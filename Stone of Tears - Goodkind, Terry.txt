stone of tears book two of the sword of truth terry goodkind for my parents natalie and leo i would like to thank my editor james frenkel for having the integrity to settle for no less than my best effort my british editor caroline oakley for her continuing support and encouragement my friends bonnie moretto and donald schassberger md for their expert advice and keith parkinson for the outstanding cover artchapter rachel clutched her doll tighter to her chest and stared at the dark thing watching her from the bushes at least she thought it was watching her it was hard to tell because the eyes were as dark as the rest of it except when the light caught them just right then they gleamed a golden color she had seen animals in the woods before rabbits and raccoons and squirrels and such but this was bigger it was as big as her maybe bigger bears were dark she wondered if it could be a bear but this wasnt exactly the woods since it was indoors she had never been in an indoor woods before she wondered if indoor woods had animals like the outdoor woods did she might have been afraid if chase wasnt there with her she knew she was safe with him chase was the bravest man she ever saw still she was a little afraid chase had told her she was the bravest little girl he knew she didnt want him to think she was afraid of some big rabbit maybe thats all it was some big rabbit sitting on a rock or something but rabbits had long ears maybe it really was a bear she put her dolls foot in her mouth she turned and looked down the path across the pretty flowers and short walls covered with vines and across the grass to where chase was talking to zedd the wizard they were standing by a stone table looking at the boxes and talking about what to do with them rachel was glad that that mean darken rahl didnt get them and that he wasnt lever going to be able to hurt anyone again rachel turned back to make sure the dark thing wasnt coming any closer to her it was gone she looked around but didnt see it anywhere sara where do you think it could have gone she whispered her doll didnt have an answer rachel bit down on saras foot and started walking toward chase her feet wanted to run but she didnt want chase to think she wasnt brave he had said she was brave and that made her feel good she looked over her shoulder as she walked checking but she didnt see the dark thing anywhere maybe it lived in a hole and it had gone there her feet still wanted to run but she didnt let them when rachel got to chase she pushed up against him and hugged his leg he and zedd were talking and she knew it was impolite to interrupt so she sucked on saras foot while she waited so what could happen if you just shut the lid chase was asking the wizard anything zedd stuck his skinny arms up in the air his wavy white hair was smoothed down but it still stuck out in places how should i know just because i know what the boxes of orden are doesnt mean i know what to do with them now that darken rahl has opened one the magic of orden killed him for opening it it could have destroyed the world it could kill me for closing it or worse chase sighed well we cant just leave them sitting around can we dont we have to do something the wizard frowned and looked at the boxes while he was thinking after more than a minute of quiet rachel tugged on chases sleeve he looked down at her chase chase i told you the rules he put his hands on his hips and twisted his face up trying to make it look mean until she giggled and hugged his leg tighter youve only been my daughter for a few weeks and already youre breaking the rules i told you before you are to call me father none of my children are allowed to call me chase understand rachel grinned and nodded yes ch father he rolled his eyes and shook his head then he mussed her hair what is it theres some big animal in the trees i think it might be a bear or worse i think you might need to take out your sword and go have a look he laughed a bear in here he laughed again this is an indoor garden rachel there arent any bears in an indoor garden maybe it was a shadow the light does odd things in here she shook her head i dont think so ch father it was watching me he smiled and mussed her hair again and put his big hand on the side of her face and hugged her head to his leg then you just stay by me and it wont bother you she sucked saras foot and nodded as he held her head to his leg she didnt feel so afraid now that his hand was on her and so looked over to the trees again the dark thing mostly hidden by one of the vinecovered walls darted closer rachel bit down harder on saras foot and let out a little whimper as she looked up at chase he was pointing at the boxes and just what is that thing that stone or jewel or whatever it is did it come out of the box zedd nodded it did but i dont want to say what i think it is until im sure at least not out loud father rachel whined its coming closer he looked down good you just keep your eye on it for me he looked back to the wizard what do you mean you dont want to say do you think it has something to do with what you said about the veil to the underworld possibly being torn zedd frowned while he rubbed his smooth chin with his skinny fingers and looked down at the black jewel sitting in front of the open box thats what im afraid of rachel looked over to the wall to watch where the dark thing was she gave a start when she saw the hands reach over the edge of the wall it was a lot closer but they werent hands they were claws long curved claws she looked up at chase at all his weapons just to be sure he had enough he had knives a lot of knives around his waist a sword strapped over the back of his shoulder a big axe hooked to his belt a few other things that looked like clubs with sharp spikes sticking out of them hanging from his belt too and a crossbow on his back she hoped it was enough all the weapons scared other men but they didnt seem to be scaring the dark thing that was coming closer and the wizard didnt even have a knife he just wore that plain tan robe and he was so skinny not big like chase but wizards had magic maybe his magic could scare the dark thing away magic rachel remembered the magic fire stick wizard giller had given her she reached into her pocket and put her ringers around it maybe chase would need her help she wouldnt let that thing hurt her new father she would be brave is it dangerous zedd looked up at chase from under his eyebrows if its what i think it is and it were to fall into the wrong hands dangerous wouldnt even begin to describe it then maybe we should drop it down a deep hole or destroy it cant we may need it what if we hide it thats what im thinking the problem is where there are things to take into consideration i need to take adie to aydindril and study the prophecies with her before i know for sure what to do with the stone and what to do about the boxes and until then until you know for sure rachel looked over to the dark thing it was closer as close as the wall came to them with its claws over the top of the wall it lifted its head up and looked right into her eyes the thing grinned at her showing long sharp teeth her breath caught in her throat its shoulders shook it was laughing rachels eyes were as big as they would go she could hear her heartbeats making a whooshing sound in her ears father she whined in a small voice he didnt look down he just shushed her the thing put its leg over the wall and dropped down in front still looking at her still laughing its shiny eyes looked at chase and zedd it hissed and then laughed as it hunched down rachel tugged chases pant leg and strained to make her voice work father its coming all right rachel zedd i still dont know with a howl the dark thing sprang into the open it ran like a streak just a blur of black rachel screamed chase spun just as it hit him claws flashed through the air chase fell to the ground as the thing leapt on zedd the wizards arms flailed about flashes of light shot from zedds fingers bouncing off the dark thing and tearing up dirt or stone where they hit the thing knocked zedd to the ground laughing in a loud howl it jumped back on chase as he was pulling his axe from his belt rachel screamed again as the claws tore at chase the thing was faster than any animal she had ever seen its claws were just a blur rachel was terrified chase was being hurt it flung the axe out of chases hand laughing that awful laugh it was hurting chase rachel had the fire stick in her hand she jumped forward and put the fire stick on its back she screamed the magic words to make the fire stick work light for me the dark thing burst into flames it made a horrible scream as it spun to her its mouth opened wide teeth snapping as flames burned all over it it laughed again but not like people laughed when they thought things were funny its laugh made her skin prickle it hunched over and started walking toward her still on fire as rachel backed up chase let out a grunt as he threw one of the clubs with the sharp spikes sticking out of it the club hit the things back and stuck in its shoulder it looked around at chase and laughed as it reached behind and pulled the club from its back it started for chase again zedd was up fire flew from his fingers covering the thing with even more flames it laughed at zedd all the fire went out smoke rose from it its body looked the same now as before it got burned in fact it had looked like it was dark from being burned even before rachel had set it on fire chase was on his feet and there was blood on him rachel got tears at seeing that chase snatched the crossbow off his back and in a blink he shot an arrow it stuck in the things chest with that terrible laugh it snapped the arrow off chase threw aside the crossbow and yanked out the sword from over his shoulder then ran for the thing jumping over it as he stabbed with the sword the thing moved so fast chase missed zedd did something that sent the thing tumbling across the grass chase put himself in front of rachel pushing her back with one hand while he held the sword out in the other the thing sprang to its feet again looking at each of them walk zedd yelled at them dont run dont stand still chase grabbed rachels wrist and started walking backward zedd started walking backward too the dark thing stopped laughing and looked at each of them blinking chase was breathing hard his chainmail shirt and the tan leather tunic under it had big rips from the claws rachel got more tears at all the blood on him blood was running down his arm onto her hand she didnt want him to be hurt she loved him something fierce she clutched sara and the fire stick tighter zedd stopped keep walking he told chase the dark thing looked at zedd standing there and a big grin with sharp teeth came to its face again it laughed that awful laugh and tore at the ground as it started in a rush toward the wizard zedd threw his hands up dirt and grass flew up in the air around the thing it was lifted into the air bolts of blue lightning struck it from all around before it hit the ground it howled in laughter as it thudded to the ground smoking something else happened rachel couldnt tell what and the thing stopped with its arms stretched out like it was trying to run but its feet were stuck it howled and twisted but couldnt move zedds arms swirled around in circles and he threw them out once more the ground shook as if from thunder and there were flashes of light hitting the thing it laughed and there was a breaking sound like wood snapping and the thing started toward zedd zedd began walking again the thing stopped and frowned then the wizard stopped and threw his arms out again a terrible ball of fire went through the air toward the thing as it ran for zedd the ball of fire made a loud scream and grew bigger as it flew toward the dark thing the fire hit so hard it made the ground shake the blue and yellow light was so bright rachel had to squint as she was walking backward the ball of fire stayed in that one place as it burned and made a loud roar smoking the dark thing stepped out of the fire its shoulders shaking as it laughed the flames went out in little sparks that flew around in the air bags the wizard said as he started walking backward rachel didnt know what bags meant but chase had told zedd not to say it in front of little ears she didnt know what that meant either the wizards wavy white hair was all messed up and sticking out in clumps rachel and chase were on the path through the trees almost to the door zedd was walking backward toward them as the dark thing watched zedd stopped and the thing started coming again walls of flame shot up in front of it the air smelled like smoke and roared with noise the thing stepped through the wall of fire zedd made another and it stepped through that too when the wizard started walking again it stopped by a short vinecovered wall watching fat vines ripped off the wall by themselves and grew suddenly longer they whipped around the dark thing as it stood there tangling all around it zedd was almost up with them where are we going chase asked him zedd turned he looked tired lets see if we can shut it in here the thing tore at the vines as they pulled it to the ground and was slicing through them with its sharp claws as the three of them went through the big doorway chase and zedd each took one of the golden metal doors and pushed it shut from the other side came a howl and then a loud crash a big dent popped out in the door knocking zedd to the ground chase put a hand on each door and put all his weight against them as the thing pounded from the other side horrible screeches came through the metal as the thing clawed at the door chase was covered with sweat and blood zedd jumped to his feet and helped chase hold the doors closed a claw stuck through the crack between the two doors and slid down then another came out from underneath through the door rachel could hear the thing laughing chase grunted as he pushed the doors creaked the wizard stood back and held out his arms with his fingers up like he was pushing against the air the creaking stopped the thing howled louder zedd grabbed chases sleeve get out of here chase backed away from the doors is that going to hold it i dont think so if it comes for you walk running or standing still attracts its attention tell anyone else you see zedd what is that thing there was another loud crash and another big dent popped out in the door the tips of claws broke through the metal and made rips in the door the noise it made hurt rachels ears go now chase snatched her up with an arm around her waist and started running down the hall chapter zedd idly fingered the stone through the coarse cloth of his robe where it was nestled in an inner pocket as he watched the claws pull back through the rips in the metal he turned and watched the boundary warden carrying rachel down the hall they hadnt gone more than a few dozen strides when one of the doors flew off its hinges with a horrific boom the strong hinges shattered as if they were made of clay zedd dove out of the way the goldclad iron door just missing him as it flew across the hall and crashed against the polished granite wall sending shards of metal flying and stone dust boiling down the hall zedd rolled to his feet and ran the screeling bounded out of the garden of life and into the hall its body was hardly more than a squat skeleton covered in a veneer of dry crisp blackened skin like a corpse that had dried in the sun for years white bone stuck out in places where the skin hanging in flaps here and there had been torn in the fight but that didnt seem to bother the creature it was a thing of the underworld and not hindered by all the frailties of life there was no blood if it could be torn up enough or hacked apart maybe it could be stopped but it was awfully quick and magic certainly wasnt doing it much harm it was a creature of subtractive magic additive magic was just being absorbed into it like a sponge maybe it could be harmed with subtractive magic but zedd had nothing of that half of the gift no wizard in the last few thousand years did some might have had the calling for the subtractive darken rahl was proof of that but none had had the gift for it no his magic wasnt going to stop this thing at least the wizard thought not directly but maybe indirectly zedd walked backward as the screeling watched with blinking bewildered eyes now he thought while its standing still concentrating zedd gathered the air making it dense dense enough to lift the heavy door he was tired it took an effort he pushed the air with a mental grunt crashing the door onto the back of the screeling dust rolled up and across the hall as the door slammed the creature to the ground it howled zedd wondered if it was howling in pain or anger the door lifted stone chips sliding off the screeling held the heavy door up with one clawed hand as it laughed a woody tendril of the vine he had tried to strangle it with still coiled around its neck bags zedd muttered nothing is ever easy zedd kept walking backward the door crashed to the floor as the screeling stepped out from underneath it and followed it was starting to learn that the people who walked were the same ones who ran or stood still this was an unfamiliar world to it zedd had to think of something before it learned any more if only he wasnt so tired chase went down a wide marble stairway zedd followed him at a quick walk if he had been sure it wasnt chase or rachel the screeling was after he would have gone a different way drawing the danger away from them but it could just as easily go after them and he didnt want to leave chase to fight it alone a man and a woman both in white robes were coming up the stairs chase tried to turn them around but they slipped past him walk zedd yelled at them dont run go back or you will be killed they frowned at him in confusion the screeling was shuffling along toward the stairs its claws clicking and scraping on the marble floor zedd could hear it panting with that nervejarring near laughter the two people saw the dark thing and froze their blue eyes going wide zedd shoved them turning them around and forced them back down the stairs they both suddenly broke into a run bounding down the stairs three at a time their blond hair and white robes flying dont run zedd and chase yelled at the same time the screeling rose up on its clawed toes attracted by the sudden movement it let out a cackling laugh and darted to the stairs zedd threw a fist of air hitting it in the chest knocking it back a pace it hardly noticed it peered over the carved stone railing at the top and saw the people running with a cackle it grasped the railing and leapt over dropping a good twenty feet to the two running whiterobed figures chase immediately put rachels face to his shoulder and reversed direction coming back up the stairs he knew what was going to happen and there was nothing he could do about it zedd waited at the top hurry while its distracted there was a very brief struggle and screams that were just as brief howling laughter echoed in the stairwell blood splattered in an arc up the white marble almost to where chase was charging up the stairs rachel hid her face against him and hugged his neck tight but didnt make a sound zedd was impressed by her he had never seen one so young use her head as well as she did she was smart smart and gutsy he understood why giller had used her to try to keep the last box of orden away from darken rahl the way of wizards zedd thought using people to do what must be done the three ran down the hall until the screeling appeared at the top of stairs then they slowed to a backward walk the screeling grinned with bloodred teeth its deathless black eyes momentarily reflecting golden in the sunlight coming in a tall narrow window it winced at the light licked the blood off its claws and then loped after them they went down the next stairway the creature followed sometimes stopping briefly in confusion seemingly unsure if it was them it was after chase held rachel in one arm and a sword in his other hand zedd stayed between them and the screeling as they backed down a small hall the screeling climbed up the walls scratching the smooth stone and sprang across tapestries tearing them with its claws as it followed the three polished walnut side tables each with three ornate legs carved in vines and dotted with gilded blossoms tipped over into the hall as the screeling pushed at them with a claw grinning and laughing at the sound of cutglass vases shattering on the stone floor water and flowers spilled over carpets the screeling hopped down and tore a priceless blue and yellow tanimuran carpet to shreds as it howled in laughter and then skittered up the wall to the ceiling it advanced along the ceiling like a spider head hanging down watching them how can it do that chase whispered zedd only shook his head as they backed into the immense central halls of the peoples palace the ceiling here was well over fifty feet high a collection of fourpointed ribbed vaults held up by a column at the corner of each vault suddenly the screeling sprang along the ceiling of the small hall it was in and leapt at them zedd released a bolt of fire as the creature flew through the air he missed the fire boiling up the granite wall leaving a trail of black soot before it dissipated for the first time chase didnt miss with a solid strike his sword lopped off one of the screelings arms for the first time the screeling howled in pain it tumbled around on the ground and darted behind a greenveined gray marble column the severed arm lay on the stone floor twitching and grasping soldiers came running across the vast hall their swords to hand the clatter of their armor and weapons reverberating off the vaulted ceilings high overhead their boot strikes echoing off the tiles around the devotion pool as they skirted it dharan soldiers were a fierce lot and they looked all the more so at finding there was an invader in the palace zedd felt an odd sort of apprehension at the sight of them a few days ago they would have dragged him off to the former master rahl to be killed now they were the loyal followers of the new master rahl zedds grandson richard as zedd saw the soldiers coming he realized the halls were filled with people the afternoon devotion had just ended even if the screeling did have only one arm this could be a bloodbath the screeling could kill a few dozen of them before they even thought to run and then it would kill more when they did they had to get all these people away the soldiers rushed up around the wizard eyes hard searching ready looking for the cause of the commotion zedd turned to the commander a heavily muscled man in leather and a polished breastplate with the ornate letter r embossed on it the symbol of the house of rahl the scars of rank were incised on upper arms covered only with coarse mail sleeves intense blue eyes glowered out from under his gleaming helmet whats going on here he demanded what is it get these people out of this hall they are all in danger the commanders face reddened behind the cheek plates of his helmet im a soldier not a bloody sheepherder zedd gritted his teeth and a soldiers first duty is to protect people if you dont get these people out of this hall commander i will see to it you become a sheepherder the commanders fist snapped to his heart in salute his voice suddenly controlled at realizing who he was arguing with by your command wizard zorander he turned his anger instead on his men get everyone back right bloody now spread rank sweep the hall the soldiers fanned out pushing a wave of startled people before them zedd hoped they could get them all clear and then maybe with the soldiers help they could bottle up the screeling and hack it to pieces but then the screeling launched itself from behind the column a black streak tearing across the floor it tumbled into a bunched knot of onlookers the soldiers were herding back toppling many over one another to the floor shrieks and wails and the screelings hideous laughter erupted from across the hall soldiers fell upon the creature and were flung back bloodied as more came to their aid in the panicked clump of people the soldiers couldnt swing a sword or axe with any effect as the screeling tore a bloody path through the bodies it had no more caution for the armed soldiers than unarmed innocents it simply ripped at anyone close enough bags zedd cursed he turned to chase stick close to me we have to draw it away he looked around over there the devotion pool they ran to the square pool of water that was situated under an opening in the roof sunlight streamed down reflecting in rippling patterns on the column at one of its corners a bell perched on the dark pitted rock that sat offcenter in the water orange fish glided through the shallow pool unconcerned with the mayhem above zedd was getting an idea the screeling certainly wasnt bothered by fire the most it did when hit with it was steam a little he ignored the sounds of pain and dying and stretched his hands out over the water gathering its warmth preparing it for what he was going to do he could see shimmering waves of heat just above the surface of the water he held the rising heat at that point just below ignition when it comes he told chase we have to get it in the water chase nodded zedd was glad the boundary warden wasnt one who always needed to have things explained to him and knew better than to waste precious seconds with questions chase set rachel on the floor stay behind me he told her she too asked no questions she nodded and hugged her doll close zedd saw she was clutching the fire stick in her other hand gutsy indeed he turned to the uproar across the hall lifted a hand and sent tickling tongues of flame into the flailing dark thing in its center the soldiers fell back the screeling straightened turning dropping a disembodied arm from its teeth as it did so steam rose where the flames had licked it it hissed a cackling laugh at the wizard standing still in the sunlight by the pool the soldiers were pushing the remaining people down the halls although the people no longer needed the encouragement zedd rolled balls of fire across the floor the screeling batted them out of the way and they sparked out zedd knew the fire wouldnt harm it he only wanted to draw its attention it worked dont forget he said to chase in the water you dont mind if its dead when it goes in do you all the better with a clatter of claws against stone the screeling charged across the hall the tips of the claws scratched into the floor sending little spurts of stone dust behind along with flakes and chips zedd hit it with compacted knots of air hammering it down keeping its attention trying to slow it down enough so they might be able to handle it it came to its feet in a rush each time charging onward chase crouched a little lower in readiness now holding a sixbladed mace in his fist instead of the sword the screeling made an impossible leap through the air at the wizard landing on him with a howl before he had a chance to turn it aside as he was thrown to the floor zedd wove webs of air to keep the thrashing claw at bay teeth snapped viciously at his throat man and beast rolled over once and when the screeling came up on top chase swung the mace at its head hitting a glancing blow it spun to him and he slammed it square in the chest knocking it off the wizard zedd could hear bones snapping with the blow the screeling seemed hardly to notice its one arm swept out yanking chases legs out from under him and then sprang on his chest as he hit the floor with a hard grunt zedd struggled to regain his wits rachel laid the fire stick on the screelings back and flames burst up zedd pushed it with air trying to knock it in the water but the screeling held on to chase tenaciously angry black eyes glared out from behind the fire lips curled back in a snarl chase brought the mace up with both hands catching the powerful creature square in the back the impact knocked the screeling into the pool hissing steam rose upon the contact of flame and water instantly zedd ignited the air above the water using the heat in the water to feed it the wizards fire sucked all warmth from the water the entire pool froze into a solid block of ice the screeling was encased the fire sputtered out when the heat feeding it was exhausted there was sudden quiet except for the moans from the injured across the hall rachel fell on chase her voice choked with tears chase chase are you all right he put an arm around her as he levered himself into a sitting position that i am little one zedd could see that that wasnt entirely true chase go sit on that bench i have to help those people and i dont want little eyes to see whats over there he knew this appeal would work better than telling chase he didnt want him walking around with his injuries until they could be seen to still zedd was a little surprised when chase nodded without protest the commander and eight of his men rushed up a few of them were bloody one had ragged claw cuts right through the metal of his breastplate they all cast an eye to the screeling frozen in the pool nice bit of work wizard zorander the commander gave a small nod and smile of respect there are a few over there who are still alive is there anything you can do for them ill have a look commander have your men use their battleaxes to hack that thing to pieces before it figures out how to melt the ice his eyes went wide you mean its still alive zedd grunted to indicate that it was so the sooner the better commander the men already had their crescent axes unhooked from their belts waiting for the order the commander gave them a nod and they charged onto the ice swinging before they slid to a stop he lowered his voice wizard zorander what is that thing zedd looked from the mans face over to chase who was listening intently he held the boundary wardens gaze its a screeling chase didnt show any reaction the boundary warden rarely did zedd turned back to the commander the big mans blue eyes were wide the screelings are loose he whispered wizard zorander you cant be serious zedd studied the mans face seeing scars he hadnt seen before scars earned in battles to the death for a dharan soldier there rarely was any other kind this was a man not used to letting fear show in his eyes even in the face of death zedd sighed he hadnt slept in days after the quads had come and tried to capture kahlan and she thought richard had been killed she had gone into the con dar the blood rage killing their attackers she chase and zedd had walked for three days and nights to reach the palace for her to extract vengeance there was no stopping a confessor in the grip of the con dar that ancient mix of magics then they had been captured and discovered richard alive that was only yesterday but it seemed forever ago darken rahl had worked all night drawing forth the magic of orden from the three boxes as they had watched helpless and only this morning was he killed by opening the wrong box killed by the wizards first rule wielded by richard proof that richard had the gift even if richard didnt believe it for only one with the gift could use the wizards first rule on a wizard of darken rahls talent zedd glanced over momentarily at the men hacking at the screeling in the ice what is your name commander the man stiffened proudly to attention commander general trimack first file of the palace guard first file what are they pride stiffened the mans jaw even more we are the ring of steel around lord rahl himself wizard zorander two thousand strong we fall to a man before harm gets a glance at lord rahl zedd nodded commander general trimack a man in your position knows that one of the responsibilities of rank is to bear the burden of knowledge in silence and solitude i do your knowledge that this creature is a screeling is one of those burdens for the time being anyway trimack let out a heavy breath i understand he looked over to the people on the floor across the hall about the injured wizard zorander zedd had respect for a soldier who held concern for wounded innocents his disregard before had been duty not callousness his instinct had been to meet the attack zedd started across the hall with trimack at his side you know darken rahl is dead yes i was in the grand courtyard earlier today i saw the new lord rahl before he flew away on the red dragon and you will serve richard as loyally as you have served in the past he is a rahl is he not he is a rahl and he has the gift he does trimack nodded to the last man before harm gets a glance at him zedd glanced over he will not be an easy man to serve under hes headstrong he is a rahl that says the same thing zedd smiled in spite of himself he is also my grandson although he doesnt know it yet as a matter of fact he doesnt even know he is a rahl or the lord rahl richard might not take well to the position he finds himself in but someday he is going to need you i would take it as a personal favor commander general trimack if you would give him a little understanding trimacks eyes surveyed the area ever ready for any new danger i would give him my life i think understanding would serve him better in the beginning he thinks of himself as nothing more than a woods guide he is a leader by nature and by birth but not by his own appraisal he will not want anything to do with it but it has come to him nonetheless at last a smile came to trimacks face done he stopped and turned to the wizard i am a dharan soldier i serve the lord rahl but the lord rahl must also serve us i am the steel against steel he must be the magic against magic without the steel he may still survive but without the magic we will not now tell me what a screeling is doing out of the underworld zedd sighed and at last nodded your former lord rahl was meddling with dangerous magic underworld magic he tore the veil between this world and the underworld bloody fool hes supposed to serve us not take us into eternal night someone should have killed him someone did richard trimack grunted then lord rahl is already serving us a few days ago some would have viewed that thought as treason it is a greater treason to deliver the living to the dead yesterday you would have killed richard to keep him from harming darken rahl and yesterday he would have killed me to get at his foe but now we serve each other only a fool walks into the future backward zedd nodded and offered a small but warm smile of respect but then his eyes narrowed as he leaned closer if the veil is not closed commander and the keeper is loosed on the world everyone will share the same fate it wont be just dhara but the whole of the world that is consumed from what i have read of the prophecies richard may be the only one who can close the veil you just remember that if harm tries to get a glance at richard trimacks eyes were ice steel against steel that he may be the magic against magic good you have it right chapter zedd surveyed the dead and dying as he approached it was impossible to avoid walking through the blood his heart ached at seeing the hurt only one screeling what if more came commander send for some healers there are more here than i can tend to already done wizard zorander zedd nodded and began checking the living soldiers of the first file were spread out among the bodies pulling the dead many of whom were their own out of the way and comforting the hurt zedd put his fingers to the sides of foreheads to feel the injuries to feel what a healer could care for and what required more he touched a young soldier laboring to breathe through a gurgle of blood zedd grunted at what he felt he glanced down and saw rib bones pulled through a fistsized hole in his breastplate zedds stomach wanted to erupt trimack knelt on the other side of the young man the wizards eyes flicked up at the commander and the other nodded his understanding the young mans remaining breaths of life numbered in the few dozen go on the commander said in a quiet voice ill stay with the lad zedd moved on as trimack gripped the young mans hand in his own and began telling a reassuring lie three women in long brown skirts sewn with rows of pockets came up in a rush their mature faces took in the scene without flinching with bandages and poultices pulled from their big pockets the three women descended on the wounded and began stitching and administering potions most wounds were within the skill of the women to heal or else beyond the skill of the wizard zedd asked one of the three the one who looked least likely to pay heed to protests to go see to chase zedd could see him sitting on the bench across the hall his chin against his chest rachel sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around his leg zedd and the other two healers moved among the people on the floor helping where they could passing on where they couldnt one of the healers called to him she was hunched over a middleaged woman who was trying to wave her away please she was saying in a weak voice help the others i am fine i need only to rest please help the others zedd felt the wetness of his bloodsoaked robes against his knees as he knelt beside her she pushed his hands away with one of hers the other held her guts from spilling out of a ripping wound in her abdomen please there are others who should be helped zedd lifted an eyebrow to her ashen face a fine gold chain through her hair held a blue stone against her forehead the blue stone matched her eyes so that it almost made her look to have three eyes the wizard thought he recognized the stone and wondered if it could be true or only a bauble bought on a whim he had not seen one wearing the stone as a calling in a very long time surely one this young couldnt know what it proclaimed i am wizard zeddicus zul zorander and who are you child to give me orders her face paled even more forgive me wizard she calmed as zedd touched his fingers to her forehead the pain caught his breath so sharply that he jerked his fingers away he had to struggle to keep the tears of hurt from showing he knew without a doubt now she wore the stone in calling the stone to match the color of her eyes and worn over the forehead as if the minds eye was a talisman to proclaim her inner vision a hand snatched at the back of his robes tugging wizard came a sour voice from behind you will tend to me first zedd turned to a face that matched the voice and maybe outdid it a little i am lady ordith condatith de dackidvich house of burgalass this wench is nothing but my body servant had she been as quick as she should have been i wouldnt be suffering so i could have been killed as slow as she was you will tend to me first i could expire at any moment zedd could tell without touching her that her injuries were minor forgive me my lady he made a show of putting his fingers to her head as he thought a hard bruise to her ribs a few lesser to her legs and a small gash on her arm requiring at most a stitch or two well she clutched at the silver ruffles at her neck wizards she muttered next to worthless if you want to know the truth of it and these guards i think they were asleep at their posts lord rahl shall hear of this well what of my injuries my lady im not sure there is anything i can do for you what she snatched the neck of his robe and gave it a snug yank you had better see that there is or i will see that lord rahl has your head on a pike see what good your lazy magic does you then of course my lady i will endeavor to do my best he ripped the small gash in the dark maroon satin fabric of the sleeve making it a huge hanging flag then put a hand back on the shoulder of the woman with the blue stone she moaned as he blocked some of her pain and gave her strength her ragged breathing evened he kept his hand on her trickling in a little magic of reassurance and comfort lady ordith shrieked my dress youve ruined it sorry my lady but we cant risk the wound festering i would rather lose the dress than the arm wouldnt you agree well yes i guess ten or fifteen stitches should do it he said to the sturdily built healer bent over between the two women on the floor her hard bluegray eyes glanced to the small wound and then back to the wizard i am sure you would know best wizard zorander she said in an even voice betraying only in her gaze to him that she understood his true intent what you are going to let this ox of a midwife do your work for you my lady im an old man ive never had any talent for sewing and my hands shake something awful im afraid i would do more damage than i would repair but if you insist i will try my best no she sniffed let the ox do it very well he looked up to the healer no emotion touched her features but splotches of red colored her cheeks i fear there is only one hope for her other injuries considering the pain she is in do you have any wattle root in those big pockets of yours she gave a little frown of puzzlement yes but good he cut her off i think two cubes should be sufficient her eyebrow lifted two dont you try to be skimpy with me lady ordith screeched if there isnt enough to go around then someone of lesser importance will just have to go short you give me the full dose very well zedd glanced up at the healer administer her the full dose three cubes shredded not whole the healers eyes opened a little wider and she incredulously mouthed shredded zedd squinted and nodded his insistence the corners of her mouth curled up in a tightly controlled smile wattle root would take away the pain of the minor injuries but it needed only be swallowed whole one small cube was all that was needed shredded and that much of it would set lady ordiths plumbing afire the good lady was going to be spending the better part of the next week in her privy what is your name my dear he asked the healer kelley hallick zedd let out a tired sigh kelley are there any others that are beyond your considerable talents no sir middea and annalee are finishing with the last of them then will you please take lady ordith somewhere where she will not where she will be more comfortable while you tend to her kelley glanced down at the woman zedd had a comforting hand to to the rip across her abdomen and back up to his eyes of course wizard zorander you look to be very tired if you would come to me later i will fix you a stenadine tea the small smile touched the corners of her mouth again zedd couldnt keep a grin from his own face besides restoring alertness stenadine tea was also used to give lovers stamina by the glint in her eye he judged her to be a fine brewer of stenadine tea he gave kelley a wink perhaps i will any other time he might have given it serious consideration kelley was a handsome woman but right now that was just about the farthest thing from his mind lady ordith what is your body servants name jebra bevinvier and a worthless girl she is too lazy and impudent well you will not be burdened with her inadequate service any longer she is going to need a long time to recover and you are shortly going to be leaving the palace leaving what do you mean leaving she put her nose in the air i have no intention of leaving the palace is no longer safe for a lady of your importance you will have to leave for your own protection as you said yourself the guards are asleep half the time you will have to be on your way well i simply have no intention of kelley he gave her a firm look please help lady ordith to a place where you can tend to her kelley was dragging the lady ordith off like a load of wash before she had a chance to cause any more trouble zedd turned a warm smile to jebra and brushed some of her short sandy hair back off her face she held one arm across her grievous wound zedd had managed to halt most of the bleeding but that wasnt going to save her what was outside had to be put back in its place inside thank you sir im feeling much better now if you could help me to my feet i will be out of your way lie still child he said softly we must talk with a hard glance he moved onlookers back soldiers of the first file had only to see that one brief look and they were already pushing people away her lip trembled as her breast rose and fell more rapidly she managed a little nod im going to die arent i i wont lie to you child your wound is at the limit of my talents were i well rested you dont have the time for me to rest if i dont do something you will die if i try i might hasten the end how long if i do nothing maybe hours maybe the night i could ease the pain enough to at least make the last of it tolerable she closed her eyes as tears seeped from the corners i never thought i cared to live because of the seers stone you wear her eyes snapped open you know you recognize the stone you know what i am i do the time is long past when people knew a seer by the stone but i am old i have seen such before that is why you didnt want me to help you you fear what the touch might do to me she nodded weakly but i find i suddenly care to live zedd patted her shoulder that is what i wanted to know child worry not about me i am a wizard of the first order not some novice first order she whispered wideeyed i did not know one was left please sir do not risk yourself on the likes of me zedd smiled not much of a risk only a little pain and my name is zedd she thought a moment then her free hand clutched his arm zedd if i am to have a choice i choose to try for life zedd smiled a little and stroked her cold sweaty forehead then i promise to give you my most earnest effort she nodded as she gripped his arm gripped her only chance is there anything you can do jebra to hold aside the pain of the visions she bit her lower lip and shook her head as tears sprang anew im sorry she whispered barely audible perhaps you shouldnt hush child he comforted zedd took a deep breath and laid a hand over the arm that held her guts back he put the palm of his other hand gently over her eyes this was not something he could fix from the outside tt had to be repaired from within with her own minds aid it could kill her and him he braced himself and released the barrier in his mind the impact of pain took the wind from his lungs he didnt dare to spare the energy to draw a breath he gritted his teeth and fought it with muscles hardened to stone with the strain and he hadnt even touched the pain of the wound yet he had to deal with the pain of her visions get past them before he could cope with that problem agony sucked his mind into a river of blackness specters of her visions swirled past he could only guess at their meaning but the pain of their reality was all too vivid tears flooded from his tightly closed eyes his whole body shook as he struggled to fight through the torrent of anguish he knew he couldnt allow himself to be pulled along with it or he would be lost consumed the emotions of her visions buffeted him as he was swept deeper into her mind dark thoughts just beyond the surface of perception clawed at his will trying to drag him into the depths of hopeless abandon his own painful memories washed to the surface of his consciousness to join with jebras lifetime of sorrow in a convergence of terrible agony and madness only his experience and resolve kept his sanity his free will from being pulled into the bottomless waters of bitterness and grief at last he broke through to the calm white light at the center of her being zedd reveled in the comparatively mild pain of her lifethreatening wound reality could seldom match the imagination and in the imagination the pain was real all around the calm center the cold darkness of eternal night encroached on the waning warmth and light of her life impatient to shroud forever jebras spirit zedd pulled back that shroud to let the light of his gift warm her spirit with life and vitality the shadows receded before the power of his additive magic the strength of that magic its exigency for the wellbeing of life drew the exposed organs back to where the creator intended them zedd didnt yet dare to spare anything to block her suffering jebras back arched she wailed in pain he too felt her pain his own abdomen flamed with the same agony she felt he shook with the searing sharpness of it when the hardest that which was beyond his comprehension was finished he at last spared a portion of the magic to block her pain jebra sagged against the floor with a moan of relief he felt the relief in his own body directing the flow of magic zedd finished the healing he used his power to pull her wound together letting tissue knit to tissue flesh to flesh layer upon layer up to the surface of skin joining as if it had never been parted finished at last zedd had only to escape her mind that was as dangerous as entering and his strength was nearly gone he had given it over to her rather than wasting any more time worrying about it he released himself into the flow of agony nearly an hour after he had begun he found himself on his knees hunched over weeping uncontrollably jebra was sitting up with her arms around him holding his head to her shoulder as soon as he was aware that he was back he managed to bring himself under control and straighten he glanced around the hall everyone had been pushed back a goodly distance beyond earshot none had any interest in being near a wizard when he was wielding magic that left people screaming as jebra had done there he said at last with a modicum of restored dignity that wasnt so bad i believe all is well now jebra laughed a quiet shaky laugh and hugged him tight i was taught a wizard couldnt heal a seer zedd managed to get a bony finger in the air no ordinary wizard can my dear but i am zeddicus zul zorander wizard of the first order jebra wiped a tear from her cheek i have nothing of value to repay you with except this she unhooked the gold chain that ran through her hair and brought it down putting it in his hand please accept this humble offering zedd looked down at the chain with the blue stone that is very kind of you jebra bevinvier im touched zedd felt a pang of guilt for having planted the impulse in her mind its a fine chain and i will accept it in humble gratitude he used a threadthin stream of power to separate the stone from its mounting he handed the stone back he only needed the chain but the chain is payment enough keep your stone its yours by right she closed her fingers around the stone with a nod and gave him a kiss on the cheek he accepted the peck with a smile and now my dear you will need to rest i have used a good deal of your strength to put things right maybe a few days of bed rest and you will be as good as new i fear that you have not only left me healed but also without employment i must find work to feed myself she looked down at the bloody shredded rip in her green dress and to clothe myself why were you wearing the stone if you were the servant of the lady ordith not many know what the stone signifies lady ordith didnt her husband the duke did he wanted my services but his wife would never have allowed a woman in his employ so he had me placed as her servant i know it is not the most honorable thing for a seer to place herself covertly but there is much starvation in burgalass my family knew of my ability and closed their doors to me afraid of the visions i might have of them before my grandmother passed on she put her stone in my hand saying if i wore hers she would be honored jebra pressed the fist with the stone to her cheek thank you she whispered for not accepting it for understanding zedd felt a renewed pang of guilt and so this duke had you taken in and used you for his own purposes yes maybe a dozen years ago because i was lady ordiths body servant i was almost always present at any meeting or function the duke would come to me later and i would tell him what i saw of his adversaries with my help he made more of his power and wealth virtually no one anymore knows of the stone of a seer he disdained people who ignored the old knowledge he mocked his opponents ignorance by having me wear the stone openly he also had me keep an eye to the lady ordith it prevented her from succeeding at making herself a widow so she now contents herself with being absent from the dukes house whenever she can she will not be displeased to be rid of me the duke used his strings of power to keep me employed when the lady ordith would have wished it otherwise why would she be displeased with your service he grinned are you lazy and rude as she claims jebra smiled back the fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes deepening no its the visions sometimes when i have them well you felt some of the hurt when you healed me though it is not as bad as that for me i think but sometimes the hurt keeps me from her service for a time zedd rubbed his chin well since you are out of employment you will be a guest here at the peoples palace until you are recovered i have some little influence around here he marveled at the sudden truth of that and pulled a purse from a pocket in his robes he gave it a jingle for your expenses and wage if i could convince you to take up a new employer she hefted the purse in her palm testing its weight if this be copper it is insufficient for any but you she smiled and leaned a little closer her eyes merry and scolding at the same time and if it be silver it is too much zedd gave her a grave expression its gold startled she blinked but it is not me mainly you will be working for she stared at the purse of gold in her hand then looked back at him who then richard the new lord rahl jebra paled and shook her head vigorously her shoulders hunching up she shoved the purse back in zedds hands no even paler she shook her head again no im sorry i dont want to work for him no zedd frowned he is not an evil person hes quite kindhearted in fact i know that you know who he is she looked down at her lap and nodded i know i saw him yesterday the first day of winter and you had a vision when you saw him her voice was weak and filled with fear yes jebra tell me what you saw every bit of it please its important she looked up at him from under her eyebrows for a long moment then back down at her lap as she chewed her lower lip it was at the morning devotion yesterday when the bell rang i went to a square and he was standing there looking into the pool i noticed him because he was wearing the sword of the seeker and because he was tall and handsome and he wasnt kneeling as the others were he stood there watching the people gathering and as i approached his eyes passed across my sight just for an instant the power coming from him took my breath away a seer can sense certain kinds of power like the gift emanating from a person she looked up at zedd i have seen those with the gift before i have seen their auras they have all been like yours there is a warmth to them a gentleness your aura is beautiful his was different it had that but more too violence zedd said in a soft voice he is the seeker she nodded it could be i dont know ive never seen the like of it before but i can tell you what it felt like it felt like having my face pushed into a basin of icy water before i had a chance to get a breath sometimes i never get a vision from a person sometimes i do i can never tell when its going to come sometimes when a person is in distress they throw off auras and visions more strongly he was throwing off auras like lightning in a thunderstorm he was in great emotional pain like an animal in a trap trying to chew its own leg off he felt the horror of having to betray his friends to save them i didnt understand that it didnt make any sense there was an image of a woman a beautiful woman with long hair maybe a confessor although i dont know how that could be the aura flamed so strongly with anguish for her that i felt my face fearing i would find the skin burned if i hadnt been at devotion i would have fallen to my knees anyway from the agony of the auras i almost rushed to him to comfort him when two mordsith approached and noticed him standing and not kneeling he felt no fear but he went to his knees anyway out of resignation to the terrible betrayal he had been forced into i was relieved when he knelt i thought that would be the end of it i was thankful i had seen only auras for the most part and not true visions i didnt want to see any visions from that man she stared off seemingly lost in the memory of it but that wasnt the end of it her eyes came back to where she was no i thought the worst of it was over but what i had seen didnt touch what was to come jebra drywashed her hands for a moment we were saying the chant to father rahl and all of a sudden he sprang up he had a smile on his face he had solved the puzzle that trapped him the last piece had snapped into place the womans face and his love for her filled the aura she shook her head i pity the person who ever puts a finger between those two they will lose the finger maybe the hand and maybe the whole arm before they have the time to think to pull it back her name is kahlan zedd said with a little smile and then what happened jebra crossed her arms across her abdomen then the visions started i saw him killing a man but i couldnt tell how not with blood but killing him just the same and then i saw the man he was going to kill darken rahl and then i saw that it was his father but he didnt know it that was when i knew who he was the son of darken rahl the soon to be new master rahl the aura was flashing in terrible conflicts commoner to king zedd put a comforting hand to her shoulder darken rahl wanted to rule the world with a frightful magic by stopping him richard saved a great many from torture or death even though killing is terrible by doing so he has saved the lives of many more surely you would not be frightened of richard because of that she shook her head no it was by what came next the two mordsith stood because he was going to leave a devotion one raised her agiel threatening him i was surprised to see he wore one at his neck red just like theirs he held it out in his fist he told them that if they didnt let him pass he would kill them the aura of violence around him took my breath away he wanted them to try they sensed it and let him pass as he turned to leave that was when i saw the other visions she put a hand to her heart as tears ran down her cheeks zedd my visions are not always clear sometimes i dont know what they mean once i saw a farmers vision birds were pecking at the stomachs of him and his family i didnt know what it meant it turned out that a flock of blackbirds came and ate the seed he had just planted he was able to replant and guard the field but he and his family could have starved if he hadnt she wiped her fingers at the tears on her cheeks sometimes i cant tell what the visions mean or if they will turn out to be true not all of that kind do she fussed with her hair but sometimes they come to pass exactly as i see them i can tell when they are true and will happen without a doubt zedd patted her shoulder i understand jebra visions are a form of prophecy and i know how confusing prophecy can be what kind of vision did you see from richard the confusing kind or the ones that are clear she shared a deep gaze with his eyes i saw every kind i saw every kind of vision i have ever had from the confusing to clear from the possible to the certain they came in a rush they have never done that before mostly i only have a single vision and i either know what it means and that it is true or i dont understand it and cant tell if it will come to pass the visions from this man came in a torrent they rushed past like winddriven rain but every one was pain and hurt and danger the ones that stood out the hardest and i knew to be true were the worst one was of something around his neck i couldnt tell what but it was something that will cause him great pain and take him from the woman kahlan you said her name was take him from everyone he loves lock him away richard was captured by a mordsith and tortured by her perhaps that is what you saw zedd offered jebra shook her head vehemently it wasnt what was it was what will be and not the pain of a mordsith different i am sure of it zedd nodded in thought what else i saw him in an hourglass he was on his knees in the bottom half crying in anguish the sand falling all around him but not a grain touching him the gravestones of all those he loved were in the top half where he couldnt reach them against the fall of the sand i saw a knife at his heart a killing knife held in his own shaking hands before i could see what would happen another vision came they are not always in order of events he was in his fine red coat the one with gold buttons and brocade trim he was facedown a knife in his back he was dead but at the same time he wasnt his own hands reached down to roll him over but before i saw his dead face another vision came it was the worst the strongest the tears welled up again and she began to sob softly zedd squeezed her shoulder to encourage her to go on i saw his flesh burning she wiped at the tears and rocked back and forth a little as she cried he was screaming i could even smell the burning skin then whatever was burning him i couldnt tell what it was when it pulled back he was unconscious and there was a mark upon him a mark burned into him zedd worked his tongue in his mouth trying to wet it could you see what the mark was no not what it looked like but i knew what it was as surely as i know the sun when i see it it was the mark of the dead a mark of the keeper of the underworld the keeper had marked him to be his own zedd worked to steady his breathing his trembling hands were there more visions yes but not as strong and i didnt understand them they rushed by so fast i couldnt grasp their form only their pain then he was gone while the mordsith were turned watching him go i ran back to my room and locked myself in i lay on the bed for hours crying uncontrollably with the hurt of what i had seen the lady ordith banged at my door wanting me but i called to her that i was sick and she finally went away in a huff i cried until my insides were jelly i saw virtue in that man and i wept in fear of the evil i saw snatching for him though the visions were all different they were the same they all had the same feel danger danger presses in around that man as tightly as water presses around a fish she regained some of her composure as zedd sat silently watching her that is why i will not work for him the good spirits protect me i dont want anything to do with the danger around that man with the underworld maybe you could help him with your talent help him to avoid the danger that is what i was hoping anyway zedd said in a quiet voice jebra dabbed her cheeks dry with the back of her sleeve not for all the dukes gold and power would i want to be in lord rahls wake i am no coward but i am no heroine in a song and no fool either i did not wish my guts put back to have them ripped out again and this time my soul with them zedd quietly watched her sniffling herself back under control putting the frightening visions away she took a deep breath and sighed her blue eyes finally looked to his richard is my grandson he said simply her eyes winced shut oh good spirits forgive me her hand covered her mouth for a long moment then her eyes came open her eyebrows wrinkled together in horror zedd im so sorry for telling you what i saw forgive me had i known i never would have told you her hands trembled forgive me oh please forgive me the truth is the truth i am not one who would shut a door in your face for seeing it jebra i am a wizard i already know of the danger he is in that is why i asked you to help the veil to the underworld is torn that thing that ripped you open escaped into the world of the living through the tear if the veil tears enough the keeper will escape richard has done things that the prophecies say mark him as maybe the only one able to close the tear he lifted the purse of gold and slowly settled it in her lap her eyes following it down he withdrew his empty hand her gaze stayed on the purse as if it were a beast that might bite would it be very dangerous she asked at last in a weak voice zedd smiled when her eyes came up no more dangerous than going for an afternoon stroll in a fortress palace with a reflex jerk her hand clutched her abdomen where the wound had been her eyes rose to look off down the wide resplendent halls as if seeking escape or maybe fearing an attack without looking to him she spoke my grandmother was a seer and my only guide she told me once that the visions would bring me a lifetime of hurt and there was nothing i would ever be able to do to stop them she said that if ever i was presented with the opportunity to use the visions for good to take the chance and it would make up for some of the burden that was the day she put her stone in my hand jebra lifted the purse and set it back in zedds lap i will not do it for all the gold in dhara but i will do it for you zedd smiled and patted her cheek thank you child he put the gold back in her lap the coins making a muffled clink you will be needing this you will have expenses what is left is yours that is the way i wish it she nodded resignedly what must i do well first we must both get a good nights sleep you will need to rest for a few days to regain your strength and then you have some traveling to do lady bevinvier he smiled at the way one of her eyebrows lifted we are both very tired right now tomorrow after i have rested i must be off on important business before i leave i will come to you and we will talk more of this but starting right now i would ask you not to wear the stone where it can be seen no good can come of declaring your talent to eyes in the shadows so my new employer shall use me covertly too not the most honorable of things the ones who would recognize you now are not vying for gold they serve the keeper they want much more than gold if they discover you you will wish i had not saved you today she winced before finally nodding chapter zedd stood with the aid of a hand to his knee he helped jebra up as he expected she was unable to stand without leaning heavily on him she apologized for the burden he made her smile by telling her he would use any excuse to have his arm around the waist of a pretty maiden people were starting to go back to their business engaged in hushed conversation as their eyes darted about the suddenly not so safe palace those hurt had been helped away and the dead carried off maidservants in heavy skirts worked tearfully at the task of cleaning up the blood sloshing mops in buckets of reddening water soldiers of the first file were spread out everywhere zedd motioned to commander trimack across the hall anyway i shall be glad to be away from this place jebra said i have seen auras here that make me sweat in my sleep as the officer started toward them zedd asked do you see anything of this man coming toward us she studied him a moment as he strode toward them checking the placement of his men a faint aura duty she frowned as she stared it has always been a burden for him he is daring to hope that maybe he will now find pride in it does that help you any zedd smiled a little yes it does any visions no just the faint aura the wizard nodded in thought then brightened by the way why has a woman as lovely as you not found herself a husband she gave him a sidelong glance three have asked as each was on bended knee before me i saw a vision of them lying with another woman zedd grinned did they ask why you said no i didnt say no i only slapped them so hard it made their heads ring like a bell zedd laughed until she was caught up in it trimack came at last to a halt before them commander general trimack may i introduce the lady bevinvier trimack gave a smart bow as are you as am i this lady is one who is at the task of keeping harm from getting a glance at lord rahl i would like her to have a heavy guard at all times while she is in the palace lord rahl needs her help and i dont want her life risked again as it was today while she is in the palace she will be as safe as a babe in her mothers arms by my honor he turned and gave a coded tap to his shoulder a good two dozen men of the first file came at a dead run freezing to a halt at attention not even breathing hard this is the lady bevinvier every one of your lives before hers with a sharp snap every fist came to an armored heart as one two of them took jebras weight from zedd she kept one hand tightly closed around the stone the purse of gold bulged in a pocket of her long green skirt it was covered most of the way down with dried blood zedd addressed the men holding her up she will need suitable quarters and meals brought in please see to it she is not disturbed by anyone but me he looked at her tired blue eyes and gently touched her arm rest well child i will visit you in the morning she smiled weakly thank you zedd as the soldiers helped her away the wizard turned his attention to trimack there is a woman staying in the palace a lady ordith condatith de dackidvich lord rahl is going to have enough trouble without her kind around i want her out of here before the day is finished if she refuses to leave offer her the choice of a carriage or a noose trimack grinned wickedly i will see to it personally if there are any others you know of about the palace who are of her temperament feel free to make them the same offer new rule brings change zedd couldnt see auras but he was sure that if jebra had been standing there she would have seen trimacks brighten some are uncomfortable with change wizard zorander the man had spoken more than his simple words are there any above you in command in the palace other than lord rahl trimack clasped his hands behind his back as his eyes swept the hall there is one named demmin nass commander of the quads who gave orders to all but darken rahl zedd let out a heavy breath at that memory he is dead trimack nodded with what might have been relief below the palace quartered in the chambers of the plateau there are perhaps thirty thousand men of the army their generals outrank me in the field but in the palace the word of the commander general of the first file is law some of them i know will welcome the change some will not richard is going to have a difficult enough time being the magic against magic underworld magic without troubles from steel you have a free hand commander to do as you see fit to protect him err on the side of duty trimack grunted acknowledgment then went on the peoples palace one roof though it may be is a city thousands live here merchants and supplies trains of wagons to lone peddlers come and go in an endless stream in all directions except to the east across the azrith plains the roads in are the arteries that feed the heart of dhara the peoples palace the inside of the plateau is chambered with twice the number of rooms of the palace above ground as with any city of this size the motives of the multitudes coming here are beyond our ability to judge with absolute certainty i will have the great inner doors closed and seal off the palace above ground it is something that has not been done in a few hundred years and it will cause worry among the people of dhara but i would risk the worried talk the only way to the palace itself if not through the inside entrances is up the cliff road on the east side i will keep the bridge up that still leaves us with thousands in the palace proper any of them could have designs not to our liking worse there are thousands of battletested soldiers in the belly of the palace many led by men i would not want getting a glance at lord rahl i have a feeling the new lord rahl is not the kind of rahl they are used to dealing with and they are not going to like the change dhara is a vast empire the supply routes long perhaps it is time some of these divisions were sent out to see to the safety of these routes especially the ones to the far south near the wilds where i have heard rumor there is unrest and trouble and perhaps from the ranks of the ones i trust the size of the first file could be increased threefold zedd studied trimacks face as the man continued to scan the hall i am no soldier but your ideas make sense the palace must be made as secure as possible how you do it is up to you i will give you a list then in the morning of the generals to be trusted and those to worry about why would i need such a list trimacks intense gaze was steady because orders such as these must come from one with the gift zedd shook his head muttering wizards should not be ruling people its not right it is the way in dhara magic and steel i want to protect lord rahl this is what i think needs to be done zedd stared off into the distance feeling the ache of exhaustion in his bones do you know trimack that i have fought and killed wizards who wanted to take it upon themselves to rule when an answer didnt come zedd turned back to the officer trimack was studying him given the choice wizard zorander i would choose to serve one who bears command as a burden to one who wears the mantle as a right zedd sighed and nodded in the morning then there is one other matter the most important of all i want the garden of life guarded that is where the screeling first attacked i dont know if there will be more there is a door up there that will have to be fixed put a ring of steel around the garden enough men that they have room only to swing an axe no one no one at all is to be allowed to go in except myself or richard or by our order anyone attempting to go into that room is to be viewed as harm trying to get a look at lord rahl even one who tells you he is there only to pull weeds and you can bet your mothers honor that anything trying to get out is harm trying to have more than a look trimack clapped his fist to his armored chest to the last man wizard zorander good lord rahl may need whats in that room i dont dare to move those things for the time being they are extremely dangerous take very seriously the guarding of that room commander more screelings could come or worse how soon i would not have thought we would have seen the first for a year or more at least months that the keeper could have loosed one of his assassins so soon is a great worry i dont know who it was sent for its possible it was simply sent to kill whoever was around the keeper needs no reason to kill i must leave the palace tomorrow to learn what i can before we are surprised again trimack pondered this with troubled eyes do you know when lord rahl will return zedd shook his head no i thought i was going to have time to teach him some of what he must know but now i must send for him at once to meet me in aydindril and see if we can discover what must be done he is in great danger and knows nothing of it events have outpaced me i have no idea what the keeper is going to do next but i now fear how deep his tendrils may be that they were around darken rahl even before the veil was torn means i have already been an ignorant fool in this business if richard should happen to return unexpectedly or if anything happens to me help him he sees himself as a woods guide not the lord rahl he will be distrustful tell him i said to trust you if he is distrustful how shall i convince him to trust me zedd smiled tell him i said it is the truth the toasted toads truth trimacks eyes widened with incredulity you wish the commander general of the first file to say such a childish thing to the lord rahl zedd straightened his face and cleared his throat its a code commander he will understand it trimack nodded but looked skeptical i had better see to the garden of life and the rest of it no disrespect intended but you look like you could use some rest he tilted his head toward where the army of maidservants were still cleaning blood off the marble floor all the healing you did looks to have tired you it did thank you commander trimack i will take your advice trimacks fist snapped to his heart the salute softened by the hint of a smile he began to turn but hesitated his intense blue eyes looked back to the wizard may i say wizard zorander that its a pleasure to at last have one with the gift in the palace who is more concerned with putting peoples guts back inside than with spilling them out ive never seen the like of it zedd didnt smile his voice was quiet i am sorry commander that i could do nothing for that lad trimack gave a sorrowful nod i know that to be the truth wizard zorander the toasted toads truth zedd watched the commander stride across the hall drawing armored men to him like a huge magnet the wizard brought his hand up staring at the gold chain looped over his sticklike fingers he gave a pained sigh wizard business using people and now for the worst of it he brought the black tearshaped stone from a pocket deep in his robes the spirits be cursed he thought for the things a wizard must do he held the mounting where the blue stone had been and pressed the point of the smooth black stone to it elemental power flowed from the fingers of each hand joining in the middle welding the stone to the mount hoping he was wrong zedd brought forth a painful memory of his longdead wife with the way jebras mind had shredded his barriers it wasnt difficult when a tear ran over his cheek he wet his thumb in it and shut the memory away with the greatest of effort he smiled a little at the irony that wizards had to use even themselves and that the horrible memory at least brought with it one with a little pleasure to balance it holding the black stone in the palm of one hand he buffed its surface with the teardampened thumb the stone turned a clear amber as he rubbed it with his thumb his heart sank a little there was no doubt now as to what it was resigned to what must be done zedd wove a wizards web around the stone the spell would work to hide the true nature of the stone from everyone except richard more important the web would draw richards attention to the stone if he ever saw it the attraction would be planted firmly in his mind he glanced over at chase who was stretched out on his back on a marble bench across the hall one foot was planted on the floor and rachel was sitting on the ground an arm wrapped around his calf her head against his knee his other foot was on the bench a bandaged forearm rested across his forehead zedd sighed and started across the polished marble floor he wondered for a moment what the boundary warden was supposed to guard now that the boundary was gone he stopped standing over the two without removing his forearm from his eyes chase spoke zedd my old friend if you ever again have some ruthless strongarmed witch of a healer pour a concoction that tastes that spiritsbecursed foul down my gullet ill twist your head around so you have to walk backward to see where youre going zedd grinned now he knew he had picked the right woman for the job did the medicine taste really awful chase rachel asked he lifted his arm a little letting it hover over his eyes as he looked down at her if you call me chase again you may find out yes father she grinned im sorry she made you drink that awful medicine her face turned to a pout but it scares me something fierce to see blood on you he grunted she peered at him maybe the next time if you take your sword out when i tell you to you wouldnt get blood on you and have to drink awful medicine zedd marveled at the childlike innocence of the perfectly delivered stinging rebuke chase held his head up a little off the bench with his arm frozen in the air several inches above his eyes as he glowered at the little girl zedd had never seen a man struggle so mightily to keep from laughing rachels nose wrinkled up and she giggled at the strained face he was making may the good spirits be mercifully kind to your future husband chase said and at least grant him a few years peace until you lay your eyes on the poor doomed fool she frowned what does that mean chase swung his leg down and sat up he scooped her up and plopped her down on his knee ill tell you what it means it means that theres a new rule and this one you better not break no father i wont what is it from now on he said with a scowl his face close to hers if you need to tell me something important and i dont listen to you you are to kick me hard as you can and you just go on kicking me until i listen got it she smiled yes father im not joking i mean it she nodded earnestly i promise chase the big man rolled his eyes and swept her to his chest with one arm holding her to him the way she held her doll to herself zedd swallowed back the lump in his throat at that moment he didnt like himself very much and he liked the alternatives a lot less the wizard fell to one knee before her the dried blood made his robes stiff at his knees rachel i must ask you to do something for me she nodded what is it zedd he brought his arm up the gold chain hanging from his fingers the stone swung back and forth under his hand this belongs to someone else would you wear it for now keep it safe someday richard may come and get it from you to take it where it belongs but i dont know when that will be chases fierce hawkish eyes looked like what zedd imagined a mouse must see an instant before the end its very pretty zedd i never wore such a pretty thing its also very important as important as the box that wizard giller gave you to look after but darken rahl is dead you said so he cant hurt us anymore i know child but this is still important you did such a good and brave job with the box that i think you would be the best one to wear this necklace until the one it belongs to comes for it you must wear it always until then dont let anyone else even try it on for play this is not something to play with her expression turned serious at the mention of the box ill take good care of it zedd if you say its important zedd chase hissed as he pulled rachels head to himself cupping his hand over her ear so she couldnt hear what do you think youre doing is that what i think it is zedd gave him a forbidding look im trying to keep all the children of the world from having very bad nightmares for eternity chase gritted his teeth zedd i dont want zedd cut him off chase how long have you known me chase glared but didnt answer in all the time youve known me have you ever known me to bring harm to another especially a child have you ever known me to put another at risk for anything foolish no chase said in a voice like grating stone and i dont want to see you start now zedd kept his own voice firm you will have to trust that i know what im doing his eyes flicked to where the screeling had killed the people what has happened today doesnt even begin to touch what is about to happen if the veil isnt closed the suffering and death will be beyond your comprehension im doing what i must as a wizard as a wizard i recognize this little one just as giller recognized her she is a ripple in the pond she is destined to do important things when we were in the tomb of panis rahl earlier checking to see that they were walling it in properly i studied some of the runes on the walls they werent all melted yet they were in high dharan and i dont understand much of it but i understood enough they were instructions on going to the underworld you know that stone table in the garden of life its a sacrificial altar darken rahl used it to go to the underworld to travel under the boundaries but hes dead what does he killed children and offered their unsoiled souls as a gift to the keeper of the underworld to gain himself passage do you understand what im saying he made pacts with the keeper that means the keeper has been using people in this world where he has used one he has surely used more and now the veil is torn that a screeling was here proves it beyond question many of the oldest prophecies i believe are about whats beginning to happen now and about richard whoever wrote them was intending to send him help across time i believe they are meant to aid him in the fight against the keeper but much has happened in the last few thousand years to muddy those words i fear that it is the keepers patient work that has obfuscated the meaning of the prophecies he has no more important skill than patience he has an eternity of it he has probably been sending careful tendrils into this world to influence people wizards like darken rahl to do his bidding the fact that we need the prophecies so much right now and that there are no wizards left who understand them cant be coincidence i have no idea where the keepers eyes lurk or what he intends next chases eyes still had fire in them but it was different from the kind they held before tell me how to help what would you like me to do zedd smiled sadly and patted the big mans shoulder i would like you to teach this child to be like you i know she is smart bring it out in her make her your student teach her how to use every weapon you know teach her to be strong and quick chase sighed and gave a nod such a little warrior in the morning i must leave to get adie and take her to aydindril i would like you to go to the mud people ride hard fast as you can go richard and kahlan and siddin will be with the dragon tonight and tomorrow she will take them there it will take you weeks to reach him we cant afford to waste any time tell richard and kahlan to come to me in aydindril at once tell them of the danger as i have told you then maybe you should take this child to safety if there is any such thing isnt there anything else i can do the most important thing is to get to richard ive been a fool for thinking we would have time i never should have let him out of my sight zedd rubbed his chin a moment in thought maybe you could tell him i am his grandfather and that darken rahl was his father maybe that will give his anger time to cool before he reaches me zedd lifted an eyebrow and smiled do you know what the mud people call him they call him richard with the temper imagine that richard of all people he is one of the gentlest people ive ever known but i fear the sword of truth has brought out his other side chase flashed a rare reassuring look he wont be angry to learn you are his grandfather he loves you zedd sighed maybe so but i dont think he will be pleased to know who his father really is and that i hid that knowledge from him george cypher raised him and they loved each other deeply thats the truth and this doesnt change it zedd nodded he held the necklace up will you trust me chase appraised the wizard for a moment then sat rachel up straight on his knee let me latch the clasp for you after chase hooked it around her neck rachel picked up the amber stone in her small hands bending her face down to see it ill take good care of it for you zedd the wizard ruffled her hair im sure you will he put a finger to each side of her forehead letting the magic flow into her and gave her the thought of how important the necklace was that she was not to talk to people about it or where she got it and that she must protect it as she had the box of orden he removed his fingers and she opened her eyes and smiled chase picked her up with a hand on each side of her waist and set her down to stand on the bench next to him he searched through the arsenal of knives at his waist and found the strap for the smallest he untied the leather thong and pulled the sheathed blade free he held it up in front of her face since you are my daughter now you will wear a knife just like me but i dont want you taking it out until i teach you about it you could cut yourself badly i will teach you how to use it in a safe manner im going to teach you how to protect yourself so you will be safe all right rachel beamed youll teach me to be like you i would like that ever so much chase chase grunted as he tied the leather strap at her waist i dont know how good ill be at teaching you seems i cant even teach you to call me father she smiled shyly chase and father mean the same thing to me chase shook his head a resigned grin on his face zedd came to his feet and straightened his robes chase if you need anything commander general trimack will see to it take as many men as you would like i wouldnt like any im in a hurry i dont need the extra baggage to tend and besides i think a man and his daughter would draw less attention isnt that the whole idea he glanced pointedly at the stone around rachels neck zedd smiled appreciating the boundary wardens sharp mind those two were going to make quite a pair i will travel with you until i reach the route toward adie i must do some things in the morning and then we can be on our way good you look like you could use some rest before we start out i think youre right zedd suddenly realized why he was so tired he had thought it was because he hadnt slept in days but that wasnt it it was because they had struggled for months to stop darken rahl and just when he thought it was over that they had finally won he now knew it had only begun and this wasnt just a dangerous wizard they were fighting it was the keeper of the underworld with darken rahl he had known most of the rules how the boxes of orden worked how much time theyd had he knew next to nothing now the keeper could win in the next five minutes zedd felt hopelessly ignorant he sighed inwardly he guessed he knew some things he would just have to build on that knowledge by the way chase said as he straightened the knife at rachels waist one of the other healers kelley she said her name was she gave me a message for you he leaned back and fished around in his pocket with two big fingers bringing out a small piece of paper he handed it to the wizard whats this the paper said west rim north highland way third tier chase pointed at the paper as zedd held it out reading it she said that is where you could find her she said to tell you that she thought you needed rest and that if you would come to her she would make you a stenadine tea and that she would brew it weak so you would sleep well does that make any sense to you zedd smiled just a little to himself as he crumpled the note in his fist a bit he tapped his lower lip in thought get yourself some rest if you think the pain of the wounds will keep you from sleeping i could have one of the healers brew you up some chase held a hand up no ill sleep fine very well he patted rachels arm and chases shoulder and started off a thought came to him and he turned back have you ever seen richard wearing a red coat a red coat with gold buttons and brocade chase gave a snort of a laugh richard zedd you half raised him you should know better than i that richard doesnt have a red coat like that he has a feastday coat thats brown richard is a woods guide he favors earth colors ive never even seen him wear a red shirt why zedd ignored the question when you see him tell him i said not to wear a red coat he shook a finger at chase ever its very important dont forget no red coat chase nodded done he knew when not to press the old man zedd gave rachel a smile and a quick hug before starting off down the hall he wondered idly if he could remember where a dining hall was it had to be almost past dinnertime a thought occurred to him he didnt know where he was going he hadnt done anything about finding himself a place to sleep well no matter he thought the palace had guest rooms he had told chase about them he could go there too he unfolded the crumpled piece of paper in his hand and looked at it a distinguished man with a neatly trimmed gray beard and dressed in official gold robes was walking past zedd snagged him gently excuse me but could you tell me where he looked at the paper where west rim north highland way third tier is located the bearded man gave a polite bow of his head of course sir those are the healers quarters it is not far let me guide you partway there and give you direction for the rest of it zedd broke into a smile he suddenly didnt feel quite so tired thank you that is very kind of you chapter as sister margaret turned the corner at the top of the stone steps an old maidservant carrying a mop and bucket saw her and fell to her knees the sister paused momentarily to touch the top of the old womans bowed head the creators blessing on his child the woman looked up her face wrinkling into a warm toothless smile thanks be to you sister and blessings to you in his work margaret smiled back and watched as the old woman lugged her heavy bucket on down the hall poor woman she thought having to work in the middle of the night but then here she was herself up and about in the middle of the night the shoulder of her dress pulled uncomfortably she looked down and saw that in her haste she had misaligned the top three buttons she redid them before pushing open the heavy oak door out into the darkness a pacing guard saw her and came at a run she held the book over her mouth to hide her yawn he lurched to a halt sister wheres the prelate hes been yelling for her runs shivers up my spine it does where is she sister margaret scowled at the guard until he remembered his manners and dropped a quick bow when he came back up she started off down the rampart with the man at her heels the prelate does not come simply because the prophet roars but he called out for her specifically she stopped and clasped her hand over the one holding the book and would you like to be the one to bang on the prelates bedchamber door in the middle of the night and wake her simply because the prophet shouts for it his face paled in the moonlight no sister it is enough that a sister must be dragged out of bed for his nonsense but you dont know what hes been saying sister hes been yelling that enough she cautioned in a low tone need i remind you that if a word he says ever touches your tongue you will lose your head his hand went to his throat no sister i would never speak a word of it except to a sister not even to a sister it must never touch your tongue forgive me sister his tone turned apologetic its just that ive never heard him cry out so before ive never heard his voice except to call for a sister the things he said alarmed me i have never heard him speak such things he has contrived to get his voice through our shields it has happened before he manages it sometimes that is why his guards are sworn on an oath never to repeat anything they should happen to hear whatever you heard you had best forget it before this conversation is over unless you want us to help you forget he shook his head too terrified to speak she didnt like frightening the man but they couldnt have him wagging his tongue over a mug of ale with his fellows prophecies were not for the common mind to know she laid a gentle hand on his shoulder what is your name i am swordsman kevin andellmere sister if you will give me your word swordsman andellmere that you can hold your tongue about whatever you heard to your grave i will see about having you reassigned you are obviously not cut out for this duty he dropped to a knee praise be to you sister id rather face a hundred heathens from the wilds than have to hear the voice of the prophet you have my oath on my life so be it then go back to your post at the end of your duty tell the captain of the guards that sister margaret ordered you reassigned she touched his head the creators blessing on his child thank you for your kindness sister she walked on across the rampart to the small colonnade at the end down the winding stairs and into the torchlit hall before the door to the prophets apartments two guards with spears flanked the door they bowed together i hear the prophet has been speaking out through the shield cold dark eyes looked back at her really i havent heard a thing he spoke to the other guard while holding the sisters gaze you hear anything the other guard leaned his weight on his spear and turned his head as he spat he wiped his chin with the back of his hand not a thing been quiet as a grave that boy upstairs been waggin his tongue the first asked it has been a long time since the prophet found a way to get anything other than a call for a sister through our shields he has never heard the prophet speak before thats all you want we should make it sos he dont hear nothin again or speak it that wont be necessary i have his oath and have ordered him reassigned oath the man made a sour face at the word an oath is nothin more than babbled words a blades oath is truer really am i to assume that your oath of silence is nothing more than babbled words too should we see to your silence then in a truer way sister margaret held his dark gaze until it at last broke with a downward glance no sister my oath is true enough she nodded has anyone else been about to hear him yelling no sister as soon as he started in calling for the prelate we checked the area to be sure there were none of the staff or anyone else about when we found everything was clear i posted guards at all the far entrances and sent for a sister hes never called for the prelate before only a sister i thought it should be up to a sister not me to decide if the prelate was to be awakened in the middle of the night good thinking now that youre here sister we should be off to check the others his expression darkened again to make sure no one heard anything she nodded and you had better hope swordsman andellmere is careful and doesnt fall off a wall and break his neck or i will come looking for you he gave an annoyed grunt but if you hear him repeat so much as a single word of what he heard tonight you find a sister before you stop to take another breath through the door and halfway down the inner hall she stopped and felt the shields she held the book to her breast in both arms as she concentrated searching for the breach she smiled when she found it a tiny twist in the weave he had probably been picking at it for years she closed her eyes and wove the breach together binding it with a barb of power that would thwart him if he tried the same thing again she was ruefully impressed by his ingenuity and his persistence well she sighed to herself what else had he to do inside his spacious apartments the lamps were lit tapestries hung on one of the walls and the floors were generously covered with the local colorful blue and yellow carpets the bookshelves were half empty books that belonged on them lay open everywhere some on the chairs and couches some facedown on pillows on the floor and some stacked in disheveled piles next to his favorite chair beside the cold hearth sister margaret went to the elegant polished rosewood writing table to the side of the room she sat at the padded chair and opening the book on the desktop flipped through it until she came to a clean page at the end of the writing she didnt see the prophet anywhere he was probably in the garden the double doors to the small garden were open letting in a gentle breath of warm air from a drawer in the desk she took an ink bottle pen and a small sprinkle box of fine sand setting them beside the open book of prophecies when she looked up he was standing in the half light in the doorway to the garden watching her he was in black robes with the hood drawn up he stood motionless his hands in the sleeves of the opposite arms he filled the doorway not just with his size but with his presence she wiggled the stopper from the ink bottle good evening nathan he took three strong slow strides out of the shadows and into the lamplight pushing back the black hood to uncover his full head of long straight white hair that touched his broad shoulders the top of the metal collar just barely showed at the neck of his robes the muscles in his strong cleanshaven jaw tightened white eyebrows hooded his deep dark azure eyes he was a ruggedly handsome man despite being the oldest man she had ever known and he was quite mad or he was quite clever and wanted everyone to think he was mad she wasnt sure which was true no one was either way he was probably the most dangerous man alive where is the prelate he asked in a deep menacing voice she picked up the pen it is the middle of the night nathan we are not going to wake the prelate simply because you throw a fit demanding she come any sister can write down a prophecy why dont you sit down and we can begin he came to the desk opposite her towering over her dont test me sister margaret this is important she glowered up at him and dont you test me nathan need i remind you that you will lose now that you have gotten me out of my bed in the middle of the night lets get this over so i may return to it and try to salvage a part of a nights sleep i asked for the prelate this is important nathan we have yet to decipher prophecies you gave us years ago it could not possibly make any difference if you give this one to me and she reads it in the morning or next week or next year for that matter i have no prophecy to give her anger rose you have called me from my bed for company a broad smile spread on his lips would you object its a beautiful night you are a handsome enough woman if a little tightly wound he cocked his head to the side no well since you have come and must have a prophecy would you like me to tell you of your death the creator will take me when he chooses i will leave it to him he nodded staring off over her head sister margaret would you have a woman sent to visit me i find i am lonely of late it is not the task of the sisters to procure harlots for you but they have seen to a courtesan for me in the past when i have given prophecies with deliberate care she set the pen on the desk and the last one left before we could talk to her she ran back half naked and half mad how she got through the guards we still dont know you promised not to speak prophecies to her you promised nathan before we could find her she had repeated what you had told her it spread like a wild fire it started a civil war nearly six thousand people died because of what you told that young woman his worried white eyebrows went up really i never knew she took a deep breath and spoke in a soft voice to control her anger nathan i myself have told you this three times now he looked down with sad eyes im sorry margaret sister margaret sister you you are far too young and attractive to be a sister surely you are but a novice she stood good night nathan she closed the cover on the book and started to pick it up sit down sister margaret came his voice again full of power and menace you have nothing to tell me i am returning to my bed i did not say i had nothing to tell you i said i had no prophecy to give if you have had no vision and have no prophecy what could you possibly have to tell me he withdrew his hands from his sleeves and placed his knuckles on the desk leaning close to her face sit down or i wont tell you margaret contemplated using her power but decided that it was easier and quicker to simply make him happy and sit down all right im sitting what is it he leaned over even more his eyes going wide there has been a fork in the prophecies he whispered she felt herself rising out of the chair when just today this very day then why have you called me in the middle of the night i called out as soon as it came to me and why have you not waited until the morning to tell us this there have been forks before he slowly shook his head as he smiled not like this one she didnt relish telling the others no one was going to be happy about this no one but warren that is he would be in a state of glee to have a piece to fit into the puzzle of the prophecies the others though would not be pleased this meant years of work some prophecies were if and then prophecies bifurcating into several possibilities there were prophecies that followed each branch prophecies to foretell events of each fork since not even the prophecies always knew which events would come to pass once one of these kind of prophecies came to pass and resolved which fork was to be true and one of the alternatives took place a prophecy had forked as it was called all the prophecies that followed down the path that had been voided now became false prophecies these themselves multiplied like the branches of a tree clogging the sacred prophecies with confusing contradicting and false information once a fork had occurred the prophecies they now knew to be false had to be followed as far as could be traced and pulled out it was a formidable task the further the event in question was from the fork the more difficult it was to know if it was of the false fork or of the true worse it was difficult to tell if two prophecies one following another belonged together or if they were to happen a thousand years apart sometimes the events themselves helped them to decipher where it was to be placed chronologically but only sometimes the further in time from the fork the more difficult was the task of relating them the effort would take years and even then they could be sure only of accomplishing part of it to this day they could not know with confidence if they were reading a true prophecy or the descendant of a false fork in the past for this reason some considered the prophecies unreliable at best useless at worst but if they nowknew of a fork and more importantly knew the true and the false branches they would have a valuable guide she sank back into the chair how important is the prophecy that forked it is a core prophecy there could be none more important decades it wouldnt take years it would take decades a core prophecy touched almost everything her insides fluttered this was like going blind until the tainted fruit of the false fork could be culled they couldnt trust anything she looked up into his eyes you do know which it was that forked he smiled proudly i know the false fork and the true i know what has come to pass well at least there was that she felt a ripple of excitement if nathan could tell her which fork was true and which was false and the nature of each branch it would be valuable information indeed since the prophecies were not in chronological order there was no way to simply follow a branch but this would be a very good start they would know right where to begin better yet they had learned of it as it happened and not years later you have done well nathan he grinned like a child who had pleased his mother bring a chair close and tell me of the fork nathan seemed drawn up in the excitement as he pulled a chair to the side of the desk he flounced down in it squirming like a puppy with a stick she hoped she wouldnt have to hurt him to get this stick out of his mouth nathan can you tell me the prophecy that has forked his eyes twinkled with mischief are you sure you want to know sister margaret prophecies are dangerous the last time i told one to a pretty lady thousands died you said so yourself nathan please its late this is very important the mirth left his face i dont remember the words exactly she doubted the truth of that when it came to prophecies nathans mind saw the words as if they were written on a stone tablet she put a reassuring hand on his arm that is to be understood i know it is difficult to remember every word tell it as best you can well lets see he looked at the ceiling as he stroked his chin with his thumb and fingertips it is the one that says something about the one from dhara who would shadow the world by counting shadows thats very good nathan can you remember more she knew he probably remembered it word for word but he liked to be coaxed it would be a tremendous help to me he eyed her a moment and then nodded by winters breath the counted shadows shall bloom if the heir to dharas vengeance counts the shadows true his umbra will darken the world if he counts false then his life is forfeit a forked prophecy indeed this had been the first full day of winters season she didnt know what the prophecy meant but she knew of it this one was the matter of much study and debate down in the vaults and worry over which year this prophecy might come to pass and which fork has the prophecy taken his face turned grim the worst one her fingers fumbled with a button we are to fall under the shadow of this one from dhara you should study the prophecies closer sister the following prophecy goes on to say should the forces of forfeit be loosed the world will be shadowed yet by darker lust through what has been rent salvations hope then will be as slim as the white blade of the one born true he leaned closer and whispered the only one of darker lust sister margaret would be the lord of anarchy she whispered a prayer may the creator shelter us in his light his smile was mocking the prophecy says nothing about the creator coming to our aid sister if it is protection you seek you had better follow the true fork it is in that way he has offered you a glimmer of hope for defense from what will be she smoothed the folds of her dress on her lap nathan i dont know what this prophecy means we cant follow the true and false forks if we dont know what it means you said you know those forks can you tell me can you tell me a prophecy on each fork one that leads each way so we may follow their path vengeance under the master will extinguish every adversary terror hopelessness and despair will reign free he peered at her intently with one eye this one leads down the false fork she wondered how it was possible for the true prophecy to be worse and one of the true fork a close prophecy after the true fork says of all there were but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive when the shadows threat is lifted therefore comes the greater darkness of the dead for there to be a chance at lifes bond this one in white must be offered to her people to bring their joy and good cheer margaret pondered these two prophecies she didnt recall either the first seemed simple enough to understand they could follow the false branch for a ways anyway from this one the second was more oblique but seemed as if it could be deciphered with a little study she recognized it as a prophecy about a confessor the reference to one in white meant the mother confessor thank you nathan this will make the false fork easier to follow the other the true fork will be a little harder but with this prophecy to lead the way we should be able to reason it out we will just have to look for prophecies leading away from this event somehow she is to bring happiness to her people that brought a small smile to her lips it sounds as if maybe she is to be wed or something of that nature the prophet blinked at her then threw his head back and howled he rose to his feet roaring in laughter until he coughed and choked he turned back to her his face red you pompous fools the way you sisters strut around as if what you do is meaningful as if you even knew what you were doing you remind me of a yard of chickens cackling to one another as if they thought they understood higher mathematics i cast the grain of prophecy at your feet and you cluck and scratch at the dirt and then peck at gravel for the first time since she became a sister she felt small and ignorant nathan that will be quite enough idiots he hissed he lurched toward her so quickly it frightened her before she knew it she had released a bolt of power it dropped him to his knees he clutched at his chest as he gasped margaret recalled her power almost instantly sorry she had reacted in this manner out of fear i apologize nathan you frightened me are you all right he grasped the chair back drawing himself up into it as he gasped he nodded she sat still ill at ease waiting for him to recover a grim smile spread on his lips frightened you did i would you like to be really frightened would you like me to show you a prophecy not tell you the words but show it to you show it to you the way it was meant to be passed on i have never shown a sister before you all study them and think you can decipher their meaning from the words but you dont understand that is not the true way they work she leaned forward what do you mean that is not the way they work they are meant to foretell and that is what they do he shook his head only partly they are passed on by ones with the gift ones like me prophets they are intended to be read and understood through the gift by ones with the gift ones like me not to be picked over by the likes of your power as he straightened himself pulling the aura of authority around himself again she studied his face she had never heard of such a thing she wasnt sure if he was telling the truth or just talking out of anger but if it was the truth nathan anything you could tell me or show me would be a great help we are all struggling on the side of the creator his cause must prevail the forces of the nameless one struggle always to silence us yes i would like you to show me a prophecy the way it is meant to be passed on if you can he drew himself up peering at her with burning intensity at last he spoke softly very well sister margaret he leaned toward her his expression so grave it nearly took her breath away look into my eyes he whispered lose yourself in my eyes his gaze drew her in the deep azure color spreading in her vision until it seemed she was looking up into the clear sky she felt as if he were drawing every breath for her i will tell you the prophecy of the true fork again but this time i will show it to you as it is meant to be she floated as she listened of all there were but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive the words melted away and instead she saw the prophecy as if seeing a vision she was pulled into it she was no longer in the palace but in the vision itself she saw a beautiful woman with long hair dressed in a satiny white dress the mother confessor margaret saw the other confessors being killed by quads sent from dhara and she felt the blinding horror of it she saw the womans best friend and sister confessor die in her arms she felt the grief of the mother confessor then margaret saw the mother confessor before the one from dhara who had sent the quads to kill the other confessors the handsome man in white stood before three boxes to margarets surprise each box cast a different number of shadows the man in white robes performed rituals cast evil spells underworld spells late into the night through the night until the sun rose as the day brightened somehow margaret knew that it was this day she was seeing what had happened this very day the man in white had finished with the preparations he stood before the boxes smiling he reached out and opened the one in the center the one that cast two shadows light from within the box bathed him in its brilliance at first but then in a flash of power the magic of the box swirled about him and snuffed out his life he had chosen wrong he forfeited his life to the magic he sought to claim she saw the mother confessor with a man a man she loved she felt her happiness it was a joy the woman had never experienced before margarets heart swelled with the bliss the mother confessor felt at the side of this man it was a vision of what was happening at this very moment and then margarets mind swept forward in a swirl she saw war and death sweep across the land she saw death brought by the keeper of the underworld to the world of the living with a wicked lust that choked her with terror again the prophecy swept her forward to a great crowd at the center was the mother confessor standing on a heavy platform the people were excited and in a celebratory mood this was the joyous event that would bring the fork of the prophecy one of the forks that must be passed correctly to save the world from the darkness snatching at it she was caught up in the festive mood of the crowd she felt a tingle of expectant hope wondering if the man the mother confessor loved was to be the one she was to wed and if that was the happy event the prophecy spoke of that would bring joy to the people her heart ached for it to be so but something wasnt right margarets warm delight cooled until her flesh prickled with icy bumps with a wave of worry margaret saw that the mother confessors hands were bound and next to her stood a man not the man she loved but a man in a black hood he held a great axe margarets worry turned to horror a hand forced the mother confessor to kneel seized her hair and laid her face to the block her hair was short now not long as it had been before but it was the same woman tears seeped from the mother confessors closed eyes her white dress shimmered in the bright sunlight margaret couldnt breathe the great crescent axe rose into the air it flashed through the sunlight thunking solidly into the block margaret gasped the mother confessors head dropped into the basket the crowd cheered blood gushed and spread down the dress as the headless lifeless corpse collapsed to the wooden floor a pool of bright blood spread under the body turning the white dress red so much blood the crowd roared with elation a wail of horror escaped margarets throat she thought she might vomit nathan caught her as she fell forward crying and sobbing he held her to him as a father would a frightened child ah nathan is that the event that will bring joy to the people is this what must happen if the world of the living is to be saved it is he said softly almost every prophecy down this true branch is a fork if the world of the living is to be saved from the keeper of the underworld then every event must take the correct branch in this prophecy the people must rejoice at seeing the mother confessor die for down the other fork lies the eternal darkness of the underworld i dont know why it is so margaret sobbed into his robes as his strong arms held her tight against him oh dear creator she cried take mercy on your poor child give her strength there is no mercy when fighting the keeper ah nathan i have read prophecies of people dying but it was only words to see it as real has wounded my soul he patted her back as he held her i know how well i know margaret pushed herself up wiping tears from her face this is the true prophecy that lies beyond the one that forked today it is and this is the way they are meant to be seen it is so this is the way they come to me i have shown you the way i see them the words too come with the prophecy and those are what are to be written down so those not meant to see the prophecies will not see them as they truly are but those who are meant to will see them when they read the words i have never before shown anyone a prophecy then why have you shown me his sad eyes regarded her a moment margaret we are in a battle with the keeper you are meant to know the danger we are in we are always in a battle with the keeper i think perhaps this is different i must tell the others i must tell them what you can show them we must have your help to understand the prophecies no i will show no other what i have shown you no matter the pain they would think to inflict upon me i will not cooperate i will never again do this for you or another sister but why not you are not meant to see them only to read them but that cant be it is meant to be otherwise your gift would work to unlock them you are not meant to see them just as you often tell me others with common minds are not meant to hear them but they could help us they would help you no more than the one i told that girl helped her or the thousands who died just as you keep me a prisoner here so others may not hear what they are not meant to hear so i must keep all but another prophet a prisoner of their ignorance it is the will of he who has given the gift and all else had he meant you to he would have given you the key with your gift but he has not nathan there are others who would hurt you until you revealed it to them i will not reveal it to them no matter how much they hurt me they will kill me before i do so he tilted his head toward her and they wont try unless you tell them she stared at him seeing him differently than she had ever seen him before none before had ever been as devious as he he was the only one they had never been able to trust all the others had told the truth about their gift and its capabilities but they knew nathan lied knew he was not telling them all he was able to do she wondered what he knew what he was capable of i will go to my grave with what you have shown me nathan he closed his eyes and nodded thank you child there were other sisters who would have hurt him for addressing a sister so she was not one of them she stood and straightened her dress in the morning i will tell those in the vaults of the prophecy that has forked and of the ones on the false and on the true branches they will have to decipher them as best they can with what the creator has given them that is the way it is meant to be she returned the ink pen and sand shaker to the desk drawer nathan why did you want the prelate to come i dont recall you ever asking for her before when she looked up he was studying her with cool detachment that too sister margaret is not for you to know do you wish to bring me pain to attempt to make me tell you she picked up the book of prophecy off the desk no nathan i will not do that then will you deliver a message to the prelate for me she nodded sniffling back the tears that still burned at her eyes what would you have me tell her will you take this too to your grave and tell no other but the prelate if you wish it although i dont see why you can trust the sisters no margaret i want you to listen to me when it is the keeper you battle you must not trust anyone i am taking a dangerous chance in trusting you and the prelate trust no one his bunched eyebrows gave him a frightening look only those you trust can betray you all right nathan what is the message he peered intently at her at last his words came in a whisper tell her that the pebble is in the pond margaret blinked at him what does that mean you have been frightened enough child dont tempt your endurance again sister margaret nathan she said softly i am not child but sister margaret please treat me with the respect i am accorded he smiled forgive me sister margaret sometimes his eyes ran shivers up her spine one more thing sister margaret what is it he reached out and brushed a tear from her cheek i dont really know of your death she sighed inwardly with relief but i do know something else of importance pertaining to you of importance in the battle with the keeper if it will help me to bring the creators light upon the world then tell me he seemed to draw himself inward looking out at her as if from a great distance a time will come soon when you stumble upon something and you will have need to know the answer to a question i dont know the question but when you have the need to find the answer come to me and that i will know this too you must tell no other thank you nathan she reached out and touched his hand the creators blessing on his child no thank you sister i do not wish anything more from the creator she stared at him in surprise because we keep you locked inhere his small smile returned there are many different kinds of prisons sister as far as i am concerned his blessings are tainted the only thing worse than being touched by the creator is being touched by the keeper and of that i am not even resolved she took her hand back i will still pray for you nathan if you care so much for me then free me im sorry i cant do that you mean you wont do that look at it how you will but you must remain here at last he turned away from her she started for the door sister would you send a woman to visit me to spend a night or two with me the pain in his voice almost made her weep i thought you would be beyond that age he slowly turned to her you have a lover sister margaret she reeled at this how could he know he didnt know he was guessing she was young and thought attractive by some of course she would be interested in men he was only guessing but then none of the sisters knew what he was able to do he was the only wizard they couldnt trust to be truthful about his powers you listen to gossip nathan he smiled tell me sister margaret do you have the day planned out in advance when you will be too old for love even if it is only for a time as fleeting as a night exactly how old sister is it when we lose the need for love she stood silent ashamed for a time i will go myself nathan into the city and bring back a woman to visit you for a time even if i must pay her price myself i cant pledge she will be beautiful to your eyes as i dont know what your eyes fancy but i can vow she will not be empty between the ears as i think you value this more than you will admit she saw a single tear fall from the corner of his eye thank you sister margaret but nathan you must promise me you will tell her no prophecy he bowed his head slightly of course sister i swear it on my word as a wizard i mean it nathan i do not wish to have a part in being responsible for people dying not only men died in those battles but women too i could not bear having a part in it his eyebrows lifted not even sister margaret if one of those women would bear had she lived a boy child who would grow into a brutal tyrant who would go on to torture and slaughter tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of innocent people women and children among them not even sister if you had a chance to choke off this fork of a terrible prophecy she stood stunned frozen at last she made herself blink nathan she whispered are you saying good night sister margaret he turned and strode off to the solitude of his small garden pulling up his black hood as he went chapter the wind ripped at her tugging at her clothes and snapping the loose ends after yesterdays tangled mess kahlan was at least glad she had thought to tie back her hair she clung to richard for dear life pressing the side of her face against his back as she squeezed her eyes tightly shut it was happening again the thick feeling of growing heavy that made the knot in the pit of her stomach sink lower of its own accord she thought she might be sick she was afraid to open her eyes she knew what always happened when she felt heavy like this richard called back for her to look she opened her eyes just a little peeking through narrow squinting slits as she suspected the world was tilted at a crazy angle her head spun sickeningly why did the dragon have to tip over whenever it made a turn she could feel herself being pressed against the red scales she couldnt understand why she wasnt falling off richard had told her he had figured out that it was just like when you swung a bucket of water around over your head and the water didnt fall out she had never swung a bucket of water over her head and wasnt entirely sure he was telling the truth about the water not falling out she looked longingly at the ground and saw what richard was pointing at the mud peoples village siddin squealed with glee from his place in richards lap as scarlets huge leathery wings caught the air and pulled them into a tight spiral as the red dragon plummeted earthward the knot of kahlans stomach felt as if it were coming up in her throat she didnt understand how they could like doing this they enjoyed it they actually enjoyed it arms stuck up in the air they were both laughing with delight acting like little boys well one was a little boy and she guessed he had a right she suddenly smiled and then laughed herself not at flying on a dragon but at seeing how happy richard was she would fly on a dragon every day just to see him laughing and happy she stretched up and kissed the back of his neck he brought his hands down and rubbed one on each of her legs she clasped them tighter around him and forgot a little about feeling sick richard called forward for scarlet to land in the open field in the center of the village the sun was almost down making the tan plastered mudbricked buildings in the circle of the village stand out brightly in the slanting light kahlan could smell the sweet smoke from the cooking fires the long shadows trailed the people running for cover women ran from the cooking shelters and men from their weapons making all shouting and calling out she hoped they wouldnt be too frightened the last time scarlet had come here she had carried darken rahl and when he didnt find richard he had killed people these people didnt know rahl had forced scarlet to fly him around after he had stolen her egg of course even without darken rahl riding her no one ever thought of a red dragon as anything but a deadly threat she herself would have run for her life at seeing a red dragon the red were the most fearsome of all the dragons and no one would ever imagine doing anything with a red dragon except trying to kill it or running for his life no one but richard that is who else but richard would think to befriend one he had risked his life to get her egg free from rahls control so she would help him and in the process had made a friend for life although scarlet still professed her intent to eat him someday kahlan suspected it was some private joke between the two as richard laughed whenever she said it at least kahlan hoped it was only a joke she wasnt entirely sure kahlan looked down at the village and hoped the hunters didnt start shooting poison arrows before they saw who was riding the red dragon siddin suddenly recognized his home he pointed excitedly and jabbered to richard in the mud peoples language richard couldnt understand a word of it but smiled and nodded and ruffled siddins hair they both gripped the spikes on scarlets back as she pulled out of the steep descent dust swept up around them lifted by the fluttering of scarlets huge wings as she settled on the ground richard grabbed hold of siddin and sat the little boy up on his broad shoulders then stood up on scarlets back the stiff cold breeze carried the dust away to reveal a ragged ring of hunters their bows drawn poison arrows pointing up at the three of them kahlan held her breath grinning siddin waved both hands over his head as richard had told him to scarlet held her head down so the mud people could get a clear view of who was riding her the hunters astonished cautiously lowered their bows kahlan exhaled when she saw the tension come off the bowstrings a figure in buckskin pants and tunic stepped through the ring of hunters long silver hair hung down spreading over his shoulders it was the bird man his sunbrowned face a picture of shock its me richard i have returned with your help we have defeated darken rahl and we have brought savidlin and weselans son back the bird man looked to kahlan as she translated a beaming grin spread on his face we welcome you both back to your people with open arms women and children were gathering among the ring of hunters their dark mudslicked hair framing amazed faces scarlet lowered her bulky body to the ground and richard slid off her shoulder landing on his boots with a thump he held siddin in one arm as he reached up with the other and helped kahlan down she was quietly joyful to have her feet on the earth again weselan pushed through the throng running to them savidlin right at her heels she wailed her sons name siddin held his arms out gleefully and practically leapt into her arms weselan alternated between crying and laughing as she tried to hug her son and richard and kahlan all at once savidlin rubbed his boys back and looked to her and richard with wet eyes he was brave as any hunter kahlan told him he gave a single firm pridefilled nod he appraised her for a moment and then stepped closer giving her a gentle slap strength to confessor kahlan kahlan returned the slap and greeting and then he threw his arms around her and squeezed nearly all the breath out of her when finished with hugging her he straightened his elders coyote hide on his shoulders and looked up at richard he shook his head in wonderment and then he gave richard a powerfully hard whack across the jaw a demonstration of his heartfelt respect for richards strength strength to richard with the temper kahlan wished he hadnt done that she could tell by richards eyes that he had a headache he had had it since yesterday and she had hoped it would be better after a good sleep the night before in scarlets cave siddin had played with the little red dragon until he was dead tired and then had cuddled between them and gone to sleep having not slept for days she thought she would have no trouble sleeping but she found she didnt want to stop looking at richard she had finally put her head on his shoulder held his hand in both of hers and fallen asleep smiling they had all needed the rest bad dreams had caused richard to jerk awake several times in a cold sweat and even though he had said nothing she could see in his eyes that he still had the headache richard didnt let it bother him though and returned savidlins slap in kind strength to savidlin my friend properly greeted souls protected savidlin let his grins and backslaps fly after they had exchanged greetings with the bird man richard addressed the crowd this brave and noble dragon scarlet he called out in a voice for all to hear even though they couldnt understand the words has helped me kill darken rahl and avenge our murdered people she has brought us here so siddin could be returned before his parents could fear for him another night she is my friend a friend to the mud people everyone was dumbfounded as kahlan translated the hunters at least puffed up at hearing that an enemy of the mud people had been killed by one of their own even if he was one of their own by proclamation and not by birth the mud people honored strength and to them killing one who harmed their people meant strength scarlets head swung down her ears twitching one yellow eye frowned at richard friend red dragons are friends to no people we are feared by all youre my friend richard smiled im a person scarlet snorted a puff of smoke at him paah i will eat you yet richards grin widened he pointed at the bird man you see this man he gave me the whistle that i used to save your egg if not for that whistle the gars might have eaten your little one he stroked a hand on the bright red snout and a wonderful little one it is scarlet tilted her head blinking a big yellow eye at the bird man i guess he would make a meager snack she peered back at richard a chuckle rumbling in her throat the whole of the village wouldnt make a decent meal more trouble than it would be worth she brought her head closer to him if they are your friends richard cypher they are my friends too and scarlet this one is called the bird man because he loves creatures that fly scarlets scaly eyebrows lifted really she swung her head close to the bird man inspecting him anew the proximity of scarlets big head caused a few close to him to back away a step or two the bird man held his ground thank you bird man for helping richard he has saved my young one the mud people have nothing to fear from me on my dragons honor the bird man looked to kahlan as she translated smiled to scarlet and then turned to his people as richard with the temper says this noble dragon scarlet is a friend to the mud people she may hunt our land and we will bring no harm to her nor her to us cheering erupted from the crowd for a people to have a dragon as a friend was taken as an honor to their strength everyone seemed to be shouting with excitement they waved their arms in the air and stamped around in little dances scarlet joined in the merriment by throwing her head back and sending a roaring column of flame skyward the people cheered louder kahlan noticed richard glancing off to the side she followed the direction of his gaze to a small band of hunters standing together none of them were cheering she recognized their leader he was the one who had blamed richard for bringing trouble to their village blamed richard for the deaths of mud people at the hands of darken rahl as the hooting and hollering went on richard motioned scarlet toward him when she lowered her head he put his face right in her ear she listened to whatever he was saying and then pulled her head back regarding him with a big yellow eye she nodded richard held out the carved bone whistle hanging from a leather thong at his neck as he turned to the bird man you gave me this as a gift but told me it would never aid me because i could only call all the birds at once i think maybe the good spirits wanted it that way this gift helped me save everyone from darken rahl it helped me save kahlan thank you the bird man smiled at the translation richard whispered in kahlans ear that he would be back in a short time and then climbed up on scarlet honored elder scarlet and i would like to give you a small gift we would like to take you up in the air so you may see where your beloved birds fly he extended a hand to the bird man the elder upon hearing the translation looked apprehensively at scarlet her vibrant red scales were glossy in the lateafternoon sun undulating with her breathing her tail reached nearly to the mudbrick homes across the field the dragon unfolded her wings and lazily stretched them he looked at richard who was still offering his hand to him a littleboy grin lit the elders face it made kahlan laugh he clasped richards arm and hoisted himself up savidlin strode over and stood by kahlan as the dragon rose into the air the people cheered their approval as they watched the dragon lifting their honored elder into the air kahlan wasnt seeing the dragon she saw only richard she could hear the bird man laughing as scarlet carried them up hid away she hoped he was still laughing after scarlet made a turn savidlin glanced at her he is a rare person richard with the temper she smiled and nodded her gaze went across the way to the man who wasnt cheering or happy savidlin who is that man chandalen he blames richard for darken rahl coming here and killing people the wizards first rule came to her mind people will believe anything if it wasnt for richard darken rahl would rule us all now the same darken rahl who killed those people savidlin shrugged not everyone who has eyes can see remember the elder you killed toffalar that was his uncle she nodded absently wait here kahlan walked across the field pulling the tie from her hair as she went she was still dazed by the knowledge that richard loved her and that he couldnt be harmed by her magic it was hardly possible to believe she a confessor could ever experience love it went against everything she had ever been taught she just wanted to take richard somewhere alone and kiss him and hug him until they were old there was no way she was going to allow this man chandalen to bring any harm to richard now that she and the man she loved could somehow magically be together she wasnt going to allow anything to jeopardize that the mere thought of anyone harming richard brought the blood rage the con dar boiling up inside her she had never known about the con dar before had never known it was part of her magic until she brought it forth when she thought richard had been killed since then she felt it within her just as she always felt the rest of the confessors magic with his arms folded across his chest chandalen watched her come his hunters stood behind him leaning on spears planted buttfirst in the ground apparently they had just returned from a hunt their lean bodies were still smeared with sticky mud they stood easy but alert bows were slung over their shoulders and quivers hung at one side of their belts long knives at the other there were smears of blood on some of the men grass tied in bands at their upper arms and around their heads helped make them invisible in the surrounding grassland when they chose to be kahlan stopped in front of chandalen looking into his dark eyes she slapped him strength to chandalen he pulled his glare from her arms still folded turned his head and spat his fierce eyes came back to hers what do you want confessor the hunters mudstreaked faces all took on small tight smiles the mud peoples land was probably the only place where it was an insult not to be slapped richard with the temper has sacrificed more than you could ever know to save our people from darken rahl why do you hate him the two of you have brought trouble to my people you will bring it again our people she corrected kahlan unbuttoned the cuff of her shirt and drew the sleeve up to her shoulder she pushed her arm up in front of his face toffalar cut me this is the scar he left as he tried to kill me that was before i killed him not after he killed himself by attacking me i did not go after him without emotion chandalens gaze rose from the scar to her eyes uncle never was very good with a knife pity kahlans jaw clenched rigid she couldnt back down now she kissed the end of her fingers as she held his gaze reaching out she touched the kissed fingers to his cheek where she had slapped him the hunters broke into angry whispers yanking their spears from the ground chandalens face twisted into a hateful glare this was the worst insult you could give a hunter he had given a disrespectful slight by not slapping her it did not admit to having no respect for her strength only that he didnt wish to show it if he did by placing a kiss where she had offered a slap of respect she had withdrawn her respect for his strength the touch of the kiss said she had no respect for his strength and considered him no more than a foolish child she had as much as spat on his honor publicly while this was a dangerous thing to do it was more dangerous among the mud people to show weakness to an enemy that would be an invitation to be murdered in your sleep showing weakness denied you the right to face an adversary in the light honor required that strength be challenged openly since she had done this to him in the view of others honor required any challenge from him be the same from now on she said if you want my respect you must earn it chandalens whiteknuckled fist jerked back to his ear preparing to strike her kahlan held her chin out for him so you have decided to show your respect for my strength his glare flicked to something behind her his hunters flinched and reluctantly thrust the butts of their spears into the ground kahlan turned and saw about fifty men with drawn bows every arrow was leveled at chandalen or one of his nine men so chandalen sneered you are not so strong you must ask others to back you lower your weapons she called back to the men no one is to raise a weapon to these men for me no one this is between chandalen and me only reluctantly all the bows lowered and the arrows rattled back into quivers chandalen folded his arms once more you are not so strong you will hide behind the seekers sword too kahlan slapped her hand onto his forearm and gripped it tightly chandalens eyes widened a little as he froze for a confessor to place her hand on someone in this manner was an overt threat and he recognized it as such defiant or not he knew better than to move a muscle he couldnt move as fast as her thought and that was all she needed her voice was a low hiss in the last year i have killed more men than you have falsely boasted to have killed in the whole of your life if you ever try to harm richard i will kill you she leaned closer if you even dare to express the thought out loud and it reaches my ears i will kill you she took in the hunters with a deliberate sweep of her gaze my hand will always be extended to each of you in friendship if any hand extends to me with a knife i will kill you as i killed toffalar i am the mother confessor dont think i cant or wont she held the gaze of each hunter in turn until they nodded in acknowledgment her hard eyes came at last to chandalen her grip tightened he swallowed at last he too nodded this is a matter between us i will not speak to the bird man of it she took her hand from his arm in the distance the dragon roared its return we are on the same side chandalen we both fight for the mud people to live that part of you i respect she gave him a very small slap she offered him no opportunity to return it or to fail to and instead turned her back to him the slap had given him back a small amount of his respect in the eyes of his men and would make him look foolish and weak if he chose to press an attack now it was a small offering but it had shown she acted honorably she would leave it up to his men to decide if he had bullying a woman brought no honor but then she was no mere woman she was a confessor kahlan let out a deep breath as she returned to savidlin and turned to watch the dragon land weselan stood next to him still hugging siddin tightly for his part siddin didnt look to want anything else in the world but to be rocked in his mothers arms kahlan gave a mental shudder at the thought of what might have happened to him savidlin turned to her and lifted an eyebrow you would make a good elder mother confessor you could give lessons in honor and leadership i would prefer the lessons werent necessary savidlin grunted his agreement dust and wind kicked up by the dragons wings fluttered past in fits that billowed her cloak kahlan was buttoning her cuff when the two men slid off scarlet the bird man looked a little green but he was grinning from ear to ear he stroked a red scale respectfully and beamed at the yellow eye that watched him kahlan approached and the bird man asked her to translate a message to scarlet she smiled and looked up at the dragons huge head at its ears which were now turning toward her the bird man would like you to know that this has been one of the greatest honors of his life he says you have given him the gift of a new vision he says that from this day forward if you or your young one ever need refuge you will always be welcome and safe in this land scarlets snout twisted into a sort of dragon grin thank you bird man i am pleased she lowered her head to speak to richard i must leave now my young one has been alone long enough and will be hungry richard smiled as he stroked a red scale thank you scarlet for everything thank you for showing us your little one it is even more beautiful than you take care of the both of you live free scarlet spread her jaws wide and reached into the back of her mouth there was a snap and she brought a tooth point out held in her blacktipped talons it was only a point but a good six inches long dragons have magic she told him hold out your hand she dropped the tooth point in richards palm you seem to have a knack for getting yourself in trouble keep this safe if you ever have great need call me with it and i will come be certain as it will only work once but how can i call you with it her head floated closer to him you have the gift richard cypher just hold it in your hand and call to me i will hear remember great need thank you scarlet but i dont have the gift scarlet threw her head back and rumbled in laughter the ground shook the scales on her throat vibrated when her fit of laughter died out in spurts she tilted her head to look at him with one yellow eye if you dont have the gift then no one does live free richard cypher everyone in the village watched in silence as the red dragon grew smaller in the golden sky richard put his arm around kahlans waist pulling her close against him i hope that ive finally heard the last of this nonsense about me having the gift he muttered half to himself i saw you from up in the air he pointed with his chin across the clearing you want to tell me what that was all about with our friend over there chandalen was making a point of not looking at her no its not important are we ever going to get to be alone kahlan asked with a coy smile pretty soon im going to have to start kissing you in front of all of these people dusk was bringing a cozy fading light to the impromptu feast richard glanced around the grassroofed shelter at the elders in their coyote hides they were all smiles and chatter their wives and a few children had joined the group people were stopping by the shelter to welcome the two of them back smiling and exchanging gentle slaps little children across the way were chasing brown chickens that wanted nothing more than to find a place to roost for the night the chickens squawked as they made flapping escapes she couldnt understand how the children could stand to be naked as cold as it was women in bright dresses were bringing woven trays of tava bread and glazed pottery bowls of roasted peppers rice cakes long boiled beans cheese and roasted meats you really think theyre going to let us get away before we tell them the whole story of our great adventure what great adventure all i remember is being scared to death all the time and being in more trouble than i knew how to get out of her insides twisted in pain at the memory of learning he had been captured by a mordsith and thinking you were dead he smiled didnt you know thats what an adventure is being in trouble ive had enough of adventure to last me the rest of my life richards gray eyes looked distant me too her gaze went to the red leather rod the agiel which hung on a gold chain around his neck she reached back and took a piece of cheese from a platter her face brightened she put the cheese to his mouth maybe we can just make up a story that sounds like a proper adventure a short adventure suits me he said and then bit off a chunk of the cheese as she held it to his mouth immediately he spit the cheese into his hand and made a sour face this is awful he whispered really she sniffed the piece she still held she took a tiny bite well i dont like cheese but it doesnt taste any worse than usual to me i dont think it has gone bad he was still making the face tastes like it has to me kahlan thought a minute and then frowned yesterday at the peoples palace you didnt like the cheese there either and zedd said there was nothing wrong with it nothing wrong with it it tasted rotten i ought to know i love cheese i eat it all the time i know bad cheese when i eat it well i hate cheese maybe youre just picking up my habits he rolled a roasted pepper in a piece of tava bread and grinned i could think of a worse fate as she returned the smile she saw two hunters approaching her back stiffened richard noticed her reaction and sat up straighter these are two of chandalens men i dont know what they want she gave him a wink be a good boy lets not have an adventure without smiling or answering he turned and watched the two come the hunters stopped in front of her at the edge of the platform they planted the butts of their spears firmly in the ground leaning on them with both hands they both assessed her with slightly narrowed eyes and small tight smiles that werent entirely unfriendly the one closest pushed his bow a little farther up on his shoulder and then extended an open hand to her palm up she looked down at the hand she knew what it meant an open hand offered without a weapon in it she glanced up at him in confusion does chandalen approve of this we are chandalens men not his children he kept the hand out kahlan looked at it a moment and then stroked her palm over his his smile widened a little and he gave her a gentle slap strength to confessor kahlan i am prindin this is my brother tossidin she gave prindin a slap and wished him strength tossidin held his palm open to her she stroked it with hers he gave her a slap and added his wish of strength he had a handsome smile that matched his brothers surprised by his friendliness she returned his slap and greeting kahlan glanced to richard the brothers noticed the look and in response both gave richard a slap and greeting we wanted to tell you that you spoke with strength and honor today prindin said chandalen is a hard man and a hard man to get to know but he is not a bad man he cares deeply for our people and wants only to protect them from harm that is what we do protect our people kahlan nodded richard and i are mud people too the brothers smiled the elders have proclaimed it for all to know we will protect you both the same as any other of our people will chandalen both grinned but neither answered they pulled their spears up readying to leave tell them i said they have fine bows richard said she glanced sideways to see him watching the two she told his words to prindin they smiled as they nodded we are very good with them richards expressionless gaze stayed on the two brothers tell them i think their arrows look to be well made ask if i may see one kahlan frowned at him before translating for the hunters the brothers beamed with pride prindin pulled an arrow from his quiver and handed it to richard kahlan noticed that the elders were all quiet richard rolled the arrow in his fingers betraying no emotion he looked at the nock and then turned it around and looked at the flat metal point he handed the arrow back very fine work as prindin replaced the arrow in his quiver kahlan told him what richard had said he slid a hand partway up his spear and leaned a little of his weight on it if you know how to shoot a bow we would invite you to come with us tomorrow before she could translate savidlin spoke to her richard told me before when you were here last that he had to leave his bow behind in westland and that he missed it as a surprise i made him one for when you both came back it is a gift to him for teaching me how to make roofs that do not leak it is at my home i was going to give it to him tomorrow tell him and tell him that if he agrees i would like to take some of my hunters and go with him tomorrow he smiled we will see if he is as good a shot as our hunters the brothers grinned and nodded their enthusiasm they looked to be confident of the results of the contest kahlan told richard what savidlin had said richard was surprised and seemed to be moved by what savidlin had done the mud people make some of the finest fbows i have ever seen i am honored savidlin that is was poison the result of an evil magic they didnt know that in westland where richard was from you could eat red things like apples they had seen him eat an apple once before when he had tricked them into not making him take a wife from their village by convincing them that his eating it might make his seed poisonous to his bride but they sweated as they watched the two of them doing it again what are you doing kahlan asked him just eat your apple and then translate for me when they finished richard stood motioning her up next to him honored elders i have returned from stopping the threat against our people now that it is over i would like to ask your permission for something i hope you find me worthy i would like to ask your permission to have a mud woman as my wife as you can see i have taught kahlan to eat these things as i do she will not be harmed by it or by me and in the same way though she is a confessor i will not be harmed by her we would like to be together and we would like to be wedded by our people kahlan could hardly get the last of the words out past the tightness in her throat and she could hardly keep from throwing her arms around him she could feel her eyes burning and filling with tears and had to clear her throat to finish the words she put her arm around richards waist to steady herself the elders suddenly beamed with surprise the bird man wore a wide grin i think you are finally learning to be mud people he said nothing could please us more than for you two to be wed richard didnt wait for the translation but gave her a kiss that took her breath away the elders and their wives applauded it was all the more special to her that they would be wedded before the mud people kahlan felt at home here when they had come before seeking help in their struggle to stop rahl richard had shown the mud people how to make roofs that didnt leak they had made friends had fought battles together with lives saved and lost in the process the two of them had bonded with these people in honor of their sacrifices the bird man had proclaimed them mud people the bird man stood and gave kahlan a fatherly hug that felt as if he were saying that he understood everything she had been through and was happy she had at last found happiness she shed a few tears against his shoulder as he held her in his strong arms their adventure a long ordeal had taken her from the depths of pain and despair to the heights of joy the fight had ended only yesterday it didnt seem possible it could be over at last as they went on with the feast kahlan wished more than ever that it could end soon so she could be alone with richard he had been held prisoner for over a month and had only rejoined her the day before she hadnt even really had a chance to talk with him or hug him nearly enough children danced and played around the small fire while the adults gathered around torches eating and talking and laughing weselan scooted down next to her hugged her and said she would make her a proper wedding dress savidlin kissed her cheek and slapped richards back she found it difficult to look away from richards gray eyes she didnt want to ever the hunters who had been out on the plain the day the bird man had tried to teach richard how to call specific birds with the special whistle he had given richard as a gift wandered by the elders platform all richard could do that day was make a sound that called all the birds at once but not different species individually the hunters had laughed endlessly that day as they listened now savidlin made richard show the whistle and tell again how he had used it to call all the birds that roosted in the valley filled with gars the thousands of hungry birds had eaten the gars blood flies creating a panic the diversion had enabled richard to rescue scarlets egg the bird man laughed even though he had already heard the story three times by now savidlin laughed and slapped richards back the hunters laughed and slapped their thighs richard laughed as he watched them react to kahlans translation kahlan laughed at seeing richard laugh i think we have found an adventure that satisfies them she thought about it and frowned how did scarlet land you close enough to the egg without being seen by the gars richard looked away and was silent a moment she landed me on the valley on the other side of the hills around fire spring i went through the cave he didnt look at her kahlan hooked some hair behind an ear and was there really a beast in the cave a shadrin he let out a deep breath as he looked across the open area that there was and more as she put her hand on his shoulder he took it and kissed the back of it still staring off i thought i was going to die there alone i thought i would never see you again he seemed to shake off the memory and leaned back on an elbow gazing at her with a lopsided smile on his face the shadrin left some scars that arent healed yet but i would have to take off my pants to show them to you really kahlan gave a throaty laugh i think i better have a look to see if everything is all right as she looked deep into his eyes she abruptly realized most of the elders were watching them suddenly she felt her face warm she snatched up a rice cake and took a quick bite relieved to know they couldnt understand their words she hoped others couldnt understand the look in their eyes she chided herself to pay more attention to where she was richard sat up again kahlan reached over to a small bowl of roasted ribs that looked to be wild boar and set it down in his lap here have some of these she looked over at a group of the wives she held up the rice cake and smiled these are very good they nodded their satisfaction she looked back to richard he was staring down at the bowl of meat his face was white take it away he whispered kahlan frowned and lifted the bowl from his lap setting it behind her she scooted closer to him richard whats wrong he was still staring at his lap as if the bowl were still there i dont know i looked down at the meat and then i could smell it it made me feel sick it just seemed like a dead animal to me like i was about to eat some dead animal lying there in front of me how could anyone eat some dead animal that was just lying there kahlan didnt know what to say he didnt look well i think i know what you mean i was sick once and they fed me some cheese i threw it all back up they thought it would be good for me and every day fed me more and i would throw it up until i was well again that is why to this day i dont like cheese maybe its something like that because you have a headache maybe he said in a weak voice i spent a long time at the peoples palace they dont eat meat there darken rahl doesnt didnt eat meat so none was served at the palace maybe i just got used to not eating meat she rubbed his back as he put his head in his hands running his fingers through his hair first cheese and now meat his eating habits were becoming as peculiar as a wizards kahlan im sorry but i need to go somewhere where its quiet my head really hurts she put her hand on his forehead his skin was cold and clammy he looked about ready to fall over her insides fluttered with worry kahlan squatted in front of the bird man richard doesnt feel well he needs to go somewhere quiet is that all right at first he thought he knew why they wanted to leave his smile faded when he saw the anxiety on her face take him to the spirit house it is quiet there no one will bother him get nissel if you think there be need a little of his smile came back maybe he has spent too much time on the dragon i thank the spirits my gift of flight was short she nodded unable to manage much of a smile and said a quick good night to the others picking up both their packs she put a hand under richards arm and helped him to his feet his eyes were squeezed shut his eyebrows wrinkled together in pain the pain seemed to pass a little and he opened his eyes took a deep breath and started off with her across the open area the shadows were thick among the buildings but the moon was up giving them enough light to see their way the sounds of the feast faded into the background leaving only the slow scrape of richards boots scuffing on the dry ground he straightened a little i think some of it has passed do you get headaches often he smiled over to her in the moonlight im famous for my headaches my father told me that my mother used to get headaches like the ones i get where you feel sick to your stomach because your head hurts so much but this one is different ive never had ones like this before its like something inside my head is trying to get out he took his pack from her and hoisted it to his shoulder it hurts more than my other headaches they passed from the narrow passageways to the wide space around the spirit house it sat by itself moonlight reflecting off the tile roof richard had helped the mud people build wisps of smoke rose from the chimney around the side by the door a row of chickens roosted on a low wall they watched as she pulled the door open for him starting a little at the squeak of the hinges and settled down as the two of them passed inside richard flopped down in front of the fireplace kahlan pulled out a blanket and made him lie back bunching the blanket under his head he rested the back of his wrist over his eyes as she sat crosslegged next to him kahlan felt helpless i think i should go get nissel maybe a healer can do something for you he shook his head ill be all right i just need to be away from all the noise he smiled his arm still over his eyes have you ever noticed how badly we do at parties every time we are at a party something happens kahlan thought back to every gathering they had been at together i think youre right she rubbed a hand on his chest i think the only solution is for us to be alone richard kissed her hand i would like that she enfolded his big hand in both of hers wanting to feel the warmth of him as she watched him rest it was dead quiet in the spirit house except for the slow crackling of the fire she listened to his slow steady breathing after a while he slid his hand away and looked up at her firelight reflected in his eyes there was something about his face his eyes something her mind was trying to tell her he looked like someone else she had met but who a name whispered in the back of her thoughts but she couldnt quite hear it she stroked his hair back off his forehead his skin didnt feel quite so cold he sat up i just thought of something i asked the elders for permission to marry you but i havent really asked you kahlan smiled no you havent suddenly he looked embarrassed and unsure of himself his eyes wandered a little that was really stupid im sorry that wasnt the right way to do it i hope youre not angry i guess im not very good at this ive never done it before me neither and i guess this isnt the most romantic place to do it it should be someplace beautiful wherever you are is the most romantic place in the world to me and i guess i must look pretty silly asking you something like this when im lying here with a headache if you dont ask me pretty soon richard cypher she whispered im going to choke it out of you his eyes finally found hers found hers so intently it nearly took her breath away kahlan amnell will you marry me quite unexpectedly she found she couldnt speak she closed her eyes and kissed his soft lips as a tear rolled down her cheek his arms closed around her hugging her tight against the heat of him she pulled back breathlessly her voice at last returned yes she kissed him again please yes kahlan laid her head against his shoulder richard gently stroked her hair as she listened to his breathing and the crackle of the fire he held her tenderly and kissed the top of her head there being no need for words she felt safe in his arms kahlan let loose her pain the pain of loving him more than life itself and thinking he had been tortured to death by the mordsith before she could tell him how much she loved him the pain of having thought she could never have him because she was a confessor and her power would destroy him the hurt of how much she needed him how uncontrollably she loved him as her anguish expended itself it was replaced by her joy in what lay ahead a lifetime together the breathless excitement of it seeped into her she clutched at him wanting to melt into him wanting to be one with him kahlan smiled that was what being married to him would be being one with him as zedd had told her once like finding the other half of herself when she finally looked up there was a tear on his face she wiped the tears from her cheeks and he did the same she hoped his tears meant he had let his demons go too i love you she whispered richard pulled her tight against him his fingers traced a trail down the bumps of her spine i feel so frustrated that there arent any better words than i love you he said it doesnt seem enough for the way i feel about you im sorry there arent any better words to tell you they are words enough for me then i love you kahlan a thousand times a million times i love you forever she listened to the snap and pop of the fire and to his heart beating to her own heartbeat he rocked her gently she wanted to stay there in his arms forever suddenly the world seemed a wonderful place richard grasped her shoulders and held her away to better see her a wonderful smile spread across his face i cant believe how beautiful you are i have never seen anyone as beautiful as you he ran a hand down her hair im so glad i didnt cut your hair that time you have beautiful hair dont ever change it im a confessor remember my hair is a symbol of my power besides i cant cut it only another can do that good i would never cut it i love you the way you are power and all dont ever let anyone cut it ive liked your long hair ever since the first day i saw you in the hartland woods she smiled as she remembered that day richard had offered her help in escaping from the quads he had saved her life it seems so long ago will you miss that life being a simple carefree woods guide she smiled coquettishly and single richard grinned single not with you as my wife but a woods guide maybe a little he stared off at the fire i guess that for better or worse i am the true seeker i hold the sword of truth and the responsibilities that go with it whatever they are do you think you can be happy being the wife of the seeker i would be happy living in a tree stump if you were there with me but richard im afraid im still the mother confessor i have responsibilities too well you told me what it meant to be a confessor how when you touch someone with your power it forever destroys who they were replacing it with absolute magical devotion to you to your wishes and in that way you can have them confess the truth of their crimes or for that matter you can make them do anything you would wish but what other responsibilities do you have i guess i never told you about everything else that it means to be the mother confessor it wasnt important at the time i didnt think we could ever be together i thought we would die or even if we somehow won you would go home to westland and i would never see you again you mean the part about it meaning that you are more than a queen she nodded the central council of the midlands in aydindril is made up of representatives of the more important lands of the midlands together the central council more or less rules the midlands even though the lands are independent they still bow to the word of the central council in that way through the confederation of lands common goals are protected and peace is maintained it keeps people talking instead of fighting if one land were to attack another it would be viewed as an attack against unity against all and all would put the aggression down kings queens rulers officials merchants and others come to the central council to petition for what they want trade agreements boundary treaties accords dealing with magic an endless list of wants and wishes i understand its something like that in westland the council rules in much the same way although westland isnt nearly big enough to have kingdoms there are districts that govern themselves but are represented by councilors in hartland since my brother was a councilor and then first councilor i was around the dealings of government i saw the councilors coming from different places to ask for things being a guide i was always leading them to and from hartland i learned a lot about it from talking to them richard folded his arms so what is the mother confessors part in it well the central council rules the midlands she cleared her throat as she looked down at her hands in her lap and the mother confessor rules the central council his arms came unfolded you mean to say that you rule all the kings and queens all the lands you rule the midlands well yes in a way i guess you see not all the lands are represented on the central council some are too small like queen milenas tamarang and the mud people and a few others are lands of magic the land of the night wisps for example the mother confessor is the advocate for these lesser lands left to their own wishes the council would decide to carve up these smaller lands and they have the armies to do it easily only the mother confessor stands for those who have no voice the other problem is that these lands are often in disagreement some have been bitter adversaries for as long as anyone can remember the council is often deadlocked as rulers or their representatives each stubbornly demands his own way to the detriment of the greater interests of the midlands the mother confessor has no interest but the good of the midlands without leadership the different lands through the central council would only be interested in vying for power the mother confessor counters these parochial interests with a larger view with direction and leadership just as the mother confessor is the final arbiter of truth through her magic she is also the final arbiter of power the word of the mother confessor is law so it is you who tells all the kings and queens all the lands what to do she took one of his hands and held it i and most of the mother confessors before me let the central council decide for themselves what they wish how they want the midlands ruled but when they fail to come to agreement or to a just agreement it is to the disadvantage of those not represented only then do i step in and tell them how it shall be and they always do as you say always why she took a deep breath well they know that if they dont bow to the mother confessors leadership they will be alone and vulnerable to any stronger neighbor who craves power there would be war until the strongest among them crushed all the rest as darken rahls father panis rahl did in dhara they know that ultimately it is in their own interest to have an independent council leader who sides with no land but its not in the best interest of the strongest something other than a good heart or common sense must keep the strongest of these lands in line she nodded with a smile you understand the games of power well you are right they know that if they were bold enough to allow their ambitions a free rein i or any of the confessors could take their ruler with our magic but there is more the wizards back the mother confessor i thought wizards didnt want anything to do with power they dont exactly the threat of their intervention makes it unnecessary wizards call it the paradox of power if you have power and are ready able and willing to use it you dont need to exercise your power the lands know that if they dont work together and use the impartial leadership of the mother confessor then the wizards are always in the background ready to teach the disadvantages of being unreasonable or greedy the whole thing is a very complex interwoven relationship but what it all comes down to is that i rule the central council and if im not there to do so the weak the defenseless and the peaceful will eventually be overrun and the rest will be drawn into a war until all but the strongest are crushed richard sank back to contemplate this with a slight frown on his face she watched the firelight play on his features she could feel what he was thinking about he was remembering the way she had with only a gesture of her hand demanded that queen milena fall to her knees kiss the mother confessors hand and swear loyalty she wished she hadnt had to show him the power she wielded and how much she was feared but what she had done had been necessary some deferred only to power when necessary a leader had to show that power or be cut down when he looked up at last his face held a serious cast there is going to be trouble the wizards are all dead they killed themselves before they sent you looking for zedd the threat backing the mother confessor is gone the other confessors are all dead killed by darken rahl you are the last you have no allies there is no one to take your place if anything happens to you zedd told us to meet him in aydindril he must know this too from what i have seen of powerful people from councilors in my homeland even my own brother to queens here to darken rahl they will view you as a lone obstacle in their way if the midlands is to be kept from being torn apart the mother confessor must rule and you are going to need help you and i both must serve the truth im going to help you a sly smile parted his lips if those councilors were afraid to plot against the mother confessor or give her trouble because of the wizards wait until they meet the seeker kahlan touched her fingers to his face you are a rare person richard cypher you are with the most powerful person in the midlands yet you make me feel as if i am riding your coattails to greatness im nothing more than the one who loves you with all my heart that is the only greatness i wish to live up to richard sighed it seemed a lot simpler when it was just you and me all by ourselves in the woods and i cooked you dinner on a stick over an open fire he gave her a sidelong glance you are still going to let me cook you dinner arent you mother confessor i dont think mistress sanderholt would like that she doesnt like anyone in her kitchens you have a cook well ive never seen her cook anything come to think of it mostly she just whisks all about ruling her domain with a wooden spoon she wields like a scepter tasting food and scolding cooks assistants and scullions she is the head cook she frets something awful when i come down to the kitchens to cook mistress sanderholt begs me to take up another interest she says i scare her people she says they shake for the rest of the day whenever i come to the kitchens and ask for pots so i try not to do it too often but i do so like to cook kahlan smiled at the memory of mistress sanderholt it was long months since she had been home cooks richard muttered to himself ive never had anyone cook for me i always cooked for myself his smile returned well i guess this mistress sanderholt will be able to make a little room for me if i want to cook you something special i would wager that you will soon have her doing whatever it is you wish he squeezed her hand will you promise me one thing promise me that one day you will let me take you back to westland and show you some of the beautiful places in the hartland woods places that only i know of ive dreamed of taking you to them i would like that kahlan whispered richard leaned forward to kiss her before his lips touched hers before his arms could embrace her he winced in pain his head sagged forward against her shoulder as he moaned kahlan clasped him to her in fear then laid him back down as he clamped his arms to his head unable to breathe panic gripped her he pulled his knees up to his chest as he rolled onto his side she braced her hand on his shoulder as she leaned over him im going to get nissel ill go fast as i can he could only nod as he shook kahlan ran to the door pushing it open out into the still night she could see her ragged breaths in the frigid air as she pushed the door closed her eyes flicked over the short wall moonlight washed the top of it with a silver cast the chickens were gone a dark shape hunched still behind the wall it moved a little in the moonlight and there was a quick flash of shiny golden eyes chapter the dark thing rose up claws rasping over the top of the short wall it laughed a low cackle that sent goose bumps up her arms to the base of her neck kahlan froze breath caught in her throat the form was a black void in the pale moonlight after the brief flash the eyes had vanished into a pool of night her mind raced trying to fit what she knew with what she was seeing she wanted to run but didnt know which way toward richard or away though she couldnt see the eyes she could feel them like cold death the tiniest of sounds rose from her throat with a howling laugh the dark shape leaped to the top of the wall the heavy door crashed open behind her banging against the wall of the spirit house at the same time she heard the distinctive ring of the sword of truth being drawn in anger the black head snapped toward richard the eyes flashing golden again in the moonlight richard reached out snatching her by the arm and tossed her back through the doorway as the door rebounded from hitting the wall he kicked it shut behind himself from beyond the door kahlan heard a howling laugh and then there was a crash against the door she came to her feet pulling her knife through the door she could hear the sword tip whistle and bodies thudding against the wall of the spirit house she could hear the screaming howls of laughter kahlan threw her shoulder against the door and rolled out into the night as she sprang to her feet she saw a small dark form hurtling toward her she slashed with her knife and missed it came again but before it was on her richard kicked it slamming it back against the short wall in the moonlight the sword of truth flashed toward the shadow the blade caught only the wall a shower of mudbrick fragments and plaster exploded into the air the thing howled in laughter richard snatched her back just as the dark shape flew past she caught it with her blade ripping through something hard bone hard a claw flashed past her face the sword following missing she could hear richard panting as he searched the darkness the shadow came out of nowhere and knocked him to the ground dark forms tumbled across the dirt she couldnt tell which was richard and which was the attacker claws flung dirt into the air as it flailed at him with a grunt richard heaved it over the wall instantly it sprang to the top and stood there eyes flashing golden in the moonlight cackling that awful laugh as the two of them backed away it fell silent as it watched them walking backward the air was suddenly alive with the zip of arrows within the space of a heartbeat a dozen thudded into the black body not one missed a breath later an equal number followed the thing panted in laughter it stood on the wall looking like a black pincushion kahlans jaw dropped as she saw it snap off a handful of arrows that stuck out of its chest the thing snarled a cackling laugh at them then blinked as it watched them backing away she couldnt understand why it just stood there another flight of arrows thudded into the black body it paid no attention but dropped from the wall to the ground a dark figure ran forward spear in hand from the shadow of the wall the thing sprang at the runner the hunter let the spear fly with impossible speed the black form ducked to the side and with its teeth snatched the spear from the air laughing it bit the shaft in half the hunter who had thrown it backed away and the thing seemed to lose interest turning to again watch her and richard what in the world is it doing richard whispered why did it stop why is it just watching us with a cold shock she knew its a screeling kahlan whispered more to herself than to him oh dear spirits protect us its a screeling she and richard were clutching each others shirtsleeves as they walked backward watching the screeling get away she yelled at the hunters walk dont run they answered with another useless flight of arrows this way richard said between the buildings where its dark richard that thing can see better in the dark than we can see in the light its from the underworld he kept his eyes on the screeling standing in the open in the moonlight im listening what else can we do she shook her head i dont know but dont run and dont stand still that attracts its attention i think the only way to kill it may be to hack it apart he looked over to her his eyes angry in the moonlight what do you think ive been trying to do kahlan looked around at the small passageway they were entering maybe we should go through here after all maybe it will stay there and we can get away if not at least we can lead it away from the others the screeling watched them backing away and then started loping after them panting a wicked laugh nothing is ever easy richard muttered they backed through the narrow passageway of smooth plastered walls the screeling following kahlan could see the dark knot of hunters following it in could feel the pounding of her heart i wanted you to stay in the spirit house why didnt you stay there where you were safe she recognized the tone of rage from the swords magic her hand holding his shirtsleeve felt wet and warm she looked over and saw blood running down his arm over her hand because i love you you big ox and dont you dare do anything like that again if we get out of this alive im going to put you over my knee they kept backing down the twisting passageway if we get out of this alive i will let you what happened to your headache richard shook his head i dont know one second i could hardly breathe and the next it was gone as soon as it was gone i could feel that thing on the other side of the door and i heard it make that awful laugh maybe you just thought you could sense it because you heard it i dont know that could be but it was the strangest feeling she pulled him by his shirtsleeve down a side passage it was darker moonlight fell high up on a wall to their left with a start she saw the dark shape of the screeling skittering across the moonlit wall like some huge black bug kahlan had to force herself to draw a breath how can it do that richard whispered she had no answer behind them torches appeared hunters were closing in around them trying to bottle up the attacker richard looked around if these people try to get this thing its going to kill the lot of them they stepped into a moonlit intersection of passageways kahlan i cant let that happen he looked to his right down toward a group of hunters coming with torches go to those men get behind them richard im not leaving he shoved her do as i say now his tone made her jump involuntarily she backed away richard stood still in the moonlight holding the sword in both hands the tip resting on the ground he looked up at the screeling hanging on the wall it howled a laugh as if suddenly recognizing the figure standing before it the screeling let go with its claws dropping straight down landing in the darkness with a thud kahlan could see the angry set of richards jaw as he watched the blur racing toward him kicking up a cloud of dust the swords tip stayed on the ground this cant be happening she thought it just cant not when everything is finally right this thing could kill him it could really kill him it could be the end of everything the thought stopped her breath her confessors blood rage roared to the surface her flesh tingled the screeling sprang into the air toward richard the sword tip snapped upward impaling the dark flailing form she could see a good foot and a half of steel sticking from its back glinting in the moonlight the screeling again howled its terrible laughter it clawed at the sword pulling itself up by the blade toward richard it severed some of its own clawed fingers as it clutched at the blade thrashing ahead richard gave the sword a mighty swing the screeling slid off slamming against the wall without pause it sprang for him again already richard was swinging the sword kahlan felt a rush of panicked anger without even realizing what she was doing she had her arm up her fist toward the thing trying to kill richard the man she loved the only man she would ever love the screeling was nearly upon him the sword completing its swing kahlan felt the power surge through her in a choking rush she released it eerie blue light exploded from her fist rending the night with a blinding flash of blue daylight the sword and the bolt of blue lightning hit the screeling at the same time the screeling burst apart in a shower of bloodless black pieces kahlan had seen the sword of truth do the same thing to living flesh she didnt know if it was the sword or the blue lightning that had done it this time the crack of thunder from the bolt left her ears ringing in the sudden silence she ran to richard and threw her arms around him as he hunched panting are you all right he hugged her with his free hand nodding she held him for a long minute as shouting hunters with torches circled around them richard slid the sword back into its scabbard in the torchlight she could see a ragged gash on his upper arm she tore off a strip of his shirtsleeve and tied it around the bleeding wound she looked around at the hunters all of whom held either nocked arrows or spears is everyone safe chandalen stepped into the torchlight and spoke to kahlan i knew you would bring trouble she peered hard at his face then merely thanked him and his men for trying to help kahlan what was that thing and what in the world did you do richard was slumping she slipped her arm around his waist i think its called a screeling and im not entirely sure what i did a screeling what is a his hands came to the sides of his head as his eyes winced shut he sank to his knees kahlan wasnt able to hold his weight savidlin was there and reached for him but before he could get an arm around him richard fell forward on his face he cried out in the dirt savidlin help me get him back to the spirit house and send someone for nissel please tell them to hurry savidlin shouted for one of his men to run for the healer he and some of the others lifted richard leaning on his spear chandalen only watched a torchlit procession wound its way back to the spirit house savidlin and the men carrying richard went inside with kahlan they laid richard in front of the fire lowering his head to the blanket savidlin sent his men out but stayed with her kahlan knelt next to richard and with trembling hands felt his forehead he was ice cold and drenched in sweat he appeared to be nearly unconscious she bit her lip and tried not to cry nissel will make him well savidlin said you will see she is a good healer she will know what to do kahlan could only nod richard mumbled incoherently as his head twisted about as if seeking some position that brought no pain they sat in silence until savidlin asked mother confessor what was that you did how did you make lightning im not sure how i did it but it is part of the confessors magic it is called the con dar savidlin studied her a moment as he squatted on his feet with his sinewy arms wrapped around his knees i never knew a confessor could call down lightning she glanced over i have known for only a few days myself and what was the dark thing i think it may be a creature from the underworld from the place the shadows came from before kahlan nodded why would it come now im sorry savidlin i dont have an answer but if any more come tell the people to walk away from them dont stand still and dont run just walk away and come get me in silence he contemplated what she had said at last the door squeaked open and a stooped figure flanked by two men with torches entered kahlan sprang up and ran to her taking her hand nissel thank you for coming nissel smiled and patted her shoulder how is the arm mother confessor healed thanks to you nissel something is wrong with richard he has terrible headaches nissel smiled yes child we will have a look at him one of the men with nissel handed her a cloth bag as she knelt beside richard the objects in the bag clinked against one other as she set it on the ground she told the man to bring the torch around she took off the bloody bandage and with her thumbs pressed open the wound nissel glanced to richards face to see if he felt it he didnt i will tend to the wound first while he sleeps she cleaned the gash and stitched it while kahlan and the three men watched in silence the torches spit and hissed lighting the inside of the nearly empty spirit house with harsh flickering light on the shelf the skulls of ancestors watched along with the rest of them sometimes talking to herself as she worked nissel finished sewing packed the wound with a poultice that smelled of pine pitch and wrapped the arm with a clean bandage rummaging around in her bag she told the men they could leave as he went past savidlin touched kahlans shoulder sympathetically and told her he would see them in the morning after they were gone nissel halted her pawing in the bag and looked up at kahlan i hear you are to be mated to this one kahlan nodded i thought you couldnt have a love because you are a confessor that your power would take him when you make babies kahlan smiled across richard to the old woman richard is special he has magic that protects him from my power they both had promised zedd they would never reveal the truth that it was his love for her that protected him nissel smiled and her weathered hand touched kahlans arm i am happy for you child she bent back to her bag and finally pulled out a handful of little stoppered pottery bottles does he get these headaches often he told me he gets bad headaches sometimes but that this is different that it hurts more like something is trying to get out of his head he said he has never had any like it before do you think you can help him we will see pulling stoppers she waved the bottles one at a time under his nose one of them finally brought richard awake nissel smelled the bottle herself to see what it was she nodded and mumbled and went back into her bag whats going on richard groaned kahlan bent over and kissed his forehead nissel is going to do something for your headaches lie still richards back arched as he squeezed his eyes shut against the pain he put his shaking fists to the sides of his head the healer pressed his chin down with her fingers forcing his mouth open and with her other hand shoved in some small leaves tell him to chew keep chewing she says to chew the leaves they will help you richard nodded and rolled to his side in agony as he chewed kahlan combed his hair back with her fingers feeling helpless wishing she could do more it terrified her to see him in pain nissel poured a liquid from a skin into a large cup and mixed into it powders from other jars she and kahlan helped richard sit up to drink the concoction when he finished he flopped back down breathing hard but still chewing the leaves nissel stood the drink will help him to sleep kahlan came to her feet and nissel handed her a small bag have him chew more of these leaves when he needs them they will help the pain kahlan hunched over a little so as not to tower over the old woman quite so much nissel do you know what is wrong nissel pulled the stopper from the little bottle and sniffed it then held it under kahlans nose it smelled of lilacs and licorice spirit she said simply spirit what do you mean it is a sickness of his spirit not of his blood not of his balance not of his air spirit kahlan didnt know what any of that meant but it wasnt really what she wanted to know will he be all right will the medicine and the leaves will they cure him nissel smiled and patted kahlans arm i would like very much to be there when you are wed i will not give up if this doesnt work there are other things to try kahlan took her arm and walked her out the door thank you nissel kahlan saw chandalen standing near the short wall some of his men stood farther off in the darkness prindin was close against the spirit house she went to him would you escort nissel home please of course he took the healers arm respectfully and guided her into the night kahlan shared a long look with chandalen and then went over to him i appreciate you and your men guarding us thank you he regarded her without emotion i am not standing guard for you i am guarding our people from you from what you may bring next kahlan brushed dirt from her shoulders either way if something else comes dont try to kill it yourself i dont want any mud people to die that includes you if something comes you must not stand still or run if you do it will kill you you must walk come and get me dont try to fight it by yourselves understand come and get me he still showed no emotion and you will call down more lightning she looked at him coolly if i have to she wondered if she could she had no idea how she had done it richard with the temper is not well he may not be able to shoot arrows with you and your men tomorrow he looked smug i thought he would think of an excuse to back out kahlan took a deep breath through gritted teeth she didnt want to stand here and trade insults with this fool she wanted to go back inside to be with richard goodnight chandalen richard was still on his back chewing the leaves she sat beside him heartened to see that he looked more alert these things are starting to taste better kahlan stroked his forehead how do you feel a little better the pain comes and goes i think these leaves are helping except they are making my head spin but better to spin than to pound yes he put his hand on her arm and closed his eyes who were you talking to that fool chandalen hes guarding the spirit house he thinks we may bring more trouble maybe hes not such a fool i dont think that thing would have been here without us what did you call it a screeling and what is a screeling im not sure nobody i know has ever seen one but ive heard them described theyre supposed to be from the underworld richard stopped chewing and opened his eyes to look at her the underworld what do you know about this screeling thing not much she frowned have you ever seen zedd drunk zedd never he doesnt like wine just food he says that drinking interferes with thinking and there is nothing more important than thinking richard smiled he says that the worse a man is at thinking the better he is at drinking well wizards can get pretty scary when theyre drunk one time when i was little i was in the keep studying my languages they have books of languages there anyway i was studying and four of the wizards were reading a book of prophecy together it was a book i had never seen before they were leaning over it and started getting all worked up they were talking in hushed tones i could tell they were frightened at the time it was a lot more fun to watch wizards than to read my languages i looked up and they had all turned white as snow they all stood up straight at the same time and flipped the cover shut i remember it banged and made me jump they all stood there quiet for a while and then one went away and came back with a bottle without saying a word he passed out cups and poured out the drink they all drank it down in one swallow he poured more and they did the same thing again they sat down on stools around the table the big book was on and kept drinking until the bottle was empty by that time they were pretty happy and drunk they were laughing and singing i thought it was tremendously interesting i had never seen anything like it they finally saw me watching them and called me over i didnt really want to go but they were wizards and i knew them pretty well so i wasnt afraid and i went over to them one set me up on his knee and asked if i wanted to sing with them i told them that i didnt know the song they were singing they looked at each other and then said they would teach me so we sat there for a long time and they taught me the song so do you remember it kahlan nodded ive never forgotten that song she rearranged herself a little and then sang it for him the screelings are loose and the keeper may win his assassins have come to rip off your skin golden eyes will see you if you try to run the screelings will get you and laugh like its fun walk away slow or theyll tear you apart and laugh all day long as they rip out your heart golden eyes will see you if you try to stand still the screelings will get you for the keeper they kill hack em up chop em up cut em to bits or else they will get you while laughing in fits if the screelings dont get you the keeper will try to reach out and touch you your skin he will fry your mind he will flail your soul he will take youll sleep with the dead for life youll forsake youll die with the keeper till the end of time he hates that you live your life is the crime the screelings might get you it says so in text if screelings dont get you the keeper is next lest he whos born true can fight for lifes bond and that one is marked hes the pebble in the pond richard stared at her when she finished pretty gruesome song to teach a child finally he resumed chewing the leaves kahlan nodded with a sigh that night i had terrible nightmares my mother came into my room and sat on my bed she hugged me and asked what i was having nightmares about i sang her the song the wizards had taught me she climbed into my bed and stayed with me that night the next day she went to see the wizards i never knew what she did or said to them but for the next few months whenever they saw her coming they turned and hurried off the other way and for a good long time they avoided me like death itself richard took another leaf from the little bag and put it in his mouth the screelings are sent by the keeper the keeper of the underworld thats what the song says it must be true how could anything of this world take that many arrows and just laugh richard thought in silence a moment what is the pebble in the pond kahlan shrugged ive never heard of it before or since what about the blue lightning how did you do that its something to do with the con dar i did it before when it came over me the first time she took a deep breath at the memory when i thought you were dead id never felt the con dar before but now i feel it there all the time just as i can always feel the confessors magic the two are somehow connected i must have awakened it i think its what adie warned me about that time we were with her but richard i dont know how i did it richard smiled you never fail to amaze me if i just found out i could call down lightning i dont think i would be sitting there so calmly well you just remember what i can do she warned if some pretty girl ever bats her lashes at you he took her hand there are no other pretty girls the fingers of her other hand combed through his hair is there anything i can do for you yes he whispered lie down next to me i want you close im afraid of never waking and i want to be close to you you will wake she promised cheerfully she took out another blanket and pulled it over the two of them she cuddled close her head on his shoulder and an arm over his chest and tried not to worry about what he had said chapter when she woke her back was against the warmth of him light was seeping in around the edges of the door she sat up rubbed the sleep from her eyes and looked down at richard he lay on his back staring up at the ceiling taking slow shallow breaths she smiled at the familiar pleasure of his face he was so handsome it made her ache suddenly she realized with a jolt what it was about him that looked so familiar to her richard looked like darken rahl not the same kind of impossible perfection the flawlessly smooth uninterrupted sweep of features that were too exactly right like some precisely perfect statue but more rugged rougher more real before theyd defeated rahl when shota the witch woman had appeared to them as richards mother kahlan had seen her looks in richards nose and mouth it was as if richard had darken rahls face with some of his mothers features making it better than rahls cruel perfection rahls hair was fine straight and blond while richards was coarser and darker and richards eyes were gray instead of rahls blue but they both possessed the same penetrating intensity the same kind of raptors gaze that seemed as if it could cut steel though she didnt know how it could be possible she knew richard had rahl blood but darken rahl was from dhara and richard from westland that was about as far apart as you could get it must be she finally decided a connection in the distant past richard was still staring at the ceiling she put her hand on his shoulder giving it a squeeze how is your head richard jumped hard he looked around and blinked at her he rubbed his eyes what i was asleep what did you say kahlan frowned you werent asleep yes i was sound asleep kahlan felt a flutter of apprehension your eyes were wide open i was watching you she left unsaid that as far as she knew only wizards slept with their eyes open really he looked around where are those leaves here does it still hurt bad yes he sat up but its been worse he put some of the leaves in his mouth and ran his fingers through his hair at least i can talk he smiled at her and i can smile without my face feeling like its going to break maybe you shouldnt go shoot arrows today if you dont feel well enough savidlin said i couldnt back out im not going to let him down besides i really want to see this bow he made for me its been well i dont even remember how long its been since i shot a bow after he chewed some of nissels leaves for a while they folded up the blankets and went looking for savidlin they found him at his home listening to siddin telling stories of what it was like to ride a dragon savidlin liked listening to stories even though it was a little boy telling them he listened with the same interest he would accord a hunter returning from a journey kahlan noted with pride that the little boy was giving a remarkably accurate rendition without fanciful embellishment siddin wanted to know if he could have a dragon for a pet savidlin told him the red dragon was not a pet but a friend to their people he told him to find a red chicken and he could have that weselan was cooking a pot of some sort of porridge with eggs mixed in she asked richard and kahlan to join them and passed each a bowl as they sat on a skin on the floor she gave them flat tava bread to fold and use as a scoop for the porridge richard had her ask savidlin if he had a drill of any kind savidlin leaned way back and with a finger and thumb pulled a thin rod from a pouch beneath a bench he handed the rod to richard who had the dragons tooth out richard turned the rod around with a puzzled look put it at the base of the tooth and twisted it experimentally savidlin laughed you want a hole in that richard nodded savidlin held out his hand give it to me i will show you how it is done savidlin used his knifepoint to start a small hole and then held the tooth between his feet as he sat on the floor he placed a few grains of sand in the hole followed by the rod he spat in his palms and then spun the rod back and forth rapidly between his hands stopping occasionally to drop a few more grains of sand down the hole and wipe a little spittle into the opening in a little while he had drilled all the way through the tooth he used his knife to clean the burrs from where the drill went through the other side of the tooth and then held it up grinning showing off the hole richard laughed and thanked him as he strung a leather thong to the tooth he hung it around his neck with the bird mans whistle and the mordsiths agiel he was getting quite a collection some of it she didnt like wiping out his porridge bowl with a piece of tava bread savidlin asked is your head better its better but still hurts something fierce nissels leaves help im embarrassed i had to be carried back last night savidlin laughed one time i had a bad hurt here he pointed at a round scar in his side i was carried home by women he leaned closer and lifted an eyebrow women weselan cast a disapproving eye toward him he made a point of not noticing when my men found out i was carried home by women they had a good laugh over it he put the last of the tava bread in his mouth and chewed for a few minutes then i told them which women carried me home and they stopped laughing and wanted to know how to get a hurt like mine so they too could be carried home by those women savidlin weselan scolded in a scandalized tone she turned to them if he didnt already have a hurt i would have given him one a good one so how did you get this hurt richard asked savidlin shrugged like i told my men it was easy you just stand there like a surprised rabbit while a trespasser puts a spear through you and why didnt he finish you because i put a few tenstep arrows in him he pointed at his throat here whats a tenstep arrow savidlin reached to the side and pulled a barbed finepointed arrow from his quiver one of these see the dark stain poison tenstep poison when it sticks you you get only ten steps and then you are dead he laughed my men decided to think of a different way to get those women to carry them weselan leaned over and stuffed the rest of her tava bread in her husbands mouth she turned to kahlan men enjoy telling the most awful stories she broke into a shy smile but i worried for him until he was well i knew he was well when he came to me and made siddin then i did not worry anymore kahlan realized she had translated before she had paid attention to the meaning of the words she felt her ears burn instead of looking at richard she paid close attention to eating her porridge she was glad her hair covered her ears at least savidlin gave richard a look of a putupon male you will find that women too like to tell stories kahlan tried desperately to think of a new direction for the conversation she couldnt thankfully savidlin did he leaned back looking out the door it will soon be the time to go how do you know what time we are to go savidlin shrugged i am here you are here some of the men are here when they are all here that is the time to go savidlin went to the corner and retrieved a bow that was taller than the one kahlan had seen him use before taller for richard with the aid of his foot savidlin stretched the cord to the bow richard had a wide grin on his face he told savidlin it was the finest bow he had ever seen savidlin beamed with pride and gave him a quiver full of arrows richard tested the weight of the draw how did you know how strong to make the pull its just right savidlin pointed at his chin i remembered how strong your respect for my strength was when we first met it is too heavy for me but i estimated it was right for you kahlan stood up next to richard are you sure you want to go how does your head feel terrible but i have the leaves they help a little i think ill be all right savidlin is looking forward to this i dont want to disappoint him she rubbed her hand on his shoulder should i come with you richard kissed her forehead i dont think ill need anyone to translate to tell me how badly im being beaten and i dont think i want to give chandalens men any excuse to humiliate me any worse than they are already going to zedd told me you were pretty good in fact he told me you were better than good richard stole a look at savidlin who was stringing his own bow its been a long time since ive shot a bow zedd was just trying to stir up trouble ill bet he stole a kiss while savidlin was finishing and then went out the door with him kahlan leaned against the doorframe still feeling the print of his lips on hers as she watched him walking away showing no emotion chandalen stared up from sighting down one of his arrows prindin and tossidin flashed sly smiles they were looking forward to this richard glanced around meeting the eyes of all the men as he walked past they fell in behind him he was a good head taller than any of them they looked like a bunch of children following an adult but these children had poison arrows and some of them didnt hold any favor for richard suddenly she didnt like this weselan stood next to her watching the men go savidlin said he will watch richards back dont be concerned chandalen would not do anything foolish i worry about what chandalen considers foolish weselan wiped her hands on a cloth turning back to keep a watchful eye on siddin siddin wanted to go out and was sitting poking a finger along the ground looking dejected because his mother said she wanted him to stay inside weselan stood over him a long moment watching he looked up his chin resting in one palm she gave him a gentle snap with the cloth go outside and play weselan sighed as he tore through the door with a squeal of glee she shook her head to herself the young dont know how dear life is or how fragile maybe that is why we all wish we were young again weselan nodded maybe so a handsome smile came to her tanned face her dark eyes sparkled what color would you like to wear when you wed your man with both hands kahlan pulled her long hair back over her shoulders and thought a minute a smile welled up from within richard favors blue weselan twined her fingers together oh that would be just right then i have just the thing i have been saving it for something special she went into her small bedroom and came back with a bundle sitting on the bench next to kahlan she carefully unfolded it in her lap the cloth was finely woven a rich blue with a print of lighter blue flowers dappled across it kahlan thought it would make a gorgeous dress she tested the weave between her finger and thumb its beautiful where did you get it i traded for it she flicked her hand over her head with people from the north they like the bowls i make i traded with them for it kahlan knew fine cloth when she saw it weselan would have had to make many bowls for this cloth i wouldnt feel right using it weselan you worked hard for this it is yours weselan held up the corners of the blue fabric giving it a critical appraisal nonsense you two come here and teach our people how to make roofs that dont leak you save siddin from those shadow things and in the process rid us of an old fool and make it so savidlin can be one of the six elders he has never been so happy when siddin is carried off you find him and bring him back to us you destroy the man who would have enslaved us you two are guardians to our people what is a piece of cloth i will be proud the mother confessor of all the midlands is wedded in a dress i make me just a simple woman for you my friend from all those faraway places with all those grand things that i cannot even imagine you would not be taking something from me you would be giving me something kahlans eyes filled with tears her lower lip trembled you cant know the joy you have given me weselan to be a confessor is to be feared my whole life people have feared and shunned me no one has ever treated me as just a woman talked to me as a woman only as a confessor no one before richard ever saw me as a person no woman before you ever welcomed me into her home no woman has ever let me hold her child she wiped away some of the tears it will be the most beautiful dress i have ever worn the most treasured dress i will ever have i will wear it proud that a friend made it for me weselan gave her a sidelong look when your man sees you in this dress he will make you a child of your own kahlan laughed and cried and hugged her she had never dared to dream that all these things could happen in her life that she could ever be treated as anything but a confessor kahlan and weselan spent the better part of the morning starting the dress weselan seemed as excited about making the dress as kahlan was about wearing it the seamstresses back in aydindril had nothing over weselan with her fine bone needles they settled on a simple design fashioned something like a kirtle they had a light lunch of tava bread and chicken broth weselan said she would work on the dress later and asked what kahlan wanted to do in the afternoon kahlan said she really would like to cook something kahlan never ate meat when she was here before on official business because she knew the mud people ate human flesh ate their enemies to gain their knowledge to avoid offending them she had always used the excuse that she didnt eat meat the night before richard had reacted strangely to eating meat so kahlan didnt say anything to change the menu when weselan suggested a vegetable stew the two of them cut up tava some other rustcolored roots kahlan didnt recognize peppers beans some nutty kuru and then added greens and dried mushrooms into the big iron kettle hanging over the little fire in the corner cooking hearth weselan pushed a few sticks of hardwood into the fire as she told kahlan the men probably wouldnt be back until dark she suggested they go to the common area with the other women and bake some tava bread in the ovens i would like that kahlan said we will talk about the wedding with them talk of weddings always makes for good conversation she smiled especially when there are no men around kahlan was happy to find that the young women talked to her now in the past they had always been too shy the older women wanted to talk about the marriage the younger women wanted to talk about faraway places they wanted to know if it was really true that men followed her orders that they did as she said their eyes were wide as kahlan told them about the central council and how she protected the interests of peoples like the mud people from the threat of invasion by more powerful lands so the mud people and others in small communities could live as they wished she explained that although she was able to command people she did so only because she was the servant to all the people when they asked if she commanded armies of men in battle kahlan told them that it wasnt like that that what she did was try to help the different lands work together so there wouldnt be fighting they wanted to know how many servants she had and what sorts of fabulous dresses she had the questions were beginning to make the older women nervous and to frustrate kahlan she flopped a ball of dough down on the board sending up a little cloud of flour she looked the younger women in the eye the prettiest dress i will ever have will be the dress weselan is making me because she is doing it out of friendship and not because i commanded her to make it there is no possession to compare to friendship i would give up everything i have and live in rags and grub for roots just to have one friend that seemed to quiet the young girls and settle the older women the chatter drifted back to the subject of the wedding and kahlan was happy to let it she tried to keep out of it to let the older women lead the talk near the end of the afternoon kahlan saw a commotion across the field she saw a taller figure richard taking long strides toward savidlin and weselans home even from a distance she could tell he was angry a throng of hunters followed in his wake trotting at times to keep pace kahlan wiped her flourcovered hands on a cloth she threw the cloth on a table as she stepped off the plank floor of the shelter and jogged the distance to the men she caught them as they went down a wide passageway pushing through the hunters she finally caught up with richard just before he reached savidlins doorway chandalen was right at his heels along with savidlin chandalen had blood down his shoulder with some kind of mud pack over a wound on top he looked to be in a mood to chew rocks she grabbed richards sleeve he spun around with a hot expression that cooled a little when he saw it was her he removed his hand from the hilt of the sword richard whats wrong he glared around at the men mostly chandalen then settled his gaze back on her i need you to translate we had a little adventure this afternoon i havent been able to make them understand what happened i want to know how he could dare to try to kill me chandalen was saying over richards words whats he talking about he wants to know why you tried to kill him kill him i saved his fool life dont ask me why i should have let him get killed the next time i will he ran his fingers through his hair my head is killing me chandalen pointed angrily at the wound on the top of his shoulder you did this deliberately i saw how you shoot it could not have been an accident richard threw his hands in the air idiot he said to the sky he lowered his glare to chandalens fierce eyes yes you saw me shoot do you have any doubt that if i wanted to kill you you would not be breathing right now of course i did it deliberately it was the only way to save you he reached over her shoulder putting his hand close to chandalens face holding his first finger and thumb half an inch apart this is all the room i had at the most if i didnt take it you would be dead what do you mean chandalen demanded kahlan put a hand on his arm calm down richard just tell us what happened he couldnt understand me none of them could i couldnt explain it to them he looked at her in frustration i killed a man today what she whispered you killed one of chandalens men no thats not what theyre angry about theyre happy i killed him i was saving chandalens life but they think she collected herself just calm down i will explain your words to them richard nodded and rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands he looked down at the ground as he combed the fingers of both hands through his hair he looked back up im only going to explain this once chandalen if you cant get it through your thick head then we are going to stand at opposite ends of the village and shoot arrows at each other until we cant argue anymore and i will only need one arrow chandalen lifted an eyebrow and folded his muscular arms so explain richard took a deep breath you were standing a long way off for some reason i knew he was there behind you i spun around all i could see of him here like this he grabbed kahlan by her shoulders and turned her around facing chandalen he held her shoulders and ducked down behind her like this i couldnt see any of him but the top of his head he had his spear ready in one second more he would have put it through your back i had only one chance to keep him from killing you only one chance i couldnt see enough of him there was nothing else to shoot at from where i was only the very top of his head the top of his forehead sloped back if i hit it too high the arrow would have deflected off and he would have killed you the only way to stop him to kill him was to let the arrow nick the top of your shoulder he held his finger and thumb half an inch apart again this is all i had if i put the arrow that much lower your bone would have deflected the arrow and he would have had you if i would have put it that much higher just enough not to nick you he would have lived and you would be dead i knew savidlins bladed arrow could pass through a little of your flesh and allow me to kill him there was no time for anything else i had to shoot instantly i think a dozen stitches is a light price to pay for your life chandalens eyes looked a little less sure how do i know you are telling the truth richard shook his head muttering he suddenly thought of something he snatched a cloth sack from one of chandalens men he thrust his hand in the sack and pulled out a head lifting it by bloodsoaked matted hair kahlan gasped she put a hand over her mouth as she turned away but before she did she saw an arrow jutting from the center of the forehead the blade end sticking from the back of the head richard held the head behind chandalens shoulder and laid the feathers of the shaft on his shoulder next to the wound this is all i saw if it were not as i say if he had been standing straighter and i put the arrow where i did it would not have touched you the hunters all started nodding and whispering among themselves chandalen looked down at the shaft of the arrow lying on his shoulder he looked back at the head he thought about it a minute and then unfolded his arms and took the head stuffing it back in the sack i have been stitched before a few more will not hurt me i will take your words as true this time richard put his fists on his hips as he watched chandalen and his men walking away youre welcome he called after them kahlan didnt translate that why do they have that head dont ask me it wasnt my idea and you dont want to know what they did with the rest of him richard that seems a risky shot to me how far were you when you shot that arrow the heat left his voice not risky at all believe me and i was at least a hundred paces you can shoot an arrow that accurately at a hundred paces he sighed im afraid i could have done it at twice that distance three times that distance he looked down at the blood on his hands i have to go wash this off kahlan in about two minutes my head is going to explode i have to sit down could you please go get nissel yelling at that idiot was the only thing keeping me on my feet she put a hand on his arm of course go on inside ill go get her i think savidlin is angry with me too please tell him that im sorry i ruined so many of his arrows she frowned as richard went inside closing the door savidlin looked as if he was about to speak to her she took him by the arm richard needs nissel come with me and tell me what happened savidlin cast a glance over his shoulder at the door to his home as they hurried away richard with the temper seems to be living up to his name he is upset because he killed a man it is not an easy thing to live with he didnt tell you all of the story there was more to it so tell me he looked over with a grave expression we were shooting chandalen was angry because of the shots richard was making he said richard was a demon and went off and stood in the tall grass by himself the rest of us were standing off to the other side watching richard shoot the things he was doing did not seem possible he nocked an arrow suddenly he spun around toward chandalen before we could even shout richard shot an arrow at chandalen as he stood there with his arms folded he had no weapon in his hand none of us could believe richard would do this as the arrow was still flying toward chandalen two of his men who had arrows nocked drew their bows the first one shot a tenstep arrow at richard before his own arrow even reached chandalen kahlan was incredulous he shot at richard and missed chandalens men dont miss savidlins voice was low and trembled slightly he would not have missed but richard spun pulling his last arrow from his quiver a bladed arrow and shot i have never seen anyone do such a thing so fast he hesitated as if he didnt think she would believe him richards bladed arrow met the other in the air and split it in half each half went to one side of richard kahlan halted savidlin with a hand on his arm richard hit the other arrow while it was in the air he nodded slowly and then the other man shot richard had no more arrows he stood his bow in one hand and waited it too was a tenstep arrow i could hear it ripping the air savidlin looked around as if not wanting anyone else to hear richard snatched it right out of the air with his hand he had his fist around its middle he put the mans arrow in his own bow and drew it on chandalens men he was yelling at them we couldnt understand his words but they dropped their bows on the ground and put their arms out to the sides to show him their empty hands we all thought richard with the temper had become crazy we thought he might kill us all we were all very afraid then prindin called out he had found the man behind chandalen we all saw then that richard had killed a trespasser who was armed with a spear we realized richard had been trying to kill the invader not chandalen chandalen though was not so certain he thought richard cut him with his arrow on purpose chandalen became even angrier when his men all went and gave richard slaps of respect kahlan stared at him she couldnt believe the things she was hearing most of it sounded impossible richard wanted me to tell you he was sorry he ruined your arrows what was he talking about do you know what a shaft shot is kahlan nodded its when you shoot an arrow through another already in the center of the target and split the shaft of the first the home guard in aydindril gave ribbons for doing it i have seen a few men with a half dozen ribbons i knew one with ten savidlin reached around and pulled a fat bundle from his quiver every arrow was split it would be easier to give richard with the temper a ribbon if he ever missed he would have no ribbons he ruined over a hundred arrows today arrows take time to make they are not to be wasted but the men kept wanting him to do it again because they had never seen anything like it before one time he put six arrows through the first one right on top of the other we shot rabbits and cooked them over a fire richard sat with us and then when we started eating he wouldnt eat with us he looked sick and went off and shot arrows by himself until we were finished later after we ate is when he killed the man she nodded we better hurry and get nissel she glanced over as they walked along savidlin why did those men have that head how can they be so gruesome did you see that there was black painted over the eyes of the dead man that was to hide him from our spirits so he could sneak up on us a man who comes onto our land with black over his eyes comes for only one reason to kill chandalens men put the heads of men like that on poles at the edge of our land to warn others who would paint black on their eyes it may seem gruesome to you but in the end it makes for much less killing do not think less of chandalens men for taking a head they do it today not because they like it but so there will be less killing tomorrow kahlan suddenly felt foolish i guess that just as chandalen i am guilty of judging too quickly forgive me elder savidlin for thinking things about your people that were wrong he gave her a onearm hug around her shoulders when they came back with the healer they found richard huddled in a corner his fingers intertwined over his head his skin was white cold and wet nissel gave him something to drink after a few minutes she gave him a small cube of something to swallow richard smiled when he saw it he must have known what it was nissel sat on the floor next to him and felt his pulse for a long time when a little of his color came back she made him put his head back and open his mouth she twisted a clove of something over his mouth dripping the juice in he made a face nissel smiled at that without comment she turned to kahlan i think these things will help him tell him to keep chewing the leaves come get me if he needs me nissel is he going to get better soon shouldnt he be getting better the stooped old woman glanced down at richard spirit has a mind of its own it doesnt always listen i think his does not want to listen she suddenly brightened at seeing the stricken look on kahlans face dont worry child i can make even the spirit listen kahlan nodded nissel gave her a warm smile and a pat on the arm before she went on her way richard looked up at kahlan and savidlin did you tell him did you tell him im sorry about ruining all his arrows kahlan smiled a little to savidlin he is worried about ruining so many arrows savidlin grunted it is my own fault i made your bow too good richard managed a laugh weselan is off making bread i must go see to some things rest well we will be back when it is time to eat we will eat together it smells like my wife has made some good stew after savidlin left kahlan sat on the floor tight against him richard what happened today savidlin told me how you shot arrows today you havent always been that good have you he wiped sweat off his brow with the back of his hand no ive split arrows before but not more than a half dozen in one day youve shot that many in one day before he nodded on a good day when i can feel the target but today was different how well we went out on the plain and my head was really starting to hurt the men set up targets of bundled grass i didnt think i would even be able to hit a target because my head hurt so much but i didnt want to disappoint savidlin so i tried anyway when i shoot i call the target to me what do you mean you call the target to you richard shrugged i dont know i used to think everyone did it when they shot but zedd told me they dont i look at the target and just sort of pull it to me when im doing it right it blocks out everything else its only me and the target as if it comes closer somehow i know exactly how the arrow must be held to hit the target when im doing it right i can feel that the arrow is in the right place before i release the bowstring when i learned that i always hit the target when i had that certain feeling i quit shooting arrows i would just aim trying to bring on the correct feel i knew when i had it i wouldnt miss so i didnt bother shooting i would nock another arrow and try for the feel again over time i learned to do it more often how was it different today well like i said my head really hurt i watched some of the other men shoot they were very good savidlin started slapping me on the back so i knew it was my turn i figured i might as well get it over my head felt as if it was going to split open i drew the bow and called the target to me richard ran his fingers through his hair i dont know how to explain it i called the target and instantly my headache was gone no pain at all the target came to me as it never had before it felt like there was a notch in the air where i needed only to lay the arrow i have never felt it so strongly before it was as if the target was huge i knew it would be impossible to miss after a while just for variation instead of splitting the arrows already there i would just shave off the red outside feather when i did that the men thought i had missed splitting the arrow already there they had no idea i was doing something more difficult and your headache was completely gone he nodded do you have any idea why all this was happening richard pulled his knees up and rested his forearms on them he looked away from her face im afraid i do it was magic magic kahlan whispered what do you mean his eyes came back to her kahlan i dont know what your magic feels like inside you but i have felt magic every time i draw the sword of truth magic flows into me becomes part of me i know what that magic feels like ive felt it often enough and in different ways depending on how i use it but because i have joined with the sword i can sense the magic from it even as it sits in its scabbard on my hip now i can call forth its magic without even having to draw the sword i can sense it like a dog at my heel ready to jump for me today when i drew the bow and called the target i also called something else magic when zedd touched me before to heal me and when you touched me when you were in the con dar i felt the magic this was something like that i knew it was magic it felt different from yours and zedds but i recognized the texture of magic i could feel the life of it like a second breath alive richard put a fist in the center of his chest i could feel it coming from inside me building until i released it to call the target kahlan recognized in herself the feelings he was describing maybe it has something to do with the sword he shook his head i dont know i suppose it could be but i couldnt control it after a while it simply went away like a candle blown out in the wind it felt like suddenly being in darkness as if i was suddenly blind and the headache came back i couldnt hit the target and i couldnt call it to me so i just let the others shoot the magic would come and go i could never tell when it was going to happen then when the men started eating meat i felt sick and had to go away from them i shot while they ate and sometimes i could summon the magic and the headache would go away what about when you caught the arrow out of the air he cast her a sidelong glance savidlin told you about that did he she nodded richard let out a deep breath that was the strangest of all i dont know how to explain it somehow i made the air thicker she leaned closer studying his face made the air thicker he nodded again i knew i had to slow the arrow down and the only thing i could think of was that if the air was thick like it was those times with the sword when the air got thick and stopped the sword then maybe i had a chance otherwise i was going to die it just all came into my head at once the idea and the doing instantly i have no clue as to what i did i just had the thought and i saw my hand snatch the arrow out of the air he fell silent kahlan rubbed her thumb on the side of her boot heel she didnt know what to say fear was nibbling at the fringes of her mind she flicked her eyes up for a glance at him he was staring off into space richard she whispered i love you his answer was a long moment in coming i love you too he turned to her kahlan im afraid of what something is going on a screeling shows up i have these headaches you call down lightning i do what i did today the only thing i can think to do is to go to aydindril and find zedd all these things have something to do with magic she didnt think he was necessarily wrong but put some other answers to them anyway me calling down the lightning has to do with my magic not you though i dont know how i did it i did it to protect you the screeling i think is from the underworld that has nothing to do with us it is just something evil the magic with you today well that could have something to do with the magic from the sword i just dont know and the headaches i dont know she admitted at last kahlan the headaches might kill me i dont know how i know that but i know its true its not just a simple headache its something else i dont know what richard please dont say that youre scaring me scares me too one reason i was angry at chandalen was because i fear he may be right about me about me bringing trouble maybe we should start thinking about getting out of here getting to zedd and what about the headaches much of the time i cant even stand i cant stop every ten paces to shoot an arrow she swallowed past the lump in her throat maybe nissel can find an answer he shook his head she can help only a little and only for a time soon i dont think she is going to be able to do anything im afraid i might die kahlan started crying richard leaned back against the wall put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her against him he started to say something else but she put her fingers over his lips she pressed her face against him as she cried clutching at his shirt it seemed as if everything was slowly starting to unravel he held her and let her cry kahlan began to realize she was being selfish it was him these things were happening to he was the one in pain in danger she should be comforting him not the other way around richard cypher if you think this is going to get you out of marrying me you had better think again kahlan im not i swear she smiled and gently touched his cheek as she kissed him i know richard weve solved problems a lot bigger than this one we will figure it out i promise we have to weselan has already started my dress richard put some of nissels leaves in his mouth really i bet you are going to look beautiful in it well if you want to find out you are just going to have to marry me yes maam savidlin weselan and siddin returned a short time later richard had closed his eyes and rested as he chewed the leaves and he said his head felt a little better siddin was excited he was a local celebrity having ridden on a dragon he had spent the better part of the day telling other children what it had been like now he wanted to sit in kahlans lap and tell her about how he had been the center of attention she listened with a smile while they all ate stew and tava bread like her richard didnt want any cheese savidlin offered him a piece of smoked meat richard politely declined as they were finishing their meal a grimfaced bird man ringed by men with spears showed up at the door everyone set their bowls down and stood kahlan didnt like the look on his face richard stepped forward what is it whats happened the bird man took in everyone with a sweep of his eyes three women strangers have come on horses kahlan wondered why three women would bring men with spears around the bird man what do they want they are difficult to understand they speak only a little of our language i believe they want richard they seemed to say they want richard and they want to see his parents my parents are you sure i think that is what they were trying to say they said for you not to try to run any more that they have come for you and you must not run they told me i must not interfere richard unconsciously loosened his sword in its scabbard his brow taking on a hawklike set where are they i had them wait in the spirit house kahlan hooked some hair behind her ear did they say who they are the bird mans long silver hair gleamed in the light of the setting sun coming from behind him they called themselves the sisters of the light kahlans breath caught in her throat goose bumps rippled up her arms her insides felt as if they had been twisted into an icy knot she couldnt make her eyes blink chapter richard frowned well who are they what did he say still she couldnt make her eyes blink she could only manage a whisper he said they are the sisters of the light he stared at her a long moment who are the sisters of the light finally she blinked and looked over at him i dont know a whole lot about them no one does richard i think we should leave kahlan clamped both hands on his arm please lets go right now richards gaze glided over the men with spears stopping on the bird man thank him for coming to us tell him we will take care of it after the bird man nodded and he and his men left and they had told savidlin they would go alone richard led her outside by the arm they went around a few corners and he pushed her gently up against a wall holding her by her upper arms all right you may not know a lot about them but you know something tell me what it is i dont need to be a mind reader to tell you know something and youre afraid they have something to do with wizards with those with the gift what do you mean kahlan put her hands on his arms the way he had his on hers one time when i was traveling with wizard giller we were sitting around talking you know about life dreams things like that giller was a wizard by calling he didnt have the gift just the calling being a wizard had been his lifelong ambition his calling zedd had taught him to be a wizard only because of the wizards web zedd put over everyone when he left the midlands giller didnt remember zedd no one did no one even remembered his name anyway i asked him if he ever wished he had more than the calling if he wished he had the gift he smiled and daydreamed about it a minute then his smile went away his face turned white and he said no he didnt wish he had the gift i was puzzled by the look of fear on his face wizards dont often get a look like that over a simple question i asked him why he wouldnt want to have the gift he said because if he had the gift he would have to face the sisters of the light i asked him who they were but he wouldnt tell me anything about them he said it was best not to even mention their name aloud he begged me not to ask him any more on the subject i still remember how much the look on his face scared me do you know where theyre from ive been almost everywhere in the midlands ive never heard of them being seen anywhere and ive asked richard let go of her and put a fist on his hip with his other hand he squeezed his lower lip to a point as he thought finally he folded his arms and turned around the gift so were back to the gift i thought we were done with this nonsense i dont have the gift she knitted her fingers together richard please lets just get away if a wizard was afraid of the sisters of the light lets just get away from here and what if they follow what if they catch up with us when the headache has me flat on my back when im defenseless richard i dont know anything about them but if a wizard is that afraid of them what if we are defenseless right now i am the seeker i am not defenseless but i might be later better to meet them on my terms than theirs and im tired of hearing about the gift i dont have it and im going to put an end to this nonsense right now she took a deep breath and nodded all right i guess the seeker and the mother confessor are not without defenses he gave her a stern look youre not coming do you have a rope richard frowned no why she lifted an eyebrow you will have a hard time stopping me if you dont have a rope to tie me up kahlan im not letting you and im not giving you a chance to have a look at a woman you might fancy more than me without being there to give her a whack he watched her with an exasperated expression and then leaned forward and kissed her all right but lets not have an adventure she smiled we will just tell these three you dont have the gift send them on their way and then im going to give you a serious kiss the sky was darkening into a deep blue when they reached the spirit house three strong horses were tethered a short distance away their saddles were different from any she had seen before with high pommels and cantles as they paused in front of the door the air was cold enough to show their breath richard and kahlan gave each other a smile and a squeeze of the hand richard checked that the sword was clear in its scabbard he took a deep breath and pulled open the door kahlan wore her confessors face as her mother had taught her the inside of the spirit house was lit by a small fire and two torches in brackets one to each side of the fireplace their packs still sat to the side the air smelled of pitch and the balsamscented sticks that were always burned in the spirit house to make the ancestors spirits welcome torchlight flickered on the skulls of ancestors sitting on a single shelf the dirt floor was dry since richard had used the spirit house to teach the mud people to make roofs that didnt leak the three women stood straight and tall in the center of the singleroomed windowless building their brown heavy wool cloaks hung almost to the ground the hoods were up partly shadowing their faces they wore long divided riding skirts of different dark muted colors and simple white blouses they pushed back their hoods the one in the middle a few inches taller than the other two but not as tall as kahlan had brown hair with some curl and body to it the one to her right had straight black shoulder length hair and the others was curly short and dark with streaks of gray each had her hands clasped at ease in front of her it was the only thing at ease about them their mature faces wore looks that reminded kahlan of the headmistress of the maidservants back in aydindril it was a countenance of authority they appeared to have held so long that it had worn permanent creases kahlan took a second glance at their hands to see if they were empty they looked like they should be carrying switches their eyes watched as if ready to silence any impudence the woman in the middle spoke you two are richards parents her voice wasnt quite as harsh as kahlan expected but still carried a clear tone of authority richard glowered at them looking as if just his look might push the three back a pace he waited until the glare caused them to blink before he spoke no i am richard my parents are dead my mother since i was young and my father since the end of summer the three exchanged sidelong glances kahlan saw the anger in his eyes he was bleeding magic from the sword without even drawing it she could tell the sword was only a blink away from coming out she could see by the look in his eyes that he would not hesitate if these women did anything wrong that is not possible the taller one in the center said you are old not as old as you richard snapped their cheeks colored the womans eyes flashed an angry scowl but she quickly softened it we did not mean to say you are old we meant to say you are older than we expected i am sister verna sauventreen the blackhaired woman to her right spoke i am sister grace rendall i am sister elizabeth myric the third said sister verna turned her stern expression on kahlan and who would you be child kahlan didnt know if it was richards attitude causing it but she felt her blood heating too she gritted her teeth i am not your child i am the mother confessor kahlans tone could carry authority too when she wished it to it was almost imperceptible but the three flinched together they bowed their heads slightly forgive us mother confessor the air of threat in the spirit house was still palpable kahlan realized her hands were fists it came to her that she felt this way because they were a threat to richard she decided it was time to act like the mother confessor where are you three from she asked in an icy voice we are from far away kahlans glare was beginning to match richards in the midlands a bow to the mother confessor is done on at least one knee it was a custom she almost never had any interest in enforcing but she felt the need now the three leaned back as one standing straighter their indignant frowns deepened it was enough to bring out the sword the distinctive ringing of steel hung in the air richard said nothing he simply stood holding the sword in both hands kahlan could see his muscles straining to be released the sword of truths magic danced dangerously in his eyes she was glad his glower wasnt directed at her it was frightening the three didnt appear to be as frightened by it as she would have expected but they turned to her and together went to one knee bowing their heads again forgive us mother confessor sister grace said we are not familiar with your customs we meant no offense they kept their heads down kahlan waited the appropriate period and then added a few long seconds rise my children when they came to their feet they clasped their hands in front again sister verna took a deep impatient breath we are not here to frighten you richard we are here to help you put the sword away the last held a harsh hint of command to it richard didnt move i was told you said you came for me whatever that means and that i must not run i havent been running i am the seeker i will decide when to put away the sword the se sister elizabeth almost shouted you are the seeker the three exchanged looks again state your business richard said now sister grace took an impatient breath this time richard we are not here to harm you are you that afraid of three women even one woman is cause enough for fear i have learned that lesson the hard way i no longer harbor foolish inhibitions about killing women last time offered state your business or this conversation is ended she glanced to the agiel around his neck yes we can see you have learned some lessons her face softened a little richard you need our help we have come because you have the gift richard looked at each of them before he again spoke you have been seriously misinformed i dont have the gift nor do i want anything to do with it he slid the sword back into its scabbard im sorry you have come a long way for nothing he took kahlans arm the mud people dont like outsiders their weapons are tipped with poison and they are not shy about using them i will tell them to grant you safe passage out of their land i advise you not to test their restraint richard led kahlan by the arm toward the door she could feel the rage radiating from him could see the anger in his eyes and something else too his headache she could see the pain he suffered the headaches will kill you sister grace said quietly richard froze in his tracks his chest heaving as he stared ahead at nothing ive had headaches all my life im used to them not like these sister grace pressed we can see it in your eyes we recognize the headaches of the gift its our job there is a healer here who is taking care of them she is very good she has already helped me and i am confident she will soon cure me of them she cant no one can but us if you dont let us help you the headaches will kill you that is why were here to help you not to bring you to harm richards hand stretched for the latch you neednt concern yourselves about me im not cursed with the gift everything is under control safe journey to you ladies kahlan gently put her hand on his arm preventing him from reaching the latch richard she whispered maybe we should at least listen to them what harm can there be in listening to them perhaps you could learn something useful to help the headaches i dont have the gift i dont want anything to do with magic magic has caused me nothing but trouble nothing but pain i dont have the gift and i dont want it he reached for the latch again and i suppose you are going to tell us that your eating habits havent changed all of a sudden sister grace said i would say in just the last few days richard froze again everyone has changes in mood about what they want to eat has anyone watched you sleep what if anyone has watched you sleep they will have noticed that you now sleep with your eyes open kahlan felt a cold wave of goose bumps everything was starting to connect wizards all had odd specific eating habits and they all slept with their eyes open sometimes even those without the gift in those with the gift like zedd it was more often i dont sleep with my eyes open you are wrong richard kahlan whispered maybe we should listen to them hear what they have to say he looked to her as if pleading for her to help him escape this pleading for her help i dont sleep with my eyes open yes you do she put a hand on his arm i have seen you sleeping for months as we were trying to stop rahl when i stood watch i often saw you sleep only since we left dhara have i seen you sleep with your eyes open just like zedd does richard still had his back to the three women what do you want how can you help me with the headaches he called to them if we are to discuss this we are not going to talk to the back of your head sister vernas tone was like one used when talking to an obstinate child you will address us properly it was the wrong tone to use on richard at that moment he yanked the door open and slammed it as he went out kahlan thought the door might come off its hinges but it didnt she felt heartsick about what she had said to him he had wanted her to take his side he was in no mood to hear the truth she was puzzled by his attitude richard was not one to avoid the truth but he was deathly afraid of something she turned and looked at the three women sister grace separated her hands and let them hang at her sides this is no game mother confessor if he isnt helped by us he is going to die he doesnt have much time kahlan nodded her anger gone replaced by an empty sadness i will go talk to him she said in a small voice that was almost lost in the large room please wait here i will bring him back richard was sitting on the ground leaning against the short wall right under where his sword had cut a swath the night before when the screeling had come his elbows were on his knees his hands over his head fingers locked together he didnt look up kahlan sat tight against him your head hurts pretty bad right now doesnt it he nodded she pulled the dry shaft of a weed and held it between her hands as she rested her forearms on her knees as if what she had said reminded him he took some leaves out of his shirt pocket and put them in his mouth kahlan stripped a little leaf off the stem richard tell me what are you afraid of he chewed the leaves a moment and then lifted his head leaning back do you remember when the screeling came and i said i sensed it and you said maybe it was just that i heard it she nodded when i killed that man today i sensed him too just like the screeling it was just the same danger i didnt know what either was but i sensed the danger i knew there was trouble but i didnt know what kind what does that have to do with the three in there before we went in the spirit house to see those women i had the same sensation danger i dont know what it means but its the same feeling somehow i know those women are going to come between us richard you dont know that they said only that they want to help you i do know just as i knew the screeling was there and the man with the spear was there these women are somehow a danger to me kahlan felt a lump growing in her throat you also said you know the headaches might kill you richard im afraid for you and im afraid of magic i hate magic i hate the magic of the sword i wish i could be rid of it you cant imagine the things ive had to do with it you dont know what it took to turn the blade white darken ranis magic killed my father and took my brother it hurt a great many people he let out a deep breath i hate magic i have magic she said softly and it almost kept us apart forever but it didnt you figured out how to make it work without my magic i would never have met you she rubbed his arm magic also gave adie back her foot and has helped a lot of others zedd is a wizard he has the gift would you say that is bad zedd has always used his gift to help people richard you have magic too you have the gift you as much as admitted it you used it to sense the screeling you saved me you used it to sense the man that was going to kill chandalen you saved him i dont want to have magic it seems to me you are thinking of the problem and not the solution isnt that what you always say think of the solution not the problem richard thumped his head back against the wall and closed his eyes he let out an exasperated breath is this what being married to you is going to be like for the rest of my life you always telling me when im being stupid she smiled would you have me let you delude yourself he scrubbed his hands on his face i guess not my head hurts so much i guess its keeping me from thinking straight then lets do something about it lets go in and at least talk to the sisters and hear what they have to say they said they want to help he gave her a dark look so did darken rahl running away is not the solution you didnt run from darken rahl he looked at her a long moment and then nodded ill listen the three were standing where kahlan had left them they gave her small smiles of appreciation apparently pleased she had brought him back richard and kahlan stood close together in front of the three women we will listen listen to what you have to say about my headaches sister grace looked to kahlan thank you for your help mother confessor but we will speak with richard alone now richards anger flared again but he kept his tone in check kahlan and i are to be married the three gave each other the look again it was a little more serious this time what you have to say to me affects her too if you want to talk to me she will stay and hear it too both of us or neither choose the looks were still passing between the three at last sister grace spoke very well and the first thing you should know is that i dont like magic and im not convinced i have the gift if i do i am not pleased about it and only want to be rid of it we are not here to please you we are here to save your life to do that we must teach you to use the gift if you dont learn to control it it will kill you i understand i had a similar problem with the sword of truth the first thing you must learn sister verna said is that just as the mother confessor is to be treated with deference so are we we have worked long and hard to become sisters of the light and expect to be treated with due respect i am sister verna this is sister grace and this is sister elizabeth richard glared at them at last he bowed his head as you wish sister verna he regarded each in turn and who are the sisters of the light we are the ones who train wizards those with the gift where are the sisters of the light from we all live and work at the palace of the prophets kahlan frowned sister verna ive never heard of the palace of the prophets where is it in the city of tanimura kahlans frown deepened i know every city in the midlands ive never heard of tanimura sister verna held kahlans gaze for a moment nonetheless that is where we are from why were you surprised when you found out how old i am because sister grace said it is almost unheard of for one with the gift not to come to our attention when he is still young how young at the very most a third your age and why do you think i did not come to your attention obviously you have been hidden from us somehow kahlan recognized that richard was slipping into his seekers role seeking answers to his questions before he gave them anything they wanted did you train zedd who zeddicus zul zorander wizard of the first order the look passed between them again we dont know first wizard zorander i thought it was your business to know of ones with the gift sister verna they stiffened you know this wizard of the first order i do why dont you is he old richard nodded perhaps he was before our time perhaps richard with a fist on his hip strolled a few steps away and stopped with his back to them how do you know about me sister elizabeth it is our business to know about those with the gift wizards though you were obviously hidden from us when you triggered the gift we knew what if i dont want to be a wizard that is your business ours is to teach you to control the magic we are not here to force you to be a wizard only to help you control the magic so you will live then you may be what you wish richard marched back and put his face close to sister verna how do you know i have the gift we are the sisters of the light it is our business to know you thought i would be young you thought i would be with my parents you didnt know i was the seeker you dont know who the first wizard is you seem to be slipping in your business besides these errors perhaps you are also mistaken about me having the gift sister verna your mistakes do not inspire confidence does your position of respect tolerate such mistakes each womans face was crimson sister verna controlled her voice with an effort richard our job our calling is to help those with the gift we have devoted our lives to it we are from far away what we have learned has been done at a great distance we dont have all the answers the matters you speak of are not important what is important is that you have the gift and if you dont let us help you you will die one reason we help those with the gift when they are young and we wanted to see your parents is because of the very difficulty we are having right now if we can talk to the parents we can help them see what is best for their son parents are more interested in the wellbeing of their children than one of your age is in himself teaching one of your age is going to be difficult people are more easily taught when they are young before they are able to think for themselves sister verna she was silent i will ask again how do you know i have the gift sister grace smoothed her straight black hair when one is born with the gift it lies dormant and is harmless we strive to find these boys when they are young we have a number of ways of knowing who they are it has happened that one with the gift does things that trigger its growth its evolution when that happens it becomes a threat to them how you managed to slip by our knowledge is something we cant answer once triggered the power begins to evolve it cannot be stopped it must be mastered or you will die this is what has happened to you it is exceedingly rare for it to happen this way to be honest though we have been taught it has happened before none of us has personal knowledge of it back at the palace of the prophets there will be old records of this in others and we will look into it but that doesnt change what matters you have the gift it has been triggered and the evolution has begun we have never had to teach one of your age before i fear the trouble it is going to cause at the palace teaching the gift requires discipline one of your age has obvious difficulty with this richard softened his tone but his gaze hardened sister grace i will ask for the last time how do you know i have the gift she stood up a little straighter and let out a noisy breath she nicked a glance to sister verna tell him sister verna gave a resigned nod and pulled a small black book from behind her belt with a frown she began leafing through it those with the gift have some use of it throughout their life in little ways even though it lies dormant perhaps you have noticed how you could do some things that others could not yes the evolution of the gift is triggered by the specific use of the magic once triggered it cannot be undone this is what you have done she continued turning pages running her finger down them ah here it is she lowered the book and looked up there are three things that must be done in a specific manner to trigger the gift we dont fully understand the precise nature of these things but we understand their general principles you have done these three things first you must use the gift to save another second you must use the gift to save yourself third you must use the gift to kill another with the gift perhaps you can see the difficulty in accomplishing them and why we havent seen this before and what is written about me in that book she looked once more to the book then glanced up lifting an eyebrow to make sure he was paying attention before consulting the pages as she spoke first you used the gift to save the life of one who was being pulled back into the underworld not physically but by her mind you drew her back without you she would have been lost she looked up from under her eyebrows you understand yes kahlan looked at richard they both understood she was the one he had saved in the wayward pine she said the first night we met when you kept the underworld from taking me back richard nodded to sister verna yes i understand sister verna put her finger back to the book as for saving yourself with the gift lets see i saw it here a minute ah yes here it is she looked up from under her eyebrows again second you used the gift to save your own life she tapped the book with a finger you partitioned your mind you understand yes richards eyes closed yes i understand he said in a weak voice kahlan didnt understand that one sister verna went back to the book third you used the gift to kill a wizard his name was darken rahl you understand yes yes he opened his eyes how do you know these things the things you have done used magic specific magic that leaves an essence because of who you are and because you are untrained were you trained it would not leave this essence and we would not know we have ones back at the palace of the prophets who are sensitive to such events richard glared at her you have violated my privacy spied on me and as for the third of your three things i didnt exactly kill darken rahl not technically i can understand how you feel sister grace said quietly but it is only done to help you if you wish to stand here and argue with us about whether or not these things qualify as the three triggers i will put your doubts at ease once they are done you begin the process of becoming a wizard you may not believe it or choose to be a wizard but there is no doubt it has happened we do not place this burden on you we are only here to help you deal with it but but nothing when the magic is triggered at least three changes come about first you begin to have fetishes about food it may be things you crave or things you have always eaten that you now refuse to eat we have studied this and dont understand its cause but it has something to do with influences at the time the gift comes to life second you begin to sleep at least some of the time with your eyes open all wizards do this even ones who only have the calling it has something to do with learning to use the magic if you have the gift that brings it about as you use it to do these three things if you have only the calling the teaching brings it on third the headaches come the headaches are lethal there is no cure for them other than learning to control the magic if you dont sooner or later they will kill you how soon how much time do i have if i refuse your help kahlan put a hand on his arm richard how much time sister elizabeth spoke it is said that one lived with the headaches for a few years before he died it is also said that another was dead within several months we believe the time you have depends upon how strong your power is the stronger the power the stronger the headaches and the shorter the time but possibly within as little as a month they will begin to be strong enough to render you unconscious at times richard gave her an even look they already have been that strong the three sisters eyes widened and they exchanged the look again we began looking for you before you did these three things since we left the palace you have done all three sister verna said this book is magic when messages are written in its twin back at the palace they appear to us here that is how we know you have done them how long since you have done the third since you have killed this darken rahl three days but i was unconscious on the second night after i killed him the second again they gave each other the look his irritation was back why do you keep looking at each other like that sister vernas voice came in a soft tone because you are a very rare person richard in many ways we have never encountered so many unexpected things wrapped up in one person kahlan slipped an arm around his waist youre right he is a rare person a person i love what can you do to help him she was worried that he was frightening them and they wouldnt want to help there are specific rules he must follow we all must they are inviolate there is no room for negotiation he must put himself in our hands and must come with us to the palace of the prophets sister graces eyes were sad as she said alone for how long richard demanded how long does it take sister graces black hair shone in the torchlight as she turned her head to him it depends on how quickly you learn it takes as long as it takes you have to stay until it is finished kahlan felt a tightness in her chest as richard slipped his arm around her waist can i visit him sister grace shook her head slowly no and there is more her eyes flicked to the agiel for an instant she reached into her cloak and pulled something out it was a ring of metal hardly more than a hand across even though it seemed unbroken sister grace did something and it unlatched opening into hinged half circles its dull silver color reflected the firelight she held it up in front of richard this is called the radahan it is a collar you must wear it richard took a step back his hand coming away from kahlans waist and going to his throat his face paled and his eyes widened why he asked in a whisper the rules begin discussion is over sister verna and sister elizabeth moved behind sister grace as she spoke standing with their hands at their sides as the black haired woman held the collar out in her hands this is no game from now on it can go only by the rules listen carefully richard you will be offered three chances to take the radahan three chances to take our help a sister for each chance there are three reasons for the radahan a sister to reveal each before each offer and chance to refuse a different sister will give you one of the reasons after each reason you will be offered the chance to accept or refuse after the third refusal as i hope you never learn there are no more chances you will receive no further help from the sisters of the light you will die from the power of the gift richards hand still clutched at his throat his voice was still hardly more than a whisper why do i have to wear a collar sister grace stiffened with authority no discussion you will listen you must put the radahan around your neck yourself of your own free will once it is on you will not be able to remove it it can only be removed by a sister of the light it will stay on until we say it comes off we will only say that when you are trained not before richards chest heaved with each labored breath his stare was fixed on the collar his eyes had a strange wild haunted look kahlan had never seen before she was frozen at seeing his terror at her own terror sister grace held his eyes with a vengeance when he looked up at her your first offer is at hand each offer comes from a different sister the first offer comes from me i sister of the light grace rendall give the first reason for the radahan give the first chance to be helped the first reason for the radahan is to control the headaches and open your mind so you may be taught to use the gift you now have the chance to accept or to refuse i strongly advise you to accept the first offer of our help please believe me it will only be much more difficult for you to accept the second time and worse yet the third time please richard accept the offer now on the first of the three reasons and offers your life depends on this she stood still waiting his gaze went back to the dull silver collar he looked on the verge of panic the room was dead quiet except for the slow crackle of the fire and the soft hiss of the torches he looked up and his mouth opened but no words came as he stared unblinking at her intense gaze at last he blinked and spoke in a hoarse whisper i will not wear a collar i will never again wear a collar for anyone for any reason never she straightened a little lowering the collar looking genuinely surprised you refuse the offer and the radahan i refuse sister grace stood a while staring with what seemed to be a mix of sadness and worry pale she turned to the two sisters behind her forgive me sisters i have failed she handed the radahan to sister elizabeth it is upon you now the light forgives you sister elizabeth whispered as she kissed sister grace on each white cheek the light forgives you sister verna whispered giving the same kisses sister grace turned back to richard her voice less steady may the light cradle you always with gentle hands may you someday find the way holding richards gaze she brought her hand up giving it a flick a knife appeared from her sleeve but rather than a blade it had what seemed to be a pointed round rod coming from the silver handle richard leapt back drawing the sword in one swift smooth motion its distinctive ring sounded in the air deftly sister grace flipped the knife in her hand so it stopped with the blade pointing not toward richard but toward herself she held it with practiced grace without taking her eyes from richard and then she plunged the knife between her breasts there was a flash of light that seemed to come from within her eyes and she collapsed to the ground dead richard and kahlan both took a step back in wideeyed shock and horror sister verna bent and pulled the knife from the dead woman she stood and looked at richard as we told you this is no game she slipped the silver knife into her cloak you must bury her body yourself if you let another do it for you you will have nightmares for the rest of your life nightmares caused by magic there is no cure for them dont forget you must bury her yourself both sisters pulled their hoods up you have been offered the first of three chances and refused we will return the two sisters glided to the door and were gone the swords point slowly settled to the ground richard stared at the dead woman tears running down his face i wont wear a collar again he whispered to no one but himself not for anyone with labored movements he retrieved a small shovel and a handle from his pack and hooked them onto his belt he then rolled sister grace onto her back folded her hands across her and lifted her lifeless form in his arms one arm slipped from its place loose swinging her head hung down limp her dead eyes stared black hair dangled there was a small blossom of blood on the front of her white blouse richards pained eyes sought kahlan im going to bury her i would like to go alone kahlan nodded and watched him shoulder the door open after it had been pushed shut she sank to the ground and started crying chapter she was sitting staring into the fire when richard came back he had been gone a long time after kahlan had stopped crying she had gone to tell savidlin and weselan what had happened and then came back to the spirit house to wait for richard they had told her to come get them if she needed anything richard sat down next to her and put his arms around her his head on her shoulder she ran her fingers through the back of his hair and held him close she wanted to say something but was afraid to say anything so she just held him i hate magic he whispered at last its going to come between us again we wont let it we just wont we will think of something why did she have to kill herself i dont know kahlan whispered richard took his arms away and fingered some of nissels leaves out of his shirt pocket he sat chewing them as he gazed into the fire a slight frown of pain on his face i feel like running away but i dont know where to go how do you run away from something inside you kahlan rubbed her fingers back and forth on his leg richard i know this is hard for you to hear but please listen magic isnt bad he didnt object so she went on how people use it is sometimes bad like the way darken rahl used it i have had magic all my life ive had to learn to live with who i am do you hate me because i have magic of course not do you love me despite my magic he thought a minute no i love everything about you and your magic is part of you that was how i got past the confessors magic if i had loved you despite your power i wouldnt have been accepting you for who you are your magic would have destroyed me so you see magic isnt all bad the two people you love most in the world have magic zedd and me please listen you have the gift it is called a gift not a curse it is a wonderful rare thing it could be something used to help others you have already used it to help others maybe you should try to think of it in this way instead of trying to fight something that cant be fought he stared into the fire a long time as she smoothed his pant leg she could hardly hear him when at last he spoke i wont wear a collar again kahlans gaze went to the agiel the red leather rod hung from a fine gold chain at his neck swinging slightly with his breathing she knew the agiel was used to torture people but she didnt know how she only knew she didnt like him wearing it kahlan swallowed did the mordsith make you wear a collar he stared unblinking at the fire her name was denna she turned to him but he didnt respond did she did denna make you wear a collar yes a tear ran down his cheek she used it to hurt me it had a chain on it she hooked the chain to her belt and led me around by that collar like an animal when she would attach the chain to some resting place i couldnt move it she controlled the magic that gives me pain when i use the sword to kill she could amplify the magic the pain it prevented me from so much as putting tension on the chain i tried i tried hard you cant imagine how much it hurt denna made me put the collar around my own neck she made me do a lot of things but the headaches will kill you the sisters said the collar will stop the headaches and help you learn to control the gift they said that was one of the reasons they also said there are two more reasons for the collar i dont know what those other two reasons are kahlan i know you think im being foolish i think im being foolish too my head tells me the same things you are saying but my insides tell me something altogether different kahlan reached out and took the agiel in her fingers rolling it back and forth because of this because of what denna did he nodded still staring at the fire richard what does this do richard looked to her at last he gripped the agiel in his fist touch my hand dont touch the agiel just my hand kahlan reached out and put her fingers against his fist she jerked back with a yelp of pain she shook her wrist trying to ease the sting why didnt it hurt before when i touched it because it was never used to train you then why isnt it hurting you to hold it richard still had his fist around the middle of the red leather rod it is it hurts whenever i hold it kahlans eyes widened you mean its hurting you right now like when i touched your hand the pain of the headache was in his eyes no my hand was shielding you from what it really feels like she reached out again i want to know he dropped the agiel no i dont want it to hurt you like that i dont want anything to ever hurt you like that richard please i want to know i want to understand richard stared into her eyes and then let out a breath is there anything you ask i wouldnt do he took the agiel in his fist again dont grip it you may not be able to let go quick enough just touch it hold your breath and keep your teeth together so you dont bite your tongue tense your stomach muscles kahlans heart pounded as her hand went toward the agiel she didnt want to feel the pain it had hurt enough just to touch his hand but she wanted to know because it was part of who he was now she wanted to know everything about him even the things that hurt it felt like touching a bolt of lightning the pain shot up her arm exploding in her shoulder she screamed as the shock threw her on her back she rolled over on her face gripping her shoulder with her other hand she couldnt move her arm her hand tingled and shook she was shocked and frightened by the sheer power of the pain she cried into the dirt as richards hand touched her back in sympathy she cried too because now she understood just a little what had been done to him when at last she was able to sit up he was still watching her still holding the agiel in his fist it hurts like that for you to hold it yes she hit him on the shoulder with her fist let go of it she cried stop it he released the agiel letting it hang again it helps distract me from the headaches sometimes to touch it believe it or not it helps you mean the headache hurts more than that he nodded if it wasnt for what denna taught me about pain i would be unconscious right now denna taught me how to control pain how to tolerate it so she could give me more she tried to hold back the tears richard i what you felt was the least of what the agiel can do he picked it up again and touched the tip to the inside of his other forearm blood gushed from under the agiel he took it away it can strip the flesh right off you it can break your bones denna liked to use it to crack my ribs she would press it against me and i could hear the bone crack they still arent healed it still hurts to lie down or when you hug me tight enough it can do a lot of other things too it can even kill with a touch he stared at the fire denna shackled my wrists and later locked my arms behind me and held me up with a rope from the ceiling she used the agiel on me for hours at a time i would beg until i was hoarse for her to stop she never did not once there was no way for me to fight back nothing i could do to stop her she trained me she taught me until i sometimes thought i had no blood or breath left i begged her to kill me to end the pain i would have done it myself but she used magic to prevent it she had me kneel in front of her and beg her to use the agiel i would have done anything she said she had a friend who came along sometimes so they could share the fun kahlan sat frozen hardly able to breathe richard i every day she led me by the collar to a place where she could hang me up by a rope a room where she could use the agiel on me without distraction where it didnt matter so much if my blood got everywhere sometimes she did it from the first thing in the morning until night and then at night that is what wearing a collar means to me you can tell me about how much sense it makes about how it will help me and about how i have no choice but that is what wearing a collar means to me i know exactly what your shoulder feels like right now it feels like the skin has been burned and the muscle has been torn and bone is splintered that is what it feels like to wear a mordsiths collar only everywhere on your body all at once and all day long add to that the thought that you are helpless to stop it that you can never escape that youll never again see the only person you will ever love i would rather die than put a collar around my neck again kahlan rubbed her shoulder it felt just as he had described it she couldnt think of anything to say she hurt too much inside to say anything so she sat and watched him look at the fire as tears ran down her face she ached for him and then she heard herself ask something she had promised herself she wasnt ever going to ask denna took you for her mate didnt she she wished she could call the words back and at the same time she didnt richard didnt flinch yes he whispered as he stared at the fire another tear ran down his cheek how did you know demmin nass brought two quads to take me he had a spellweb from darken rahl to protect him from zedds magic from mine too zedd couldnt do anything he was frozen by a web demmin nass told me what had happened to you he said you were dead that was when i called forth the con dar and killed him richards eyes closed as another tear ran down there was no way for me to stop her i swear kahlan i tried you cant imagine what denna did to me for trying to stop her there was no way for me to fight back she could do anything she wanted it wasnt enough for her to hurt me just in the day she wanted to hurt me at night too how can anyone be that evil richard stared at the agiel as he slowly grasped it in his fist again she was captured when she was twelve they trained her with this agiel this very one everything she did to me they had done to her over and over for years they tortured her parents to death in front of her there was no one to help her she grew into a woman at the end of this agiel surrounded only by people who wanted her to hurt there was no one to give her even a single word of hope of comfort of love can you imagine her terror they gave her a life of endless pain they raped her body and her spirit they broke her they made her one of them darken rahl personally made her one of them the whole time she used this agiel on me it hurt her the same as it hurts me to hold it now theres some magic for you one day darken rahl beat her for hours because he thought she wasnt hurting me enough he flailed the skin right off her back richards head hung as he cried and then at the end of all that at the end of a life of pain and madness i come along turn the sword of truth white and run it through her the only thing she asked before i killed her was for me to wear her agiel and remember her i was the only one who understood her pain it was the only thing she wanted for someone who understood to remember her i promised and she hung it around my neck and then she just sat there as i pushed my sword through her heart she had been hoping i would be the one with the power to kill her that is how someone can be that evil if i had the power i would bring darken rahl back to life so i could kill him again kahlan sat stunned motionless caught in a vortex of conflicting emotions she hated this denna for hurting richard she was unaccountably jealous of her and at the same time she felt unexpected wrenching sorrow for her finally she turned away and wiped the tears from her face richard why didnt they win why wasnt denna able to break you how did you keep your sanity because as the sisters said i partitioned my mind i dont know how to explain it i didnt even know exactly what it was i was doing but thats how i saved myself i put the core of myself away and sacrificed the rest i let her do what she would darken rahl said that i have the gift because i did that that was when i first heard the word partitioned richard lay back resting his arm over his eyes kahlan pulled out a blanket and bunched it under his head im so sorry richard she whispered its over that is what matters he took his arm from his eyes and at last smiled up at her its over and we are together in some ways it was good if she hadnt taught me i wouldnt be able to deal with this headache maybe denna has helped me maybe i can use what i know to get out of this she winced in sympathy is it really bad right now he nodded a little but ill die before i ever put a collar around my neck again she understood now though she wished she didnt she lay down snug against him the fire was a watery blur chapter the next day the sky was a cold gray and the wind icy as the two of them went out alone on the plain richard wanted to be away from people away from buildings he wanted to see the sky and the earth he said the brown grass bowed in the stiff gusts that flapped and tugged their cloaks as they walked along in silence richard wanted to shoot his bow to make the headache go away for a while kahlan just wanted to be with him it seemed that the eternity which a few days ago she had felt belonged to them was slipping through her fingers she wanted to fight back but didnt know how everything that was so right was suddenly going wrong she didnt think that richard would put on the radahan the collar no matter what the sisters said he might accept learning to use the gift but she didnt think he would wear a collar and if he didnt he would die after what he had told her and worse the things she knew he hadnt how could she expect him to wear it or ask him to it did feel good though to be away from the village away from people and away from chandalens eyes following them everywhere how could she blame him it did seem as if the two of them kept bringing trouble but it irritated her that he acted as if they did it on purpose she was tired of trouble it seemed as if it would never end well she decided for today at least they would be away from trouble and just enjoy being together kahlan had told him she used to shoot a bow she couldnt draw his because it was too heavy so richard encouraged her to borrow one and bring it along so he could teach her how to shoot better they found the bundled grass targets the men had set up before standing head high like a group of scarecrows on guard over the vast flat grassland a few even had balled grass for heads each had an x made of grass for a target the targets with heads had an x there as well richard thought the xs were too fat so he took them off and made ones of single grass stalks they stood a long way off so far in fact that she could hardly see the bundled grass much less the xs richard strapped on a simple leather bracer savidlin had made for him along with the bow and shot arrows until his headache was gone richard was a picture of stillness of smoothness he was one with the bow she smiled at how good he looked and that he was hers it made her heart ache with joy to see his gray eyes sparkle without the pain of the headache in them they moved closer so she could shoot dont you want to go check where your arrows hit he smiled i know where they hit you shoot now she shot a few arrows getting the feel again he set one end of his bow on the ground rested both hands over the other end and watched her she had been a girl the last time she used a bow richard watched her shoot a few more times and then came and stood behind her his arms came around her and he adjusted her hand on the bow and put his fingers on the string here do this you cant get any power or be steady enough holding the arrow with your thumb and the knuckle of your first finger that way hold the bowstring back with your first three fingers like this nesting the arrow between the first two and pull with your shoulder too you dont need to pull on the arrow just concentrate on holding back the string the arrow will take care of itself see isnt that better she grinned it is with your arms around me pay attention to what youre doing he scolded kahlan took aim and shot he said it was better and told her to try again she shot a few more arrows and thought she might have even hit the bundled grass once she drew the bowstring again trying to hold the bow steady suddenly he tickled her stomach she doubled over squealing and laughing trying to get his fingers off her stop it she laughed breathlessly trying to twist away from him stop it richard i cant shoot when youre doing that he put his fists on his hips you have to be able to she frowned up at him as she panted what do you mean besides being able to hit what you want you have to be able to shoot no matter what is happening if you cant shoot when youre laughing how can you shoot when youre afraid just you and the target thats all there is nothing else matters you have to be able to block everything else out if a wild boar is charging you you cant think about how afraid you are or what will happen if you miss you have to be able to make the shot under pressure or else have a tree close by you can climb but richard you can do it because you have the gift i cant do that nonsense the gift has nothing to do with it its simple concentration here ill talk you through it nock an arrow he stood behind her again pulling her hair off her neck leaning close looking over her shoulder and whispering in her ear as she drew the bowstring back he whispered what she should feel how she should breathe where she should look what she should see he talked in a way that made the words melt into nothingness and instead made images form in her head only three things existed the arrow the target and his words she was in a world of silence when everything else winked out the target seemed to grow larger in her vision drawing the arrow to it his words made her feel it made her do things without understanding them she relaxed and exhaled holding herself still without taking another breath she could feel it feel the target she knew when it was time when it was right lightly like a breath of air the arrow left of its own accord as if it had decided to go on its own in the quiet she could see the feathers clear the bow feel the string hit the bracer she could see the target pulling the arrow she could hear the arrow hit the x she felt air rush back into her lungs it was almost like when she released her confessors power it was magic richards magic his words were magic it was like having a new vision she felt as if she were coming awake from a dream the world came back she almost fell against him kahlan turned and threw her arms around his neck still gripping the bow in one hand richard that was wonderful the target came to me see i told you you could do it she kissed his nose i didnt do it you did it i was just holding the bow instead of you he smiled no you did it i just showed your mind how thats what teaching is i was simply teaching you do it again kahlan had lived around wizards all her life she knew the way wizards did things that was the way richard had done it he spoke to her the way wizards spoke it was the gift speaking she knew even if he wouldnt admit it as she shot more arrows he talked less without his words guiding her it was harder to get the feel but now and again she did she could tell when she was doing it herself without him it seemed to be as he said like intense concentration as she started to learn to block the world out as she aimed he began to do things to try to distract her at first he just rubbed her stomach it made her smile until he told her to stop thinking about what he was doing and think only about what she must do after a few hours she could shoot while he tickled her sometimes it was an exhilarating feeling to be able to feel where the arrow needed to be she couldnt do it very often but when it happened it felt wonderful addictive its magic she told him thats what youre doing magic no its not everyone can do it chandalens men are doing it when they shoot everyone who gets good enough does it its your own mind doing it i just helped by showing you if you had practiced long enough you would have learned it by yourself before now just because you dont know how something is done doesnt make it magic she gave him a sidelong glance im not so sure you shoot let me tickle you while you try to shoot after we have something to eat and you practice some more they flattened a circle of grass like a nest and lay on their backs watching the birds wheel in the sky as they ate tava bread wrapped around greens handfuls of kuru and drank water from a skin the surrounding grass protected them a little so the wind didnt feel quite so cold she laid her head on his shoulder as they watched the sky in silence she knew they were both wondering what they were going to do maybe richard said at last i could partition my mind again to control the headaches darken rahl said that was what i had done you talked to him you talked to darken rahl yes actually he did most of the talking i mostly listened he told me a lot of things i dont believe all of them he told me george cypher wasnt my father he told me i had partitioned my mind and that i have the gift he told me i had been betrayed because of what shota said that you and zedd would both use your magic against me i thought one of you had betrayed us i never thought of my brother maybe if i could figure out how to partition my mind again i could control the headaches so they wouldnt kill me maybe thats what the sisters teach ive already done it once so if i could do it again i might be able to save myself without he rested an arm over his eyes not wanting to finish the thought out loud kahlan maybe i dont have the gift it could just be the wizards first rule what do you mean zedd told us that much of what people believe is wrong the first rule can make you believe something is true either because you want it to be true or because youre afraid it might be im afraid of having the gift and that fear makes me accept the possibility that what the sisters say is true it could be there are other reasons the sisters want me to think i have the gift and that it isnt true maybe i dont have it richard do you really think you can dismiss all the other things that have happened zedd said you have the gift darken rahl said you have the gift the sisters say you have the gift even scarlet says you have the gift scarlet doesnt know what she is talking about i dont trust the sisters and do you think i would believe anything darken rahl said and what about zedd do you think zedd is lying or that he doesnt know what he is talking about you have told me you think he is the smartest man you know besides he is a wizard of the first order do you really think a wizard of the first order wouldnt know the gift when he saw it zedd could be wrong just because hes smart that doesnt mean he knows everything kahlan thought a while about his reluctance to accept that he had the gift she wished for his sake that it could be the way he wanted it but she knew the truth richard at the peoples palace when i touched you with my power and we all thought it had taken you and didnt know you had figured out how not to be consumed by the magic you recited the book of counted shadows to darken rahl didnt you he nodded i couldnt believe you did that how did you know it where did you ever learn the book richard sighed when i was young my father took me to a place where he had it hidden he told me it was being guarded by a beast sent by covetous hands to watch over it until that person could come for the book so he rescued it i know now that they were the hands of darken rahl but at the time we didnt know that my father said he had to take it because otherwise it would be stolen by those hands he feared that person might eventually find it so he had me memorize it all of it he said i had to know every word so that someday i could return the knowledge to the keeper of the book he didnt know that zedd was the books keeper it took me years to memorize every word of the book he never looked in it he said that was for only me to do after i had learned it all perfectly we burned the book ill never forget that day light and sound and strange forms came forth as the book burned magic she whispered knowingly he nodded as he rested his wrist over his eyes again my father died keeping the book from darken rahl he was a hero he saved us all by his actions kahlan tried to think of how to put words to the things she was thinking the things she knew zedd told us the book of counted shadows was kept in his keep how did your father get it he never told me that richard i was born and raised in aydindril i spent a good portion of my life in the wizards keep its a huge fortress in times long ago hundreds of wizards lived there when i grew up there were only the six and none were wizards of the first order it is not an easy place to enter i was able to because im a confessor and needed to learn from books kept there all the confessors had access to the keep but it was protected by magic from any others entering if youre asking i dont know how my father did it he was a pretty smart man he must have figured it out if the book was in the keep itself maybe there were wizards and confessors coming and going and at times others were permitted to enter perhaps someone could have found a way to sneak in even once inside there are areas protected more strongly by magic areas even i could not enter but zedd said the book of counted shadows was an important book of magic very important he said he kept it in his keep the wizard of the first orders keep that is altogether different its separate from the rest part of the larger keep but set off by itself ive walked the long ramparts to the first wizards keep there is a beautiful view of aydindril from there just walking the ramparts i could feel the awesome power of the spells that protect that place it made your skin crawl if you went close enough the power of the protection spells made the hair lift off your shoulders and stick out in all directions popping and snapping with little sparks if you went closer still the spells filled you with a sensation of dread so strong you couldnt force your feet to take another step or your lungs to draw another breath since zedd left the midlands before we were born none had entered the first wizards keep the other wizards tried to enter there is a plate you must touch it is said touching the plate is like touching the frozen heart of the keeper himself if the magic doesnt recognize you as one permitted entry you cannot gain entrance touching the plate without at least the protection of your own magic or even just getting close enough to the spells themselves can be death since i was young and first went to the keep to learn from the books the wizards had been trying to get in they wanted to know what was inside the first wizard was gone and they thought they should take an inventory thought they should at least know what was in there they never succeeded not one of them was ever able to so much as place a hand to the plate richard if five wizards of the third order and one of the second could not get in how did your father he sighed i wish i had an answer for you kahlan but i dont she didnt want to dash his hopes give irrefutable life to his fears but she had to the truth was the truth he had to know that truth about himself richard the book of counted shadows was a book of instruction for magic it was magic i have no doubt of that i know what i saw when we burned it she stroked the back of his hand with her finger there were other books of instruction for magic in the keep less important ones the wizards let me look at them when i would read them i would get to a place in the books and a strange thing would happen sometimes after only a few words sometimes after a few pages i would forget what i had just read i couldnt remember a word of it not a single word i would go back and read it again and the same thing would happen the wizards would smile watching me and then they would laugh after a while of trying to read the books and not knowing what i had just read i finally got frustrated and asked what was happening they told me that books of instruction for magic are protected by powerful spells invoked at certain words in the books they said none but one with the gift could read a book of magic instruction and remember so much as a single word those six wizards were wizards by calling not by the gift even they couldnt read all the books and know what they said only the less important ones and only then because of their training zedd told us that the book of counted shadows was one of the most important books in the keep so important it was kept in the first wizards enclave richard you would never have been able to memorize it if you didnt have the gift there is no other way somehow your father must have known that is why he chose you to learn it her head was still resting on his shoulder and she felt his breathing halt for a moment as he realized the significance of what she had told him richard do you still remember the book his voice came low and distant every word though i heard you recite it and i know you spoke it all i cannot remember a word of what you said the magic of certain words erased it all from my mind i dont know how you used it to defeat darken rahl the first of the book said that if the words were being told to the one who controlled the boxes of orden and not read by that person then the only way that person could know the words were true was with the use of a confessor rahl thought you had taken me with your power and so he thought i was speaking all the words true i did speak the words true but i left out an important part at the end so he would pick the box that would kill him you see you still remember the words you could not do that if you didnt have the gift the magic would prevent it richard if we are going to get out of this we have to at least face the truth and then think of what to do about it my love you have the gift you have magic im sorry but that is the truth of it he let out an exasperated breath i guess i just so badly didnt want it to be that i have been trying to talk myself out of it but things dont work that way i hope you dont think me a fool thank you for loving me enough to make me see the truth you are no fool you are my love we will think of something she kissed the back of his hand and they watched the sky in silence it was a dark cold gray a mirror to her mood i wish you could have met my father he was a special person i guess even i never knew how special i miss him he stared off into his own thoughts what of your father kahlan twisted a strand of her hair around her finger my father was mate to my mother mate to a confessor he was not a father in the way a man is a father to other children he had been taken by her power and there was nothing to him but his devotion to her he paid heed to me only to please my mother only because i was born to her he didnt see me as myself but only as a part of the confessor he was bonded to richard pulled a piece of long grass and flattened the end of it between his front teeth as he thought at last asking who was he before she took him with the magic he was wyborn amnell king of galea richard pushed himself up on an elbow looking down at her with surprise king your father was a king without realizing she was doing it her expression slipped into the calm exterior that showed nothing a confessors face my father was mate to a confessor that was all that was in him when my mother was dying of a terrible wasting illness he was in a constant state of panic one day the wizard and the healer who had been tending her came to us and said there was nothing more they could do that the spirits would soon take her to be with them that she would soon pass from life with a wail of anguish like none i have ever heard my father clutched his chest and fell to the floor dead richard gazed into her eyes im sorry kahlan he bent and kissed her forehead im sorry he whispered he lay back once more and put the stalk of grass back between his teeth it was a long time ago so what does that make you are you a princess or a queen or something she laughed a little at the question at how strange all this must seem to him he still knew little of her life her world no i am the mother confessor the daughter of a confessor is a confessor not the daughter of her father she felt uncomfortable about seeming to belittle her father it was not his fault her mother had chosen and taken him do you wish to know about him he shrugged sure you are part of him too i like knowing all about you she thought a moment about what his reaction would be well he was the husband to queen bernadine when my mother chose him as her mate your mother chose a man who was already married she felt richards eyes on her it is not as it must seem to you the marriage between him and the queen was arranged he was a warrior a great commander the marriage wedded his realm to the lands ruled by queen bernadine creating the land of galea he did it for his people to make a united land under a crown that could stand against hostile neighbors the queen was a wise and respected leader she married my father for the good of galea not for herself she and my father had no love for each other he gave her gave the people of galea a fine strong daughter cyrilla and a then a son harold then you have a half sister and brother she shrugged in a way but not in the way you think of it i am a confessor not a knot in the string of royalty i have met both cyrilla and harold they are fine people cyrilla is the queen of galea now her mother died a few years back prince harold is the commander of the army as was his father they dont think of me as kin nor i them i am of the confessors of the magic what about your mother when did she come into all this she had just become the mother confessor at the time she wanted a strong mate one who would give her a daughter with strength she had heard the queen was not happy in her marriage and went to speak with her queen bernadine told my mother that she did not love her husband that he was a cuckold even though she loved another she respected wyborn as a strong man as a leader and as a cunning warrior and would not condone my mother taking him with her power while my mother was thinking on what she would do wyborn caught the queen in the bed of that lover he nearly killed her when my mother heard of this she returned to galea and solved everyones problems before he could add the murder of the lover to the beating he had given his wife though a confessor has many things to fear being struck by her husband is not one of them it must be hard to have to choose a mate without loving him she smiled and pressed her head against him in my whole life i never thought i would be able to have anyone i love i wish my mother could have known this joy what was it like having him as your father she folded her fingers together against her stomach he was as a stranger to me he had no emotion except for my mother no real feelings except for devotion to my mother she wished him to spend time with me to teach me the things he knew so he was overjoyed to do so but for her sake not mine he spent time teaching me what he knew war he taught me the tactics of his enemies how to steal victory from a much larger and confident force and most importantly how to survive and triumph by using your head instead of rules my mother would sit sometimes and watch as he taught me he would look up and ask her if he was teaching me correctly she told him he was to teach me so that i might know the skills of war he knew in the hope id never need them and if i did so that i might survive he taught me that the most important quality in a warrior is ruthlessness he said that he prevailed many times by being ruthless he said terror could overwhelm reason and it was a leaders job to bring that manner of terror to the enemy the things he taught me helped me survive when other confessors died because of what he taught me i was able to kill when there was need he taught me not to be afraid of doing the things that must be done to survive for the things he taught me i loved him and i hated him well i love him for teaching you to how to survive so that you could be with me now kahlan shook her head slightly as she watched a small bird chasing away a raven the things he knew were not the horror those who make you do them to survive are he never wrongly took war to others i shouldnt fault him for knowing how to triumph when he was forced to fight a war richard perhaps we should start thinking about surviving now youre right he said slipping an arm around her you know i was thinking were sitting here like those targets just sitting here waiting for an arrow to come and shoot us waiting to see what will happen to us what do you think we should do he shrugged i dont know but if we keep sitting here sooner or later were going to get shot sooner or later the sisters are going to come back why should we just wait for them to come to us i dont have the answers but i cant see how sitting here is going to help she crossed her arms under her breasts burying her hands to get them warm zedd richard nodded zedd would know what to do if anyone would i think we need to see him what about the headaches what if you get them when were traveling what if they get worse and you dont have even nissel to help i dont know he sighed but i think we have to try otherwise i dont have a chance then lets leave right away before they get worse lets not wait for anything else to happen he squeezed her shoulders soon but we have to do something first something important kahlan twisted her head around looking up at him what he smiled down at her we have to get married he whispered im not leaving until i get to see this dress i keep hearing so much about she turned and hugged him oh richard its going to be so beautiful weselan smiles the whole time she sews on it i cant wait for you to see me in it i know you will love it of that my wifetobe i have no doubt everyone is looking forward to it a wedding feast among the mud people is a big party dancing music actors the whole village joins in weselan said it will take a week or so to prepare everything once we give the word to start he pulled her closer word is given she had her eyes closed as she kissed him but even so she could tell his headache was back come on she said catching her breath lets shoot some arrows so your head will stop hurting they took turns for a while kahlan squealed in delight when they went to retrieve their arrows and she found she had put one of hers through one of his wait until the home guard hears about this they will turn green having to give the mother confessor a ribbon for making a shaft shot they may even turn green just seeing me with a bow in my hands richard laughed as he pulled arrows from the targets well youd better keep practicing they might not believe you and you may have to prove it to them and im not taking the blame for this one with savidlin he turned to her suddenly what did you say what did you say before last night about the quad rahl sent them with a spell so zedd couldnt stop them kahlan was a little surprised at his sudden change of subject yes his magic wouldnt work against them thats because zedd has only additive magic thats all any wizard with the gift has just the additive darken rahl had the gift for additive but he had somehow learned to use subtractive zedd had no defense against subtractive magic neither did you wizards created the confessors magic and wizards have only additive magic she nodded with a frown for him to go on so then how did you kill them i went into the con dar she shrugged its part of the confessors magic but i had never before known how to use it it was something to do with rage it means blood rage kahlan do you realize what youre saying you had to have used subtractive magic otherwise how could you have defeated them zedds magic didnt work and your regular magic didnt work because those men were protected from additive magic you must have subtractive magic but if wizards of long ago created your confessors magic how can it have an element of subtractive to it she stared at him i dont know i never thought about it but it must be as you say maybe when we get to aydindril zedd can explain it with a frown he pulled another arrow from the bundled grass maybe but why would confessors have subtractive magic his frown deepened i wonder if that was what you did with the lightning richard with the gift and her with subtractive magic two frightening thoughts she shivered but not from the cold they shot arrows the rest of the afternoon until the daylight began to dim her shoulders and arms were weary from pulling the bowstring she told him she couldnt shoot another arrow if her life depended on it and told him to shoot some arrows before they went back so his headache would be gone for a while as she watched him it occurred to her she hadnt tried to distract him while he shot and he had promised she could try kahlan stepped up close behind him time to see if you are really as good as you think you are when he drew back the bowstring she tickled his ribs he didnt flinch he shot the same as before but he laughed and squirmed after the arrow was away she kept trying as he shot but wasnt able to distract him she became more determined if tickling wouldnt work she would just have to try something else kahlan pressed up against his back as he concentrated on aiming and smoothly unbuttoned the top three buttons of his shirt she slipped her hand inside and ran it over his chest his skin was taut over his hard muscles he felt good warm strong hard she unbuttoned more buttons to better extend her reach she ran the fingers of one hand through the back of his hair as the other roamed across his stomach richard kept shooting she started to forget about distracting him as she kissed the back of his neck he giggled and hunched his shoulders after the arrow was away he nocked another arrow at last she had all the buttons undone and was feeling all of the front of his torso all the way down to his belt kahlan pulled the shirttails out of his pants and ran both hands over his body one high one low it didnt keep him from hitting the target she couldnt break his concentration her breathing quickened she decided she was going to win this game she smiled as she pressed harder against him and reached farther kahlan he gasped kahlan thats not fair he still had the bowstring drawn but his aim was starting to wander he worked to steady it she drew his earlobe gently between her teeth and kissed his ear you said you have to be able to shoot no matter what is happening she whispered as she pushed her hand farther kahlan his voice was high and strained that isnt fair thats cheating no matter what those were your exact words you have to be able to make the shot under pressure she ran her tongue into his ear is this enough pressure my love can you do it can you make the shot kahlan he panted youre cheating she gave a throaty laugh and squeezed he gasped and released the bowstring by its flight she knew that was one arrow they would never find i think you missed she breathed in his ear he twisted around in her arms dropping his bow his face was red as he enclosed her in his arms he kissed her ear not fair he whispered his breath hot you cheat the touch of his lips on her ear made her gasp she held on tight as he pulled her hair away and put his warm mouth to her neck it made her shiver she hunched her shoulder against his face and half moaned half laughed as the world tilted and she found herself on the ground under him she managed to get out most of i love you before his lips covered hers and she wrapped her arms around his neck she couldnt get her breath she didnt want to just as she was starting to wonder when his hands were going to get even for what she had done richard leapt to his feet he drew his sword in a rush the passion in his eyes had been replaced by rage anger from the sword of truth flashed in his expression the ring of steel was carried away by the wind he stood with his shirt open his chest exposed and heaving with fury she pushed herself up on her elbows richard what is it something is coming get behind me now kahlan sprang to her feet snatched up her bow and nocked an arrow some thing a ways off she saw the grass moving and it wasnt the wind chapter a splotchy gray head bobbed toward them through the long grass whatever it was it wasnt very tall kahlan wondered if it could be another screeling at that thought she drew her bowstring back until the arrows point was at her grip on the bow and the string against her cheek she frantically worried if she could make the shot if it came at them although from what she had seen of a screeling before an arrow she realized would do no good she wondered if she could call the lightning again richard lifted his arm in front of her wait a squat hairless figure with long arms and big feet dressed only in pants held up with straps broke through the grass in front of them blinking yellow eyes gazed up at her pointing the arrow between them a sharptoothed grin split its face pretty lady it was the witch woman shotas companion samuel richard growled what are you doing here the beastly creature hissed and reached for the sword mine gimme richard brandished the blade menacingly and samuel pouting snatched his arm back richard laid the swords tip on the gray folds of skin at samuels neck i asked what are you doing here hateful eyes peered up mistress wants you well you can just go home by yourself were not going to agaden reach he regarded richard with one yellow eye mistress not in the reach he turned stretching up on his toes to look over the grass and pointed a long thick finger back toward the mud peoples village mistress waits for you there where those people live together he glared back at richard she said if you dont come she will kill them and samuel can cook them in a stew his grin returned richard gritted his teeth if she has hurt anyone she said she will not hurt them if you come to her what does she want you what does she want with me mistress not tell samuel tells me only to get you kahlan had relaxed half the tension on the bowstring richard shota said she would kill you if she ever saw you again he kept his eyes on samuel as he spoke no she said she would kill me if i ever went back to agaden reach shes not in the reach but if i dont go she said she will kill people do you doubt her no but she still might kill you he grunted and then smiled kill me i dont think so she likes me i saved her life indirectly at least kahlan bristled shota had once tried to bewitch him and she didnt like that one bit other than the sisters of the light the witch woman was just about the last person kahlan ever wanted to see again i dont like it richard stole a quick glance at her if you have a better idea put words to it kahlan let out an angry breath i guess we have no choice but you just keep her hands off you richard gave her a startled look then turned to the witch womans companion you take the lead samuel and dont forget whos carrying the sword and remember what i told you the last time i might still have some samuel stew if you try doing anything to harm us samuel eyed the blade a moment without another word he turned and started off glancing over his shoulder to make sure they followed richard kept the sword out slung his bow over his shoulder and put himself between kahlan and samuel the anger of the swords magic blazed in his eyes samuel loped through the grass ahead of them turning back occasionally to hiss at them kahlan stayed close on richards heels shed better not put snakes on me again no snakes she said emphatically and i mean it as if we have a choice richard muttered it was near dark by the time they reached the village they came in from the east and noticed immediately that the entire population of the village was clustered at the south end of the common field shielded by armed hunters standing shoulder to shoulder kahlan knew the mud people were deathly afraid of the witch woman they wouldnt even speak her name aloud for that matter everyone she ever knew was deathly afraid of the witch woman including her shota would have killed her the last time if richard hadnt used a wish shota had granted him to save her she didnt think shota would be granting richard any more wishes samuel led them through the narrow passageways toward the spirit house walking as if he had lived here all his life he gurgled his odd laugh as he bounded along giving them an occasional glance he grinned with bloodless lips as if he knew something they didnt when his grin showed too many teeth and richard prodded him with the sword samuel growled and hissed his yellow eyes glowing in the fading light samuel laid his longfingered hand on the latch to the spirit house pretty lady waits here with me mistress wants only seeker richard im going in too kahlan said firmly he gave her a sidelong glance and then looked at samuel open the door one powerful arm drew the door back as shining yellow eyes glowered at him richard held his sword out indicating that he wanted her to go in the door squeaked closed behind them with a sourfaced samuel on the other side in the center of the room sat a tall elegant throne torchlight danced and flared on the carved goldleaf vines snakes cats and other beasts that covered every inch of the stately structure a canopy draped with heavy red brocade and trimmed with gold tassels jutted out overhead the throne itself sat atop three square white marble platforms that served as steps the whole thing was massive and imposing tufted red velvet covered the seat the back and the tops of the arms kahlan couldnt imagine how it could have possibly fit through the door or how many men it must have taken to carry it shota sat regally her impassive almond eyes watching richard she reclined slightly against the red velvet one leg crossed over the other her arms resting on the chairs high widespaced arms with hands draped haughtily over gold gargoyles the gargoyles licked her wrists while she clicked one long lacquered fingernail against a thumbnail luxuriant auburn hair cascaded over her shoulders shota redirected her ageless eyes to kahlan the long rocksolid gaze felt as if it paralyzed her penetrated her a red white and black banded snake slumped down hanging from the canopy it flicked its tongue at kahlan hissing and then dropped into shotas lap coiling up like a contented cat it was a message to say that she had not been invited and was now warned of what would happen if shota became displeased kahlan swallowed trying not to let it show after what seemed an eternity and after the witch woman seemed satisfied that the message was understood she turned her unblinking eyes back to richard put your sword away richard shotas voice was like smooth velvet rubbed the right way kahlan didnt think it was fair that anyone that beautiful should also be graced with a voice that could melt butter or a mans heart from the impression you left when we parted i fear you might try to kill me his voice also was annoyingly smooth if i decide to kill you my dear boy and i may your sword will not help you richard suddenly yelped and dropped the sword as if it was a hot coal he stared down at the sword as he comforted his hand now put it away that time the quality of her voice was more of velvet rubbed the wrong way from under his eyebrows richard looked up at shota on her throne before bending to retrieve his sword and slide it back into its scabbard a selfsatisfied smile spread across shotas full lips she lifted the snake from her lap and set it aside shota watched richard a moment longer and then stood leaning forward enough in the process to offer her breasts the opportunity to fall out of her wispy lowcut variegated gray dress how they managed not to kahlan didnt know a little stoppered bottle tumbled from its snug place between her breasts and swung on a fine silver chain kahlans face heated as shota gracefully descended the three platforms never taking her eyes from richard the loose points of the dress floated gently as if in a light breeze but there was no breeze inside the spirit house that fabric kahlan decided was definitely too thin for a dress she wondered what she would look like in it and blushed at the mental image once standing on the ground shota turned and pulled the stopper from the little bottle the entire throne wavered like something seen through heat waves abruptly it turned to gray smoke and swirled in a circle diminishing all the time in size and sucked itself into a fine line that went into the little bottle shota replaced the stopper tucked the bottle back between her breasts and with a finger pushed it so far down it could no longer be seen kahlan took a deep noisy breath shotas gaze glided from richards eyes and took in his open shirt with what might have been amusement or satisfaction richards face reddened shotas smile widened how delightfully indecent she ran one of her long red nails all the way down his chest to his navel and then she gently patted his stomach button your shirt richard or i may forget why im here his face turned a deeper red kahlan moved deliberately closer to his side as he began redoing the buttons shota he said as he tucked the tails in his pants i have to thank you you may not know it but you really helped me before helped me to figure it out it was my intention to help you you dont understand i mean you helped me figure out how to be with kahlan you helped me figure out how we could be together how to love her he smiled were going to be married there was a moment of icy silence thats right kahlan said holding her chin up we love each other and can be together now forever she hated the way shota made her feel explanations were necessary and the way she fumbled with them shotas intense gaze slid to her and her smile slowly evaporated making kahlan have to swallow again you ignorant children shota whispered as she slowly shook her head you foolish ignorant children richards expression was becoming heated we may be ignorant but we are not children and we love each other and we are going to be married i was hoping you would be happy for us shota since you played a small part in it what i told you dear boy was that you needed to kill her but thats all over kahlan protested the problem has been solved its all right for us now everything is all right kahlan gasped as she felt her feet lift off the ground both she and richard were flung across the room and up against the wall the impact knocked the wind from her lungs little points of light floated and danced before her eyes she looked down trying to clear her vision she and richard were flattened against the mudbrick wall a good three feet off the ground she could hardly breathe the only thing she could move was her head even her clothes were flattened her cloak lay against the wall as if it were the floor richard was as helpless as she they both struggled twisting their heads but it was useless they were stuck tight shota glided across the room toward them her eyes hot and dangerous she stopped in front of kahlan he didnt need to kill you and its all right now is it mother confessor yes kahlan managed trying to sound confident as she hung helpless did it ever occur to you mother confessor that perhaps there are reasons behind what i say yes but that has all did it ever occur to you mother confessor that there is a reason why confessors are not supposed to love their mates and perhaps another reason he should have killed you kahlan couldnt answer her mind raced with frantic thoughts what are you talking about richard demanded shota ignored him did it mother confessor kahlans throat was so dry she had to swallow twice before she could speak what do you mean what reason have you lain with this man you love have you done that yet mother confessor it was kahlans turn to blush what kind of question is that to ask someone answer the question mother confessor shota hissed or i will skin you right now and use your hide to make myself something pretty i am of a mind to do it anyway you had better not even think of lying to me i we no and what business is it of yours anyway shota stepped closer her eyes sent a silent shriek through kahlan maybe youd better think twice before you do mother confessor what do you mean she breathed wideeyed shota folded her arms across her breasts her voice became more menacing confessors are not supposed to love their mates because if they bear a male child she has to ask the husband to kill the baby the husband is supposed to have been taken by the confessors power so that he will do whatever she asks without question but shota stepped even closer her eyes filled with fury if you love him how could you ask that of him how could you ask richard to kill his son do you think he would would you would you kill the son of the man you love would you mother confessor shotas words knifed into kahlans heart and soul leaving her barely able to whisper the answer no she felt her hopes and happiness collapsing in the joy of finding she could be with richard she hadnt given any thought to the future to the consequences to children she had thought only of richard and her being together shota was screaming at her and then what mother confessor you will raise him and you will visit upon the world a male confessor a male confessor she unfolded her arms her whiteknuckled fists dropping to her sides you will bring the world to the dark times again the dark times because of you because you love this man did you ever think of that you ignorant child the lump in kahlans throat threatened to choke her she wanted to run from shota but she couldnt move not all male confessors are that way almost every one is almost every one she pointed a single finger at richard without looking at him are you going to risk the world because you love this man risk sending everyone into the terror of the dark times just because you would selfishly want the son of this man to live shota richards voice was surprisingly calm most confessors bear girls you are worrying about something that probably wont even happen we may not even have children not all couples conceive you are extending your worries along a lot of forks in the road richard suddenly slid down the wall landing with a grunt in a rage shota grabbed his shirt in her fists and lifted him slamming him against the wall knocking the wind from his lungs do you think i am as stupid as you i know the flow of time i am a witch woman i told you before i know how certain events flow and unfold if you lie with this woman she will have a male child she is a confessor every confessor bears a confessor always if you give her a child it will be a boy she slammed him against the wall again kahlan winced at the sound of his head hitting the wall shotas behavior was frightening and seemed out of character she had impressed kahlan before as menacing in the extreme but she also seemed intelligent and reasonable at least to an extent she seemed different now unstable richard didnt try to remove her hands but kahlan could see he was getting angry shota she slammed him up against the wall again keep your tongue still or i will cut it out richards rage looked to match shotas you were wrong before shota wrong there are many ways for events to flow forward in time had i listened to you the last time and killed kahlan when you wanted me to darken rahl would rule us all now and it would have been because i followed your stupid advice it was through her that i defeated darken rahl if i had done as you wished we would have lost his chest heaved as he glared at her if you have come all this way to threaten us about some perceived threat you have wasted your time i didnt do it your way the last time and i will not do it your way now i will not kill her nor will i give her up on your word on anyones shota stared at him a moment and then removed her hands from his shirt i did not come here about some perceived threat to the future she whispered i did not come here to argue with you about making babies with confessors richard rahl richard jerked back in shock im not i came here because i may want to kill you for what you have done richard rahl that you two ignorant children want to go make babies is a flea on the back of the true monster you have already created why are you calling me that richard whispered shota studied his pale face because that is who you are i am richard cypher george cypher was my father you were raised by a man named cypher you were sired by one named darken rahl he raped your mother richards face turned whiter kahlan ached for him she understood now knew it was true this was what she had seen in him she had seen the face of his father darken rahl she tried desperately to free herself to go to him but couldnt richard shook his head no thats not true it just isnt possible true shota snapped your father was darken rahl your grandfather is zeddicus zul zorander zedd he whispered zedd is my grandfather he straightened darken rahl no he cant be its not true he turned and looked up at kahlan he saw it in her face saw that she knew it was he turned back to shota zedd would have told me he would have i dont believe you i dont care she said in a flat tone i dont care what you believe i know the truth her emotion came back and the truth is you are the bastard son of a bastard son of a bastard son and each one of those bastard sons all the way back had the gift worse zedd has the gift you have the gift but it is from two bloodlines of wizards she glared at his wide eyes you are a very dangerous person richard rahl richard looked like he might fall down you have the gift in this case i would be more inclined to call it a curse i would agree with you about that richard whispered you know you have the gift we are going to have no argument about that richard could only nod the rest of it i could not care less about you are the son of darken rahl and on the other side the grandson of zeddicus zul zorander he is the father of your mother if you choose to ignore the truth of that i dont care believe as you will delude yourself as you will i am not here to argue your ancestry richard leaned back until the wall stopped him he ran his fingers through his hair go away shota please go away his voice sounded as if all life had gone out of him i dont want to hear anything else you have to say just go away leave me alone i am disappointed in you richard i dont care i didnt know you were this stupid i dont care i thought george cypher meant something to you i thought you had some kind of honor his head came up what do you mean george cypher raised you gave you his time his love he taught you cared for you provided for you shaped you and you would throw that away because someone else raped your mother that is what is important to you richards eyes lit with fire his hands started coming up kahlan thought he was going to try to strangle shota but then his hands sank back to his sides but if darken rahl is my father shota threw her arms up in the air what you are suddenly going to start acting like him you are going to spontaneously start doing vile things because you now know you fear you will go out and kill innocent people because you learned your real father is darken rahl you will ignore the things you learned from george cypher because you find your name is rahl and you call yourself the seeker i am disappointed in you richard i thought you were your own man not the reflection of others impressions of your ancestors richard hung his head as shota frowned angrily and watched him in silence at last he took a deep breath im sorry shota thank you for not letting me be any more stupid than i already am his eyes were wet as he turned to kahlan please shota let her down kahlan felt the pressure lift and she slid down the wall her boots thumping against the ground the glare shota gave her made her stay where she was even though she wanted to go to richard he stared at his boots shota put her fingers under his chin and lifted his head you should be happy your father was not ugly some of his looks are the only thing of his you have that and a bit of his temper and the gift richard pulled his chin away from her fingers the gift i dont want the gift i dont want anything to do with it i wouldnt call anything i got from darken rahl a gift i hate it i hate magic it comes from zedd too shota said with surprising compassion from both sides that is the way you get the gift it is passed down sometimes skipping one or even many generations sometimes not you received it from both sides in you it is more than a single dimension it is a very dangerous mix passed down like any other deformity with a sneer shota gripped his face in her long fingers remember that before you lie with her from kahlan the boy would be a confessor from you he would have the gift can you even fathom the danger of that can you conceive of a confessor with the gift a male confessor i doubt you can you should have killed her when i told you to you ignorant child before you found a way to be with her you should have killed her richard glared at her ive heard enough of that talk i intend to hear no more of it i told you before it is through kahlan i defeated darken rahl had i killed her he would have won i hope you didnt waste your journey here just to repeat this nonsense no shota said quietly none of these things matter that is not why i am here i came because of what you have done not because of what you might do someday what you have already done richard is worse than anything you could ever do with this woman no monster you conceive with her could equal the monster you have already created richard frowned i stopped darken rahl from ruling the world i killed him i created no monster she shook her head slowly the magic of orden killed him i told you he mustnt open a box you didnt kill him you let him open one of the boxes of orden the magic of orden killed him you were supposed to kill him before he opened one of the boxes i couldnt that was the only way there was no other way to kill him and what difference does it make anyway hes dead it would have been better if you had let him win than let him open the wrong box youre crazy what could be worse than darken rahl gaining the magic of orden and ruling the world unchallenged her eyebrows lifted the keeper she whispered it would have been better to let darken rahl rule us or behead us or even torture us to death than what you have allowed to happen what are you talking about the keeper of the underworld is kept in his place kept from the world of the living by the veil the veil holds him and his minions back holds the underworld back it keeps the dead from the living what you have done has torn that veil already some of the keepers assassins have been loosed the screelings richard whispered shota nodded yes by freeing the magic of orden you have allowed its magic to somehow tear the veil to the underworld if it tears enough the keeper will be freed you cant even conceive of what that means shota lifted the agiel at his neck it will make what was done to you with this seem like a lovers kiss compared to what he will do to everyone it would have been better to have let darken rahl win than to have let this happen you have condemned everyone to a fate beyond horror she gripped the agiel in her fist i should kill you for what you have done i should make you suffer unspeakably do you have any idea how much the keeper would like to settle his gaze upon one with the gift do you have any idea how much he wants those with the gift or how much he wants witch women kahlan saw tears run down shotas cheeks with a flush of understanding that sent an icy ripple of panic through her kahlan realized shota wasnt angry she was afraid that was why she was here not because she was angry at kahlan being alive or at them having a child she was here because she was terrified the idea of shota a witch woman being afraid was worse than anything her own mind could conjure richard stared at her his eyes wide but there must be something we can do some way to stop it we she screamed jabbing her finger at his chest you only you richard rahl only you only you can fix it me why me i dont know she cried through gritted teeth but you are the only one with the power she pounded her fist against his chest you she kept hitting his chest as he just stood there you are the only one who has a chance i dont know why but only you can fix it only you can repair the tear in the veil shota was sobbing now only you you stupid foolish child kahlan was dazed by the magnitude of what was happening the idea of the keeper being loose was beyond comprehension the dead in the world of the living she couldnt imagine the horror of it but seeing shotas fear put dimension to the dread shota i dont know anything about it i dont have any idea of how to shota was still hitting his chest as she cried you must you must find a way you have no idea what the keeper would do to me what hed do to a witch woman if you wont do it for me do it for yourself he would be no easier on you than me and if you wont do it for yourself do it for kahlan he would have her for an eternity of pain for no other reason than that you love her he would do it to her just to make it worse for you we will all be held on the cusp between life and death for all eternity twisting in anguish she was sobbing uncontrollably now our souls will be stripped from us he will have our souls forever shota hit richards chest again he put his arms around her and pulled her against him comforting her as she cried forever richard soulless minds trapped by the dead an eternity of torment you are too stupid to even comprehend it you could never even imagine the horror of it until it happens kahlan stood next to richard putting her hand reassuringly on his shoulder she felt no anger at the sight of him comforting shota she could see how terrified the witch woman was kahlan couldnt share the same level of terror because she didnt know the things shota knew but in some ways seeing shotas reaction was knowing enough screelings came into the reach she cried richard looked down at her screelings in agaden reach screelings and a wizard a particularly nasty wizard samuel and i escaped with little more than our lives a wizard with his hands on her shoulders richard pushed her away what do you mean a wizard there are no other wizards there is one in the reach the screelings and the wizard are in agaden reach now they are in my home my home kahlan couldnt hold her tongue shota are you sure it was a wizard could it be someone pretending to be a wizard there are no more wizards except zedd they are all dead shota gave a tearful frown do you think anyone could deceive me about having magic i know a wizard when i see one and i know a wizard with the gift i know wizards fire this one is a wizard with the gift young though he is i dont know where he came from or why no one knew of him but he was with screelings screelings that can mean only one thing this wizard has given himself over to the keeper he is doing the keepers bidding he is working to tear the veil the rest of the way for the keeper it means the keeper has agents in this world darken rahl was probably one of them that is why he was able to use subtractive magic shota turned to richard that the keeper is using wizards means that it must take a wizard to tear the veil you have the gift you are a wizard a stupid wizard but a wizard nonetheless i dont know why but you are the only one with a chance to close the tear richard brushed a tear from shotas cheek what are you going to do the fire came back to shotas eyes her teeth clenched i am going back to the reach i am going to take back my home but they chased you out they took me by surprise she snapped i only came here to tell you how stupid you are and that you must do something about it you must close the tear or we are all shota turned her back to them i am going back to the reach the keeper is going to lose his agent i am going to take the gift from him do you know how to remove the gift from a wizard no richard looked interested i didnt know it could be done oh yes it can be done she turned and arched an eyebrow if you rip their skin off the magic bleeds from them that is the only way to remove the gift from a wizard i am going to hang him up by his thumbs and then i am going to skin him alive every inch of him then i am going to use his skin to cover my throne then i am going to sit on my throne on his skin and watch him scream to death as the magic bleeds from him she made a fist or i am going to die trying shota i need some help i dont know anything about all this shota stared off flexing her fists at last her hands relaxed and opened there is nothing i can tell you that will help you mean there is something you can tell me but it wont help shota nodded richard sighed what is it she folded her arms against her stomach her eyes were wet again you will be trapped in time dont ask what that means because i dont know you will have no chance of closing the veil unless you escape the trap it will keep you locked away and the keeper will escape unless you are able to free yourself unless you learn something of the gift you have no chance for either richard walked to the far side of the room he stood with his back to them one hand on a hip his other combing through his hair kahlan didnt look at shota she didnt want to meet the witch womans gaze if she didnt have to is there anything else richard called over his shoulder anything you can tell me anything no and believe me if there was i would be more than anxious to offer it i dont wish to meet the keepers gaze richard thought by himself for a time at last he came back and stood before shota i am having headaches bad headaches shota nodded the gift three women came they call themselves the sisters of the light they said i have to come with them to learn to use the gift or the headaches will kill me richard studied her face what do you know about them i am a witch woman i dont know much about wizards but the sisters of the light have something to do with wizards with training them that is all i know i dont even know where they are from they come once in a great while when they find one has been born with the gift what if i dont go with them will i die as they say if you dont learn to control the gift the headaches will kill you that much i know but are they the only way shota shrugged i dont know but i know you must learn to use the gift or you will not escape the trap or be able to close the veil or even survive the headaches so you are saying you think i should go no i said you must learn to use the gift there may be another way what way i dont know richard i dont even know if there is another way im sorry but i can be of no help in this i just dont know only a fool will give advice about something she doesnt understand i can give you no advice in this shota richard pleaded im lost i dont know what to do i dont understand any of it the sisters the gift or the keeper isnt there anything you can tell me to help me i have told you everything i know i feel as lost as you worse i have no ability to influence what will happen at least you have that dim as the chance is shotas eyes glistened i fear i am going to look into the keepers dead eyes forever i havent been able to sleep since i learned these things if i knew anything i would help i just dont know anything about the world of the dead it is not something the living have faced yet richard stared at the ground shota he whispered i dont have any idea what to do im afraid im very afraid she nodded so am i she reached out and touched his face goodbye richard rahl dont fight who you are use it she turned to kahlan i dont know if you can help him but if there is a way i know you will do your best kahlan nodded that i will shota i hope you get your home back shota gave her a small smile thank you mother confessor she turned and glided to the door her wispy dress flowing behind she pushed the door open samuel was waiting on the other side his yellow eyes shining shota stopped in the doorway and stiffened richard if you should happen to somehow close the veil and save me from the keeper save everyone from the keeper i will be forever grateful to you thank you shota her back was still to them but know this if you give the mother confessor a child it will be a boy it will be a confessor neither of you will have the strength to kill him even though you know the consequences she paused a moment my mother lived in the dark times her voice was like ice i have the strength and i will use it you have my word on that but know that it will not be personal the door squeaked closed behind her the spirit house felt suddenly very empty very quiet kahlan felt numb she looked down at her hands they were shaking she wanted richard to hug her but he didnt do it he was staring at the door his face was white as snow i dont believe this he whispered he still stared at the door how can this be happening am i dreaming all this kahlan felt as if her knees were about to buckle richard what are we going to do richard turned to her his eyes distant they filled with tears this has to be a nightmare if it is im having the same one richard what are we going to do why does everyone ask me that why does everyone always ask me what makes everyone think i am the one who knows kahlan stood woodenly trying to make her mind work she couldnt seem to form a coherent thought because you are richard you are the seeker i dont know anything about the underworld the keeper the world of the dead shota says no one living does richard seemed to come out of his daze abruptly he grabbed her shoulders then we must ask the dead what the ancestors spirits are dead we can talk to them i can ask for a gathering and ask them questions we can learn from them maybe we can find out how to close the veil maybe i can find out how to stop the headaches how to use the gift he gripped her arm come on kahlan almost smiled he was indeed the seeker richard pulled her through the passageways running when they could see well enough clouds hid the moon and it was dark between the buildings the air was like ice on her face making tears run from the corners of her eyes when they reached the open field there was light torches lit the people gathered there they were all still bunched together with hunters shielding everyone they didnt know the witch woman was gone the entire village watched in silence as the two of them crossed the opening the hunters parting for them as they approached the bird man and the other six elders chandalen stood to their side everyone is safe kahlan reassured them the witch woman is gone there was a collective sigh of relief chandalen thumped the butt of his spear on the ground again you bring trouble richard ignored him and asked her to translate he took in the elders and let his gaze settle on the bird man honored elder the witch woman was not here to harm anyone she was here to warn me about a great danger you claim chandalen snapped we do not know this to be true kahlan knew richard was struggling to keep calm do you doubt that if she wanted to send you to the spirit world she could have done it chandalen answered only with a glare the bird man gave chandalen a look that seemed to shrink him a few inches he looked to richard what danger she says we are in danger of the dead escaping into the world of the living they cannot come into the world of the living the veil keeps them back you know of the veil yes each level of the dead the underworld as you call it is sealed with a veil when we hold a gathering we invite our ancestors spirits to visit us and they are able to come through the veil for a short time richard studied the bird mans face a moment what else can you tell me about the veil the other shrugged nothing we know only what our ancestors spirits have told us about it that they must pass through it to come to us when we call them and that it holds them back the rest of the time they tell us that there are many levels of the underworld the dead and that they are in the uppermost level and so they can come those who are not honored are in lower levels and may not come their spirits are locked away forever richard met the eyes of all the elders the veil is torn if it isnt sealed again the world of the dead will swallow us all gasps spread back through the gathered people fearful whispering broke out richards gaze went back to the bird man please honored elder i request a gathering i must have the help of our ancestors spirits i must find a way to seal the veil before the keeper of the dead escapes the spirit ancestors may be able to help i must know if they can help chandalen thumped his spear lies you carry us the lies of a witch woman we should not call the honored spirits of our ancestors for the words of a witch woman the spirits of our ancestors are called only for our people not a witch woman they will strike all our people dead for such blasphemy richard glared at him they are not being called by a witch woman it is i who makes the request and i am one of the mud people i ask for the gathering to help me keep our people from being harmed you bring death to us you bring strangers you bring the witch woman you only wish to help yourself how did this veil become torn richard unbuttoned his sleeve and pushed it up his arm he slowly pulled the sword of truth holding chandalens glare he drew the sword across his forearm turning it to wipe both sides in the blood he jammed the point in the ground and rested both hands over the hilt kahlan i want you to translate something dont leave out a single word richard returned his glare to chandalen his voice was calm almost gentle but his eyes shone with lethal intent chandalen if i hear one more word from you tonight even if it is to agree with me and offer your help i will kill you some of the things the witch woman told me have put me in the mood to kill if you give me any more reason it will be you i kill the eyes of all the elders widened chandalen opened his mouth to say something but at seeing the look on richards face he shut his mouth and folded his arms his glower was fierce but no match for richards at last he glanced to the ground richard spoke again to the bird man honored elder you know my heart you know i would do nothing to harm our people i would not ask this if it were not important or if i had any other choice please may i have a gathering so i may ask our ancestors spirits how i can stop this threat to our people the bird man turned to the other elders each nodded in turn kahlan knew they would it was only a formality savidlin was their friend and the others had dealt with richard before there was not one of them who wanted to challenge him the real decision was the bird mans he watched each elder nod and then turned back to richard this is bad business i do not like calling the ancestors to ask about their world it is our world they come to help us with they may be displeased they may be angered they may say no he watched richard a moment but i know your heart i know you are a savior to our people and you would not ask if you had any other choice he laid a firm hand on richards shoulder granted kahlan sighed in relief richard nodded his thanks kahlan knew he didnt look forward to meeting the ancestors spirits again the last time had been devastating to him suddenly there was a flutter of shadow in the air kahlan threw her hands up protectively richard was knocked back a step as something hit him on the head people shouted in confusion a dark shape thumped to the ground between richard and the bird man richard straightened putting his fingers to his scalp blood trickled down his forehead the bird man squatted down over a dark form and then straightened he was holding a dead owl cradled in his hands the head lolled to the side the wings fell open the elders all looked at one another chandalens frown deepened but he said nothing richard inspected the blood on his fingers why in the world would an owl hit me like that and what killed it the bird man gently smoothed the dead birds feathers birds live in the air a different level than us they live in two levels land and air they can travel between their level and ours birds are closely connected to the spirit world to the spirits owls more than most birds they see in the night where we are blind just as we are blind to the spirit world i am a spirit guide for our people only a bird man can be a spirit guide because he can understand such things he held the dead bird a little higher this is a warning i have never witnessed an owl bringing a spirit message before this bird gave its life to warn you richard please reconsider your request for a gathering this warning means the gathering will be dangerous dangerous enough for the spirits to send this message richard looked from the bird mans face to the owl he reached out and stroked its feathers no one made a sound dangerous for me or for the elders for you you are the one calling for the gathering the owl brought the message to you the warning was for you he glanced up at richards forehead a blood warning one of the worst kinds the only thing worse than an owl would have been if a raven had brought the message that would have meant sure death richard took his hand back and wiped his fingers on his shirt he stared down at the dead owl i dont have any choice he whispered if i dont do something the veil will be torn and the keeper of the dead will escape our people everyone will be swallowed into the world of the dead i must learn how to stop it i must try the bird man nodded as you wish it will take three days to prepare richard looked up you did it in two days before we cant spare any time the elder took a deep breath and sighed two days thank you honored elder richard turned to her his eyes were filled with pain kahlan please find nissel and bring her im going to the spirit house ask her to bring something stronger she squeezed his arm of course ill hurry richard nodded he pulled his sword from the ground and walked off into the darkness chapter cause of death she looked up in thought pressing the round end of the plain woodenhandled pen to her lower lip the small modest room was dimly lit with candles set among and on top of the disheveled piles of papers on her desk scrolls were balanced precariously in stacks between fat books the dark patina of the desktop was only visible in a small area in front of her framing the waiting report odd objects of magic stood jammed together collecting dust on the shelves behind her the everpresent and diligent cleaning staff was not allowed to touch them and so the task of dusting them was left to her but there was never enough time or inclination besides they looked less important to curious eyes when covered in a mask of dust heavy drapes were drawn against the night the only splash of color in the room was one of the local blueandyellow carpets she had placed on the other side of the desk visitors usually spent their time in her office staring down at it cause of death reports were such a bother she sighed but a necessary bother for now anyway the palace of the prophets required reams of reports there were sisters who spent their whole lives in the libraries cataloging reports pampering them keeping records of every useless word they thought might someday be important well there was nothing for it but to think up a suitable cause of death the truth would never do her sisters would have to have a satisfactory explanation as to the cause of death they valued highly those with the gift fools training accident she smiled yes a training accident she hadnt used that one in many years she pursed her lips as she dipped the pen in the ink bottle and began writing the cause of death was a training accident with the radahan a twig as i have often warned the other sisters no matter how young and tender will break if bent too far who could question let them wonder where among them the fault lay it would keep them from digging too deeply lest the blame fall on them as she blotted the paper there was a soft rap at the door one moment please she touched the corner of the boys letter to the candle flame and when it was nearly consumed tossed it in the cold hearth the broken seal melted into a molten red puddle he would be writing no more letters come the heavy roundtopped door opened enough to admit a head sister its me came a whisper from the shadow dont stand there like a novice come in and close the door the woman entered closing the door quietly after putting her head back out to check the hall she didnt look down at the carpet sister with a finger across lips and an angry scowl she was silenced no names when we are alone ive told you before the other looked about at the walls as if expecting someone to pop out but surely youve shielded your room of course its shielded but it is always possible the breeze could carry words to the right ears if that ever happened we wouldnt want our names carried with the words now would we the others eyes flicked around at the walls again of course not of course you are right she scrubbed her hands together someday this wont be necessary i hate that we must remain hidden someday we will be able to what have you found out she watched as the woman straightened her dress at the hips and then put her fingers to the desk leaning over a little her eyes had a fierce intensity they were strange eyes pale pale blue with dark violet flecks she always found it hard not to stare at those eyes she leaned closer and whispered theyve found him you saw the book she nodded slowly i saw it at dinnertime i waited until the others were at dinner she gave an even look he refused the first offer she slapped her hand down on the desk what are you sure thats what the book said and not only that there was more hes grown grown into a man grown she took a heavy breath as she watched the sister standing before her which sister was it what difference does it make they are all ours no they werent i wasnt able to send three of our own only two one is a sister of the light the others eyes widened how could you let that happen something as important as this she slapped her hand down on the desk again silence the other straightened knitting her fingers together a small pout came to her face it was sister grace she closed her eyes and leaned back in the chair sister grace was one of ours she whispered the other leaned over the desk again then only one of the two remaining is ours who is it sister elizabeth or sister verna that is not for you to know why not i hate never knowing i hate not knowing if the sister im talking to is a sister of the light or one of us a sister of the dark she slammed her fist on the desk and gritted her teeth dont you ever say that out loud again she hissed or i will send you to the nameless one in pieces this time the other stared down at the carpet as her face paled forgive me she whispered there isnt a sister of the light alive who believes we are anything but myth if that name ever reaches their ears they could begin to wonder that name is never ever to be spoken aloud by you if the sisters were to ever discover you or who you serve they would have a radahan around your neck before you had a chance to scream the others hands went to her throat as she let out a small gasp but i you would claw your own eyes out for fear of seeing them come to question you every day that is why you are not to know the names of the others so you cant give them over that is why they dont know your name so they cant give you over it is to protect us all so we may serve the only name you know is mine but sister i would bite my own tongue off before i ever gave them your name you say that now but were there a radahan around your neck you would be begging to give me up just to have it off and it isnt my forgiveness that matters if you fail us the nameless one will not be forgiving when you meet his eyes it will make whatever could be done to you with the radahan while you were alive seem a pleasant time at tea but i serve i am sworn i have given the oath those who serve well will be rewarded when the nameless one is free of the veil those who fail him or fight him will have an eternity to regret their mistake of course sister she was staring furiously at the carpet now i live only to serve she knitted her fingers back together i will not fail our master on my oath on your soul her defiant violet flecked eyes came up i have given my oath she nodded as she sank back in the chair as have we all sister as have we all she stared at the others eyes a moment did the book say anything else i didnt have time to search it thoroughly but there were some other things i caught he is with the mother confessor he is promised as her mate she frowned the mother confessor she waved her hand that is no problem what else he is the seeker she slapped her hand on the desk curse the light she let out a noisy breath the seeker well we can deal with that anything more the other nodded slowly leaning closer he is strong and grown yet only two days after he triggered the gift the headaches made him unconscious she rose slowly out of her chair this time it was her eyes that went wide two days she whispered are you sure two days the other shrugged i am only telling you what the book said im sure of what it said im not sure it is true i dont see how it could be she sank back into her chair two days she stared at her desk the sooner we get a radahan around his neck the better even the sisters of the light would agree with you about that there was a message sent back from the prelate she lifted an eyebrow the prelate herself sent orders the other nodded yes under her breath she added i wish i knew if she was with us or against us she ignored the comment what did she say that if he refuses the third offer sister verna is to kill him herself have you ever heard of such an order if he is really this strong and he refuses the third time he would be dead in a few weeks anyway why would she give such an order have you ever heard of anyone refusing the first offer well no i guess i havent it is one of the rules if one with the gift refuses all three offers they are to be killed to spare them the suffering at the end the madness you have never seen such an order before because you have never heard of anyone refusing the first offer i have spent time in the archives looking through the prophecies that is where i saw reference to the rule the prelate knows all the obscure rules the old rules and she is afraid she has read the prophecies too afraid she asked wideeyed the prelate i have never seen her afraid of anything she nodded up at the woman she is afraid now either way suits our purposes either he is collared or he is dead if he is collared we will deal with him in our way as we have always done if he is dead we wont have to maybe better he were dead maybe better he were dead before the sisters of the light find out what he is if they dont already know the other leaned over the desk again lowering her voice if they know or find out there are those among the sisters of the light who would kill him she studied the violet flecks a moment indeed there are a smile spread across her face what a dangerous dilemma for them what a glorious opportunity for us her smile faded what of the other matter the woman straightened ranson and weber are waiting where you wanted them she folded her arms beneath hei breasts they were pretty cocky because they have passed all the tests and tomorrow are to be released a sadistic grin came to her thin lips and flecked eyes i gave them a little reminder that they still wear the collar im surprised we cant hear their knees knocking together all the way up here she ignored the others smile i have lessons to give you will go in my place tell them i had reports to work on ill go see to our two friends they may have passed all the prelates tests but they have not yet passed all of mine one has an oath to give and the other she leaned halfway over the desk hunger in her flecked eyes which one which one are you going to oh i so wish i could watch or help promise me you will tell me everything she smiled at the others eagerness everything i promise from beginning to end every last scream now go see to my lessons for me the woman danced through the doorway like a giddy schoolgirl she was too eager that kind of eagerness was dangerous that kind of lust made one forget to be careful made one take chances she pulled a knife from a drawer and made a mental note to use her less in the future and keep an eye on her she tested the edge gingerly with a thumb and satisfied it was razor sharp tucked the knife up her sleeve the sleeve without the dacra she plucked a small dusty statue from the shelf and slipped it into a pocket before she was around the desk and through the door she remembered one more item and turned back to pick up the stout rod leaning against the side of her desk it was late and the halls were quiet and mostly empty despite the heat she pulled her short thin blue cotton cloak tighter across her shoulders thoughts of this new one with the gift gave her a chill grown a man she shook her head as she walked silently over the long carpets past lamps set in wall brackets centered in the raised cherry paneling past tables set with dried flowers and past heavily draped windows looking out over the bailey and courtyard below lights of the city in the distance twinkled like a carpet of stars slightly rank air drifted in the windows must be near low tide she thought the cleaning staff polishing a chairrail molding here or a banister there dropped into deep curtsies as she swept past she hardly noticed them and certainly didnt acknowledge them they were beneath her attention grown into a man her face heated with anger at the thought how could this be someone had made a serious mistake a mistake an oversight it had to be that a maidservant on her hands and knees concentrating on wiping at a spot on a carpet looked up just in time to leap back out of the way with a forgive me sister on her hands and knees she touched her head to the floor with another apology grown it would have been difficult enough to turn this one if he were still a boy but a man she shook her head again grown she smacked the rod against her thigh in frustration two maidservants nearby jumped at the sound and fell to their knees burying their tightly closed eyes behind prayerful hands well grown or not he would have a radahan around his neck and a whole palace full of sisters to watch over him but even wearing a radahan he was still grown into a man and the seeker he might be difficult to control dangerously difficult if necessary she guessed he could always have a training accident if not that there were certainly enough other dangers to one with the gift dangers that could leave a man worse than dead but if she could turn him or use him that would make all the trouble worthwhile she turned into a hall she at first thought empty then noticed a young woman standing in the shadows between lamps gazing out a window she thought she recognized her one of the novices she stopped behind the young woman and folded her arms the novice tapped her toe on the carpet as she leaned on her elbows through the opened window looking at the gates below she cleared her throat the young woman spun gasped and dropped into a curtsy forgive me sister i didnt hear you coming a good evening to you when the big brown eyes came up she put the end of the rod under the young womans chin and lifted it a little more pasha isnt it yes sister pasha maes novice third rank next in line to be named next in line she sniffed presumption my dear does not befit a sister and less so a novice even one of the third rank pasha cast her eyes down and gave a curtsy as best she could with the rod still under her chin yes sister forgive me what are you doing here just watching sister watching the night watching the night i would say you were watching the gates am i wrong novice pasha tried to look down but the rod lifted her chin keeping her eyes to her superior no sister she admitted you are not wrong i was watching the gates she licked her full lips several times at last she spilled out the words i heard the talk the talk among the girls they say well they say three of the sisters have been gone a long time now and that could only mean they are bringing back one with the gift a new one in all the years i have been here ihave never seen a new one brought in she licked her lips again well i am i mean i hope to be next in line and if i am to be named i will have to be assigned a new one she knitted her fingers together i so want to be named a sister i have studied hard worked hard waited and waited and no new one has come yet forgive me sister but i just cant help being excited and hopeful that i will be worthy so yes i was watching the gate hoping i would see him brought in and you think you are strong enough to handle the job to handle a new one yes sister i study and practice my forms every day she looked down her nose at the novice is that so show me as they stared at each other she felt her feet rise off the ground a few inches solid grip of air strong not bad she wondered if the novice could handle interference with that thought fire ignited at both ends of the hall sweeping with a howl toward the two women pasha didnt flinch the fire hit a wall of air before reaching them air was not the best for fire a small error pasha quickly corrected before the fire burned through the air became moist dripping the fire hissed out although she didnt try to move she knew she couldnt she could feel that the grip held her firmly she turned it cold brittle with ice and broke it when she was free she lifted pasha from the floor defensive webs from the girl wove through her snaking onslaught but failed to break the grip her feet rose again impressive the girl could counter even while being held spells tangled together conflicting fighting snarling into knots each matched and defended striking back at any opportunity the silent motionless battle raged on for a time the two of them hanging inches off the ground at last she tired of the sport and severed herself from the webs tying them to the girl locking them on she settled gently to the ground and left pasha with the whole weight of the load to juggle a simple if devious escape giving the opponent not only the attacking spells to deal with but dumping her own back on her pasha hadnt been expecting this and wasnt able to defend against it it was not the way she had been taught sweat ran down the novices face as she grimaced slightly the force radiating through the hall made carpets curl up at their corners lamps chattered in their brackets pasha was getting angry her brow wrinkled with a loud crack that shattered a mirror far off down the hall she broke the spells her slippered feet settled to the ground pasha took a few deep breaths i have not seen that done before sister it is not by the rules she put the rod back under the others chin rules are for childrens games you are no longer a child when you are a full sister you must deal with situations where there are no rules you must be prepared for that if you always stick to somebodys rules you may find yourself at the point of a very sharp knife held by a hand that doesnt know about your rules pasha didnt flinch yes sister thank you for showing me she smiled inwardly but kept it off her face this one had a spine if a small one a rare commodity in a novice even one of the third rank she let her eyes take in pasha again soft brown hair that just touched her shoulders big brown eyes attractive features lips of the sort men stared at proud upright shoulders and a sweep of curves that even a novices dress failed to conceal she let the rod trail from pashas chin down her neck down into the heart of her exposed cleavage grown into a man and since when pasha she said in a quiet voice that could have been taken for either threatening or kind have novices been allowed to wear their dresses unbuttoned like this pasha blushed furiously forgive me sister its such a warm night i was alone i didnt think there was anyone about i just wanted to let the breeze cool my skin her face turned a deeper red i sweat so there i never meant to offend anyone im so embarrassed forgive me pashas hands rushed to the buttons with the rod she gently pushed the hands away from the swell of the young womans bosom the creator made you this way you should not be embarrassed of what he has chosen in his wisdom to bestow upon you you should never be ashamed pasha of what he has graced you with only those of questionable loyalty to the creator would scorn you for being proud of showing the makers hand in all its magnificence why thank you sister i never looked at it in quite that way a frown wrinkled her brow what do you mean questionable loyalty she pulled the rod away and lifted an eyebrow those who worship the nameless one dont hide in the shadows my dear they could be anywhere why even you could be one even me pasha fell to a knee bowing her head oh please sister she implored dont say such a thing of yourself even in jest you are a sister of the light and we are in the palace of the prophets safe i pray from the whispers of the nameless one safe with her rod she motioned the novice up after she was on her feet she gave her a stern look only a fool assumes she is safe even here sisters of the light are not fools even they must always be alert to the dark whispers yes sister i will remember remember it any time someone would make you ashamed of how the creator has formed you ask yourself why they blush at seeing the makers hand blush as the nameless one would yes sister thank you she stammered you have given me things to think on i have never thought about the creator in this way before he has reasons for the things he does is this not true what do you mean well when he gives a man a strong back what does that say everyone knows that he was given the strong back to use it means the creator has given him the strong back so that he might work to feed his family work to make his way work to make the creator proud and not waste the creators gift by being lazy she whisked the rod up and down in front of pasha and what do you think the creator had in mind when he gave you this body i dont know exactly that i should use it to make the creator proud of his work in some way she nodded you think on it you think on your reason for being here being here at this time we are all here for a reason the sisters of the light are here for a reason are they not oh yes sister we are here to teach the ones with the gift teach them to use it and guide them so they may not hear the whispers of the nameless one that they may hear only the creator and how are we able to do that we were given the gift of being sorceresses so that we may be able to guide them in their gift and if the creator was wise enough to give you that gift the gift of being a sorceress do you not think he may have given you your looks for a reason too maybe to be a part of your calling as a sister of the light to use your looks to serve him pasha stared why i never thought of it that way before in what way are my looks to be of aid she shrugged we cannot always know what the creator has intended when he wishes it will be revealed yes sister her voice was unsure pasha when you see a man that the creator has graced with good looks a finely shaped body what do you think what do you feel pasha blushed i sometimes it makes my heart race i guess it makes me feel good feel longings at last she allowed a small smile there is no need to blush my dear it is a longing to touch what the creators hand has wrought dont you suppose it pleases the creator that you appreciate his work dont you think he wants you to like what he has done to enjoy it just as you must know that men enjoy witnessing your beauty and long to touch the work of the creators hand it would be a crime against the creator not to use in your service to him what he has given you pasha smiled shyly i never thought about it in that way you have given me new eyes sister the more i learn the more it seems i dont know i hope that someday i will be a sister of the light half as wise as you knowledge comes as it will pasha lifes lessons come at the most surprising times like tonight she swished the rod toward the window here you are looking out a window hoping to learn one thing and you have learned something more important pasha touched her arm oh thank you sister for taking the time to teach me no sister has spoken so frankly to me before this is one lesson pasha that is outside the palace curriculum it is a lesson the nameless one would be angry you learned so keep it to yourself as you think on what i have told you and the creators hand is revealed you will understand better how it is to work for him and if you need more understanding i will always be here to help guide you but keep our talk from others as i said you can never tell who listens to the whispers of the nameless one pasha curtsied i will sister thank you a novice is given many tests tests of the palaces devising there are rules to them the final test to be named a sister of the light is being charged with a new one in this the final test there are not always rules new ones can be difficult to control but that does not mean they are bad difficult of course they come here plucked from the only life they knew and are thrust into a new place with new demands they dont understand they can be rebellious difficult to control it is because they are afraid we must have patience afraid of the sisters and the palace werent you afraid when you first came here just a little well maybe just a little but it was my dream to come i wanted it more than anything for the new ones it is not always their dream they are confused about their power with you it grew as you grew you were accustomed to it it was part of you with them it is sometimes sudden unexpected not what they planned or wanted the radahan can ignite the power and it is new to them it can be frightening that fear makes them fight it sometimes fight us your job the responsibility of a novice of the third rank is to control them for their own good until they can be taught by the sisters in all your other lessons there have been rules in this there sometimes are no rules the new ones dont know of our rules yet they can be difficult to control if you follow only the rules you know sometimes the collar is not enough you must use whatever the creator has given you you must be able to do whatever it takes to control the will of these untrained wizards that is the true and final test to be a sister novices have failed in this final test and been put out of the palace pashas eyes were wide i have never heard such things she shrugged then i have been of aid to you i am pleased the creator has chosen me to help perhaps others have not wanted so strongly for you to succeed and have held back perhaps you would do well to bring to me your questions about any new one you are assigned oh yes thank you for your help sister i must admit it worries me to learn that new ones can be difficult i guess i always imagined they would be eager to learn and that it would be a joy to show them and to help teach them they are all different some are as easy as a babe in a crib let us hope you are given one like that some will test your wits why i have even seen old records that tell of ones that have triggered the gift before we could get to them before we could get a radahan on them and help them no that must be frightening for them to have the power awakened without guidance from us indeed and fear can make them troublesome as i have said i have even seen an old report of one who refused the collar on the first offer pashas fingers covered her mouth as she gasped she took them away but that means one of the sisters she nodded solemnly it is a price we are all prepared to pay we bear a heavy responsibility but why wouldnt the parents make him accept the offer she leaned closer lowering her voice tn the report i saw the one with the gift was grown a man pasha stared in wideeyed disbelief a man she whispered if a boy can be difficult to control what of a grown man she gave the novice an even look we are here to serve in the creators work you can never tell what the creator has in his plan why you are given what you have a novice in charge of a new one must use whatever the creator has given her the collar is not always enough you can never tell what you might need to do the rules dont always work do you still want to be a sister of the light even knowing you may be given a new one who could be more difficult than any other novice has ever been given oh yes yes sister if the new one is difficult i know it is a test from the creator himself to see if i am truly worthy i will not fail i will do whatever must be done i will use everything i have learned everything the creator has given me i will be on guard that he may be from a strange land or have strange customs and be afraid or troublesome or difficult and that i may have to make my own rules to succeed she hesitated and if you are so kind as to mean what you said about helping me then i know i will have your wisdom backing me and i will not fail she nodded with a smile i have given my word it holds no matter the difficulty she frowned in thought perhaps it could be that you are graced with your looks so a new one might see the beauty of the creator through you through his work perhaps this is how you are to show a new one the way it would be an honor in any way to show a new one the light of the creators hand you are right in that my dear she straightened clasping her hands now i want you to go to the mistress of the novices and tell her that you have too much free time and that starting tomorrow you need to be assigned some chores tell her you have been spending too much of your time looking out windows pasha bowed her head and curtsied again yes sister she said meekly she smiled when the novice looked up i too have heard that three of the sisters are searching for one with the gift i think it will be a while before they return with him if at all but when they return and if they bring him i will remind the prelate that you are next in line and are ready for the task oh thank you sister thank you you are a fine young woman pasha the creator has truly shown the beauty of his work in you thank you sister she said without blushing thank the creator i will sister sister before the new one is brought in could you teach me more about what the creator has intended for me help me to understand if you wish oh i do i really do she patted pashas cheek of course my dear of course she stood up straight now off to the mistress of the novices with you i wont have soontobesisters with nothing better to do than stare out windows yes sister pasha curtsied with a smile and rushed off down the hall she stopped and turned sister i am afraid i dont know your name go pasha flinched yes sister she watched the swell of pashas hips sway as she walked quickly off down the hall kicking the rolled edges of carpets back down as she went the girl had exquisite ankles grown into a man she collected her thoughts and started off again down the halls and stairs as she descended the wooden stairs changed to stone the heat lessened although not the stuffiness or the smell of the tide flats the warm glow of lamps was replaced by the flickering shadows of widely spaced torches the cowering palace staff diminished in number until she saw no one she continued down to the lowest floors below dusty storerooms down below the servants quarters and workshops the torches became more widely spaced until there were no more she ignited a ball of flame in her palm and held it up to see by as she continued on when she reached the proper door she sent the flame into a cold torch set in a bracket next to the doorway the stonewalled room was small an abandoned cellar of some sort empty except for moldy straw on the floor a lit torch and the two wizards the smell was unpleasant burning pitch and damp mold at her entrance the two stood swaying slightly both wore the plain robes befitting their high rank each had a stupid half grin on his face they werent cocky she realized they had been drinking probably celebrating their last night in the palace of the prophets their last night with the sisters of the light their last night wearing the radahan the two men had been friends since they had been brought to the palace as boys almost at the same time sam weber was a plain man of average height with curly light brown hair and a cleanshaven jaw that seemed too big for the rest of his soft face neville ranson was slightly taller with straight black hair cut short and smoothed neatly down he wore a short wellkept beard that was just beginning to show flecks of gray his eyes were almost as dark as his hair his features seemed all the more sharply formed standing next to his soft friend she had always thought he had grown into a handsome man she had known him since he had come to the palace as a small boy she had been a novice then and he had been the one assigned to her put in her care her final test before becoming a sister of the light that had been a long time ago wizard ranson swept his arm across his middle and gave a dramatic although wobbly bow he came back up with a widening grin his grin always made his face look boyish despite his years and the beginnings of gray a good evening to you sister hard as she could she backhanded him across the face with her rod she could feel his cheekbone break he fell back to the floor with a cry i have told you before she hissed through gritted teeth never to use my name when we are alone being drunk does not excuse the order wizard weber stood stone still his eyes wide his face white his grin gone ranson rolled over on the ground with his hands to his face leaving blood on the straw the color came back to webers face in a red rush how dare you do this we have passed all the tests we are wizards she sent a cord of power into the radahan the impact threw him back against the wall where the collar stuck to the stone like a nail to a magnet passed the tests she screamed passed the tests you have not passed my tests she twisted on the pain until weber was choking in agony is this how you address a sister is this the way you show respect she snipped off the cord and he fell to the floor grunting when he hit he pushed himself up on his knees with an effort forgive me sister he said in a pained hoarse voice i beg you forgive our disrespect his eyes rose cautiously to meet her glare it was only the drink speaking forgive us please with her fists on her hips she stood watching him she pointed with the rod at the one rolling and moaning on the floor heal him i dont have time for this nonsense i have come to give you both your test not to watch him whine and complain about a little slap weber bent to his friend rolling him gently over on his back neville its all right ill help you lie still he took the mans shaking hands away and replaced them with his own he began talking and healing she waited impatiently with her arms folded it didnt take long weber was talented at healing weber helped his friend sit up and with a handful of straw wiped the blood from the healed wound ranson pushed himself to his feet his eyes flashed anger but he kept any speck of it out of his voice forgive me sister what is it you want weber came up beside him please sister we have done everything the sisters have asked we are finished finished finished i dont think so have you forgotten our talks have you forgotten what i told you did you think i would forget simply let the two of you dance out of here free as birds no man walks out of here without seeing me or one of mine there is the matter of an oath the two glanced at each other retreating a half step if you will just let us go weber offered we will give you our oath she watched them a moment her voice coming quietly at last my oath it is not an oath to me boys it is an oath to the keeper you know that they both paled a little and the oath comes only after one of you has passed the test only one of you has to give the oath one of us ranson asked he swallowed only one of us has to give the oath sister why only one of us because she whispered the other will have no need to give an oath he is going to die they both gasped and moved closer together what is this test weber asked take off your robes and we will begin they glanced at each other ranson lifted his hand a little our robes sister now here she looked to each dont be bashful boys i have seen you both swim naked in the lake since you were only this big she held her hand out just below her waist but that was when we were boys weber complained not since we have grown into men she glowered at them dont make me have to tell you again the next time i will burn them off you they both flinched and began pulling their robes over their heads she made a deliberate point of looking each up and down just to show them her displeasure with their argument each mans face turned red in the torchlight with a flick of her wrist she brought her knife to her hand up against the wall both of you when they didnt move quickly enough she used the collars to slam them against the wall with a thin stream of power to each radahan she immobilized them against the stone they were flattened against the wall and helpless to lift a finger please sister ranson whispered dont kill us well do anything anything her cold gaze settled on his dark eyes yes you will one of you anyway but we havent gotten to the oath yet now still your tongue or i will do it for you as the two were held helpless she moved to weber first putting the knife tip against his upper chest she drew it slowly down carefully cutting through the skin and no more sweat poured from webers face as he gritted his teeth his jowls shook after she had made a cut about a forearm long she went back to where she had begun and made another next to it so the two cuts were about a fingers width apart small highpitched sounds escaped from the mans throat as she drew the knife along the ends of the lines drew together to a point small trickles of blood ran down his chest she worked the knifepoint under the top between the cuts separating the skin from him until there was a generous flap of it hanging down she moved over to ranson and made the same twin cuts with a flap of skin hanging away at the top tears ran down his face with the sweat but he said nothing he knew better when finished she straightened and inspected her work they looked the same good she tucked the knife back up her sleeve one of you two is going to have the radahan taken off tomorrow and be free to go as far as the sisters of the light are concerned anyway not as far as i or more importantly the keeper are concerned it will be the beginning of your service to him if you serve well you will be rewarded when he is free of the veil if you fail in your tasks well you wouldnt want to know what would happen to you if you should fail him sister ranson asked in a shaky voice why only one of us we could both give the oath we could both serve webers sudden glare shifted to his friend he didnt like being spoken for he always had been obstinate the oath is a blood oath one of you will have to pass my test to earn the privilege of taking it the other is going to lose the gift tonight lose his magic do you know how a wizard loses the gift they both shook their heads when they are skinned the magic bleeds from them she said it as if she were discussing peeling a pear bleeds away until its all gone weber stared at her his face gone white ranson closed his dark eyes and shook at the same time she wrapped the flap of skin on each man around her first fingers im going to ask for a volunteer this is just a little demonstration of what is in store for the one who volunteers i dont want either of you to think dying is going to be the easy way out she gave them a warm smile you have my permission to scream boys i believe this is going to hurt she yanked the strips of skin off their chests she waited patiently for the screams to stop and even a little while longer while they sobbed it was always good to let a lesson sink in please sister we serve the creator as the sisters have taught us weber cried we serve the creator not the keeper she regarded him coolly since you are so loyal to the creator sam i will give you first choice do you want to be the one to live or to die tonight why him ranson demanded why does he get to choose first keep your tongue still neville you will speak when spoken to she slid her gaze back to weber she lifted his chin with a finger well sam who dies you or your best friend she folded her arms across her breasts he looked up at her with hollow eyes his skin was ashen he didnt look over at his friend his voice came in a flat whisper me kill me let neville live i wont give an oath to the keeper i would rather die she looked back into his empty eyes a moment and then turned to ranson and what have you to say neville who lives who dies you or your best friend in the world who gives the keeper their oath he glanced to weber who didnt look back he licked his lips his dark eyes came back to her you heard him he chooses to die if he wants to die let him i choose to live i will give the keeper my oath your soul he nodded slowly his eyes flashing fierce determination my soul well then she smiled it seems you two friends have come to an agreement everyone is happy so be it i am pleased neville that it is to be you with us you have made me proud do i have to be here ranson asked do i have to see it see it she raised an eyebrow you have to do it he swallowed but the hard look stayed in his eyes she had always known it would be him oh not that there hadnt been doubts but she had known she had taught him well she had spent a great deal of time on him bending him to her way may i be granted one request weber whispered may i have the collar off before i die so that you may make wizards life fire and take your own life before we have a chance to take it from you do you think i am stupid a stupid soft woman she shook her head denied she released both radahan from the wall weber sank to his knees his head hanging he was alone in the room and knew it ranson stood and straightened his shoulders he pointed at the bloody wound down his chest what about this she turned her gaze to weber sam stand up weber stood his eyes staying to the ground your good friend has an injury heal him without a word weber finally turned and put his hands on ransons chest and began healing ranson stood tall waiting for the pain to be taken away she walked to the door and leaned her back against it watching weber do his work his last work when he finished he didnt look at either her or ranson but went to the far wall and slid his back down it until he sat on the floor he buried his head between his knees and folded his arms around them the healed but still naked wizard strode up to her and stopped waiting what is it i am to do she flicked her wrist bringing the knife to her hand once more she gave it a quick sharp toss in the air catching it by the blade she held the handle out to him you are to skin him alive she pushed the handle against him until his hand came up and took it ransons eyes left her steady gaze he stared at the knife in his hand alive he repeated she reached into a pocket and pulled out the small item she had brought a pewter figure of a man on one knee holding a crystal over his head his tiny bearded face was turned up to it in wonder the crystal was slightly elongated coming to faceted points inclusions floated frozen inside like a sky of constellations she wiped the dust off it with the corner of her light cloak and held the small statue out to ranson this is magic and a receptacle of magic the crystal is called quillion it will absorb the magic as it bleeds from your friend after he is skinned when and only when all his magic has bled into the quillion it will give off an orange glow you will bring the crystal to me to prove you have done the job ranson swallowed yes sister before i leave tonight you will give the oath she pushed the figure with the crystal toward him until he took it this will be your first task after giving the oath fail it or fail any of the tasks to follow and you will wish you could trade places with your friend you will wish it for all eternity he stood gripping the knife in one hand and the small figure in the other yes sister he stole a quick glance over his shoulder at the man crouched on the floor against the wall he lowered his voice sister could you could you still his tongue i dont know if i could bear him talking while i do it she raised an eyebrow you have a knife neville if his words bother you cut out his tongue he swallowed and closed his eyes for a moment they came open what if he dies before the magic is all bled away with the quillion present he will live as long as there is any significant trace of it in him after its all in the crystal it will begin to glow in that way you will know it is finished after that i dont care what you do with him if you want you may finish him quickly what if he tries to prevent what i do he leaned a little closer with his magic she smiled indulgently that i will still with his collar he will not be able to stop you after hes dead there will be no life force to hold the radahan on him it will open bring it with you and give it to me when you bring the crystal and what about the body she gave him a hard look you know how to wield the subtractive i have spent a good deal of time teaching you as have others she darted a glance at weber use it get rid of the body with subtractive magic every last scrap of it every last drop of blood ranson straightened a little and nodded all right after you have finished here and before you come to me at dawn there is one more task you will perform this night ranson took a deep breath letting it out slowly another task must i do another task this night she smiled and patted his cheek this second task you will enjoy its a reward for doing a good job with the first serving the keeper well has its rewards as you will find out failing him has its punishments as i hope you never discover he looked suspicious and what is this second task you know a novice named pasha he let out a grunt there isnt a man in the palace who doesnt know who pasha maes is and how well do these men know her ranson shrugged she likes to give a kiss and a cuddle in a corner any more than a kiss and a cuddle i know a few men who have had their hand up her skirt ive heard them talk about what fine legs she has how they would give up the gift just to have those legs around them but i dont think any have some of the men watch out for her as if she were a defenseless kitten one in particular young warren keeps a watchful eye on her warren is one of the men she likes to kiss and cuddle i dont think she would know him if he was standing in front of her he chuckled softly if he could even work up enough courage to take his nose out of the archives and look her in the face he frowned so what is the task when you are finished here i want you to go to her room tell her how you are to be released tomorrow and that when you passed all your tests the creator came to you in a vision tell her that the creator told you in this vision that you were to go to her and teach her how to use the glorious gift of her figure that he had given her how she was meant to use this gift to please men so that when the special task he has for her is revealed she will be prepared tell her the creator said it was to help her deal with her new one as he would be the most difficult any novice has ever been given tell her the creator revealed to you that he made this night hot so she would sweat between her breasts over her heart to awaken her to his wishes she gave him a smooth smile then i want you to teach her how to please a man he stared incredulously at her what makes you think she will believe any of this or go along her smile widened you tell her what i told you to tell her neville and you will have a great deal more than your hand up her skirt she will probably have her legs around you before you finish talking he nodded dumbly all right she glanced deliberately down at him im glad to see that you are up to the task she looked back to his eyes teach her everything you can think of to please a man at feast everything you can teach her by dawn teach her well i want her to know how to make a man happy and keep him coming back for more he smiled yes sister she put the tip of the rod under his chin lifting it a little you be gentle with her neville i dont want you to hurt her in any way i want this to be a very pleasant experience for her i want her to enjoy it she looked down at him again well do the best you can with what you have ive never had any complaints he snapped idiot women dont complain about that to mens faces they complain to the backs of their heads dont you dare jump on her please yourself then fall asleep you have until dawn i dont want you sleeping tonight you make sure this is an experience she remembers fondly you teach her well everything you know she pushed up with the rod a little more this may be a pleasant task but it is a task for the keeper just the same fail in this as in any other and your service will end abruptly but your pain will go on and on keep alert when you are with her in the morning i expect a detailed report of everything you have taught her you will report every bit of it i need to know what she knows so i may guide her yes sister she glanced past him to the man against the wall the sooner you finish here the sooner you can be with pasha and the more time you will have to teach her he nodded with a grin yes sister she took the rod away and he let out a breath with a gesture she made his robe float to her hand she shoved it at him put this on youre embarrassing yourself she watched as he began gathering the material and pulling it over his head tomorrow the real work the real task begins his head poked through the robe his arms following one at a time what work what task after you are released you must be off at once in the service of your homeland you do remember your homeland dont you you are going to go to aydindril as an advisor to high prince fyren you have things to do there important things like what we will talk about it in the morning but now before you can do the first task and the second and the rest of it you have an oath to give is this of your free will neville she watched his eyes they darted briefly to his friend huddled against the wall then he turned to glance at the knife and the quillion she saw his dark eyes go out of focus and she knew he was thinking about pasha he answered her in a whisper yes sister she nodded very good neville kneel the time of the oath is upon you as he went to his knees she lifted her hand the flame of the torch puffed out plunging the room into total blackness the oath to the keeper she whispered is given in the darkness that is his homeland chapter gently kahlan pulled the door open he was awake and sitting in front of the fire when the door closed it shut out some of the eerie sound of the boldas and the drums coming from the center of the village she stood next to him and tipped his head against her leg and then combed her fingers through his hair how is your headache its all right the rest and that last drink nissel gave me helped he didnt look up they want me out there dont they kahlan sank down to sit on the ground next to him yes it is time she rubbed his shoulder are you sure you want to eat the meat knowing this time what it is i have to but its still meat will you be able to eat it if i want a gathering i have to eat it the way is the way i will eat it richard im worried about this gathering im not so sure you should go through with it maybe theres another way the bird man is afraid for you too maybe you shouldnt do it i have to why he stared into the fire because this is all my fault i am responsible it is my fault the veil is torn thats what shota said my fault i caused it darken rahl caused it somehow and i am a rahl he whispered kahlan glanced over but he didnt look back the crimes of the father passed on to the son he smiled a small smile i dont believe that old line but maybe there is a little snip of truth to it his eyes turned to her you remember what shota said that only i could restore the veil maybe because darken rahl tore it through the magic of orden and my intervention i have to restore it she watched the firelight flicker in his eyes so you think what that maybe since a rahl tore it it takes a rahl to close it he shrugged maybe that could explain why only i can close it it may not be the reason but its the only one i can think of he smiled im glad im marrying a smart woman she grinned it made her happy to see him smile well this smart woman cant see how that could be the reason it might not be but its a possibility i have to consider then why do you have to go through with the gathering his eyes lit up with excitement as he gave her a boyish grin because i figured it out i figured out what were going to do he rearranged himself turning toward her and folding his legs tomorrow night well have the gathering and find out what we can that will help us then the next morning when its over he snatched the dragons tooth up in his fist and held it up to her as the grin grew on his face then i call scarlet with this thats how we get to zedd thats how we can get to aydindril without the headaches stopping me on a long journey by land scarlet flies with magic her magic allows her to cover vast distances in little time well be gone before the sisters can stop us and it will take them a long time to follow i wont have to turn them down for now i can get to zedd first he will know what to do about the headaches i mean after the gathering ill call scarlet it will probably take her the better part of the day to reach us he leaned toward her and gave her a quick kiss while were waiting well be married her heart leapt married yes married all in the same day day after tomorrow well do it all and be away before the day is out oh richard i would like that but lets do it now call scarlet now we can be married in the morning when she gets here i know the mud people would do it quickly for us we can get to zedd and he will know what to do and you wont shave to risk a gathering he shook his head we have to have the gathering shota said only i could close the veil not zedd what if he doesnt have any idea what to do he has said he doesnt know much about the underworld no one does no one knows about the world of the dead but the ancestors spirits do i have to find out whatever i can to help we cant waste the time going to zedd only to find out he doesnt know what to do i have to find out what i can first then go to zedd shota said only i could close the veil maybe its because i am the seeker i have to do my job and find the answers even if they mean little to me they might be significant to zedd and then he might know what to do know what i can do what if we beat zedd to aydindril if we travel on scarlet she will get us there in a day zedd may not be there yet if he isnt there we know hes going there and well find him he will be able to see scarlet she watched him a moment your mind is made up about all this isnt it he shrugged if anyone could poke holes in my idea it would be you you have any better ideas she shook her head at last i wish i did but i dont i like all of it but the gathering richards face softened with a gentle smile i would really like to see you in the wedding dress weselan is making can she have it done that soon we could spend our wedding night in aydindril in your home kahlan couldnt keep the smile back she can and there doesnt have to be a big wedding party anyway theres not time to prepare with the banquet for the gathering going on but the bird man will be pleased to marry us without it she looked at him coyly we would have a real bed in aydindril a big comfortable bed his arm circled around her waist and pulled her against him he gave her lips a soft kiss she didnt want it to end but she gently pushed back and glanced away richard what about the other things shota said about a child shota was wrong before about a lot of things even the things she was right about didnt turn out how we expected im not going to give you up on her word remember what you said to me one time about never letting a beautiful woman pick your path for you when there was a man in her line of sight and besides we will be able to talk to zedd first confessors and the gift are something he does know a lot about she ran her finger down his chest you seem to have an answer for everything how did you get so smart he pulled her to him and kissed her again harder this time i will find an answer to anything that tries to keep me from you and your big comfortable bed i would go to the underworld and fight the keeper himself to be with you she cuddled against his shoulder it seemed like forever since he had found her in westland being chased by a quad it seemed a lifetime ago not a mere few months they had been through so much she was so tired of being afraid and being chased hunted it wasnt fair that just when it was over it was starting again she gave herself a mental shake that was the wrong way to see things it was the problem not the solution she forced herself to look at the new problem in its own light and not color it with what had happened in the past maybe it wont be so hard this time maybe we can do as you say and find out what needs to be done and be finished with it she kissed his neck wed better get out there they are waiting and besides if i stay here with you any longer we wont make it to my big comfortable bed they left the quiet of the spirit house and walked hand in hand through the dark pathways between the buildings of the village she felt safe holding his hand from the first day they met and he offered his hand to her to help her up she had liked having her hand in his no one had ever done that before people were afraid of confessors she wanted this over so they could be together and live in peace so they could hold hands whenever they wanted and not ever have to run the sound of the people the dancing the conversation and the children grew louder until the two of them passed into the firelit field musicians stood on open grassroofed platforms swaying as they drew paddles up and down the carved ripples on the boldas sending the haunting strains out over the surrounding flat grassland arms a blur men pounded on drums sending frantic echoing beats across the village to others who answered or joined in dancers in costumes followed one another around in circles stopping and turning as one jumping and stomping acting out stories for the gleeful children and adults who crowded around them cooking fires sent sweetsmelling smoke and wonderful aromas drifting to them as they walked past large fires roared and crackled in the center of the field warming one side of her with their heat men proudly wore their finest skins and women their brightest dresses all had their hair freshly slicked down with sticky mud woven trays of tava bread roasted peppers onions long beans cabbage cucumber and beets bowls of stewed meats fish and chicken as well as platters of boar and venison were carried by young women from the cook fires to people gathered at various shelters the whole village was in joyful celebration to welcome the ancestors spirits savidlin stood at their approach welcoming them onto the elders platform he looked dignified with his official coyote hide around his shoulders the bird man and the other elders gave the two of them smiles and nods as soon as she and richard sat crosslegged the young women brought woven trays and platters of food they both took pieces of tava bread and rolled them around peppers careful to put them to their mouths with the right hand only a boy brought pottery mugs and a jug of water mildly flavored with spices when he was satisfied they were comfortably settled the bird man nodded to a group of women at a nearby shelter kahlan knew what this meant the women were special cooks the only ones allowed to prepare the banquet specialties richards eyes watched as one of them came with a woven platter filled with dried meat neatly arranged in a circular pattern he gave no sign of his feelings there would be no gathering if he didnt eat this meat worse this was not just any meat she knew though that he was determined and would eat it the woman bowed her head holding the platter out to the bird man and then the other elders after each took some she offered it to the elders wives a few took a piece she turned and held the platter out to richard he looked at it a moment and then reached up and took one of the larger pieces he held it in his fingers looking at it as the woman left after kahlan declined the offer i know it is difficult for you the bird man said to richard but it is necessary for you to have the knowledge of our enemies richard pulled off a big bite with his teeth the way is the way he chewed and swallowed without showing any emotion he looked off into the distance who is it the bird man watched him a moment after richard looked back to him it is the man you killed i see he took another bite he had taken a big piece and was eating the whole thing to show them his determination to have the gathering to show them that despite the warning from the spirits he was resolved to go through with it he watched the dancers as he chewed washing each swallow down with a drink from his mug the elders platform was an isolated island of quiet in the sweep of noise and activity richard abruptly stopped chewing his eyes widened he sat up straighten his head snapped around to the elders wheres chandalen they looked at one another after studying his face a moment richard sprang to his feet wheres chandalen he is here somewhere the bird man said find him right now bring him here the bird man sent one of the nearby hunters to search richard hopped down off the platform without a word and went to the shelter with the banquet cooks he found the woman with the platter of meat and took a piece kahlan turned to the bird man do you have any idea what is going on he nodded solemnly he has had a vision a vision from our enemies flesh it happens sometimes that is why we do this to know what is in our enemies hearts richard returned and paced back and forth in front of the elders platform waiting richard what is it what do you see he stopped pacing the expression on his face was agitated trouble he resumed his pacing she asked what sort of trouble but he didnt seem to even notice the question at last the hunter returned with chandalen and his men what would make richard with the temper ask for me richard shoved the piece of meat at him eat this tell me what you see chandalen watched richards eyes as he ate the strip of dried meat richard went back to his impatient pacing pulling off another bite with his teeth he chewed and paced finally he could wait no longer well what do you see chandalen watched warily an enemy richard let out an exasperated breath who was this man from what people he was bantak from the east kahlan jumped up bantak she hopped down off the platform and stood next to richard bantak are peaceful they would never attack anyone it is against their way he was a bantak chandalen repeated he had black painted on his eyes he attacked us he redirected his gaze to richard at least that is what richard with the temper claims richard went back to pacing theyre coming he muttered he stopped and grabbed chandalen by the shoulders theyre coming theyre coming to attack the mud people chandalen frowned the bantak are not fighters it is as the mother confessor says they are peaceful they plant crops herd goats and sheep we trade with them this one that attacked us must have been sick in the head the bantak know the mud people are stronger than they they would not attack us richard hardly heard the translation get your men together get more men we have to go stop them chandalen studied him we have nothing to fear from the bantak they would not attack us richard nearly exploded chandalen you are charged with protecting our people i am telling you there is a threat to them you must not ignore me in this he ran his fingers through his hair calming himself chandalen dont you think it a little strange that one man would have attacked all of us would you as brave as you are have come into the open and attacked that many men by yourself you with only a spear and they with bows chandalen only glared the bird man led the other elders off the platform and stood next to chandalen facing richard tell us what our enemy has revealed to you tell us what you have seen this man richard held the piece of meat up in front of the bird mans face this man was the son of their spirit guide the elders broke into worried whispers the bird man didnt move his eyes from richard are you sure of this killing the son of a spirit guide is a grave offense even in selfdefense it would be the same if someone killed my offspring had i one he lifted an eyebrow grave enough to start a war richard nodded hurriedly i know thats what they had planned for some reason they thought the mud people were suddenly dangerous to them to be sure they sent the son of their spirit guide knowing that if we killed him it would be a sign of our hostile intent they were planning on watching for his head on a pole to see if they were right if he didnt return and they found the head they were going to attack he waved the meat in front of the elders faces again this man for some reason had bitterness in his heart he wanted there to be a war he attacked us knowing he would be killed wanting it so it would start the war and his people could kill all the mud people dont you see with the banquet going on they will hear the sounds of it far out onto the plain they will know we are not prepared to defend ourselves that we are diverted they are coming now the elders all leaned back a little the bird man turned to chandalen richard with the temper has had a vision from our enemy have each of your men gather ten others we must not allow the bantak to harm our people you will stop them before they reach the village chandalens eyes flashed to richard and then back to the bird man we will see if his vision is true i will lead our men east if they are coming we will stop them no richard screamed when kahlan translated they will come from the north north chandalen glared at him the bantak live to the east not the north they will come from the east they will expect you to defend to the east they think the mud people want to kill them they expect it they will flank you and come from the north chandalen folded his arms the bantak are not fighters they do not know of such tactics if they are going to attack us as you say they will simply come straight in as you said they will hear the banquet they will know we will be unprepared they have no reason to go all the way around and come in from the north it would only slow them down for no reason richard glared at him they are coming from the north was this part of your vision the bird man asked did you see this too from eating the meat richard forced out a breath and looked down no i didnt see it with the rest of the vision he ran his fingers through his hair but i know its true i dont know how but i know they are coming from the north the bird man turned to chandalen perhaps you could split the men take some to the east and some to the north chandalen shook his head no if the vision proves true we will need all our men together one strike with surprise with all our men and with luck will end it if there are enough of them as he seems to think then they might defeat a number that small and then they would be upon our people before we could turn them back many women and children would be killed the whole village could fall it is too dangerous the bird man nodded chandalen a vision has been presented to us it is your job to keep our people safe since the vision did not say which way they would come only that they would come i leave it to you to protect us as you see best you are the smartest fighter among us i will trust your fighting judgment he frowned and leaned closer to the man but know that it had better be a fighting judgment and not a personal one chandalen showed no emotion it is my opinion the bantak would attack from the east he glanced at richard if they really come richard put a hand on chandalens folded arm chandalen please listen to me his voice was quiet and worried i know you dont like me maybe you are justified in your feelings maybe you are right that i have brought trouble to our people but trouble is coming now and it is coming from the north please i beg you believe me the lives of all our people depend on this hate me all you want but dont let any of them die because of that hate richard drew the sword of truth and held out the hilt i will give you my sword go north if they come from the east and i am wrong you may kill me with it chandalen looked down at the sword and back up to richards face a small smile spread on his own i will not let you trick me i will not let our people be devastated just for a chance to kill you i would rather let you live among us than let my people be killed i go to the east he turned and strode off shouting instructions to his men richard stood watching him go then slid the sword back into its scabbard that man is a fool kahlan said richard shook his head he is just doing what he thinks best he wants to protect his people more than he wants to kill me if i had to pick one man to fight beside me as much as he hates me it would be him i am the fool for not being able to make him see the truth he turned to her i have to go north i have to stop them kahlan looked around there are some other men here we will gather all we can and he shook his head cutting her off no there wouldnt be enough besides we need every man able to hold a bow or spear here to defend the village if i fail the elders must go on with the banquet we must have the gathering that is whats most important ill go alone im the seeker maybe i can stop them maybe they will listen to one man see that he isnt so much of a threat all right wait here ill be right back why i have to put on my confessors dress youre not going i have to you cant speak their language kahlan i dont want richard she snatched a fistful of his shirt im the mother confessor there will be no war under my nose while i have a say in it you will wait here she released his shirt and stormed off the mother confessor didnt wait for answers to her instructions she expected them to be carried out she suddenly regretted yelling at richard but she was furious at chandalen for not listening she was furious too at the bantak she had been to their village before and always found them to be a gentle people whatever their reasons as long as she was around there was going to be no war the mother confessor was supposed to stop wars not sit by and watch them start this was her responsibility her job not richards at savidlin and weselans home in the dark with all the noise going on outside she slipped into her white confessors dress all confessors wore dresses cut the same square at the neck long simple free of embellishment and satiny smooth but of black fabric only the mother confessors was white it was a mantle of power in the dress she was not kahlan amnell she was the mother confessor a symbol of the power of truth with all the other confessors now dead the weight of defending the midlands those without power was upon her shoulders it made her feel different now to wear the dress before it had seemed the normal thing to do now since she had met richard it seemed a heavier responsibility before she had always felt alone in her job but now with him she felt more of a connection to the people of the midlands more one of them more responsible to them she knew now what it was to love someone and to fear for him she was not going to allow anyone to start a war not as long as she was the mother confessor she grabbed their heavy cloaks and went back through the passageways to the festivities the elders were standing in front of their platform where she had left them richard was still waiting she tossed his cloak to him and addressed the elders tomorrow night is the gathering it must go on we will be back well before then she turned to the wives weselan we wish to be married the next day im sorry there isnt more time to prepare but we must leave as soon as it is done we must go to aydindril we must stop the threat to the mud people and everyone else weselan smiled your dress will be ready i wish we could give you a big wedding feast but we understand the bird man put a hand on her shoulder if chandalen is wrong be careful the bantak are peaceful but maybe things have changed tell them we wish their people no harm we do not want war with them kahlan nodded and flung her cloak around her shoulders as she started off lets go chapter richard fell in beside her without objection without speaking they left the village and went north out onto the flat open grasslands as they walked the sounds of the people and boldas and drums faded steadily into the night the moon wasnt near full but it gave them enough light to see by as they walked through the waisthigh dry grass she hoped that it was dark enough to make them poor targets richard finally glanced over kahlan im sorry for what for forgetting who you are that you are the mother confessor and that this is your job i was just worried for you she was surprised by his apology im sorry i yelled at you i shouldnt have done that i just dont want there to be any fighting im supposed to keep the people of the midlands from fighting it makes me angry when they insist on killing one another richard im so tired of seeing people killed i thought it was over i cant bear it anymore i swear i cant he put an arm around her i know me too he gave her shoulder a squeeze as they walked the mother confessor will put a stop to it he looked over she thought he was frowning but it was too dark to be sure with my help she grinned with your help she leaned her head against him a moment from now on always with your help they walked a long way from the village without seeing anything but the black ground and starlit sky richard would stop once in a while to watch the surrounding grassland and take out a few of nissels leaves to chew sometime past the middle of the night they came to a slight depression in the landscape he looked around again and then decided they should wait where they were it would be better for the bantak to come upon them he said than for the two of them to walk into a surprise richard flattened out a small patch of grass and they sat down to wait they each took turns taking little naps while the other watched to the north with her hand over his she watched him sleep and scanned the horizon and thought about all the times they had done this before one standing watch the other sleeping she longed for the day they could just sleep and not have to watch sleep together it would happen she decided soon enough richard would figure out how to close the veil and then it would be over they could be at peace kahlan slept nuzzled against him with her cloak wrapped tight against the cold his warmth made her all the more sleepy she began to wonder if he was right if the bantak would come from the north if they came from the east there would be a lot of killing chandalen would show no mercy she didnt want the mud people to be hurt but she didnt want the bantak hurt either they too were her people she drifted into worried sleep her last thoughts of richard he brought her awake pressing his arm around her and his hand over her mouth the sky was just beginning to lighten to their right to the east thin wisps of dark purple clouds bunched near the horizon as if trying to mask the sunrise with their dark hue richard was watching to the north she was lower than he and couldnt see anything but she knew by the tenseness of his muscles that someone was coming they lay still close to the ground waiting gentle breezes rustled the dry grass around them kahlan quietly slowly slid the cloak from her shoulders she didnt want there to be any mistake about who she was the bantak would recognize her long hair but she wanted them to see her confessors dress too she didnt want there to be any doubt who she was and that she was here as the mother confessor richard shrugged his cloak off his shoulders shadows slid through the grass around them when there seemed to be men all around the two of them stood up men with spears and bows closest leapt back and screamed yells of surprise the bantak were spread out in a long thin line advancing toward the mud peoples village there were excited shouts men swept in from the line a few surrounding them most bunched in front kahlan stood tall her hands at her sides she wore her confessors face a calm that showed nothing as her mother had taught her richard was tight at her side his hand on the hilt of his sword most of the men in simple hide clothes trimmed with grass leveled weapons at the two of them they were clearly nervous about doing so you would dare to threaten the mother confessor she called out lower your weapons now eyes flicked around looking to see if the two of them were alone the men seemed to become less sure about pointing spears and arrows at the mother confessor they were doing something unheard of and they knew it they looked as if they couldnt decide to keep doing what they were doing or drop their weapons and fall to their knees a few of them crouched lower in half bows kahlan took an aggressive stride toward them now the men flinched cowering back a little the points of all the weapons moved from her to richard they appeared to hope this would be an acceptable compromise it was not what she had expected she stepped in front of richard all the weapons were once again pointing at her what do you think you are doing he whispered to the back of her head just stay quiet let me try to do this we dont have a chance if we cant get them to lower their weapons and talk why are they doing this i thought everyone was afraid of the mother confessor they are afraid but they are used to seeing a wizard with me they may be more bold because they dont see one now even so they shouldnt be doing this she took another step forward who speaks for the bantak who among you takes responsibility for allowing the bantak to threaten the mother confessor not being able to point their weapons at richard with her in the way the bantak lost a bit of their confidence and lowered the points a little not all the way but a little at last an old man approached pushing through stopping in front of her he wore simple hide clothes like the other men but around his neck hung a gold medallion worked with bantak symbols she knew him he was ma ban grid the bantaks spirit guide his scowl made his heavily wrinkled loose skin seem even more deeply creased than she remembered she also didnt remember him scowling like this she remembered only his easy smile i speak for the bantak ma ban grid said he had only two bottom teeth in front his jaw wobbled easily with the difficulttopronounce bantak words he glanced at richard who is this one kahlan returned ma ban grids scowl now ma ban grid would question the mother confessor before she is welcomed before his eyes the bantak men shuffled their feet uneasily ma ban grid did not his gaze was solid and unwavering these are not right times these are not our lands we are not here to welcome visitors before the eyes of the bantak we have come to kill the mud people why ma ban grid peered down his nose at her they have invited war as our spirit brethren have warned us they would they have proven it by killing one of mine we must kill them before they can kill us all there will be no war there will be no killing i am the mother confessor and i will not allow it the bantak will suffer by my hand if they do this the band of men broke into worried whispers and moved back a pace the spirit guide stood his ground the spirit brethren have also told me that the mother confessor no longer holds command over the people of the midlands they say that as proof she has been stripped of the company of a wizard he gave her a smug look i see no wizard as always the spirits speak true to ma ban grid kahlan stared speechless at the old man richard leaned toward her what are they saying kahlan told him what ma ban grid had said he stepped up next to her i want to speak to them translate for me kahlan nodded they wanted to know who you are i didnt tell them richards eyes turned cold with menace i will let them know who i am his voice took on the same cold quality as his eyes and they arent going to like it he turned his hawklike glare on the men deliberately ignoring ma ban grid and she saw in those eyes the rage of the swords magic he was calling the magic forth even as the sword sat in its scabbard you men are following an old fool an old fool by the name of ma ban grid who is not wise enough to know true spirits from false spirits the men gasped at the insult richard turned his penetrating gaze to ma ban grid is this not true old fool ma ban grid stammered with anger a moment before he could get any words out who are you to dare to insult me like this richard glared at him your false spirits told you the mud people killed one of yours the false spirits lied to you and you in your foolishness believed them lie we found his head the mud people killed him they want war with us we will kill them all every last one they have killed one of mine i am growing tired of talking to one as stupid as you old man the bantak are a witless people if they put one such as you in charge of talking to the spirit brethren richard what are you doing she whispered translate when she did ma ban grids face reddened more with each word he looked ready to burst into flames richard leaned closer to him the mud people didnt kill the one that was yours i did richard i cant tell them that they will kill us he continued to glare at ma ban grid as he spoke softly to her something is frightening these people into doing this they are going to kill us and then go and kill a lot of the mud people unless i can make them even more frightened of us translate she let out a noisy breath at him and then told the bantak what richard had said the weapons came back up you you killed one of mine richard shrugged yes he pointed at his forehead i put an arrow right here one arrow right here right through his head as he was about to put his spear in the back of a man a man who had no hate in his heart for the bantak i killed him as i would kill a coyote sneaking up to steal one of my lambs one who would take a life by such cowardice deserves to die one who would listen to false spirits and send one of his own to do such a thing does not deserve to lead a people we will kill you really maybe you will try but you cannot kill me richard turned his back to the old man and walked about twenty paces away the men opening up to let him pass he turned back i used one arrow to kill one of yours use one arrow to try to kill me and we will see who the good spirits protect pick any man you wish have him do to me as i did to yours shoot me with an arrow he pointed angrily at his forehead again right here where i shot the coward who would kill for false spirits richard have you lost your mind im not going to tell them to shoot you kahlan i can do this i can feel it you did it once what if it doesnt work this time im not going to stand here and let you be killed kahlan if we dont stop these people here now both of us are going to be killed and then the keeper is going to escape tonight is the gathering that is whats important im using the wizards first rule the first step to believing is wanting to believe something is true or being afraid it is up until now they have been believing something because they wanted to i have to make them afraid that what i am going to say is true what are you going to say hurry up translate before i lose their interest and they decide to kill us and then go after the mud people she turned back to ma ban grid and reluctantly translated the men all started shouting that they wanted to be the one to shoot the arrow ma ban grids eyes moved among them as they yelled and waved their arms he smiled all you men may shoot this evil one who has killed one of mine everyone shoot him the bows came up richard glared coward do you men see how foolish this old man is he knows he listens to false spirits he would have you listen to them also he knows the good spirits protect me in my challenge he is afraid to have you see he is a fool this proves it ma ban grids jaw tightened he held his arm up for his men to halt at last he turned to a man with a bow and snatched it from his hands i will show you the spirits i hear are true you will die for killing one of mine for saying our spirit brethren are false spirits he drew a poison arrow back and in a blink shot it at richard a cheer rose from the men kahlans breath caught in her throat she went cold with fear richard snatched the arrow out of the air right in front of his face the men gasped and then fell silent as richard marched back to the spirit guide the arrow in his hand and fire in his eyes he stopped before ma ban grid and snapped the arrow in front of his face to the sound of fearful murmurs his voice was deadly the good spirits protect me old fool you listen to false spirits who are you ma ban grid whispered wideeyed richard slowly drew the sword of truth the soft ring of steel filled the quiet dawn he placed the swords point at ma ban grids throat i am richard the seeker mate to the mother confessor worried whispers drifted through the cold air and i am a wizard her wizard eyes as far as she could see widened jaws dropped ma ban grids face slackened a little he glanced to the sword wizard you wizard richards angry glare swept across the gathered men wizard i command the magic the gift it would seem old fool your false spirits have lied to you they said the mother confessor had no wizard they sent one of yours to start a war the mud people do not want they have used you for their own purposes perhaps a wise spirit guide would have known this perhaps an old fool would not grumbling broke out among the men if you persist in this if you disobey the mother confessor i will use my magic to destroy you i will use terrible magic to burn the bantaks land to ashes and put a blight upon it for all time each bantak will die a horrible death a death by my magic i will kill every last bantak young and old his cold gray eyes returned to ma ban grid but i will start with the old magic ma ban grid whispered you would kill us with magic richard leaned closer if you disobey the mother confessor i will kill you all with magic more frightful than anything you can imagine as the men all listened in rapt attention to her translation richard recited a litany of horrors he would bring to them most of the things she remembered zedd telling a mob that had come to kill him when they thought he was a witch richard was using the same things now to scare the bantak the more he spoke the wider their eyes became ma ban grids gaze left the sword and returned to richards face he looked less sure of himself but wasnt entirely ready to concede the spirits told me there was no wizard with the mother confessor why should i believe you are a wizard all of the anger left richards face she had never seen him hold the sword without the fury of the swords magic in his eyes there did seem to be something in his eyes but it wasnt hate or rage he looked at peace somehow it was more frightening than the anger it was the peace of a man committed to a course in the dim dawn light the blade of richards sword changed it began to glow white white hot with magic it brightened until no one could miss seeing the bright white luminescence richard was using the only magic he knew and could depend on the magic of the sword it was enough fear swept the crowd men fell to their knees dropping their weapons muttering for forgiveness beseeching the spirits to protect them others stood frozen not knowing what to do forgive me old man richard whispered but i must kill you to save a great many more lives know that i forgive you and regret what i must do as she translated kahlan put a hand on richards arm to keep him from doing anything richard wait please give me a chance he nodded slightly one chance fail and i kill him she knew he was trying to scare the bantak to break the spell they seemed to be under but he was scaring her too he was beyond the rage of the sword to something worse she looked back to the spirit guide ma ban grid richard will kill you he does not lie about this i have asked him to wait so i may grant you my forgiveness if you will see the truth of what we say i can ask him not to kill you and he will do as i ask but only once after that i will have no control over him if you are insincere in your change of heart there will be much death and suffering richard is a man of his word he has made a promise to you and if you try to trick him with your answer he will keep his promise i give you this one chance to hear the truth it is not yet too late the mother confessor does not want any of her people to die every life in the midlands holds dear value in my heart but sometimes i must let a few lose their lives so that many more may live i will hear your answer the men all stood stooped and still they looked as if they had gotten themselves into something they no longer wanted the bantak were a peaceful people and they seemed to regret their foray even seemed confused by it richard had succeeded in giving them a bigger fright than whatever brought them to this the breeze fluttered the dry grass and in its passing pulled a stray wisp of hair across her face kahlan reached up and pulled it back as she waited with eyes that seemed to have gone empty of passion ma ban grid searched her face the spell had been broken his voice came soft and sincere i heard the spirits speak i thought they were speaking the truth it is as he says i am an old fool he looked around at his silent men the bantak have never before sought to bring death to others we will not start now he bowed his head and pulled his medallion over his wispy gray hair he brought it up in both hands offering it to her please mother confessor give this to the mud people tell them it is given in peace we will start no war with them he glanced over richard returned the sword to its scabbard ma ban grid looked back to her thank you for stopping us far stopping me from listening to false spirits and doing a terrible thing kahlan bowed her head to the old man i am thankful i was able to serve in time to prevent anyone from being hurt richard glanced to her ask him how the spirits convinced him to do something against the nature of his people ma ban grid how did the spirits put the lust for war in your heart the lust for killing he stared off unsure their whispers came to me in the night made me feel the need i have felt an urge to violence before but never acted on it this time it seemed i could not hold it back i had never felt this need so strongly before the veil to the underworld the spirit world is torn whispers spread back through the men as she told them richards words false spirits may seek to speak to you again be on guard against them i understand how you were tricked and will hold no anger against you for it but i expect you to be more cautious now that you have learned the truth and have been warned thank you wizard ma ban grid nodded i will make it so did the spirits voices tell you anything else the old man frowned in thought i dont really remember their voices telling me what must be done it was more of a feeling that filled me with the need my son he looked up the one who died he was with me and heard them also i felt that the spirits spoke differently to him somehow his eyes were wild with hate even more than mine he went as soon as we were visited by the spirits his gaze sank to the ground richard regarded the spirit guide a long moment his voice came softly i am sorry ma ban grid that i had to kill your son it wounds my heart to have done so know that had there been any other path i would have taken it the old man nodded but couldnt bring forth words he looked around at his men he seemed suddenly ashamed i dont know what we are doing here he whispered this is not the bantak way it is the fault of false spirits i am glad we were here to help you see the truth of it richard said he nodded again and turned to his men looking about at them and then walked off toward their homeland kahlan let out a heavy sigh richard watched warily as the bantak plodded off into the sunrise dragging spears behind what do you make of that she asked when he turned to her at last he rested his hand on the hilt of the sword and turned to watch the bantak the keeper is getting ahead of us he looked back to her eyes he has taken the effort to discredit you to discredit the mother confessor he is laying traps for us he has plans and i dont have the slightest idea what they are what are we going to do what we planned to do tonight we have the gathering and tomorrow we are married and leave for aydindril she studied his face you really are a wizard she said softly you used magic to break the keepers spell his expression didnt change no im not it was just a little trick zedd taught me he said once that people are more afraid to die from magic than anything else as if they would somehow be more dead i used that fear and the wizards first rule to make them believe it it was a stronger fear than the one the spirits gave them and what of turning the sword of truth white he regarded her a long moment do you remember when zedd showed us how the sword works how it couldnt harm anyone you think innocent she nodded well he was wrong when it is white you can kill anyone anyone even one you know to be innocent even one you love his eyes hardened i hate magic richard the gift has just helped you save the lives of many people at what cost he whispered whenever i even think of turning the sword white all i can remember is how i did it to you how i almost killed you with it but you didnt almost doesnt make bread rise that doesnt stop the pain of it or of having killed with the swords white magic and of knowing what i am capable of it makes me feel like a rahl he let out a heavy breath and changed the subject i think we had better be very careful at the gathering tonight richard this puts a new light on things we have been warned twice now of the danger of dealing with the spirits wont you reconsider the gathering he looked away what choice do i have the keeper seems to be ahead of us events are moving fast the more we find out the more we realize we dont know we must learn what we can but maybe the ancestors spirits wont be able to help us then we will have learned something we cant pass up the chance too much is at risk we have to try he gently took her hand kahlan i cant allow myself to be responsible for this to know its my fault she waited until his eyes came up why because darken rahl is your father you think you are responsible because you are a rahl maybe but rahl or not i cant be responsible for the keeper having everyone for having you i have to find a way to stop it darken rahl haunts me from the grave somehow i have caused this i dont know how but its my fault i have to do whatever it takes to stop it or everyone will suffer and the keeper will have you forever that thought scares me more than anything in my life has ever scared me it wakes me with nightmares there isnt anything i wouldnt do to stop him from getting you i wont take a chance of missing anything no matter the risk i have to have the gathering his gaze held hers even though i fear it might be a trap i have to try a trap you think it might be a trap it could be we have been warned at least we can be alert for it he looked down at her hand in his i wont have the sword in the gathering do you think you can call down the lightning if you have to kahlan shook her head i dont know richard i dont know how i did it it just happened i dont know how to control it he nodded as he rubbed the back of her hand with his thumbs well maybe you wont have to try maybe the ancestors spirits will be able to help us they helped us before richard reached up and gripped the agiel his gray eyes were filled with the pain of the headache he sank down and put his head in his hands as she sat next to him i have to rest awhile before we go back this headache is killing me she feared he was right that the headache really was killing him she ached for the next day when they could get to zedd get to help it was late afternoon by the time they returned to the celebration the banquet richards head was a little better but still hurt him enough to leave the pain in his eyes the elders stood as the two of them approached the open pole shelter the bird man stepped forward what of the bantak did you see them there has been no word from chandalen kahlan held the gold medallion out to him and let it drop in his hand when it came up we found them to the north as richard said we would ma ban grid sent this as a gift to tell the mud people that the bantak will not make war with them they made a mistake and are sorry we made them see that the mud people mean them no harm chandalen has also made a mistake the bird man nodded solemnly and turned to a hunter standing nearby telling him to bring back chandalen and his men kahlan didnt think he looked as pleased as she thought he would be honored elder is something wrong his brown eyes seemed heavy he glanced to richard and back to her two of the sisters of the light have returned they wait in the spirit house kahlans heart jumped she had hoped they wouldnt be back so soon what had it been only a few days she turned to richard the sisters of the light are waiting in the spirit house richard sighed nothing is ever easy he addressed the bird man tonight is the gathering will you be ready tonight the spirits will be with us we will be ready be careful take nothing for granted all our lives depend on it he took her arm lets see if we can put a stop to this they walked together across the field past the roar of the fires people were still everywhere eating dancing playing the boldas and drums there were fewer children about some were off napping but some still managed to dance and play three days he muttered what its been three days almost since they were here last i will send them away and tomorrow we will be gone when they come back in another three days we will have been in aydindril for two she stared ahead as they walked that is if they keep to the same schedule who says they wont show up for the third time after only one day or one hour she could feel his eyes on her but she didnt look over when he spoke are you trying to make a point you only get three chances richard im afraid for you im afraid of the headaches this time she did look over but he didnt i wont wear a collar not for any reason not for anyone i know she whispered he yanked the door open and strode into the spirit house his jaw was set with determination his eyes fixed on the two women standing in the center of the dimly lit room as he marched up to them both wore their cloaks with the hoods pushed back their faces in mild frowns seemed almost calm richard stopped in front of the two i have questions and i want answers we are glad to see you are still well richard sister verna said still alive why did sister grace kill herself why did you allow it sister elizabeth stepped in front of sister verna she held the open collar in her hands we told you before discussion is over it is by the rules now i have rules too with his fists on his hips he looked to each woman in turn my first rule is that neither of you is going to kill herself today they ignored him you will listen i sister of the light elizabeth myric give the second reason for the radahan give the second chance to be helped the first of the three reasons for the radahan is to control the headaches and open your mind so you may be taught to use the gift you have refused the first chance to be helped i bring the second reason and offer she watched his eyes as if to be sure she had his full attention the second reason for the radahan is so that we can control you richard glared at her control me what does that mean to control me it means what it says im not putting a collar around my neck so you can control me he leaned a little closer or for any other reason sister elizabeth held the collar up as you were told before it is more difficult for you to accept the second offer please believe us you are in great danger your time is running out please richard accept the second offer now on the second of the three reason and offers it will only be much more difficult to accept on the third of the three reasons there was something in his eyes kahlan had seen only once before the last time the collar was held out to him something alien something frightening it sent a chill through her goose bumps rose on her arms the anger left his voice i told you before he whispered i will not wear a collar for anyone for any reason if you want to teach me to use the gift to control it we can talk about it there are things going on you know nothing about important things dangerous things i have responsibilities as the seeker i am not a child like you are used to dealing with i am an adult we can talk about it sister elizabeth stared at him with fierce intensity richard retreated a half step his eyes closed and he shook slightly at last he straightened his eyes came open as he took a deep breath he returned the sisters stare something had happened and kahlan had no idea what it was the strength in sister elizabeths eyes waned her hands lowered the collar her voice came in a fearful whisper will you accept the offer and the radahan richard stood staring at her the power was back in his voice i refuse sister elizabeth went pale as she stared back for a moment before turning to the woman behind her forgive me sister i have failed she put the radahan in sister vernas outstretched hand her voice came in a whisper it is upon you now sister verna kissed her on each cheek the light forgives you sister sister elizabeth turned back to richard her face gone slack may the light cradle you always with gentle hands may you someday find the way richard stood with his fists on his hips as he watched her eyes she lifted her chin as sister grace had done she brought her arm up and with a flick of her wrist brought the silverhandled knife to her hand richard continued to watch her as she flipped it around toward herself kahlan watched holding her breath spellbound as the woman prepared to kill herself the silence seemed thick for a heartbeat everyone was stone still the instant the knife began to move richard did too his speed was shocking before sister elizabeth realized what had happened richard had her by her wrist his other hand came up and began prying the odd knife from her fingers as she struggled to keep ahold of it she was no match for his strength i told you my rule you are not allowed to kill yourself today her face twisted with futile effort please let go her body flinched her head jerked back there was a flash of light that seemed to come from within her from within her eyes sister elizabeth crumpled forward to the ground sister verna pulling her own knife from the womans back as she fell sister vernas gaze rose from the dead woman to richard you must bury her body yourself if you let another do it for you you will have nightmares for the rest of your life nightmares caused by magic there is no cure for them you killed her you murdered her whats the matter with you how could you kill her she tucked her knife up her sleeve as she glared at him she reached out snatched the silver knife from his hand and slipped it in her cloak you killed her sister verna whispered your hands have the blood on them so does the executioners axe but it doesnt wield itself richard lunged for her throat she didnt move she simply continued to stare at him his hands stopped before reaching her richard shook straining against an invisible barrier as she watched him in that instant kahlan knew what the sisters were richard relaxed the pressure of pushing against the barrier he pulled his hands back a little he visibly relaxed gently his face gone calm he reached one hand toward sister verna his fingers clutched around her throat her eyes went wide with shock richard she whispered angrily take your hand from me as you have said this is no game why did you kill her his weight came off his feet richard floated a few inches into the air he tightened his grip on her throat when he didnt release her fire ignited all around them roaring to life a whorl of flame closing around him i said take your hand from me in a moment more the fire would consume richard before she realized what she was doing kahlan had her fist out toward the sister blue light crackled all around her wrist and hand little threads of blue lightning escaped from the sides as she struggled to restrain herself from releasing the bolt of power wisps of blue fire sizzled forth throughout the spirit house up the walls across the ceiling and floor everywhere except where the other two stood she shook with the strain of holding back the power stop it the threads of blue lightning sucked the fire into them there will be no more killing today the blue light extinguished silence again filled the room as sister verna stared at kahlan a hard edge of anger stole into her eyes richard settled to the ground and took his hand from the womans throat i wouldnt have harmed him i only meant to frighten him into releasing me she turned her glare to richard who taught you to break a web no one taught me i taught myself why did you kill sister elizabeth you taught yourself she mocked i told you this is no game it must go by the rules her voice lost its edge i have known her for many years if you had ever turned that sword of yours white you would understand what it took for me to do as i did richard didnt tell her he had turned the sword white you would expect me to put myself in your hands after what you have done your time is running out richard after what i have seen today i would be surprised if the headaches dont soon kill you i dont know why it is that the pain hasnt already put you down whatever is protecting you wont last much longer i know you dont like to see anyone die neither do we but please believe that what is done is done for you to save you she turned to kahlan be very careful with that power of yours mother confessor i doubt you have the slightest idea how dangerous it is sister verna pulled her hood up as her brown eyes turned to richard you have been offered the first and second of three chances and refused i will return she leaned a little closer you only have one chance left if you refuse it you will die think on it carefully richard after the door closed behind sister verna richard squatted next to the dead sister she was doing something to me magic i could feel it what did it feel like richard shook his head a little the first time they were here i thought i felt something pulling me to accept their offer but i was so afraid of the collar i paid it no attention this time it was much stronger it was magic the magic was trying to force me to say yes to accept the offer from the sisters i just thought about the collar until the force left and i was able to say no he looked up at her you have any idea whats going on what she was doing and what sister verna did with the fire and the rest of it kahlans hand still tingled from the blue lightening yes the sisters are sorceresses richard rose smoothly to his feet sorceresses he watched her eyes for a long moment why would they kill themselves when i said no i think it is to pass their power on to the next sister to make her stronger for when they try again he looked down at the body why would i be so important that they would kill themselves to get me maybe it is as they say to help you he glanced at her out of the corner of his eye they dont want one man a stranger to die yet two of them have already died trying to get me to accept their help so a life wouldnt be lost how does that add up i dont know richard but im so scared it hurts im afraid they could be telling the truth that you dont have much time and the headaches are killing you im afraid you wont be able to control them much longer her voice broke with emotion i dont want to lose you richard slipped his arms around her it will be all right i will bury her the gathering will be in a few hours tomorrow we will be in aydindril and then i will be safe zedd will know what to do she could only nod against his shoulder chapter kahlan sat naked in the circle with eight naked men richard was to her left painted as were she and the elders with the black and white mud except in a small circle in the center of his chest in the dim light coming from the small fire behind her she could see the wild jumble of lines and swirls sweeping diagonally across his face they all wore the same mask so that the ancestors spirits might see them she wondered if she looked as savage to him as he looked to her the unfamiliar acrid smell from the fire made her nose itch none of the elders scratched their noses they only stared at nothing and chanted sacred words to the spirits the door slammed shut by itself making her jump the bird mans distant eyes came up from now until we are finished near dawn no one may go out no one may come in the door is barred by the spirits kahlan didnt like the idea that as richard had said this could be a trap she squeezed his hand more tightly he returned the squeeze at least she thought she was with him she hoped she could protect him she hoped she could call the lightning if she had to the bird man fished out a frog and then passed the woven basket to the next elder kahlan stared at the skulls arranged in a circle in the center as each elder took a frog and began rubbing its back against the bare circle of skin on his chest as they did so each rolled his head back and chanted different words without looking over savidlin passed her the basket closing her eyes she reached inside and finally caught a squirming kicking spirit frog its smooth slimy skin was revolting swallowing hard and taking a mental grip on her confessors power to try to keep from releasing it unintentionally she pressed the frogs back to the skin between her breasts as she passed the basket to richard tingling tightness spread across her skin she freed the frog and took up richards hand once more as the walls began to waver as if seen through heat and smoke her mind tried in vain to hold on to the images of the spirit house around her they drifted away as she felt herself spinning around the skulls soft sensations caressed her skin light danced from the skulls in the center and filled her eyes sounds of the boldas and drums and chanting filled her ears the pungent smell from the fire filled her lungs as once before the light from the center brightened taking them into it into the silken void spinning them around and then there were shapes around them kahlan remembered them too from before the ancestors spirits she felt a gossamer touch on her shoulder a hand a spirit hand the bird mans mouth moved but it wasnt his voice it was the joined voices of the ancestors spirits flat hollow dead who calls this gathering kahlan leaned toward richard and whispered they want to know who calls this gathering he nodded i do i call this gathering the touch left her shoulder and the spirits all floated from behind them into the center of the circle speak your name the echo of their voices sent ripples of pain along the skin of her arms your full and true name if you are certain that you wish this gathering despite the danger speak the request after your name you get but this one warning richard stared at her translation richard please i have to he looked back to the spirits in the center and took a deep breath i am richard he swallowed and closed his eyes for a moment i am richard rahl and i request this gathering so be it came the empty whispers the door to the spirit house crashed open kahlan jumped with a little shriek she felt richards hand flinch too the doorway stood open a black maw in the soft light around them the elders all looked up their eyes no longer glazed with the distant vision they seemed confused dazed the spirit voices came again this time not through the elders but from the center from the spirits themselves the sound of it was even more painful than before all but the one who calls the ancestors spirits may leave leave while you still can heed our warning those who remain behind with him risk forfeiting their souls they turned as one to richard their voices were a hiss you may not leave the elders frightened eyes flicked around to each other as she translated for richard kahlan knew this had never happened before everyone out richard whispered have everyone get out i dont want them hurt kahlan looked to the bird mans worried eyes please all of you leave now while you can we dont want harm to come to any of you the elders all looked to the bird man he stared at her a moment glanced at richard and then back to her i can offer you no guidance child this has never happened before i dont know what it means kahlan nodded i understand go now before it is too late savidlin touched her shoulder and then the elders vanished as they walked through the black void of the doorway she sat in the quiet with richard with the spirits kahlan i want you out of here too go now his voice was calm almost cold fear danced in his eyes and magic she watched his face as he stared at the spirits no she whispered she turned once more to the center i will not leave you not for any reason though no words have been spoken over us we are joined in our hearts by my magic we are one what happens to one happens to both i am staying richard didnt look over he continued to stare at the spirits as they floated in the center of the room above the skulls she thought he would yell at her to leave he didnt his voice came soft and gentle thank you i love you kahlan amnell together then the door banged closed kahlan jumped and a little sound escaped from her throat before she could catch it her heart pounded in her ears she tried to slow her breathing but couldnt she swallowed instead the image of the spirits dimmed what you have called forth richard rahl we cannot stay to witness we are sorry their forms seemed to evaporate as she watched as they vanished the light went with them until the two of them were left in total blackness she could hear the slow crackle of the fire off beyond that blackness richards quick breathing her own breathing and nothing else richards hand found hers in the darkness they sat together alone naked as kahlan began to think to hope that nothing was going to happen she became aware of a slight brightening in front of her there was light beginning to glow green light a shade of green light she had seen from only one place the underworld her breaths came in ragged pulls the green light brightened and with it distant wails from the air all about came an earsplitting crack like a clap of thunder sudden hard painful the ground shook with the impact of it from the center of the green light a white brilliance oozed through to coalesce into a form and stand before them her breath caught in her throat the fine hairs on the back of her neck stood out stiffly the white form took a step closer she only dimly realized richards grip on her hand was hurting her kahlan knew the white robes the long blond hair the painfully handsome face that stood before them smiling that small gruesome smile dear spirits protect us she whispered it was darken rahl as one she and richard came slowly to their feet the glowing blue eyes watched them rise relaxed unhurried darken rahl brought a hand up and licked his fingertips thank you richard for calling me back his cruel smile widened how thoughtful of you i didnt call you back richard whispered darken rahl laughed a quiet laugh once again you make a mistake call me back you did you called a gathering a gathering of ancestors spirits i am your ancestor only you could have brought me back through the veil only you i denounce you denounce me all you will he held his arms out out in the white light around him i am still here but i killed you the glowing shimmering white robed form laughed again killed me so you did and you used magic to send me to a different place a place where i am known a place where i have friends and now you have called me back again with magic not simply called me back richard but torn the veil further to do so he slowly shook his head is there no end to your stupidity darken rahl seemed to float and at the same time walk toward richard richard let go of kahlans hand as he backed away she couldnt make her legs move to go with him richards eyes were wide i killed you i defeated you i won you lost the blond head nodded slowly you won a small battle in a timeless war by using the gift and the wizards first rule but in your ignorance you violated the wizards second rule and in so doing you have lost it all his slow wicked smile came back such a shame didnt anyone ever tell you magic is dangerous i could have taught you could have shared it all with you he shrugged but it doesnt matter you have helped me win even without being taught i couldnt be more proud of you what is the wizards second rule what did i do rahls eyebrows lifted as he took another step closer why richard dont you know you should he whispered you have broken it a second time today and in violating it a second time you have torn the veil once more a second time and brought me here so that i might tear it the rest of the way and free the keeper his mocking smile returned all by yourself he gave a taunting laugh my son you should never have meddled in things you dont understand what do you want rahl drifted closer you my son you his hand began to rise toward richard you sent me to another world and now in turn i am going to send you there you are for the keeper he wants you you are his without even realizing it kahlans fist was up the con dar igniting in the depths of her being rage exploded through her and blue lightning erupted from her fist the dark void around them was ripped away in a fury of light and sound that shook the ground under her feet the spirit house was back lit by the blue bolt as it arced toward darken rahl effortlessly his hand came up deflecting the strike the bolt of lightning split one shaft blasted through the roof into the black sky sending a shower of tile fragments raining down the other fork struck the ground throwing dirt hurtling everywhere darken rahls eyes met hers his gaze seared her very soul he smiled the most wicked smile she had ever seen it seemed to make every fiber of her being ache she tried to call forth the power again but nothing happened he had done something kahlan tried but she couldnt move a muscle richard seemed as paralyzed as she her world was collapsing in a frightening rush richard she wailed in her mind my richard oh dear spirits dont let this happen his eyes burning with rage richard managed to take a step forward but darken rahl put his hand to the left side of his chest above his heart stopping him stone still i mark you richard for the keeper with the keepers mark you are his richard threw his head back his scream seemed to rend the very fabric of the air and tear her heart and soul with its despair kahlan felt as if she died a thousand deaths in that instant as darken rahl held his hand to richards chest wisps of smoke curled away kahlans nostrils filled with the stench of burning flesh darken rahl pulled his hand back the price of ignorance richard you are marked you are the keepers now now and forever the journey begins richard collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been out kahlan didnt know if he was unconscious or dead something held her up but it wasnt her legs it was the strings held by darken rahl he glided closer to her he loomed over her crushing her in blinding brilliance kahlan wanted to shrink away to close her eyes but she could not finally she regained her voice kill me too she whispered send me where you have sent him please his glowing hand reached toward her the agony in her heart tore her mind senseless his fingers fanned open his touch on her flesh sent fire and ice through her in a wave of shock the hand pulled back no darken rahls pitiless smile spread anew no that would be too easy better to let him see what happens to you better to let him watch helpless the smile showed teeth for the first time better to let him suffer it his eyes had an intensity that seemed to impale her it was the same frightening glare richard had inherited you live for now soon enough you will twist in a different pain living and dead he whispered in a measured merciless tone he will watch forever i will watch forever the keeper will watch forever please she cried send me with him a finger reached out and touched a tear the pain of the touch made her flinch since you love him so much i will give you a gift he turned and drew his arm smoothly through the air in richards direction his frightening blue eyes returned to her i will let him live a short time longer long enough for you to watch as the keepers mark bleeds the life from him bleeds his soul from him time is nothing the keeper will have him i give you this spark of time in forever to watch the one you love die he leaned toward her she struggled to back away but couldnt his lips left a kiss on her cheek the pain of it sent a silent shriek through her and filled her mind with a vision of being raped luminous fingers lifted her hair from her neck his mouth was by her ear enjoy my gift he whispered intimately in time i will have you too forever between life and death forever i would like to tell you how much you will suffer but i am afraid you would not be able to comprehend it soon enough i will show you he gave a whispering laugh in her ear after i have torn the veil the rest of the way and freed the keeper as she stood helpless he left another kiss on her neck the horror of the visions it seared through her mind left her feeling defiled beyond anything she had thought possible just a tiny taste goodbye for now mother confessor as he turned from her she was able to move again she snatched desperately for the power it wouldnt come she cried and shook as she watched him glide through the doorway of the spirit house and disappear and then she collapsed to the ground with a wail of agony convulsing in ragged sobs she clawed across the dirt to richard he lay on his side away from her she pulled him over on his back his arm flopped to his side limp his head rolled toward her he looked ashen dead on his chest was a burned handprint the keepers mark the blackened skin was cracked and bleeding his life his soul was bleeding away she fell on him clutched at him as she wept and shook uncontrollably kahlan gripped her fingers into a fist in his hair and pressed her face against his cold cheek please richard she cried in choking sobs please dont leave me i would do anything for you i would die in your place dont die dont leave me please richard dont die she crouched against him her world ending dying she could think of nothing to do other than cry that she loved him he was dying and she could do nothing to stop it she could feel his breathing slow she willed herself to die with him but death wouldnt come she lost all sense of time she didnt know if she had been there a few minutes or a few hours she didnt know what was real anymore it all felt like a nightmare with trembling fingers she stroked his face his skin was dead cold you would be kahlan she spun around sitting up at the sound of the womans voice coming from behind her the door to the spirit house was closed again in the darkness a white spiritlike glow towered over her it appeared to be a spirit a woman her hands clasped in front of her she watched with a pleasant smile her hair as best as kahlan could make of it was plaited in a single braid who are you the figure sank down to sit in front of her the spirit had no clothes kahlan could make out but didnt appear to be naked either the woman looked at richard a glaze of both longing and anguish came over her fair features the spirit turned to kahlan i am denna the shock of the name and her proximity to richard brought kahlans fist up in a jerk lightning screamed to be released before kahlan could let it go denna spoke again he is dying he needs us both of us kahlan hesitated you can help him we both can maybe if you love him enough kahlans hopes flared i would do anything anything denna nodded i hope so denna looked back to richard and tenderly stroked his chest kahlan was a blink away from releasing the power she didnt know if denna was trying to hurt him or help him she hoped against hope this was her only chance to save richard richard took a deep breath kahlans heart leapt denna withdrew her hand and smiled he is still with you kahlan lowered her fist a little and wiped tears from her cheek with the fingers of her other hand she didnt like the look of longing denna had as she watched richard not one bit how did you get here richard couldnt have called you you are not his ancestor denna turned her small dreamy smile fading it would be impossible to relate it to you accurately but perhaps i could explain it enough that it would help you to understand i was in a place of darkness and peace it was disturbed as darken rahl passed through his passing through is something that is not supposed to happen as he neared i sensed that richard had somehow called him and enabled him to pass from where he was held by a veil and to come here i know darken rahl all too well so i followed him i would never have been able to pass through my own veil but by latching on to him i was able to come through too to follow in his wake i came because i knew what darken rahl would do to richard i dont know how to explain it better kahlan nodded she wasnt seeing a spirit she was seeing a woman who had taken richard as her mate the power boiled angrily inside her she struggled to put it down telling herself that this was to save richard she didnt know any other way she had to let denna help if she could kahlan had said she would do anything and she meant it even if it was not to try to kill someone who was already dead someone she wanted to kill a thousand times and then another thousand can you help him can you save him the keepers mark has been placed upon him the mark will take the holder to the keeper if anothers hand is placed over the mark it will transfer to them and take them instead in his place richard will not then be pulled to the keeper he will live kahlan knew in that instant what she must do without hesitation she leaned over richard stretching her hand out then i will take the mark i will go in his place so that he will live she spread her fingers to match the black mark her hand was only a scant inch above it kahlan dont do that she looked over her shoulder why if it will save him then i am willing to go in his place i know you are but it is not that simple we must talk first it will not be easy for either of us it will hurt both of us to really help him kahlan reluctantly sat back down and nodded she would have agreed to anything paid any price even talking to this woman she put a hand protectively on richard as she sat facing denna how do you know who i am denna grinned almost laughed to know richard is to know who kahlan is he told you about me dennas smile faded in a way i heard your name countless times when i hurt him until he was delirious he cried your name never another not his mothers nor his fathers only yours i hurt him until he didnt know his own name but he always knew yours i knew he would find a way to be with you despite your confessors power a little of her smile came back i think richard could find a way to make the sun rise at midnight why are you telling me this because i am going to ask you to help him and i want you to understand exactly how much you will be hurting him before you agree to it you must understand what it is you will have to do in order to save him i wont trick you into doing it it must be with your full knowledge only in that way will you know how to save him if you dont understand you could fail he is in danger from more than this mark he is sick with a madness madness i put there it will kill him as surely as will the keepers mark richard is probably the most sane person i know he has no madness it is the mark we must remove he is marked in other ways he has the gift i knew from the moment he came to kill me i can see it in him now the aura of it i know it is killing him and i know his time is very short i dont know how long only that there is not much time left we cant save him from the keeper just to have him die anyway from the gift kahlan nodded as she wiped her nose on the back of her hand the sisters of the light say they can save him they say he must put a collar on to save himself richard will not put it on he told me what you did to him why he wont wear a collar but richard is not crazy he will see in the end what must be done and do it that is the way he is he will see the truth denna shook her head what he told you does not scratch the surface of it you cannot imagine what he has not told you i know his madness he will not tell you the rest of it i must kahlans anger boiled i dont think it would be wise for you to tell me if he doesnt want to tell me then i dont think i should know it you must you must understand him if you are to help him in some ways i understand him better than you i have taken him to the edge of madness and beyond i have seen him in a wasteland of insanity i have stood over him and held him there kahlan glared she recognized the look in dennas eyes when she looked at richard she didnt trust her you love him denna stared at her he loves you i used that love to hurt him i took him to the brink of death and held him there on the cusp others would bring a man to the edge faster but they couldnt hold him there they always went one step too far too quickly and killed them ending it before they could extract the most exquisite pain inflict the crudest of the insanity darken rahl chose me because i had a talent for keeping them alive and giving them that pain and then more and then even more darken rahl himself taught me i had to sit for hours sometimes and wait knowing that if i touched him just once more with the agiel it would be one touch too many it would kill him as i sat waiting for him to recover enough so that i might hurt him more he would whisper your name over and over for hours he wasnt even aware he was doing it you were the thread that kept him alive it was the one thread that allowed me to give him that extra pain allowed me to take him further toward death deeper into madness i used his love for you to punish him beyond anything otherwise possible as i would sit there listening to him whisper your name i wished it would once just once have been my name he called out it never was i hurt him more for that than for anything else tears ran down kahlans cheeks falling from her face please denna i dont want to hear any more i cant bear to hear any more to know i made it possible for you to do what you did you must i have not yet even begun to tell you what you must hear if you want to help him you must understand how i used magic against him why he hates the magic within himself i understand because what i did to him was also done to me by darken rahl as kahlan sat shaking staring blankly at nothing almost in a trance denna began telling her what she had done to richard how she used the agiel she flinched at the description of every kind of touch at everything it could do kahlan remembered all too well what its touch felt like the maddening pain she learned that what she had felt was the least of it she cried as denna told her how richard had hung in shackles as she pulled his head back by his hair and made him stay perfectly still while she pushed the agiel in his ear or risk damage inside his head and how he had been able to do it because of his love for kahlan she shook when she heard the horrifying description of what it did to him what the magic did to him what his own magic did to him she couldnt look at denna as the other spoke couldnt meet her eyes and that was only the beginning she clutched her stomach and held a trembling hand to her mouth to keep from vomiting as denna described one unspeakable act after another kahlan couldnt make herself stop crying she gagged as she closed her eyes tight as she listened she prayed to the good spirits that denna wouldnt tell her the one thing she knew she couldnt bear to hear but then denna told her told her what a mordsith did to her mate why their mates didnt live long every intimate detail and what she had done to richard that she had done to no other mate with a wail kahlan turned away crawled a short distance and started throwing up with one hand holding herself up and the other across her abdomen she cried and heaved and gagged dennas hands were there holding her hair back as kahlan emptied the contents of her stomach onto the dirt she vomited until her insides were heaved dry she felt dennas warm tingling touch on her back she wanted to call forth the lightning but was too sick to find the power she was torn between wanting to throw herself on richard and comfort him and ripping this woman apart with the magic of the con dar the blood rage between gagging and panting and crying kahlan managed to get the words out take your hands off me the hand holding her hair slipped away the one on her back lifted her stomach heaved again in a dry convulsion how many times did you do that to him enough it does not matter kahlan turned in a rage clenching her fists as she screamed how many times dennas voice was soft and calm im sorry kahlan i dont know i didnt keep a tally but he was with me a long time longer than any other mate i did it almost every night the things i did i did to no other because none had the strength richard did the strength of his love for you the others would have died the first time he fought me for a long time i did it enough thats all enough enough enough for what enough to drive a part of him mad hes not mad hes not hes not denna watched as kahlan shook with pain and rage kahlan listen to me anyone else would have been broken by what i did richard saved himself by partitioning his mind he locked the core of himself away where i couldnt get to it where the magic couldnt get to it he used the gift to do that it saved the core of himself from the insanity but in the darkest corners of his mind lurks madness i used his magic against him to drive him insane he couldnt protect all of himself from the things i did i told you what i did so you could see the truth of his madness he had to sacrifice that part to save the rest to save the rest for you i wish i could have done the same when it was done to me kahlan lifted richards hand in hers holding the back of it to her heart how could you do those things she cried oh my poor richard how could you how could you do that to anyone we all have our own little bits of insanity some more than others my life was a darkness of it then how could you how could you knowing what it was like denna watched her from under her eyebrows you have done terrible things too you have used your power to hurt people but they were people guilty of horrible crimes all of them she asked quietly every one kahlans breath caught with the memory of using her power against brophy no she whispered but i didnt do it because i wanted to i had to it is my job who i am what i am but you did it and what of demmin nass the words cut through her her mind flooded with the memory the sweet memory of castrating that beast of a man she sank forward with a wail oh dear spirits am i no better than you we all do what we must whatever the reasons her glowing diaphanous fingers lifted kahlans chin i do not tell you these things to hurt you kahlan the telling of them wounds me more than you can know i tell you because i want to save richard so that he doesnt die before his rightful time and so that the keeper does not escape kahlan clutched richards hand tighter to her breast as she wept im sorry denna but i dont have it in me to forgive you i know richard does but i do not i hate you i would not expect you to forgive me i only wish you to understand the truth of what i am telling you the truth of richards madness why to what purpose so that you will understand what you must do wearing a collar is the core of that insanity it symbolizes everything i did to him in his mind magic is madness torture a collar is madness torture insanity the thought of having a collar around his neck brings that madness out of the darkest corners of his being brings out his deepest fears he is not exaggerating when he says he would rather die than put a collar around his neck he will not do it to save himself if he doesnt he will die there is only one thing in the world that will make him put on the collar kahlans head snapped up her eyes were wide you want me to ask him to put a collar around his neck she went weak with dread you would have me do that to him after what you have told me denna nodded he will do it if you tell him to he will not do it for any other reason none richards limp arm slipped from kahlans shaking hands her fingers covered her mouth denna was right after what she knew now what she had heard she knew denna was right she knew now what it had been that she had seen in richards eyes when he looked at the collar the sisters held out to him it had been madness richard would never put a collar around his neck of his own accord never she knew that now really knew it a small cry escaped her throat if i make him put on the collar he will think i have betrayed him in his madness he will think i want to hurt him pain welled up inside her and she started to cry all over again he will hate me dennas voice came in a soft whisper i am sorry kahlan that could be the truth of it we cant know for sure but he may very well see it that way i dont know how much the madness will take over when he knows he must put on the collar when you tell him he must but he loves you more than life itself and will put it on for no other reason denna i dont know if i could do that to him not after what you have told me you must or he will die if you love him enough you must do this you must be strong enough in your love for him to force him to do it knowing the pain it will bring him you may have to act as i would have acted to frighten him enough to do as you say you may have to bring the madness to full flower make him think the way he did when he was with me when he would have done anything he was told you may lose his love he may hate you forever but if you really love him you will see that you are the only one who can help him the only one who can save him kahlan snatched desperately for a way out but in the morning we were going to go to zedd a wizard who might be able to help him control the gift richard thinks zedd will know what to do that he will be able to help him that may be true im sorry kahlan i dont know the answer to that it may work but i do know that the sisters of the light have the power to save him if they come and he turns them down for the third time he will forever lose the opportunity to get their help if it turns out that this wizard cant help richard then he will die his time is short days at most do you understand what that means kahlan he wont just die the keeper will have him have everyone richard is the only one who can close the veil how do you know how he can close it im sorry i dont i know only that it must be torn the rest of the way from this side that is why the keeper has agents on this side that is why darken rahl came here somehow richard is the only one who can stop them and also the only one with the power to repair what has been rent if he turns the sisters down and this wizard cant help him then he dies soon and it will be as if the mark itself took him to the keeper if he can get to this wizard before he turns the sisters down for the third time he can learn whether he can be helped without them without the collar but if they come before he can get to zedd i must have your promise you will do what must be done to save him there is time the sisters wont be back for at least a few days we can get to zedd first there is time i hope you are right i really do im sure you wont believe me but i dont want richard to ever have to wear a collar to ever face that madness again but if you cant get to zedd then you must promise me you wont allow him to miss the chance at life the sisters offer tears streamed from kahlans burning eyes richard would hate her if she made him put on the collar she knew he would he would think she had betrayed him but what of the mark he still has the mark on him denna watched her a long time her voice came so softly kahlan could scarcely hear it i will take the mark i will go to the keeper in his place a shimmering tear ran down her cheek but i will only do it i will only give up my soul if i know it gives him a chance kahlan stared incredulously you would do that for him she whispered why because after all i had done to him he cared about my pain he is the only one who ever did anything to stop my pain when darken rahl beat me he cried and he made a potion to take away my pain though i had never once stopped torturing him no matter how much he begged not once and after all the things i have told you i did to him he forgave me he understood what i had suffered he took my agiel to wear around his neck and promised to remember me to remember that i was more than a mordsith to remember that i was once just denna another shimmering tear ran down and because i love him even in death i love him though i know my love will never be requited i still love him kahlan looked at richard as he lay on his back unconscious helpless with the keepers mark black and bleeding on his chest the black and white mud painted everywhere on him made him look wild savage but he wasnt he was the gentlest person she had ever known she realized then that she would do anything to save him anything i will do it she whispered i promise if we cant find zedd before the sisters come back for the third time i will make him put on the collar no matter what it takes even if it makes him hate me even if it kills me dennas hand reached out to her an oath then between the living and the dead to do what must be done to save him kahlan stared at the hand before her i still cant forgive you i wont forgive you the hand stayed where it was waiting the only forgiveness i need has already been granted kahlan stared at the hand and then reached out and took it an oath then to save the one we love they clasped hands and shared a silent joining denna took away her hand time is short for him it must be now kahlan nodded when it is done get help for him though the pull of the mark will be removed the wound will still be there and it is a serious one kahlan nodded there is a healer here she will help him dennas eyes were filled with compassion thank you kahlan for loving him enough to help him may the good spirits be with you both she gave a small frightened smile where i am going i will never see any of them or i would send them to help you kahlan touched the back of the others hand offering a silent prayer for strength denna returned the touch to kahlans cheek and then knelt next to richard her hand went to the mark covering it dissolving into it richards chest heaved dennas features twisted in pain she threw her head back with a piercing scream that shot through kahlan and then she was just gone richard groaned kahlan bent over him caressing him crying kahlan he moaned kahlan what happened it hurts it hurts so lie still my love everything is all right you are safe with me ill get help he nodded and she ran to the door throwing it open the elders were sitting in a small circle in the dark just outside the door they looked up expectantly help me she screamed carry him to nissel theres no time to get her chapter when he stirred kahlan lifted her head his gray eyes blinked and searched around the small room until they found her face where are we she gave his shoulder a little squeeze at nissels she tended your burn his right hand came up and touched the bandagecovered poultice he winced how long what time is it kahlan looked up from where she was crouched on the floor next to him rubbed her eyes and squinted out the partly opened door at the gray light it has been light for an hour or two nissel is in the back room sleeping she was up most of the night tending your wound the elders are all outside watching over you they havent left since we brought you here when when did you bring me here in the middle of the night richard looked around again what happened darken rahl was there his big hand grasped her arm he touched me he marked me where did he go what happened after he touched me she shook her head i dont know he just left his hand squeezed her arm painfully his eyes were wild what do you mean he left did he go back into the green light back into the underworld she pulled at his fingers richard youre hurting me he let go im sorry he cradled her head to his good shoulder im sorry i didnt mean to im sorry he let out a noisy breath i cant believe how stupid i am she kissed his neck it didnt hurt that much thats not what i mean i mean i cant believe how stupid i was to call him back from the underworld i cant believe i did something that stupid i was warned i should have thought i should have figured it out i let myself focus on one thing so strongly that i didnt look around and see what was coming from a different direction i must be mad to have done that dont say that she whispered youre not mad she pushed herself up and looked down at him dont you ever say that about yourself he blinked then pushed himself up to sit facing her he winced when he touched the bandage again he reached out to run his hand down her cheek through her hair he smiled the smile that made her heart melt he sought her eyes you are the most beautiful woman in the world did i ever tell you that all the time well you are i love your green eyes your hair you have the most beautiful hair i ever saw kahlan i love you more than anything in the world she forced herself to hold back tears i love you more than anything else too please richard promise me you wont ever doubt my love promise me that no matter what happens you wont ever doubt how much i love you he cupped her cheek i promise i promise i will never doubt your love no matter what all right whats the matter she leaned against him laid her head on his shoulder and wrapped her arms carefully around him so as not to hurt him darken rahl frightened me thats all i was so afraid when he burned you with his hand i thought you were dead he stroked her shoulder so what happened i remember him telling me how he got here because i called him and he was my ancestor and then he said something about marking me for the keeper then i dont remember anything else what happened kahlans mind raced well he said he was going to mark you kill you that the mark would send you to the keeper he said he was here to tear the veil the rest of the way he put his hand against you burned you but before he could do it enough before he could kill you i called the lightning the con dar he missed a breath i dont suppose that we could be lucky enough that it killed him or destroyed him or whatever it is that can be done to a spirit she shook her head no it didnt destroy him he was able to block it partly anyway but i think it frightened him he left not back into the green light but out the door before he could finish what he was going to do to you he just left thats all he grinned and hugged her tighter my heroine you saved me he was quiet a moment here to tear the veil he whispered to himself his brow was set in a thoughtful frown and then what happened kahlan steeled herself for the lie of omission but she couldnt bear the scrutiny of his eyes she nestled her face against his shoulder frantically trying to think of a way to get him off the subject and then the elders and i carried you here so nissel could tend to your burn she said that its bad but that the poultice will make it well you have to leave it on for a few days until it begins to heal over enough she angrily shook a finger at him i know you you will want to take it off sooner you always think you know best well you dont you will just leave it on like i tell you richard cypher his smile faded a little richard rahl she stared at him im sorry she whispered richard rahl she forced a smile my richard maybe you could change it when were married you could be richard amnell mates to confessors sometimes take their wifes family name he grinned i like it richard amnell husband to the mother confessor devoted husband loving husband the haunted look returned to his eyes sometimes i fear i dont know who or what i am sometimes i think you are part of me and i am part of you thats all that is important he nodded absently his eyes glistening with tears i wanted to help with a gathering i wanted to find a way to stop all this instead as darken rahl said ive only made it worse he was right i am stupid its going to be my fault richard stop it youve been hurt youre just exhausted when youve rested youll figure it out youll know what to do he gave himself a mental shake he threw the blanket off and looked down who washed the mud off me and dressed me the elders washed off the mud nissel and i were going to dress you she said as his face turned red but you were too big and heavy for us the elders did that too they had quite a time of it it took all of them he nodded absently he had stopped listening he reached up to the spot on his chest where the whistle scarlets tooth and the agiel usually hung but didnt find them we have to get out of here we have to get to zedd right now before anything else happens i need zedds help where is scarlets tooth i have to call her wheres my sword all of our things are in the spirit house he scrubbed his hands over his face thinking then combed his fingers through his hair all right his solid gaze came to her eyes ill go get the tooth and call scarlet and get our things together get them ready to leave he gently squeezed her upper arm you go to weselan and put on your wedding dress while we wait for scarlet to come we can be married well leave when scarlet gets here he kissed her cheek we will be married and well be in aydindril with zedd before dark everything will be all right youll see everything will be all right ill find out what i did wrong and fix it i promise she put her arms around his neck we will fix it she corrected together always together he laughed quietly in her ear together i need you you light my way she slipped away from him and looked at him sternly well i have instructions for you and you are going to do as you are told you are going to wait here until nissel says you can get up she said that when you wake she has to change the poultice and bandage and give you medicine you are going to stay here until she is finished understand i dont want you getting sick and dying on me now not after i have gone to all the trouble of saving you and a great deal of trouble it was ill go to weselan so she can finish fitting my dress when nissel is finished with you then she shook a finger at him and only then may you leave to go call scarlet when you are finished here with nissel and when you have called scarlet and gotten our things together come get me and i will marry you she kissed the end of his nose if you also promise to love me always always he said with a grin she rested her wrists on his shoulders to each side of his strong neck and clasped her fingers together behind his head ill wake nissel and ask her to hurry with you but please richard dont waste any time after that call scarlet quickly quick as you can i want to get away from here i want to get away before sister verna even comes close i dont want to take any chances even if she isnt supposed to be back for a few days i want us away from here away from the sisters of the light i want to get you to zedd so he can help you with the headaches before they can get any worse he gave her a boyish lopsided smile what about your big bed in aydindril dont you want to get to that in a hurry too with a finger she gently squashed his nose flat ive never had anyone else in my big bed before i hope i dont disappoint you he gripped her waist in his strong hands and pulled her to him hard enough to make her grunt he pushed her hair back off her neck and gave it a tender kiss right where darken rahls lips had been disappoint me that my love is the only thing in the world it would be impossible for you to do he gave her neck one more tickling kiss now go get nissel we are wasting time kahlan pulled on the fabric trying to bring it up as much as she could ive never worn anything cut this low you dont think it shows too much weselan looked up from the floor where she was fussing with the hem of the blue dress she look the fine bone needle from her mouth as she rose to appraise her clients fit she studied the expanse of flesh a moment you dont think he will like it kahlan felt her face flush well i think he will i hope so but weselan leaned a little closer if you are worried about him seeing that much maybe you had better reconsider this kahlan lifted an eyebrow he is not the only one who will be looking ive never worn anything like this before im worried that i dont do it justice weselan smiled and patted kahlans arm you wear the dress well it looks beautiful on you its perfect kahlan still fretted as she glanced down at herself really are you sure i fill it out properly weselans smile widened really you have fine breasts everyone says so kahlan felt her face redden she was sure of the truth of the casual statement among the mud people commenting favorably on a womans breasts in public was no more odd than a man elsewhere telling a woman she had a pleasant smile it was an uninhibited attitude that more than once had caught her offguard kahlan held the skirt out to the sides its the most beautiful dress ive ever worn weselan thank you for all your hard work i will treasure it always maybe someday if you have a daughter she will wear it when she weds kahlan smiled and nodded please dear spirits she was thinking if a child comes let it be a daughter and not a son she reached up and touched the delicate necklace she wore her fingers turning the small round bone strung among a few red and yellow beads adie the bone woman had given her the necklace to protect her from the beasts that dwelt in the pass through the boundary that at the time had separated westland from the midlands the old woman had told her it would help protect her child one day kahlan dearly loved the necklace it was just like the one her mother had received from adie and had in turn given to kahlan kahlan had buried it with her closest childhood friend dennee since dennees death she had missed her mothers necklace this one was all the more special because the night before they had gone through the pass richard had added his oath to the necklace to protect any future child she might have neither she nor richard had suspected at the time that there was any way that child might possibly be his i hope so weselan will you stand with me stand with you kahlan pulled some of her hair selfconsciously over her halfexposed chest where i come from it is the custom to have a friend stand by you when you wed to stand as a representative of the good spirits watching over the joining richard would like savidlin to stand with him i would like it if you stood by me that seems a strange custom the good spirits always watch over us but if it is your custom i would be honored to be the one who stands by you kahlan beamed thank you now stand up straight i am almost finished weselan again bent to her task at the hem kahlan tried to stand with her back straight it hurt from sitting on the floor next to richard the last half of the night she wished she could sit or lie down she was that sleepy but mostly her back hurt suddenly she wondered how much denna was hurting right now she didnt care she told herself whatever was happening to her would never be enough after what she had done to richard her stomach lurched at the memory of what denna had told her kahlan could still feel the place on her neck where darken rahl had put his lips a shiver ran up her spine at the memory she remembered the mask of agony on dennas face the instant before she disappeared it didnt matter she deserved it it could have been richard though if it hadnt been for denna it could have been richard dont be afraid kahlan what she focused her eyes weselan was standing in front of her smiling im sorry what did you say weselan reached out and wiped a tear from kahlans cheek i said not to be afraid richard is a good man you will have a happy life with him it is natural to fear being wedded but do not worry it will be fine you will see i cried too before i wedded my savidlin i didnt think i would because i wanted him so but i found myself crying just like you she winked i never had reason to cry again sometimes i find reason to complain but never to cry kahlan wiped the other cheek what was the matter with her she didnt care what was happening to denna she didnt not one bit she nodded to weselan and forced a smile that would be my greatest hope in life never to cry again weselan gave her a comforting hug would you like something to eat no im not savidlin burst through the door he was sweating and panting kahlan went cold with fright at the look on his face she started shaking even before his words came when nissel finished with richard i went with him to the spirit house like you told me to so he could call the dragon the sister of the light came for him she is there with him i didnt understand his words but i knew their meaning and your name he wanted me to come for you hurry noooo kahlan wailed as she shot past him and out through the doorway as she ran she held the hem of her dress up in her fists so she wouldnt trip on it she had never run so fast her breath couldnt keep pace as she raced down the narrow passageways her hair streamed behind her as she ran the winter air was frigid on her skin the sound of savidlin running behind her faded away she couldnt form a thought except that she must get to richard this couldnt be happening it was too soon the sister shouldnt be here the two of them were leaving almost gone it wasnt fair at all richard big white snowflakes drifted down not enough to turn the ground white but enough to bring an icy foreboding of the winter that was coming the winter that was here the wet flakes melted instantly as they touched her hot skin some caught in her lashes until she blinked them away a light breeze curled around a corner swirling into a white curtain kahlan flew through it and down a passageway she skidded to a stop and looked around it was the wrong way she ran back and took the correct turn tears ran down her face with the melted snowflakes it was too much it couldnt be panting and desperate she broke from the buildings into the clearing around the spirit house the sisters horses were tethered on the other side of the short wall the wall with the gash through it from when richard had tried to kill the screeling people were standing around but she didnt see them everything except the door to the spirit house grayed in her vision she ran desperately for it it took forever as if she were running in a dream and couldnt make any headway her legs ached with the strain her hand stretched for the latch her heart pounded in her ears please dear spirits she begged dont let me be too late grunting through gritted teeth she yanked the door open and threw herself through kahlan jerked to a halt she gulped air richard stood before sister verna beneath the hole ripped through the roof by the lightning the two of them stood in a shaft of gray light in the gently drifting snowflakes floating down the rest of the room dimmed into darkness around them at his hip richards sword glinted in the light he didnt have the tooth or whistle or agiel around his neck he hadnt had time to call scarlet yet in one hand sister verna was holding the collar out to him her gaze went to kahlan in silent warning for a moment and then slid back to richard you have heard the three reasons for the radahan this is your last chance to be helped richard will you accept the offer richard left the sisters steady gaze and turned slowly toward kahlan toward where she stood panting his bright gray eyes followed down her dress and came back up to her face his voice was gentle reverent kahlan that dress is beautiful beautiful kahlan couldnt find her voice her heart was pounding breaking sister verna spoke his name in a tone of serious warning for the first time kahlan saw that sister verna held something in her other hand it was the silver knife but she wasnt pointing it at herself it was held toward richard kahlan knew if he didnt accept she intended to kill him he didnt even seem to be aware of the knife as it flashed in the dim light kahlan wondered if she had used a spell to block it from his vision richard turned back to the sister you have done your best you have tried your best it is not enough i told you before i will not richard kahlan took another step toward him as he turned to the sound of her shriek her eyes locked on his richard she whispered as she took another step her voice broke accept the offer take the collar please sister verna didnt move she watched calmly richard frowned a little what kahlan you dont understand i told you i wont richard he fell silent as he looked at her in puzzlement she glanced at the sister standing motionless the knife still in her hand she watched as kahlan stepped closer their eyes met kahlan knew the other would wait to see what would happen there was a hardness in those eyes that spoke of what she was prepared to do if kahlan didnt change richards mind richard listen carefully to me i want you to accept the offer his frown deepened what take the collar his eyes flashed anger i told you before i will not you said you loved me kahlan whats the matter with you you know i love she cut him off then you will accept the offer if you really love me you will take the collar and put it on for me he stared at her in disbelief for you kahlan i cant i wont you will she was being too gentle and knew it it was only confusing him she had to be stronger she had to act more like denna if she was to save him dear spirits she begged in her mind please give me the strength to do this to save him kahlan i dont know whats gotten into you we can talk about it later you know how much i love you but im not going to she clenched her hands into fists and screamed at him if you love me you will dont stand there and tell me you love me if you arent willing to prove it you disgust me he blinked in surprise the way his voice sounded made her ache kahlan you arent worthy of my love if you arent willing to prove it how dare you say you love me his eyes were rilling with tears with madness with the memory of what denna had done to him he sank slowly to his knees kahlan please she leaned over him as she held out clenched fists dont you dare talk back to me his arms flinched up covering his head he thought she was going to strike him he really thought she was going to strike him her heart felt as if it ripped tears streamed down her face as she let the rage loose i told you to take the collar how dare you talk back to me if you love me you will take it kahlan please he cried dont do this you dont understand dont ask me to i understand perfectly well she screamed i understand that you say you love me but i dont believe you i dont believe you youre lying to me your love for me is a lie if you wont take the collar a lie a filthy lie he couldnt look up at her look up at her as she stood over him in the blue dress she was to wed him in he struggled to get the words out as he fixed his eyes on the ground its not its not a lie please kahlan i love you you mean more to me than anything in the world please believe me i would do anything for you but please dying inside she grabbed a fistful of his hair and jerked his head up making him look at her madness danced in his eyes he was gone but only for now she prayed please dear spirits only for now words thats all you offer me not love not proof just words worthless words as she held him by his hair she drew her other hand back to slap him his eyes winced shut she couldnt make herself do it she couldnt hit him it was all she could do just to stay on her feet not to fall to her knees and throw her arms around him and tell him how much she loved him that everything was all right but it wasnt all right if he didnt do this he would die she was the only one who could save him even if it killed her dont hit me anymore he whispered please denna dont kahlan swallowed back the wail that tried to escape her throat and made herself speak look at me he did as she ordered im not going to tell you again richard if you love me you will accept the offer and put on the collar if you dont i will make you regret disobeying me more than anything you have ever regretted in your life do it now or its over everything is over his eyes faltered she gritted her teeth im not going to tell you again my pet put on the collar now kahlan knew knew that my pet was what denna had called him denna had told her with the rest of it she knew what those two words meant to him she had hoped she wouldnt have to use them whatever link he had to sanity dissolved in that instant she saw it in his eyes the thing she feared more than death betrayal she released her grip on his hair as on his knees he turned to sister verna she lifted the collar a little holding it out to him it looked dull gray dead in the cold light richard stared at it snowflakes drifted down in the still quiet light expressionless sister verna watched him all right he whispered his shaking hand reached for the collar his fingers touched it curled around it i accept the offer i accept the collar then put it around your neck sister verna said in a soft voice and close it he turned to kahlan i would do anything for you he whispered kahlan wanted to die his hands shook so much she thought he might drop the collar as he took it from sister verna he held it staring at it but then his hands stopped shaking he took a deep breath and put the collar around his neck it closed with a snap and the seam disappeared leaving a smooth ring of metal the shaft of light dimmed as if to twilight even though it was still day deep ominous thunder rumbled in every direction out across the grasslands it didnt sound like any thunder kahlan had ever heard before she could feel it in the ground beneath her feet she thought that maybe it had something to do with the magic of the collar something to do with the sisters she knew when she glanced at sister verna and saw her eyes glide around that it wasnt richard smoothly rose to his feet before the sister you may find sister verna that holding the leash to this collar is worse than wearing it he gritted his teeth much worse sister vernas voice remained calm we only want to help you richard he nodded slightly i take nothing on faith you will have to prove it in a panic a sudden thought came to kahlan what is the third reason what is the third reason for the collar richard turned to her with a glare that even his father could not have matched for a moment she forgot how to breathe the first reason is to control the headaches and open my mind so that i may be taught to use the gift the second reason is to control me his hand came up and grabbed her by the throat his eyes sliced through her the third reason is to give me pain she closed her eyes with a wail no dear spirits no he released her throat his expression went slack lost i hope i have proven my love for you kahlan i hope you believe me now i have given you everything i hope it is enough i have nothing else to offer nothing you have more than you could ever realize i love you more than anything in the world richard she reached out to touch his cheek he pushed her hand away his eyes said it all she had betrayed him do you he looked away i would like to believe you she tried to swallow the painful burning lump in her throat you promised me you would never doubt my love he nodded slightly so i did if she could have called lightning down on herself she would have done it richard i know you dont understand right now but i only did what i had to to help you live to keep you from being killed by the headaches the gift i hope that someday you will understand i will always wait for you i love you with all my heart he nodded tearfully if thats true then find zedd tell him what you have done tell him sister vernas voice broke in richard take your things and go wait with the horses looking back at her he nodded he went to the far corner and picked up his cloak bow and pack reaching in he pulled out the three leather thongs the one with the bird mans whistle the one with scarlets tooth and the one with dennas agiel as kahlan watched him hang the three of them around his neck she wished she had something of her own to give him she tried desperately to think of something as he went past her she put a hand to his arm and stopped him wait kahlan pulled the knife from his belt she held out a long lock of her hair and severed it with the knife she didnt even think about what she was doing what happened when confessors cut their own hair with a scream of pain she found herself on the ground the magic seared through her burning every nerve in its passing she fought to remain conscious as she gulped for air she struggled against the wrenching pain of it she had to remain conscious or richard might leave before she could give it to him she thought of only that and forced herself to her feet as she did so the pain finally abated still panting kahlan pulled a small blue ribbon from the waist of the dress cut it too and after wrapping the long strand of hair around two fingers tied it together in the middle with the ribbon as he watched she returned the knife to its sheath at his belt and put the lock of hair in his shirt pocket to remind you always that my heart is with you that i love you expressionless he looked at her a long moment find zedd was all he said before turning and going through the doorway kahlan stood staring at the door after he was gone she felt numb empty lost sister verna stopped next to her watching the door with her that was probably the most courageous act i have ever witnessed she said softly the people of the midlands are fortunate to have you as their mother confessor kahlan continued to stare at the door he thinks i betrayed him she turned and looked at the sister tears welling up in her eyes he thinks i betrayed him the sister studied her face for a time you have not i promise you that in time i will help him to see the truth of what you have done this day please she begged dont hurt him sister verna clasped her hands in front of herself and took a deep breath you have just hurt him to save his life would you have me do any less a tear ran down her cheek i guess not and i doubt you could do anything as cruel as what i have just done sister verna nodded i fear you are right but i will give you my promise that i will personally watch over him and see to it that what is done is only what is necessary i promise you that i will not let it go one inch beyond that not one breath on my word as a sister of the light thank you she looked down at the knife in the others hand the sister pushed it back up her sleeve you would have killed him if he said no you would have killed him she nodded if he had said no the pain and madness at the end would have been grotesque i would have spared him that but it doesnt matter now you have saved his life thank you mother confessor kahlan sister verna stepped toward the door sister how long how long will you have him how long will i have to wait the sister didnt turn im sorry i cant say it takes as long as it takes much of it is up to him it depends on how fast he learns kahlan smiled for the first time i think you will be surprised at how fast richard learns sister verna nodded that is what i fear most knowledge before wisdom it frightens me more than anything else i think too that richards wisdom may surprise you i pray you are right goodbye kahlan dont try to follow or he will die sister one more thing the cold danger in her own voice surprised her if you are lying to me about any of it if you kill him i will hunt down every sister of the light i will kill every last one but not before each of you begs endlessly to die the sister stood still as stone a moment before nodding and then going on her way kahlan followed her out and stood with the people outside as she watched the sister mount her horse richard already sat tall on a big bay gelding his back was to her as he waited kahlans heart was breaking she wanted to see his face one more time but he didnt turn as the two of them started away kahlan sank to her knees richard she cried i love you he seemed not to hear her as he and sister verna disappeared into the snowy grasslands kahlan sat on the ground in her wedding dress her head hanging down crying weselan put an arm around her comforting her kahlan remembered what he had said find zedd she forced herself to her feet the elders were all there she looked around at them all i must leave at once i must get to aydindril i need some men to go with me to help me to be sure i make it savidlin came up next to her i go and as many of my hunters as you wish all of them if you wish we will take a hundred kahlan put a hand on his shoulder and gave him a little smile wo i do not wish it to be you my friend or your hunters i will take only three men everyone mumbled in confusion more would bring attention maybe trouble it will be easier with three to slip unnoticed it will take less time that way kahlan took the hand away and pointed at a man who stood watching glaring i choose you chandalen the two brothers were standing to his side and you prindin and tossidin chandalen stormed forward me why would you want me because i must not fail i know that if i took savidlin he would try his hardest but if he failed the mud people would know he did his best you are a better hunter of men richard told me once that if he had to pick one man to fight beside him it would be you even though you hate him where we go men are the danger if i dont make it if you fail me everyone will think it is because you didnt try your hardest they will always think you let me die let another mud person die because you hate me and richard if you let me be killed you will never be welcomed back to the mud people your people prindin stepped forward his brother right next to him i will go my brother too we will help you chandalen glared i will not i will not go kahlan looked to the bird man his brown eyes met hers and then he turned an iron gaze on chandalen kahlan is a mud person you are the bravest most cunning fighter among us it is your responsibility to protect us all of us you will do this you will go with her you will follow her orders and you will get her safely to where she wishes to go or you will leave now and never return and chandalen if she is killed dont come back if you do we will kill you as we would kill any outsider with black painted on his eyes chandalen shook with rage he threw his spear on the ground seething he put fists to his hips if i am to leave our land there will have to be a ceremony to call the spirits to protect us on our journey it will take until tomorrow we leave then all eyes went to kahlan i leave in one hour you will be with me you haw until then to prepare kahlan turned to the spirit house to change out of her wedding dress into her traveling clothes and to get her things together she gratefully accepted weselans offer to help chapter fat wet flakes of snow drifted down sometimes falling harder gathering in gusts and swirling into white curtains richard rode in a numb haze behind sister verna the third horse tethered to his and trotting along behind when the snow swept down in dense flurries the sister was no more than a gray shape ahead of him it never occurred to him to wonder where they were going or to close his cloak against the cold biting wind it didnt matter nothing mattered his thoughts seemed to float and dance with the snow unable to settle he had never loved anything in his life the way he loved kahlan she had become his life and she had sent him away he hurt too much to think of anything else he was stunned that she would doubt his love that she would send him away why would she send him away his mind drifted in and out of dense desperate thoughts he couldnt understand how she could ask him to put on a collar to prove his love he had told her what wearing a collar meant to him maybe he should have told her all of it maybe then she would have understood his chest ached where darken rahl had burned him when he reached up and touched the bandage he finally noticed that the snow flurries had stopped the low scudding clouds were broken in places letting shafts of sunlight shine through the grassland was a flat dead brown and the clouds a dull dead gray the landscape was a colorless empty expanse by the angle of the sun he realized it was getting to be late afternoon they had been riding for a long time in silence sister verna had said nothing to him he reached up and experimentally touched the collar for the first time it was smooth seamless cold he had said he would never wear a collar again he had promised himself yet here he was wearing one worse he had put it on himself put it on because kahlan had asked him to because she doubted him for the first time since he had put it on he forced himself to think of something else he couldnt think about kahlan anymore couldnt stand the pain he was the seeker he had other things to think about important things with a gentle squeeze of his lower legs to the horses girth he urged it ahead pulling it close beside the sisters chestnut gelding richard reached up to push back the hood of his cloak and realized it wasnt even up so he ran his fingers through his wet hair instead he looked over at sister verna there are some things we have to talk about important things you dont know about she glanced over without emotion the edge of her hood partially blocked her face and what would those things be i am the seeker she looked away returning her eyes to where they had been that is hardly something i dont know her calm unconcerned attitude annoyed him i have responsibilities i told you before there are important things going on you know nothing about dangerous things she didnt respond it was as if he hadnt spoken he decided to cut right to the heart of it the keeper is trying to escape the underworld we do not speak his name you are not to speak it as you have just done it brings his attention when we must speak of him he is addressed as the nameless one she was talking to him as if he were a child kahlans life was in danger and this woman was treating him like a child i dont care what you call him hes trying to get out and i assure you i already have his attention at last she looked over unconcerned the nameless one is always trying to get out richard took a deep breath and tried again the veil to the underworld is torn he is going to get out sister verna turned to him once more this time pulling the edge of the hood back to get a better look curly brown hair peeked out the edge of the dark heavy hood she had an odd frown a frown of amusement there was a wisp of a smile at the corners of her mouth the creator himself put the nameless one where he is the creator himself placed the veil with his own hand to keep him there her smile swelled a little as her eyebrows came closer together creasing her weathered brow the nameless one cannot escape the prison the creator has placed him in do not be afraid child exploding in rage richard wheeled his bay mare around toward the sister the two horses jostled whinnying and tossing their heads richard firmly snatched the reins of the sisters surprised horse to keep it from rearing or bolting he leaned toward her his chest heaving in fury i will not be called names i will not have names put to me because i wear a collar i am richard richard rahl sister verna didnt flinch her voice remained calm and smooth im sorry richard it was only force of habit i am used to dealing with ones much younger than you i meant nothing demeaning by it the way she stared at him made him feel suddenly foolish embarrassed made him feel like a child he released the reins i apologize for yelling im not in a very good mood she frowned again i thought your name was cypher he tugged his cloak over his chest where the bandage covered his burn its a long story george cypher raised me as his son i only found out a short time ago that i am in truth the son of darken rahl her frown deepened darken rahl the one with the gift you killed you killed your father dont look at me like that you didnt know him you have no idea what kind of man he was he imprisoned and tortured and killed more people than you or i could imagine the idea of him being with my mother makes me sick but that is the truth of it i am his son if you expect me to be sorry i killed him you will have longer than eternity to wait sister verna shook her head with what seemed genuine concern im sorry richard sometimes the creator weaves a tangled cloth for our lives and we are left to wonder why but i am sure of one thing he has reasons for what he does babble he was getting babble from this woman he urged his horse around and started out again im telling you the veil is torn and the keeper is going to get out her voice lowered dangerously the nameless one he glanced over annoyed tine the nameless one i couldnt care less what you want to call him but he is going to get out we are all in great danger kahlan was in great danger he didnt care if this sorceress of a sister burned him to a cinder his life meant nothing to him anymore his only concern was kahlans safety sister vernas quizzical frown and smile returned who told you such a thing shota a witch woman she told me the veil was torn he left out that shota had also told him he was the one who had torn it she said it was torn and if it wasnt fixed the kee the nameless one would escape sister verna smiled her eyes sparkled a witch woman she laughed a little and you believed her you believed a witch woman you think witch women speak the truth in such simple fashion fuming richard glanced at her from the corner of his eye she seemed pretty sure of it to me she wouldnt lie about something this important i believe her sister verna seemed to think the whole thing amusing if you had ever had occasion to deal with a witch woman before richard you would know that they have an odd view of the truth they can be well intentioned at times but witch women speak in words that rarely come to pass the way they sound the truth of that took some of the steam out of him sister verna certainly seemed to know about witch women in fact she seemed to share his own view of them she seemed pretty sure of what she was saying she was afraid i am sure she was a wise person is always afraid of the nameless one but i wouldnt put much stock in what she says its not just what she says other things have happened too she looked over curiously such as a screeling she set her calm brown eyes back ahead a screeling you have seen a screeling yes seen it it attacked me screelings are from the underworld they are sent by the nameless one it was sent through a tear in the veil to kill me her smile returned you have quite an imagination richard you have listened to too many childrens songs he restrained his renewed anger what do you mean screelings are indeed from the underworld as are other beasts the heart hounds for example but they are not sent they simply escape we live in a world that lies between good and evil between the light and the dark the creator did not intend this to be a perfect world safe from all harm we cannot understand his reasons always but he has them and he is perfect perhaps the screelings are meant to show us the dark side i dont know but i do know they are simply an evil that sometimes comes i have seen this happen before to ones with the gift it is possible that the gift draws them a test perhaps a warning perhaps of the rancid evil that awaits those who stray from the light but there are prophecies that say they are sent when the veil is torn sent by the nameless one how could that be richard has the veil ever been torn before how should i know he thought a minute but i dont see how it could have been if it were how could it have been mended and it wouldnt have gone unnoticed what are you getting at well if the veil has never been torn how could the screelings have been sent before how would we know what they were how could they have a name already put to them it was richards turn to frown maybe we only know them as screelings because they have been named in the prophecy you have read this prophecy well no kahlan told it to me and she read it herself with her own eyes yes no she learned it when she was young richards irritated frown deepened in a song she learned it from wizards in a song sister verna didnt look over but her smile widened richard i do not mean to belittle your fears but things repeated over and over especially in a song have a way of changing as for prophecies well they are harder to understand than a witch woman we have vaults full of them at the palace as part of your studies perhaps you will be allowed to work with them i have read all of them we have and i can tell you that they are beyond the minds of most if you arent cautious you can find a prophecy that will say whatever you want to hear or at least you will think it is what you want to hear some wizards devote their lives to the study of them and yet even they understand only a tiny fraction of their truth this is a danger not to be taken so lightly do you think the veil is torn that simply have faith richard the creator placed the veil have faith in him richard rode in silence for a time sister verna did seem to make sense he felt as if his understanding of the world was tilting but it was difficult for him to think too hard on the subject kahlan kept creeping back into his mind his anguish at her wanting him to put on a collar to prove his love knowing it would take him from her tore at his heart the betrayal burned painfully in his chest he picked at the reins with his thumbnail at last he turned once more to the sister thats not all i havent told you the worst of it she smiled a motherly smile there is more tell me then perhaps i can put your fears to rest richard let out a deep breath trying to release at least a little of the pain with it the man i killed darken rahl my father well when he died he was sent to the underworld to the kee the nameless one last night he escaped escaped through the tear in the veil he is back in this world back to tear the veil the rest of the way and you know he was sent to the nameless one you were in the underworld to see him arrive there at the side of the nameless one yes the woman had a way of poking his temper awake he tried to ignore the sting of the jab i talked to him when he came back to this world he told me he told me he was here to tear the veil the rest of the way he said the keeper would have us all a dead man come back to this world do you see the only way his spirit could be here is if he came through the veil you were just sitting there and this dead man walked up and spoke to you yes richard frowned deeply at her but she didnt look over to see it it was at a gathering with the mud people i was trying to talk to their ancestors spirits to try to find out how to close the veil and he appeared ahhh she nodded in satisfaction i see what does that mean sister vernas face set into an expression of tolerance born of explaining things to children did the mud people have you drink or eat some sacred potion before you saw this spirit no you simply sat down with them and saw spirits yes well not exactly there is a banquet first for a couple of days the elders eat and drink special things but i never did then we were painted with mud and then i went into the spirit house with the seven elders we sat in a circle and they chanted awhile then they passed around a basket and we took out a spirit frog and rubbed the slime from its back onto our skin frogs sister verna looked over red frogs yes yes red spirit frogs with a smile she looked back ahead i know of them and it made your skin tingle yes and it is then you saw spirits thats a pretty simplistic version but i guess you could distill it down like that what are you trying to say you have traveled the midlands often you have seen many of her peoples no im from westland i dont know much about the people of the midlands she nodded to herself again there are many peoples in the midlands unbelievers who do not know of the light of the creator they worship all sorts of things idols and spirits and such they are savages who hold to customs of worship centered around these false beliefs they mostly have one thing in common they use sacred food or drink to help them see their spirit protectors she looked over to make sure he was paying attention the mud people apparently use the substance on the red frogs to help them have these visions of what they wish to see visions the creator has placed many plants and animals in our world for us to use the power of these things work in invisible ways a tea for example of the bark of willow can help reduce a fever we cant see it work but we know it does there are many things that if eaten will make us sick even kill us the creator gave us minds to learn the difference there are some things that if eaten or in the case of the red frogs rubbed into our skin will make us see things just as we see things when we dream savages who dont know better think the things they see are real that is what happened to you you rubbed the slime of a red frog into your skin and it gave you visions your rightful fear of the nameless one made it all the more real to you if these spirits were real why would you need to use some special plant or food or drink or in this case red frogs to see and talk to them please dont think i am mocking you richard the visions can seem very real when you are under their influence they can seem as real as anything but they are not richard was reluctant to believe the sisters explanation but he understood what she was talking about from a young age zedd had taken him into the woods to find special plants to help people aum to take away pain and help minor wounds heal faster and wattle root to ease the pain of deeper wounds zedd had showed him other plants that would help fevers digestion the pain of childbirth dizzy spells and he had also told him about plants to avoid plants that were dangerous and plants that would make people see things that werent there visions but he didnt think he had imagined darken rahl he burned me richard tapped his shirt where the bandage was i couldnt have been having visions darken rahl was there he reached out and touched me and it burned my skin pm not imagining that the sister gave a little shrug that could be one of two things after you rubbed the frog on your skin you couldnt see the room you were in could you no it just seemed to disappear into a dark void well see it or not it was still there and im sure the savages would have had a fire burning when you had this gathering and when you were burned you were not sitting in the same place but you were standing moving about yes yes he admitted reluctantly she pursed her lips in the deluded state you were in you probably fell and burned yourself on a stick in the fire and imagined that it was this spirit doing the burning richard was beginning to feel decidedly foolish could the sister be right was it all this simple was he really this gullible you said it could be two things what is the other the sister rode in silence for a moment when her voice came it came lower darker than it had before the nameless one always seeks to have us side with him though he is locked behind the veil his tentacles can still reach into this world he can still harm us he is dangerous the dark side is dangerous when ignorant people dabble in things dark they can call forth danger call forth the attention of the nameless one or his minions it is possible you really were touched burned by one of the evil ones she glanced over there are dangerous things people are too foolish to avoid sometimes those things can kill her voice brightened a bit that is one of our jobs trying to teach those who have not yet seen the light of the creator to go toward that light and stay away from the things dark and dangerous richard couldnt think of anything to counter the sisters explanations of events the things she said made sense if she were right that would mean that kahlan wasnt really in danger that kahlan was safe he wanted to believe that he desperately wanted to believe that but still i will admit that you could be right but im not sure there seems to be more to it than i can put into words i understand richard its hard to admit we have been wrong no one wants to admit they have been tricked or made to look the fool that view of ourselves hurts but part of growing learning is being able to hold the truth above all else even when it means we must admit to having held foolish ideas please believe me richard i do not see you as a fool for having believed as you did your fear was understandable the mark of a wise person is being able to reach beyond for the truth to admit they can learn more than they already know but all of these things are connected are they a wise person doesnt string together the beads of unrelated events into a necklace simply to have something they wish to see a wise person sees the truth even if it is something unexpected that is the most beautiful necklace to wear the truth the truth he muttered to himself he was the seeker the truth was what the seeker was all about it was woven in gold wire into the hilt of his sword the sword of truth something about the things that had happened were more than he could put into words for her could it be as she said could he simply be fooling himself he remembered the wizards first rule people will believe anything either because they want it to be true or are afraid it might be he knew from experience that he was as susceptible to it as anyone else he wasnt above believing a lie he had believed kahlan loved him he had believed she would never do anything to hurt him and she had sent him away richard felt the lump rising in his throat again im telling you the truth richard i am here to help you he didnt answer he didnt believe her as if to answer his thoughts she asked how are your headaches the question stunned him not the question so much as the realization theyre gone the headache is completely gone sister verna smiled and nodded in satisfaction as i promised you the radahan would take away the headache we only want to help you richard his eyes turned to watch her you also said the collar is to control me so we may teach you richard you must have a persons attention to teach them thats all it is for and to hurt me you said it is to give me pain she shrugged opening her palms to the sky the reins woven through her fingers i have just given you pain i showed you how you were believing in something foolish does that not give you pain does it not hurt you to learn you have been wrong but isnt it better to know the truth than to believe a lie even if it hurts he looked away thinking of the truth of kahlan making him put on a collar sending him away that truth hurt more than anything the truth that he wasnt good enough for her i guess so but i dont like wearing a collar not one bit he was sick of talking his chest hurt his muscles were all cramped he was tired he missed kahlan but kahlan had made him put on a collar and sent him away he let his horse and the one tethered to his saddle fall back to trail behind the sisters once more as tears ran down his cheeks feeling like ice on his skin he rode in silence his horse tore off wads of grass and chewed as it plodded along ordinarily richard wouldnt have let his horse eat while it had a bit in its mouth it couldnt chew properly with the bit and could end up with colic you could lose a good horse to colic instead of stopping it richard stroked its warm neck and gave reassuring pats it felt good to have company that didnt tell him he was stupid company that didnt judge or make demands he didnt feel like doing the same to the horse better to be a horse than a man he thought walk turn stop nothing more better to be anything than what he was despite what sister verna said he knew he was nothing more than a captive nothing she said could change that if he was ever going to be set free he would have to learn to control the gift once the sisters were satisfied he could control the gift maybe they would free him if kahlan didnt want him at least he would be free that was what he would do he decided learn to use the gift as fast as he could so he could get the collar off and be set free zedd had always told him he was a fast learner he would learn everything besides he had always liked learning he had always wanted to know more there was never enough for him he brightened the slightest bit at the idea he liked learning new things maybe it wouldnt be so bad he could do it besides what else was there he thought of the way denna trained him taught him his mood sank he was just deluding himself they would never set him free he wasnt going to learn because he wanted to or what he wanted to he was going to learn what the sisters of the light wanted him to learn and he didnt necessarily believe that what they taught was the truth they were going to teach him about pain it was hopeless he rode with his dark brooding thoughts he was the seeker the bringer of death every time he killed someone with the sword of truth he knew that that was what he was that was what the seeker did what the seeker was the bringer of death as the sky began flaming into pinks yellows and golds he noticed white patches in the distance ahead it wasnt snow the snow hadnt stuck besides these things moved sister verna didnt say anything about them she simply rode along the sun at their backs sent long shadows ahead of them for the first time richard realized they were traveling east when they were closer he recognized the white forms spread across their way turning pink in the last rays of the sun it was a small flock of sheep as they passed among them richard saw that the people tending the animals were bantak he recognized their manner of dress three bantak men approached to the side of richard ignoring sister verna they mumbled something he didnt understand but their words and faces seemed to hold a certain reverence the three dropped to their knees and bowed down stretching their arms out their hands on the ground toward him richard slowed his horse to a walk as he looked down at them they came back up on their knees chattering at him but he didnt understand the words richard lifted his hand in greeting it seemed to satisfy them the three broke into grins and bowed a few more times as he rode past they came to their feet and trotted next to his horse attempting to push things into his hands bread fruit strips of dried meat a drab dirty scarf necklaces made of teeth bone and beads even their shepherds crooks richard forced a smile and with signs he thought they would understand tried to decline the offers without offending the men one of the three was particularly insistent he take a melon offering it repeatedly richard didnt want trouble so he took the melon and bowed his head several times they seemed proud nodding and bowing as he rode on he gave them a last bow from his saddle as he rode past and slipped the melon into a saddlebag sister verna had her horse turned toward him waiting for him to catch up she scowled as she waited richard didnt hurry his horse along he simply let it go at its own pace what now he wondered when he finally reached her she leaned toward him why are they saying those things what things i dont understand their language she gritted her teeth they think you are a wizard why would they think that why richard shrugged i would guess its because thats what i told them what she pushed the hood of her cloak back you are not a wizard you have no right telling them you are you lied richard folded his wrists over the high pommel of the saddle youre right im not a wizard yes i told them a lie lying is a crime against the creator richard heaved a weary sigh i did not do it to play at being a wizard i did it to stop a war it was the only way i could keep a lot of people from dying it worked and no one was hurt i would do the same thing again if it would prevent killing lying is wrong the creator hates lies does this creator of yours like killing better sister verna looked like she was ready to spit fire at him he is everyones creator not just my creator and he hates lies richard calmly appraised her heated expression tell you that himself did he come right up and sit down next to you and say sister verna i want you to know i hate lies she ground her teeth and growled the words of course not it is written written in books ahh richard nodded well then of course it is the truth if it is written in books then it has to be true everyone knows that if something is written down and attributed then it must be true her eyes were fire you treat lightly the creators words he leaned toward her some of his own heat surfacing and you sister verna treat lightly the lives of people you consider heathens she paused and with an effort calmed herself a little richard you must learn that lying is wrong very wrong it is against the creator against what we teach you are as much a wizard as an infant is an old man calling yourself a wizard when you are not is a lie a filthy lie it is a desecration you are not a wizard sister verna i know very well that lying is wrong i am not in the habit of going around telling lies but in perspective i consider it preferable to people being killed it was the only way she took a deep breath and nodded causing the curls in her brown hair to spring up and down a little perhaps you are right so long as you know that lying is wrong dont make a habit of it you are no wizard richard stared at her as his grip tightened on the reins i know im not a wizard sister verna i know exactly what i am he gave his horses ribs a squeeze with his legs urging it ahead im the bringer of death her hand darted out and snatched a fistful of his shirtsleeve yanking him around in his saddle he snugged the reins back as he was pulled around to her wide eyes her voice was an urgent whisper what did you say what did you call yourself he gave her an even look im the bringer of death who named you that richard studied her ashen face i know what wearing this sword means i know what it is to draw it i know it better than any seeker before me has known it is part of me i am part of it i used its magic to kill the last person who put a collar around my neck i know what it makes me i lied to the bantak because i didnt want people to be killed but there is another reason the bantak are a peaceful people i did not want them to learn the horror of what it means to kill i know all too well that lesson you killed sister elizabeth perhaps you know too who named you bringer of death she pressed no one i named myself because that is what i do what i am i am the bringer of death she released her grip on his shirt i see as she began turning her horse around he called out her name in a commanding tone it brought her to a halt why why do you want to know who named me that why is it so important her anger seemed to have vanished and left a shadow of fear in its passing i told you i read all the prophecies at the palace there is a fragment of one that contains those words he is the bringer of death and he shall so name himself richard narrowed his eyes and what does the rest of the prophecy say did it also say that i will kill you and anyone else i have to to get this collar off she looked away from his glare prophecies are not for the eyes or ears of the untrained with a sharp kick she surprised her horse and sent it surging ahead as he followed behind richard decided to let the matter drop he didnt care about prophecies they were nothing more than riddles as far as he was concerned and he hated riddles if something was important enough to need saying why couch it in riddles riddles were stupid games and not important as he rode he wondered how many people he was going to have to kill to get the collar off one or a hundred it didnt matter his rage boiled at the thought of being led around by the radahan he gritted his teeth at the thought his jaw muscles flexed at the thought his fists tightened on the reins bringer of death he would kill as many as it took he would have the collar off or he would die trying the fury the need to kill surged through every fiber of his being with a start he realized he was calling forth the magic from the sword even as it sat in its scabbard he no longer had to hold the sword to do it he could feel its wrath tingling through him with an effort he put it down and calmed himself besides the rage of hate from the sword he also knew how to call forth its opposite side its white magic the sisters didnt know he could do that he hoped he would have no reason to teach them but if he had to he would he would have the collar off he would use either side of the swords magic or both to have the collar off his neck when the time came when the time came in the violet afterglow of twilight sister verna brought them to a halt for the night she had said nothing further to him he didnt know if she was still angry but he didnt really care richard walked the horses a short distance to a line of small willows at the bank of a creek and removed their bridles replacing them with halters his bay tossed her head glad to have the bit out of her mouth richard saw it was an aggressive spade bit few bits were more cruelly punishing people who used them it seemed to him were people who thought horses were nothing more than beasts humans had to conquer and control he thought maybe they should have to have a bit in their mouths to see how they liked it properly trained a horse needed nothing more than a jointed snaffle if it was properly trained and given a little understanding it didnt even need a bit he guessed some people preferred punishment to patience he reached up experimentally to stroke the horses blacktipped ear it lifted its head firmly away from his hand so he muttered they like to twitch your ear too he scratched and patted the horses neck i wont do that to you my friend the horse leaned against his scratching richard retrieved water in a canvas bucket and let each horse have only a few swallows as they werent cooled down in one of the saddlebags he found brushes and took his time carefully currying each of them and then picking their hooves clean he took longer than he needed to because he preferred their company to the sisters after he finished he cut a section of rind from the melon the bantak had given him and gave each horse a piece horses loved few things in life as much as a melon rind each showed eagerness for the treat it was the first eagerness any of them had shown after seeing the spade bits he knew why when he decided his chest hurt too much to stand around any longer he went over to where sister verna sat on a small blanket and put his own blanket on the ground opposite her he folded his legs as he sat and pulled a piece of the flat tava bread from his pack more for something to do than because he was hungry she accepted his offer of a piece he cut up the melon and put the remaining rind aside saving it for later richard offered sister verna a piece of melon she looked at it coolly as he held it out it was given under false pretenses it was given as thanks for preventing a war she took it at last but not eagerly perhaps ill take first watch if you wish he offered there is no need to stand watch he appraised her in the near darkness as he chewed a juicy piece of melon there are heart hounds in the midlands other things too i could draw another screeling i think a watch would be wise she pulled off a piece of tava bread without looking up you are safe with me there is no need for a watch her voice was flat it wasnt angry but it wasnt far from it either he ate in silence for a while and then decided to try to lighten the mood he tried to make his voice sound cheerful even though he felt no cheer im here youre here im wearing the radahan how about if you start teaching me to use the gift she looked up from under her eyebrows as she chewed there will be time enough to teach you when we reach the palace of the prophets the air felt as if it had suddenly cooled his anger heated the swords anger tugged at him to be released richard put it down as you wish sister verna lay down on her blanket pulling her cloak tightly around herself its cold build a fire he put the last bite of tava bread in his mouth and waited until he had swallowed before speaking softly her eyes watched him im surprised you dont know more about magic sister verna there is a word that is magic it can accomplish more than you might think maybe you have heard it before it is the word please he rose to his feet im not cold if you want a fire build it yourself im going to go stand watch i told you before i will take nothing on faith if we are killed in the night it wont be without warning on my watch he turned his back to her without waiting for a response he didnt want to hear anything she had to say walking off a good distance through the dry grass he found a mound of dirt around a groundhog hole and flopped down on top of it to watch to think the moon was up it stared down at him and cast a pale silver light upon the surrounding empty land enough light to enable him to see without any trouble he looked out over the deserted countryside brooding as much as he tried to think of other things it did no good he could think of only one thing kahlan he drew up his knees and wrapped his arms around them after he had wiped some tears from his face he wondered what she was doing where she was whether she would get zedd he wondered if she still cared for him enough to go get zedd the moon moved slowly across the sky as it stared down on him what was he going to do he felt lost he pictured kahlans face in his mind he would have conquered the world to see her smile at him to bask in the warmth of her love richard studied her face in his mind he pictured her green eyes her long hair her beautiful hair at that thought he remembered the lock of her hair she had put in his pocket he pulled it out and looked at it in the moonlight it was a circle she had pulled together and tied in the middle with the ribbon from her wedding dress so that it reminded him of a figure eight turned sideways as he held it in his fingers turned sideways like that it was also the symbol for infinity richard rolled the lock of hair between his finger and thumb watching it as it spun kahlan had given it to him to remember her by something to remember her by because he would never see her again racking grief choked his breathing he gripped the agiel as hard as he could until his fist shook with the effort the pain from the agiel and his heartache twisted together into burning agony he let it distort his perception until he could stand it no longer and then he let it go on longer yet let it go on until he collapsed to the base of the dirt mound barely conscious he gasped for air the pain had swept all the thoughts from his mind if only for a few minutes his mind had been free of the anguish he lay on the ground a long time recovering when he was finally able to sit up once more he found the lock of hair still in his hand he stared at it in the moonlight remembering what sister verna had said to him that he had told the bantak a lie a filthy lie those had been kahlans words she had said that his love for her was a filthy lie those words hurt more than the agiel its not a lie he whispered i would do anything for you kahlan but it wasnt good enough putting on the collar wasnt good enough he wasnt good enough son of a monster he knew what she wanted what she really wanted she wanted to be free of him she wanted him to put on the collar so he would be taken away so she would be free i would do anything for you kahlan he cried he stood up and looked out over the empty grassland the dark horizon wavered in a watery blur anything even this i set you free my love richard threw the lock of kahlans hair as far as he could out into the night he sank to his knees and fell facefirst to the ground sobbing he cried until he could cry no more he continued to lie on the cold ground groaning in agony until he realized he was gripping the agiel again he let it go and at last sat up flopping back in exhaustion against the dirt mound it was over finished he felt empty dead after a time he rose to his feet he stood a moment and then slowly drew the sword of truth its ring was a soft song in the cold air the anger came out with the steel and he let it fill the void in him rage freely through him he welcomed the anger into himself letting it fill him until he was submerged in its wrath his chest heaved with lethal need his eyes glided to where the sister lay sleeping he could see the dark hump of her body as he approached silently he was a woods guide he knew how to stalk silently he was good at it his eyes carefully watched the ground as he moved fluidly watched the sleeping form of sister verna as he closed the distance he didnt hurry there was no need to hurry he had as much time as he needed he tried to slow his breathing to keep from making noise he was nearly panting with allconsuming fury the thought of wearing a collar again fed the raging fire within him fueled the inferno rage from the swords magic seared through him like molten metal richard recognized the feeling all too well and gave himself over to it he was beyond reason beyond being stopped nothing short of blood would now satisfy the bringer of death his knuckles were white on the hilt his muscles knotted with restrained need aching to be set free but they wouldnt be restrained for long the magic of the sword of truth screamed to do his bidding richard stood a silent shadow over sister verna looking down at her the fury pounded in his head he drew the sword along the inside of his forearm wiping both sides in the blood giving the steel a taste of it the dark stain ran down the fuller dripping from the tip it ran wet and warm down his arm his chest heaved as he gripped the hilt in both hands again he felt the weight of the collar around his neck the blade rose glinting in the moonlight he watched the sleeping sister at his feet she was drawn up almost into a ball she was cold and she shivered as she slept he stood with the blade raised watching her as he gritted his teeth and shook with raging need kahlan didnt want him son of a monster no just monster he saw himself standing over the sleeping woman his sword in the air ready to kill he was the monster that was what kahlan saw and she had sent him away in a collar to be tortured because he was a monster that needed to be collared a beast tears ran down his face the sword slowly sank until the tip touched the ground he stood staring at the sister as she slept shivering with the cold he stood a long time watching richard finally slid the sword quietly back into its scabbard he retrieved his blanket and laid it over sister verna tucking it carefully around her being gentle so as not to wake her he sat and watched until she stopped shivering and then he lay down wrapping himself in his cloak he was exhausted and he hurt all over but he couldnt sleep he knew they were going to hurt him that was what the collar was for when she got him to the palace they were going to hurt him what difference did it make memories danced and darted through his mind memories of what denna had done to him he remembered the pain the helpless agony the blood his blood the visions went on and on as long as he lived he would never be able to forget them it had only just ended and now it was going to start all over again there would never be an end to it there was only one thought in all the turmoil of his mind that comforted him he had learned from sister verna that he was wrong about the keeper escaping that meant kahlan was safe she was safe and that was all that really mattered he tried to keep everything else away and think only of that that thought allowed him to drift at last into sleep chapter his eyes opened the sun was just breaking the horizon when he sat up the pain from his burn caught his breath short he put his hand over his shirt where the bandage was and held it there until that pain subsided the residual effects of the agiel left the rest of him feeling as if he had been beaten with a club he ached everywhere he remembered from the time when denna had trained him using the agiel feeling a lot worse when he awoke only to have her start using the agiel on him all over again sister verna was sitting on her blanket her legs folded beneath her watching him as she chewed something she had her cloak around her shoulders with the hood down her curly brown hair looked freshly brushed she had neatly folded richards blanket and placed it back next to where he slept she said nothing about it richard pushed himself to his feet taking a moment to steady himself and stretch his hurting cramped muscles the sky was a clear cold deep blue the grass smelled sweet and damp with dew the vapor of his breath drifted lazily in the still crisp air ill go saddle the horses and we can be on our way dont you want something to eat he shook his head im not hungry what happened to your arm she asked without looking up there was dark dried blood all down his arm and hand i was polishing my sword it was dark i cut myself its nothing i see she glanced up as he scratched the stubble on his face i hope you are more careful when you shave your neck richard decided in that instant that as long as he was held captive in a collar he would not shave it would be his way of proclaiming to them that a collar was unjust that he knew he was nothing more than their prisoner and that he would not believe their spurious protestations to the contrary there could be no justification for a collar and there would be no compromising of that basic truth none not ever richard glowered at the sister prisoners dont shave he turned toward the horses richard he looked over his shoulder sit down her voice was gentle but he glared at the order nonetheless she gestured to a place in front of her sit down i was thinking about what you said you are here i am here sit down and i will begin teaching you how to control the gift he was caught offguard now here yes come and sit he didnt really care about using the gift he hated magic he had only asked about it before because he had been trying to ease the tension his eyes darted about before he finally sat and folded his legs imitating the way she was sitting what do you want me to do there is much to teach you about using the gift you will learn about balance in all things especially magic you must heed all our warnings and follow what we tell you there are dangers to using magic perhaps you already know this from using the sword of truth yes richard didnt move she went on there is greater danger in using the gift it can have unanticipated results results that can be disastrous i have already used the gift you said i used it in three specific ways she leaned forward a little and look what happened it brought an unanticipated result it resulted in you having that collar around your neck surprised richard stared at her that wasnt a result of my using the gift you were already looking for me you said so if i hadnt used the gift the result would have been the same sister verna slowly shook her head her eyes stayed on his we had been looking for you for years something hid you from us if you hadnt used the gift in the ways you did i doubt we ever would have found you using the gift put that collar around your neck years they had been searching for him for years all that time he had lived peaceably in westland first with his brother and father and zedd and then on his own as a woods guide they had been looking for him and he never knew it the thought gave him a chill he brought it on himself by using magic he hated magic although i would agree that that is disastrous for me how could you its what you want it is what we had to do but you have threatened my life you have threatened the lives of anyone else who keeps that collar around your neck that would be all the sisters of the light i never take the warnings of wizards even untrained wizards lightly your use of the gift allowing us to find you could end up being a disaster for all of us he felt no satisfaction that his threats had not gone unnoticed he felt nothing then why are you doing this he whispered making me wear it to help you you would have died otherwise you have already helped me the headaches are gone you have my thanks why cant you let me go now if the collar is removed too soon before you learn enough of controlling the gift they will come back you will die then teach me so i can get it off we must be cautious in teaching magic you must have patience in your studies we are careful in our training because we know more of the dangers of magic than you and we dont want you to be hurt through ignorance but that is not a problem for now because it will take time before you are advanced enough to really use the gift and risk these dangers as long as you adhere to what we say you can have patience yes i have no desire to use magic i guess that could be construed as patience good enough for now we will begin then she squirmed a little rearranging her legs there is a force within us all it is the force of life we call it han richard frowned lift your arm he did as she asked that is the force of life given us by the creator it is encased within you you have just used han those with the gift can extend that force outside themselves such an external force is called a web those with the gift like you have the ability to cast a web with the web you can do things outside your body much as the life force can do within your body how can that be sister verna picked up a small stone in her fingers here my mind is using han to make my hand lift the stone my hand is not doing it of its own accord but rather my mind is directing the life force to use my hand to accomplish what my mind wishes done she set the stone back on the ground and folded her hands in her lap the stone floated into the air and hung between them i have just accomplished the same thing only this time i did it by projecting the life force outside of my body that is the gift you can do what a wizard can no only some of it that is how we are able to teach its use we understand the feel of it the sisters have some control of the life force and the gift but nothing like a wizard who knows how to control his han how do you get this life force to go outside your body that cant begin to be explained until you learn to recognize the force within yourself learn to touch the han why because every person is different every person uses the force differently it isnt used the same in any two people love is a form of han being projected outside ones self into another it is though a very mild weak form even though love is universal it is used and felt differently by all some use it to bring out the best of the han in another some use it to bring out the best in themselves some use it to control to dominate another it can heal or wound once we understand how the gift works within you how you use it we can guide you through exercises called forms the forms are a method of practice that will help you learn to control the power once it is free of your body but for now that is not important first you must learn to feel the han within yourself before you can project it anywhere outside your body after you are able to touch the han then we must discover what it is you can do with it every wizard is different and uses han differently some can use it only through the use of mind like wizards who study the prophecies the use of their han to understand prophecies is the major way the gift manifests itself with them it is their unique talent some can only use their han to create beautiful inspiring objects some use their han to create things invested with magic it is their unique talent how they are able to express han some are able to use their thoughts to influence the world about them as i showed you when i lifted the rock some can do other things with han some are able to do a little of everything her frown returned the truth is of the utmost importance in this richard you must be completely truthful in telling us how the han feels within you lying will cause grave difficulty she relaxed a bit but first you must be able to call upon your han before we can discover what sort of wizard you are i told you i dont want to be a wizard i just want to learn to control the gift so i can stop the headaches and get this collar off my neck you said i didnt have to be a wizard controlling han with the gift is what it means to be a wizard when you learn to control it you will be a wizard that is the very essence of a wizard but wizard is only a word you should not fear a word if you choose not to use the gift that is your business we cant force you but a wizard you will be teach me what i need to know but ill not be a wizard it is not something evil richard it is just learning to know yourself what you are capable of what your talents are richard sighed tine so how do i control it teaching control of the gift is a process taken in steps i cannot explain it to you all at once because you would be unable to understand steps further along each step must be mastered before you can move on to the next before we can show you how to project the han outside yourself you must first recognize it and then be able to touch it join with it within yourself you must know what it is you must be able to feel it you must be able to reach for it touch it at will you understand what i am saying yes richard nodded a little i guess so what is it how will i know it what is it like to know it to touch it sister vernas eyes became distant seeming to go out of focus you will know it she whispered it is like seeing the light given off by the creator it is almost like joining with him richard watched her glazed expression she seemed enthralled by what she was seeing within herself so how do i find it he asked at last her eyes focused on him you must search for it within yourself how you simply sit and search within you put all other thoughts aside and seek the quiet the calm within yourself at first it is helpful if you close your eyes breathe slowly evenly and let yourself find the peace of nothingness in the beginning it helps to focus on a single thing in order to exclude all distracting thoughts a single thing like what she shrugged whatever you wish it is only a device to help you reach the end not the end in itself everyone is different some use a single word repeating it over and over to the exclusion of all else some use a mental picture of a simple object using it to bring their mind into focus eventually after you learn to recognize the power to touch it and become one with it you wont need to focus on a device first you will know the nature of han and be able to reach directly for it it will become second nature to you i know it sounds strange and difficult to you now richard but in time you will find it as easy as it is for you to call forth the magic of your sword richard had the uneasy feeling that he already knew what she was talking about he could almost understand what she was saying the words seemed strange but they described something that was somehow familiar yet different so you just wish me to sit and close my eyes and seek the quiet within she nodded yes sister verna pulled her heavy brown cloak tighter around her shoulders you may begin richard let out a breath all right he closed his eyes it seemed his thoughts were scattering in all directions at once he tried to herd them away he tried to think of a word or a picture to focus on he thought of kahlans name before anything else he let it flow like liquid through his mind kahlan he rejected the idea he hated his magic and didnt want to associate her with anything he hated besides the thought of her only brought pain the pain of loving her enough to give her what she wanted of having set her free he thought of simple words simple objects but none held any interest for him he calmed his mind and relaxed his breathing he sought peace within himself a calm center the way he had always done when he needed to think of a solution to a problem in the quiet he tried to think of an image he could use it popped into his mind almost of its own accord the sword of truth it was already magic and therefore he wouldnt be tainting it it was a simple image it seemed to fit the requirements it was settled it would be the sword of truth richard pictured it floating by itself on a field of black he studied the details he knew so well the polished blade with the fuller down its length the aggressive downswept crossguards the hilt covered in fine twisted silver wire with twisted gold wire woven through it forming the raised letters of the word truth as he pictured it fixing it in his mind floating on a black background something fought him it was the background not the sword around the edge of the black was white forming the black into a square richard remembered it from before it was one of the instructions in the book of counted shadows the book he had memorized when he was a boy clear your mind of all thought and in its place put nothing but the image of white with a square of black in its center it was part of the instructions for removing the covers from the boxes of orden and using the magic of the book he had used that magic to show darken rahl how to remove the cover from a box to prove to him he truly did know the book but why would it be in his mind now just a random memory forcing its way to the surface he decided it was as good a background as any to put the sword on after all he was trying to use magic if his mind wanted to use it it made no difference to him he would let it be at that thought the image of the sword and a square black background with white around it solidified and became still richard concentrated on the mental image of the sword against the black square with the white border he concentrated as hard as he could something began to happen the sword the black square and the white border all began to shimmer as if seen through heat waves the solid form of the sword softened it became transparent and then it was gone the background dissolved he was looking into a place he knew the garden of life at the peoples palace richard thought it odd and somewhat annoying that he wasnt able to hold his concentration enough to keep the image of the sword in his mind the memory of the place where he killed darken rahl must have been so strong that it forced its way into his mind while he was relaxed he was about to try to force the image of the sword to come back when he smelled something burned flesh the stench made his nostrils flare he almost gagged his stomach turned sickeningly he searched the image of the garden of life it was like looking through a dirty windowpane there were bodies lying over the short walls fallen partly hidden in bushes and sprawled on the grass all were hideously burned some held weapons swords or battleaxes in charred fists others lay with open hands their weapons resting where they had tumbled as their owners fell dead choking apprehension swelled in richards chest richard saw the back of a white glowing figure standing before the stone altar before the three boxes of orden one of the boxes stood open as richard remembered the white figure with long blond hair lifted his face away from the boxes darken rahl turned and looked right into richards eyes his blue eyes glowed a smile spread slowly on his lips it seemed as if richard was helplessly pulled closer closer to the grinning face darken rahl lifted a hand to his mouth and licked the tips of his fingers richard he hissed im waiting for you come watch while i tear the veil unable to draw a breath richard slammed the image of the sword back into his mind like slamming a door he held it there rigidly without the background as he tried to make himself breathe it was just a stray memory and his fear making him see the image he told himself he concentrated on the sword as he finally decided that what he had seen wasnt real but maybe a manifestation of his heartache over kahlan and his lack of sleep thats what it had to be it couldnt have been real that would be impossible he would have to be insane to believe it had been real he opened his eyes sister verna was sitting calmly watching him she gave a heavy sigh he thought maybe out of displeasure richard swallowed im sorry nothing happened dont be discouraged richard i did not expect anything to happen it takes a long time to learn to touch the han it will happen when it happens there is no way to rush it it does no good to push too hard it comes from finding the inner peace and not by force that is long enough for today a few minutes thats all you want me to try she lifted an eyebrow you have had your eyes closed for over an hour he stared at her and then glanced to the sun it seemed to have jumped up into the sky over an hour how was that possible a tingle of apprehension spread through him she cocked her head it seemed only a few minutes to you richard stood he didnt like the frown on her face i dont know i wasnt paying any attention i guess it did feel like an hour he started packing the few things he had taken out the more he thought about what he had seen the more unreal it seemed it began to feel like a dream after waking the fear the hard edges the reality fading he began to feel foolish for being so frightened by a dream a dream he hadnt been sleeping how could he have been dreaming when he was awake maybe he hadnt been awake he had been dead tired maybe while he was sitting there concentrating on the sword he had fallen asleep thats how he went to sleep sometimes by concentrating on something until he drifted off that was the only explanation for the time going so fast he was asleep and the rest of it had been a dream he let out a heavy breath he felt silly for having been so frightened but he felt relieved too when he turned sister verna was still watching him do you wish to shave now now that i have shown you i only wish to help you richard straightened i told you prisoners dont shave you are not a prisoner richard he stuffed his blanket into his pack tucking in the corners to make it fit will you remove the collar her answer was slow in coming but firm no only when it is time may i leave and go where i wish she sighed impatiently no you must go with me and if i dont if i try to leave you her eyes narrowed a little then i would be forced to prevent it you would find you did not like that richard nodded solemnly that fits my definition of a prisoner as long as im a prisoner i will not shave the horses nickered at his approach their ears pricking toward him sister verna eyed them suspiciously he returned the greeting with gentle words and a stiff scratch to the side of each horses neck taking out the brushes he gave each a quick grooming paying particular attention to their backs sister verna folded her arms why are you doing that you groomed them last night because horses like to roll in the dirt they could have something under where the saddle goes feels kind of like walking around with a rock in your boot only worse it could give them a sore and then we wont be able to ride them so i like to check them over before i put their saddles on when he finished he cleaned the brushes against each other what are their names sister verna gave a sour frown they dont have names they are just horses we dont give names to dumb animals he pointed with the curry brush at the chestnut gelding you dont even give your own a name he is not my own they all belong to the sisters of the light i ride whichever one is available the bay you rode yesterday is the one i rode before you came with me but it makes no difference i simply ride whichever one is available well from now on theyre going to have names avoids confusion yours is the chestnut and he will be jessup my bay will be bonnie and the other bay will be geraldme jessup bonnie and geraldine she huffed no doubt from the adventures of bonnie day glad to hear you read something other than prophecies sister verna as i told you before ones with the gift who come to the palace are brought when they are young one boy brought the adventures of bonnie day with him i read it to see if it was appropriate for young minds and to see if it was of good moral teachings i found it to be a preposterous story of three people who would have had no troubles if a one of them had been blessed with brains richard smiled a little perfect names for dumb animals then she scowled at him it was a book of no intellectual value no value of any kind i destroyed it richards smile tried to fade but he didnt let it my father well the man who raised me as his son and who i think of as my father george cypher well he traveled often one time when he came home he brought me the adventures of bonnie day as a gift for learning to read it was the first book i ever had i read it many times it brought me pleasure and made me think each time i read it i too thought the three heroes did foolhardy things and i always vowed not to repeat the same mistakes they made you may have seen no value in it but it taught me things things of value it made me think perhaps sister verna that is something you dont like your students to do he turned away from her and started taking apart the bridles my real father darken rahl came to my house just this autumn looking for me he wanted to cut my belly open and read my entrails to kill me just as he killed george cypher he stole a quick glance over his shoulder anyway i wasnt at home and while he was waiting for me he tore that book apart and threw the pages all around maybe he didnt want me learning any of its lessons or thinking for myself either sister verna didnt say anything but he could feel her eyes watching him take the bridles apart undo the headstalls and reins from the bits after he had them apart he packed the headstalls away and flipped the reins over his shoulder he could hear her let out a little angry breath ill not be calling horses by names richard stacked the three spade bits atop one another on the dirt where the horses had pawed the ground bare you might want to reconsider the wisdom of that sister verna she stepped out to the side of him where he could see her pointing at the ground what are you doing why did you take the bridles apart what are you doing with those bits richard drew the sword its distinctive ring filled the cold bright air the rage of the magic instantly flooded through him im destroying them sister with a scream of fury and before she could make a move he brought the sword down with a powerful swing the tip whistled through the air the blade shattered the three bits into flying shards of hot metal she rushed forward her cloak flapping whats the matter with you have you lost your mind we need those bits to control the horses spade bits can be cruel i wont allow you to use them cruel they are just stupid beasts beasts that need to be controlled beasts he muttered shaking his head and sliding his sword back into its scabbard he snugged up the halter on bonnie and began attaching the reins to the side rings you dont need a bit to control a horse ill teach you how besides without a bit in their mouths they can eat while we travel theyll be happier that way thats dangerous spade bits give you control over a headstrong beast he arched an eyebrow to her with horses as with many other things sister you often get what you expect to get without bits you dont have any control nonsense if you ride properly you control with your legs and body you just have to teach the horse to pay attention and trust you she stepped close commanding his attention thats foolish and dangerous there are dangers out here if you get into a dangerous situation and the horse is frightened it could bolt without a spade bit you wont be able to stop a runaway horse he halted what he was doing and looked to her intense brown eyes sometimes sister we get the opposite of what we intend if we do get in a dangerous situation and you get overanxious and jerk too hard on a spade bit you could tear the horses mouth if you do that the pain terror and anger can be so intense that he wont respond to anything you do he wont understand he will only know that you hurt him and that youre hurting him more with each pull on the reins youll be the threat he will throw you in a heartbeat then if he is simply frightened he will bolt worse he could be angry angry horses are dangerous in trying to avoid danger with a spade bit you will have brought it upon yourself he held her startled eyes in his gaze if we get to a town or something and can find a jointed snaffle bit ill let you use that but i will not allow you to put a spade bit in any horses mouth as long as im with you she took a deep breath releasing it carefully as she folded her arms again richard we cant control them without a bit its that simple he gave her a onesided smile sure we can ill teach you the worst thing that can happen without a bit is that he can run away with you and youll have a time of stopping him but sooner or later you will be able to your way you and the horse could be hurt or killed he turned and scratched bonnies neck first thing you have to do is make friends with them they have to trust you not to hurt them or let anything happen to them though you are in charge if youre their best friend they wont let anything happen to you theyll do what you ask its surprisingly easy all you have to do is show them a little respect and kindness along with a firm hand if theyre going to be your friend they need names to get their attention and so they know when youre talking to them he scratched a little harder the horse leaning into it isnt that right bonnie youre a good girl arent you sure you are he looked over his shoulder at the sister jessup likes it when you scratch under his chin give it a try show him you want to be friends he gave her a humorless grin like it or not sister we dont have the bits anymore you need to learn a new way sister verna stared at him with a cold look at last she unfolded her arms and went over to the chestnut gelding she stood in front of him a moment and then reached out and stroked the side of his head finally moving her hand under his jaw to give him a scratch theres a good boy she said in a flat tone you may think horses are dumb sister verna because they dont understand most of your words but they understand tone of voice if you want him to believe you you had better at least pretend youre sincere she moved her hand up and rubbed his neck you are a dumb beast she said in a syrupy sweet voice happy she snapped over her shoulder as long as youre nice to him you need to gain his trust horses arent as dumb as you think look at the way hes standing he doesnt trust you from now on im assigning you to jessup youll tend to all his needs he must come to depend on you to trust you ill take care of bonnie and geraldine youll be the only one to groom jessup and you will do it after he is ridden and before he is ridden the next morning me most certainly not im in charge you are quite capable of grooming all three and will do so this has nothing to do with whos in charge among other things grooming helps build a bond between you and the horse i already told you the bits are gone you need to learn a new way i need to teach you how for your own safety he handed her a set of reins tighten up the halter and attach these to this ring here while she was doing it he cut up the leftover melon rind into small pieces talk to him call him by name and let him know you like him it doesnt matter what you say you can describe what youre doing if you want but make it sound like hes important to you if you have to pretend treat him like hes one of your little boys she glared over her shoulder at him then turned back to hooking up the reins she started talking softly so richard couldnt hear her but he could tell it was gentle when she finished he handed her some of the pieces of melon rind horses love this give him a piece tell him what a good boy he is the idea is to change his feelings about having the reins on let him know its going to be pleasant instead of that bit he hates pleasant she repeated in a flat tone sure you dont need to show him how much you can hurt him to make him do as you wish thats counterproductive just be firm but gentle the idea is to try to win him over with kindness and understanding even if it isnt sincere and not by using force richards smile vanished and he let his features slide into a glare he leaned closer to her as she stood looking up at him you should be able to do that sister verna you seem pretty good at it just treat him like you treat me her stunned expression hardened i swore on my life to bring you back to the palace of the prophets when they see you at last i fear i may be hung for doing my duty she turned and gave the melon rind to the eager horse stroking his neck and encouraging him with motherly pats theres a good fellow good boy you like that jessup good boy her voice was heavy with compassion and tenderness the horse liked it richard knew it lacked sincerity he didnt trust her and wanted her to know it he didnt appreciate people thinking they were so easily fooling him he wondered if her attitude toward him would change now that he had let her know he hadnt swallowed her act kahlan had told him that sister verna was a sorceress he had no idea what she was capable of but he had felt the web she had thrown around him in the spirit house he had seen the fire she started with a thought she could have easily started a fire the night before without telling him to do it he had the strong feeling she could break him in half with her han if she so chose she was just trying to train him get him accustomed to doing as she said without thinking just like training a horse or a beast as she had called it he doubted she had any more respect for him than she did for her horses but instead of using a spade bit to control him she had the radahan around his neck and that was much worse but he would have it off when the time came even if kahlan didnt want him and had sent him away he would have it off while sister verna was making friends with jessup richard started saddling the horses how far to the palace of the prophets it is a long way to the southeast a long and difficult way well then we will have plenty of time to teach you how to handle jessup without a bit you wont have as hard a time as you think he will defer to and follow bonnie bonnie is the dominant horse the male is dominant richard lifted the saddle up onto bonnie a mare is always at the top of the hierarchy dams teach and protect the foals their influence lasts a lifetime there isnt a stallion a mare cant intimidate and chase away mares can run off any unwanted stallion a stallion may drive a predator away from the herd but a mare will chase it and try to kill it a male horse will always defer to the authority of the lead mare bonnie is the lead mare jessup and geraldine will follow her and do as she does so ill take the lead just follow me and you wont have any trouble she swung herself up into the saddle the beam in the central hall its the highest everyone will be able to see it what are you talking about she gave him a solemn look the beam in the central hall that is where they will probably hang me from richard swung up into his saddle its your choice sister you dont have to take me there she sighed yes i do she gave him her most gentle and concerned look he thought it quite convincing if a little strained richard i only wish to help you i want to be your friend i think you need a friend right now very much richard bristled that is a kind offer sister verna but i decline you seem a little too quick to put that knife you keep up your sleeve in the back of your friends did it bother you at all sister verna to steal the life from sister elizabeth a friend and companion it didnt seem so i decline to offer you my friendship sister or my back if youre sincere in your wish to be my friend then i would advise you to truly commit to it before i call upon you to prove it when the time comes you are only going to get one chance there are no shades of gray in this matter only friends and enemies friends dont keep a friend in a collar and hold them prisoner i intend to have this collar off when i decide its time any friend will help me those who try to stop me wont be my friends they will be dead enemies sister verna shook her head and urged jessup in behind him as he started away the beam in the central hall im sure of it chapter the sound of her heart pounded in her ears struggling to control her panicked breathing she ducked behind the fat trunk of an old pine pressing up against the rough bark if the sisters had discovered she was following them the dark damp air filled her lungs in ragged pulls her lips moved soundlessly with prayers to the creator beseeching protection with eyes as big as gold pieces she stared into the darkness and swallowed trying to wet her throat the dark form glided silently closer she could just see it as she peeked out past the edge of the tree she suppressed the urge to scream to run and prepared herself to fight she reached for the sweet light she embraced her han the shadow slipped closer hesitating searching one more step just one more and she would spring she would have to do it right make sure there was no chance to raise an alarm it had to be fast and it would take different kinds of webs all thrown at once but if she could be precise and quick there would be no chance of a scream no alarm and she would know for sure who it was she held her breath the dark shape finally took another step spinning out from behind the tree she threw the webs cords of air strong as dock line whipped around the form as the mouth came open she jammed a solid knot of air into it gagging it before it had a chance to cry out she slumped a little with relief when no sound came forth but her heart still raced nearly out of control as she gasped for air with an effort she managed to bring calm back to her mind although she maintained a firm grip on her han fearful to let her caution slip there could be others about she took a deep breath and stepped closer to the immobilized shape when she was close enough to feel its breath on her face she extended her palm up and in its center released a thread of fire to light a tiny flame just enough to see the face jedidiah she whispered she pressed her hand to the back of his neck her fingers feeling the smooth cool metal of the radahan and leaned her forehead against his as she closed her eyes tears ran down her cheeks oh jedidiah you gave me a such a fright she opened her eyes and looked up at his terrified face lit by the tiny flickering flame i will release you she whispered softly but you must be very quiet promise he nodded as best he could considering how tightly she had him bound she slipped off the webs pulling out the gag of air jedidiah sagged with relief sister margaret he whispered in a shaky voice you very nearly made me soil myself she laughed soundlessly im sorry jedidiah but you very nearly did the same to me she snipped the thin thread of han fueling the small flame and they both sank to the ground leaning against one another recovering from the fright jedidiah several years younger was bigger than she a handsome young man painfully handsome she thought she had been assigned to him when he had first come to the palace and she had been a novice he had been eager to learn and had studied hard he had been a pleasure from the first day she knew others had been difficult but not jedidiah he had done everything she had asked of him she had only to ask and he threw himself into it others thought he was more eager to please her than to please himself in what he did but none could deny that he was a better student than any other and was becoming a better wizard and that was all that mattered this was one area where the results were what counted not the method and she had quickly earned her full sisterhood for the way she had brought him along jedidiah had been more proud of her than she had been of herself when she had been named a sister of the light she was proud of him too he was probably the most powerful wizard the palace had seen in a thousand years margaret he whispered what are you doing out here sister margaret she corrected no one is around he kissed her ear stop that she scolded the tingle from the kiss ran all the way down her spine he had added a wisp of magic to the kiss sometimes she wished she hadnt taught him that but other times she ached to have him do it jedidiah what are you doing here you have no business following me following a sister out of the palace youre up to something i know you are and dont you try to tell me youre not something dangerous at first i was only a little concerned but when i realized you were headed out into the hagen woods i became frightened for you im not going to let you go wandering into a dangerous place like this not by yourself anyway not without going along to protect you protect me she whispered harshly might i remind you of what just happened you were helpless in a heartbeat you werent able to fight off even a single one of my webs you werent able to break one of them you are hardly able to touch your han much less use it effectively you have a lot to learn before you are wizard enough to go around protecting anyone its all you can do at this point to keep from stepping on your own feet the rebuke silenced him she didnt like to reprimand him so harshly but this was far too dangerous for him to be involved in if what she suspected was true she feared for him and didnt want him hurt the things she had said werent entirely true either he was already more powerful than any sister when he could bring everything together properly even though that wasnt often already there were sisters who were afraid to push him too far she could feel him look away im sorry margaret he whispered i was afraid for you her heart ached at the hurt in his voice she kept her head close to his so they could speak in soft whispers i know you are jedidiah and i appreciate your concern i really do but this is sister business margaret the hagen woods are a dangerous place there are things in here that could kill you i dont want you in here the hagen woods were indeed dangerous they had been for thousands of years and had been left that way by decree of the palace as if they could do anything about it it was said the hagen woods were a training ground for a very special kind of wizard that kind of wizard was not sent there but went in by choice because he wanted to craved to needed to but that was only what was said she knew of no wizard going off to spend time in the hagen woods at least not for the last few thousand years if it was true any ever did the tales said that in ancient times there were wizards of that kind with that much power and that they went into the hagen woods few ever came out it was also said but there were rules even to this place the sun didnt set while i was here i came after dark if you dont let the sun set on you in the hagen woods you can leave and i dont intend to stay long enough for the next sun to set on me its safe enough for me anyway i want you to go home right now whats so important that you would go in here what are you doing i expect an answer margaret a truthful answer i wont be put off there is danger for you in this and i wont be put off she fingered the finely worked gold flower she kept on a chain around her neck jedidiah had made it for her himself not with magic but with his own hands it was a morning glory meant to represent his awakening awareness of the gift an awareness she had helped to blossom that little gold flower meant more to her than anything else she had she took up his hand and leaned against him all right jedidiah i will tell you but i cant tell you all of it its too dangerous for you to know everything whats too dangerous what cant you tell me be quiet and listen or i will send you back right now and you know i can do it his other hand went to the collar margaret you wouldnt do that tell me you wouldnt do that not since we have been hush he fell silent she waited a moment to be certain he was going to stay hushed before she went on i have suspected for a time that some of the ones with the gift who have gone away or died have not done so as it has been put to us i think they have been murdered what keep your voice down she whispered angrily do you want to get us killed too he fell silent once more i think something awful is going on in the palace of the prophets i think some of the sisters murdered them he stared at her in the darkness murdered by sisters margaret you must be crazy to even suggest such a thing well im not but everyone would think i was if i were to say such a thing aloud inside the palace walls i have to figure out a way to prove it he thought a moment well i know you better than anyone and if you say its true then i believe you ill help maybe we could dig up the bodies find something to go against what was said about their deaths find somebody who saw something we could carefully question the staff there are ones i know who jedidiah thats not the worst of it what could be worse she held the gold flower in the crook of a finger and rubbed her thumb against it her voice came even lower than before there are sisters of the dark in the palace even without being able to see him in the darkness she knew bumps were running up his arms the night bugs chirped around them as she watched the dark shape of his face margaret sisters of the that cant be there is no such thing that is only a myth a fable it is no myth there are sisters of the dark in the palace margaret please dont keep saying that you could be put to death for making an accusation like that if you accuse a sister of that and cant prove it you would be put to death and you cant prove it because it isnt possible there is no such thing as a sister of the he couldnt even say the words the thought of it frightened him so much he couldnt even say it out loud she knew his fear she had felt it herself until she had happened on things she could no longer ignore she wished she hadnt gone to see the prophet that night or at least not listened to him the prelate had been angry that margaret wouldnt give the prophets message to one of her aides when she had finally granted an audience the prelate had only stared blankly at her and asked what the pebble in the pond was margaret didnt know the prelate had lectured her sternly for bothering her with nathans nonsense margaret had been furious at nathan when he had denied remembering giving any such message for the prelate i wish it were as you say but it is not theyre real they are among us they are in the palace she watched the dark shadow of him a moment thats why im out here to get the proof how are you going to do that theyre out here i followed them they come out into the hagen woods to do something im going to find out what his head turned about searching the darkness who which sisters do you know which ones i know some of them anyway which ones are they jedidiah i cant tell you if you knew and you made even the slightest mistake you would not be able to defend yourself if im right and they really are sisters of the dark they would kill you for knowing i cant bear the thought of you being hurt i wont tell you until i go to the prelates office with the proof how do you know they are sisters of the and what proof have you what proof could you get she searched the darkness for any sign of danger one of the sisters has something a thing of magic a thing of dark magic i saw it in her office its a little statue i noticed it one time because she has a number of things old things everyone thinks are just ancient curiosities i had seen it before and like all the rest of the things it was covered with dust but this one time after one of the boys died i went to her office to talk to her about it about her report that little statue was tucked back in a corner with a book leaning against it hiding it and it wasnt covered with dust it was clean thats it this sister dusted a statue and you think no no one knows what that statue is after i saw she had dusted it i had reason to question what it was i had to be careful not let anyone know what i was up to but i finally found out what it is how how did you find out she remembered her visit to nathan and her vow never to reveal how she had learned what that statue was never you mind that is not for you to know margaret how could you she cut him off i said im not telling you and it isnt important anyway what is important is what the statue is not how i found out about it its a man holding up a crystal the crystal is quillion whats quillion its an exceedingly rare magic crystal it has the power to bleed the magic from a wizard the surprise of that left him speechless for a moment how do you know its quillion if its so rare how would you be able to recognize it maybe it is just some other crystal that looks similar that might be true if it hadnt been used when quillion is used to bleed the magic from a wizard it glows orange with the power of his gift his han for just a brief second as i left her office i saw that statue all clean hiding behind that book the quillion was glowing orange but that was before i knew what it was after i found out i went back to take it to the prelate as proof but it no longer was glowing what could that mean he whispered in a fearful voice it means that the wizards power had passed out of the crystal into somebody a host quillion is just a vessel for the gift until it can be placed into someone else jedidiah i think the sisters are killing those with the gift and stealing it for themselves i think they are absorbing the power into themselves his voice trembled on top of what they already are they now have the power of a wizards gift she nodded yes that makes them more dangerous than we could even believe more powerful than we can imagine thats what scares me the most not being put to death for making the accusation but being found out by these sisters if they really are taking the power into themselves i dont know how we can stop them none of us can match them i need proof so the prelate will believe me maybe she will know what to do i certainly dont what i cant understand is how the sisters are absorbing the gift from the quillion the gift of a wizard his han is male the sisters are female a female cant just absorb the male han its not that simple otherwise they would simply have bled the han into themselves when they killed him if they are really taking the han from the males into themselves i dont know how theyre doing it so what are you doing out here she folded her arms against an inner chill even though the air was warm do you remember the other day when sam weber and neville ranson had completed all the tests and were to have their collars off and leave the palace he nodded in the dark yes i was really disappointed because sam had promised to come say goodbye and show me he had his radahan off i wanted to wish him well after he was a true wizard he never came they told me he left in the night because he didnt want any tearful goodbyes but sam was my friend he was a gentle person a healer and it just wasnt like him to leave in that fashion without telling me goodbye it just wasnt i was hurt he didnt come by i really wanted to wish him well they killed him what he sagged down a little oh dear creator no his voice broke with tears are you sure how do you know she put a comforting hand on his shoulder the day after he supposedly left in such a strange manner i suspected something terrible had happened i went to see if the quillion was glowing again but the door was shielded that doesnt prove anything sisters shield their rooms or offices sometimes you do it yourself when you dont want to be disturbed like when we are together i know but i wanted to see the quillion so i waited around a corner until the sister came to her office i came out from where i waited timing it so that as i walked past she would be entering as i went by and just before she closed the door behind herself i saw into her dark office i saw the statue on the shelf behind the book it was glowing orange im sorry jedidiah his voice lowered with anger who was it which sister im not going to tell you jedidiah not until i can take proof to the prelate its too dangerous he thought a moment if this crystal really is quillion and it would prove what she is why wouldnt she hide it better maybe because she didnt think there was a chance of anyone knowing what it was maybe because she isnt afraid and doesnt take the time to be any more careful than she thinks necessary then lets go back break the shield get the cursed thing and take it to the prelate i can break the shield i know i can i was going to do that myself i went back to do it tonight but the room wasnt shielded anymore i snuck in to take the statue but it was gone that was when i saw her leaving the palace and i saw others leaving too i followed them out here if i can steal the quillion while its glowing i can prove they are sisters of the dark i have to stop them before they can suck the life out of anyone else jedidiah theyre murdering people but worse i fear the reason they are doing it he let out a soft sigh all right but im going with you she gritted her teeth no you are going back margaret i love you and if you send me back to worry all alone i will never forgive you ill go to the prelate myself and make the accusation to bring you help though i may be put to death for making the accusation i know it would raise suspicions and maybe an alarm thats the only other way ill be able to protect you either i go with you or i go to the prelate i promise you i will she knew he was telling the truth jedidiah always kept his promises powerful wizards always did rising to her knees she leaned over and put her arms around his neck i love you too jedidiah she kissed him deeply as he rose up on his knees to meet her his hands went under the back of her dress and he gripped her bottom pulling her against him the feeling of his hands on her flesh made her moan softly his hot lips kissed her neck and then her ear sending shimmers of magic tingling through her his knee forced her legs apart giving his hands access to her she gasped at the contact come away with me now he whispered in her ear lets go back and you can shield your room and ill give you more until you scream you can scream all you want and no one will hear you she pushed away from him and pulled his hands out from under her dress he was breaking down her resistance she found she had to force herself to stop him he was using his magic to seduce her away from the danger trying to save her by drawing her away she knew that if she let it go on for another second it would work jedidiah she panted in a hoarse whisper please dont make me have to use the collar to stop you this is too important lives are at stake he tried to reach out to her once more but she sent a cord of power through her hands on his wrists to stop him she firmly held his hands away i know margaret your life is one of them i dont want anything to harm you i love you more than anything in the world jedidiah this is more important than my life this is about the lives of everyone i think this is about the nameless one he froze stiff you cant be serious why do you think these sisters want this power what do they need with it why would they be willing to kill for it to what end who do you think sisters of the dark serve dear creator he whispered slowly dont let her be right his hands came up and held her by her shoulders margaret who else knows these things who have you told only you jedidiah i know who four maybe five of the sisters of the dark are but there are others and i dont know who they are i dont know who i can trust there were eleven i followed out here tonight but there could easily be more what about the prelate maybe you shouldnt go to her she could be with them she shook her head with a sigh you may be right but its the only chance we have there is no one else i can think of who can help me i have to go to her she touched her fingertips to his face jedidiah please go back if anything were to happen to me then you would be able to do something there would be someone who knew no i wont leave you if you make me go back i will tell the prelate i love you i would rather die than live without you but there are others to think of other lives at stake i dont care about anyone else please margaret dont ask me to leave you to this danger sometimes you can be infuriating my love she took his hands up in hers jedidiah if we are caught if we are together then i accept the risk she twined her fingers through his then be my husband as we have talked about if i die tonight i want it to be as your wife he put a hand behind her head and drew her against him pulling her hair away from her ear he whispered softly into it that would make me the happiest man in the world i love you so much margaret but how can we be married here now we can say the words our love is all that counts not some other person saying words for us words coming from our hearts will bond us better than anyone else could do he squeezed her tight this is the happiest moment in my life he pulled back taking up her hands again in the darkness they looked at each other i jedidiah pledge to be your husband in life and in death i offer you my life my love and my eternal devotion may we be bonded in the creators eyes and heart and in our own she whispered the words back to him as tears streamed down her cheeks she had never been so afraid and so happy in all her life she shook with the need of him when they finished the words they kissed it was the most tender loving kiss he had ever given her tears continued to run down her face as she pressed against him against his lips her hands clutched the back of his broad shoulders holding him to her his arms around her made her feel safer and more loved than she had ever felt at last they parted she struggled to catch her breath i love you my husband i love you my wife always and forever she smiled even though she couldnt see it in the dark she knew he was smiling too lets go see if we can get some proof lets see if we can put a stop to the sisters of the dark lets make the creator proud of the sisters of the light and a wizardtobe he squeezed her hand promise me you wont do anything foolish promise me you wont try to do anything that might get you killed i want to spend some time with you in bed not the woods i need to see what they are up to see if i can find a way to prove all this to the prelate but they are more powerful than i am to say nothing of the fact that there are at least eleven of them on top of that if they truly are sisters of the dark they have the use of subtractive magic we have no defense against that i dont know how we are to get the quillion away from them maybe we will see something else that will help us if we just keep our eyes open and let the creator guide us maybe he will reveal what it is we can do but i dont want either of us taking any more of a chance than we have to we must not be discovered he nodded good thats the way i want it too but jedidiah im a sister of the light that means i have responsibilities responsibilities to the creator and all his children though we are now husband and wife its still my job to guide you in this we are not equals im in charge and i will only allow you to go with me if you promise to abide by that you are not yet a full wizard if i tell you something you must obey im still better with my han than you are with yours i know margaret one reason i wanted to be your husband is because i respect you i wouldnt want a weak wife you have always guided me and that will not change now youve given me everything i have i will follow you always with a smile she shook her head you are a marvel my husband a marvel of the best kind you will make a remarkable wizard truly remarkable ive never told you because i always feared you would let the knowledge swell your head but some of the sisters say that they think you may prove to be the most powerful wizard in a thousand years he didnt speak and she couldnt see his face but she was sure he was blushing margaret your eyes are the only ones i need to see filled with pride she kissed his cheek and then took his hand lets go see how we can put a stop to this how do you know where they went how can we follow them its dark as pitch in these woods the trees hide the moon she pinched his cheek a trick my mother taught me ive never shown it to anyone when i saw them leaving the palace i cast a pool of my han at their feet they stepped through it it leaves tracks of my own han only i can see them their footprints are as bright as the sun on a pond to me but to no other you must teach me this trick someday i promise come on she led him by the hand as she followed the glow of the sisters footprints through the dense woods distant night birds called in haunting voices owls hooted and other creatures made low screams and clicks the ground was uneven tangled with roots and brush but the glowing footprints helped her to see the way the damp heat made her sweat causing her dress to cling to her wet skin when she got home she would shield her room and she would have a bath a long bath with jedidiah then she would let him use his magic on her and she would use hers on him they went deeper into the hagen woods deeper than she had ever gone before vapor drifting from boggy areas carried the pervasive stench of rotting vegetation they passed through dark gullies veiled with hanging roots and moss that brushed against her face and arms making her flinch at the unexpected contact the footprints led up and over sparsely wooded rocky ridges at the top of one standing in the still damp air she looked back out across the somber landscape in the far distance she could see the flickering lights of tanimura and set among the lights rising up in the silvery moonlight the palace of the prophets its dark shape blocking out the lights of the city beyond she longed to be back there to be home but this was something that had to be done there was no one else to do it the lives of everyone depended on her the creator was depending on her still she longed to be home and safe but home was no longer safe it was as dangerous as the hagen woods if there really were sisters of the dark even with as much as she knew it was difficult for her to accept the idea the prelate had to believe her she just had to there was no one else she could turn to for help she wished there were even just one sister she could trust confide in but she didnt dare trust anyone nathan had warned her not to trust anyone even though she wished jedidiah were home and safe she was glad to have him with her she knew there was nothing he could do to help but it still felt good to have him to confide in her husband she smiled at the thought she would never forgive herself if anything happened to him she would protect him with her life if she had to the ground pitched into a descent through gaps in the trees she could see they were going down into a deep bowl in the earth the edge was steep and they had to move slowly so as not to send any rocks tumbling through the woods one started to slide as her foot touched it and she quickly used a handful of air to stop it and then push it firmly into the ground she sighed in relief jedidiah followed her a silent comforting shadow her tension relaxed a little when they passed from the loose rock back into denser woods where the ground was mossy and silent to step on the faint sound of chanting drifted to them through the thick woods carried on heavy fetid air low rhythmic guttural tones of words she couldnt understand resonated in her chest even without understanding the words she felt revulsion at them as if they made the air reek jedidiah gripped her upper arm dragging her to a halt he put his mouth close to her ear margaret please he whispered lets go back now before its too late im afraid jedidiah she growled as she reached up and snatched him by the collar this is important im a sister of the light youre a wizard what do you think ive been training you for to stand on a street down in the market and perform tricks to have people throw coins at you we serve the creator he has given us everything we have so we may use it to help others others are in danger we must help youre a wizard act like one she could just see his wide eyes in the faint light he sagged slightly as the tension went out of his muscles im sorry youre right forgive me i will do what i must i promise her anger cooled im afraid too touch your han keep a firm grip on it but not too tight hold it so you can release it in an instant as ive taught you if anything happens dont hold back dont be afraid of how much you might hurt them if you do need your power anything less than all of it will not be enough if you keep your head youre strong enough to defend yourself you can do it jedidiah have faith in what ive taught you what all the sisters have taught you have faith in the creator in what he has given you you have it for a reason we all do this may be the reason tonight may be what youve been called for he nodded again and she turned back to the glowing footprints following them into the thick forest they wandered through the trees toward the center of the bowl toward where the chanting was coming from the closer they got the more the voices made her skin prickle the voices were sisters she thought she recognized some of them dear creator she prayed give me the strength to do what i must to help you give jedidiah strength too help us serve you to help others little flickers of light came through the leaves they crept closer the trees around her were huge the two of them glided from one trunk to another no longer following the footprints they could see glimpses now of something through openings in the underbrush slowly they tiptoed forward across the open forest floor beneath large spreading spruce trees the needles were soft and quiet to walk on shoulder to shoulder they slid behind low heavy brush at the edge of woods it was as close as they could go beyond lay a flat round open area at least a hundred candles were set on the ground in a ring like a fence or boundary as if holding back the dark forest inside the candles was a circle drawn on the ground it looked to be made of white sand that sparkled with little points of prismatic light it looked like the descriptions of sorcerers sand she had heard although she had never actually seen any it stood out clearly in the candlelight and the light of the moon overhead symbols were drawn with the same white sand they were inside the circle points of them touching the outer boundary of the circle at irregular intervals margaret had never seen the symbols before but she knew some of the elements of them from an old book they spoke to the underworld about halfway in from the outer white line and candles eleven sisters sat in a circle margaret stared harder trying to see in the dim flickering light it looked as if each had a hood over her head with holes cut for the eyes they chanted in unison shadows from the sisters extended inward to a point in the center in the center lay a woman naked except for a hood like the others she lay on her back her hands crossed over her breasts her legs pressed together twelve with the one in the center that made twelve she searched the circle of sisters again even with the candles it was still dark and the candles were to the sisters backs her eyes stopped on a form on the opposite side of the circle her breath caught in her throat that form was larger than the rest it was hunched its head lowered and without a hood it sat at a convergence of lines in the symbols it was not a sister with a start she saw the faint orange glow the statue with the quillion was resting in its lap she and jedidiah crouched frozen watching the circle of sisters as they chanted after a time one of them to the side of the hunched form stood the chanting stopped she spoke short sharp words in a language margaret didnt know at points in the speech her hand shot into the air flinging sparkling dust over the naked woman in the center the dust ignited bathing the hooded sisters with brief harsh light at the flash they all answered with odd rhyming words she and jedidiah exchanged looks her own confused frightened feelings reflected in his eyes the standing sister flung both hands up calling out a list of strange words she went to the naked woman stood at her head and threw up her arms again the sparkling dust caught fire once more this time the orange glow from the quillion brightened the head of the hunched form slowly rose margaret made a silent gasp when she saw the face of the beast its fanged mouth opened with a low growl the sister drew a delicately wrought silver scepter from her cloak and gave it sharp shakes as she chanted again sprinkling water over the prone woman something was happening to the quillion it brightened and then dimmed the dark eyes of the beast watched the naked woman margaret stared wideeyed her heart pounded so hard it felt as if it would tear a hole in her chest as the quillion faded the beasts eyes began to glow orange the same color orange as the quillion as the quillion dimmed the glow in the beasts eyes intensified until the little statue was dark and the things eyes shined bright two more sisters stood they moved to each side of the first the first knelt her hooded head lowered looking down to the naked woman it is time if you are sure you know what must be done the same as has been done to us you are the last to be offered the gift do you wish to accept it yes im entitled its mine i want it margaret thought she knew both voices but she wasnt sure because the hoods muffled their words then it shall be yours sister the other two knelt beside her as she pulled a cloth from her cloak twisting it between her fists you must pass this test of pain to gain the gift we cannot touch you with our magic while it is being done but we will help you as best we can i will do anything its mine let it be done the naked woman spread her arms the sisters to each side leaned with all their weight on her wrists the sister at her head held the twisted cloth over the hooded face open your mouth and bite down on this she put the cloth between the womans teeth now open your legs you must keep them open if you try to close them it will be a rejection of what you are being offered and you will lose the chance forever the naked woman stared fixedly up at nothing she panted with fear her breast heaving slowly she spread her legs the beast stirred giving a low grunt margaret gripped jedidiahs forearm her fingers digging into him the beast sniffed the air as it slowly unfolded itself margaret saw that it was larger than it had looked when it was all hunched over it was powerfully built looking mostly like a man flickers of candlelight reflected off sweatslicked knotted muscles of its arms and chest downy hair started at the narrow hips growing coarser farther down the legs to the ankles where it was the longest thickest but the head was something other than a man it was a horror of anger and fangs a long thin tongue flicked out tasting the air the eyes glowed orange in the dim light orange with the power of the gift it had absorbed from the quillion as it stretched out on its hands and knees toward the naked woman margaret almost gasped aloud she recognized the beast she had seen a drawing of it in an old book the same book in which she had seen drawings of some parts of the spells before her she wanted to scream it was a namble one of the nameless ones minions oh dear creator she prayed fervently please protect us growling in a low rumble its powerful muscles flexing its haunted eyes glowing orange the namble edged like a huge cat toward the woman on the ground head low it crawled between her legs in a state of ragged fear the woman still stared up at nothing the namble sniffed at her crotch its long tongue flicked out running over her she flinched making a small jerk of a sound against the cloth in her teeth but she kept her legs open her eyes did not move she did not look at the namble the sisters in the circle began a soft chant the namble licked her again slower grunting this time as it did so she squealed against the rag beads of sweat shimmered on her flesh she kept her legs wide apart rising up on its knees the beast gave a throaty roar to the black sky its pointed barbed erect phallus stood out plainly silhouetted against the candles beyond muscles bulged in knotted cords along its arms and shoulders as the namble bent forward putting a fist to each side of the woman its tongue licked out around her throat as it gave a vibrating rumble of a growl and then it lowered itself covering her with its massive form its hips hunched forward the womans eyes winced shut as she screamed against the cloth in her teeth the namble gave a quick powerful thrust and her eyes snapped open in a panic of pain even with the cloth clenched in her teeth her screams could be heard over the chanting each time the beast knocked the wind from her adding more force to the shrieks margaret had to force herself to take a breath as she watched she hated these women they had given themselves over to something unspeakably evil still they were her sisters and she could hardly bear to watch one being hurt she realized she was shaking she clenched the gold flower at her neck in one fist and jedidiahs arm with her other as tears streamed down her face the beast thrashed at the sister on the ground as the three sisters held her her muffled screams of torment ripped at margarets heart the sister holding the cloth finally spoke if you want the gift you must encourage him to give it to you he will not surrender it unless you overcome his control unless you take it from him you must win it from him do you understand crying her eyes shut tight the woman nodded the sister pulled the cloth away then he is yours now take the gift if you will the other two released her arms and the three of them returned to their places in the circle taking up the chanting with the others the woman let out a wail that turned margarets blood to ice it made her ears hurt the woman flung her arms and legs around the namble clutching herself to it moving with it moving with the chanting her screams died away as she panted with the effort margaret could watch no longer she closed her eyes and swallowed back a wail of her own that tried to force itself from her throat but even with her eyes closed it was no better she could still hear it please dear creator she begged in her mind let it end please let it end and then with a husky grunt it did margaret opened her eyes to see the namble still its back hunched it shuddered and then slowly went limp the woman struggled to breathe under its weight with strength that seemed impossible she at last pushed the namble off her chest heaving it rolled to its hands and knees and slunk back to its place in the circle folding itself into a dark bundle the chanting had stopped the woman lay on the ground for a time panting recovering she was covered with a glistening sheen of sweat that reflected the yellow light of the candle flames taking one last deep breath the woman came smoothly to her feet a dark stain of blood ran down her legs with a calm awareness that sent a chill up margarets spine and caught her breath short the woman turned to face her pulling off her hood the menacing orange glow in her eyes faded and they returned to the pale blue with dark violet flecks that margaret knew so well sister margaret her tone was as mocking as the smile on her thin lips did you enjoy watching i thought you might wideeyed margaret rose slowly to her feet across the circle the sister who had held the cloth also rose and pulled off her hood margaret dear how nice of you to show such interest in our little group i didnt know you were that stupid did you think i let you see the quillion in my office by accident that i wasnt aware someone was interested i had to know who was skulking about looking into things that were none of their concern i let you see it i wasnt sure though until you followed us her smile froze margarets breathing think we are fools i saw the pool of han you cast for us to step in i obliged you such a shame for you margarets hand was clutched tightly around the gold flower at her neck her fingernails digging into her palm how could they have seen the pool of her han the answer was tragically simple she had underestimated them underestimated what they could do with the gift her mistake was going to cost her her life but only her only her please dear creator only her she could sense jedidiah close at her side jedidiah she whispered run ill try to hold them off while you escape run my love run for your life his powerful hand came up and gripped her upper arm i dont think so my love her eyes were captured by his cruelly empty expression i tried to save you margaret i tried to get you to turn back but you wouldnt listen he glanced to the sister across the clearing if i got her oath couldnt we just the sister glared back he sighed no i suppose we couldnt he gave her a strong shove into the clearing she came to a stumbling stop at the edge of the candles she had gone numb her mind refused to work her voice refused to work the sister across the circle clasped her hands together looking to jedidiah has she told anyone else no just me she was looking for proof before she went to anyone else for help his eyes returned to her isnt that right my love he shook his head again the smirk of a smile touching his lips lips she had kissed she felt sick she felt like the biggest fool the creator had ever seen such a shame you have done well jedidiah you will be rewarded and as for you margaret well tomorrow jedidiah will report that after trying to avoid the insistent affections of an older woman he finally and firmly rejected you for good and you ran away in shame and humiliation if they come here and find your bones it will confirm their fears that you chose to end your life because you felt unworthy to live any longer as a sister of the light the darkflecked eyes glided back to margaret let me have her let me test my new gift let me taste it those eyes kept margaret frozen her hand still clutching the gold flower at her neck she could hardly breathe through the numbing agony of knowing jedidiah had betrayed her she had prayed to the creator to give jedidiah strength strength to help others she had had no idea who those others would be the creator had answered her prayers foolish as they had been when the sister consented the thin lips widened in a greedy grin margaret felt naked helpless in the penetrating gaze of those flecked eyes at last margaret made her mind work her thoughts sprang to a terrified groping for a way of escape she could only think of one thing to do before it was too late with panicked abandon she let her han explode through every fiber of herself and brought forth a shield the most powerful shield she knew a shield of air she made it hard as steel impenetrable she poured her hurt and hate into it the thin smile never left the flecked eyes didnt move air is it then with the gift i can see it now shall i show you what i can do with air what the gift can do with it the creators power will protect me margaret managed the thin smile turned to a sneer you think so let me show you the creators impotence her hand came up margaret expected a ball of wizards fire it wasnt it was a ball of air so dense she could see it see it coming it was so dense it distorted what was seen through it margaret could hear the whoosh of its approach the wail of its power it went through her shield like flaming pitch through paper it shouldnt have been able to do that her shield was air air should not have been able to break a shield of air not a shield as strong as she had made but this was air made not by a mere sister but one with the gift a wizards gift confused margaret realized she was lying on the ground looking up at the stars pretty stars the creators stars she couldnt draw a breath simply couldnt she thought it odd she didnt remember the air hitting her only her breath being ripped violently from her lungs she felt cold but there was something warm against her face warm and wet it was a comfort her legs didnt seem to work try as she might she couldnt make them move with the greatest of effort she managed to lift her head a bit the sisters hadnt moved but now somehow they were farther away they all watched her margaret looked down at herself something was terribly wrong below her ribs there was mostly nothing there just the shredded wet remains of her insides and then nothing where the rest of her should have been there was nothing where had her legs gone they must be somewhere they had to be somewhere there they were they lay a little distance away where she had been standing so that was why she couldnt take a breath air shouldnt have been able to do that it was impossible at least air wielded by a sister shouldnt have been able to do that it was a wonder dear creator why have you not helped me i was doing your work why have you let this be done it should hurt shouldnt it shouldnt it hurt to be ripped in half but it didnt it didnt hurt the least little bit cold she felt only cold but the warm rope of her guts lying against her face felt good warm she took comfort in the warmth maybe it didnt hurt because the creator was helping her that must be it the creator had taken her pain dear creator thank you i did my best i am sorry i failed you send another boots were near jedidiah husband jedidiah monster jedidiah i tried to warn you margaret i tried to keep you away you cant say i didnt try her arms lay sprawled out to her sides in her right hand she could feel the little gold flower she hadnt let go of it even as she was torn in half she never let go she tried to now but she couldnt make her hand open she wished she had the strength to open her hand she didnt want to die with that in her hand but she just couldnt open her fingers dear creator i have failed in this too since she couldnt release it she did the only other thing she could think of she sent the rest of her power into it maybe someone would see and ask the right question tired she was so very tired she tried to close her eyes but they wouldnt close how could a person die if they couldnt close their eyes there were a lot of stars pretty stars there seemed to be fewer than she remembered hardly any at all she thought her mother had told her once how many there were but she couldnt remember well she would just have to count them one two chapter how long chase asked the seven fiercelooking men that were squatted down in a half circle before her and chase just stared at him and blinked none of the seven had any weapons except belt knives and one didnt even have that but there were a lot of other men standing behind them and they all had bows or spears or both rachel tugged her thick brown woolen cloak tighter around herself and shifted her weight as she squatted wiggling her toes wishing her feet werent so cold they were starting to tingle she stroked her fingers over the big amber stone hanging on the chain from her neck its smooth teardrop shape felt warm against her fingers chase mumbled something rachel couldnt understand as he pushed his heavy black cloak back over his shoulders and then pointed with a stick at the two people drawn in the dirt all the leather belts for his weapons creaked as he leaned forward on boots big enough for any of the other men to fit both of their feet into just one he tapped his stick on the ground again then turned and pushed his hand out toward the grassland how long he pointed at the drawing and pushed his hand out a few more times how long since they left they chattered something chase and she couldnt understand and then the man with long silver hair falling down around his sun brown face the one who didnt have a coyote hide around his shoulders but wore only simple buckskin clothes drew another picture in the dirt she could tell what it was easy this time it was the sun he made marks under it chase watched as the man drew three rows of marks under the picture of the sun he stopped chase stared at the picture three weeks he looked up at the man with the long hair three weeks he pointed at the sun on the ground and held up most of his fingers three times theyve been gone three weeks the man nodded and made some more of those funny words siddin handed her another piece of flat bread with honey it tasted wonderful she tried to eat it slowly but it was gone before she knew it she had tasted honey only once before back at the castle when she lived there as the princesss playmate the princess never let her have honey said it wasnt for the likes of her but one of the cooks had given her some once her stomach fluttered at the memory of how mean the princess had been to her she never wanted to live in a castle again now that she was chases daughter she would never have to every night she lay in her blankets before she went to sleep and wondered what the rest of her new family was like chase said she would have sisters and brothers and a real mother he said she would have to mind her new mother she could do that it was easy to mind when someone loved you chase loved her he never really said it but it was easy to tell he put his huge arm around her and stroked her hair when she was afraid of sounds in the dark siddin smiled at her as he licked the honey off his fingers it was nice to see him again when they had first come here she thought there was going to be trouble scary men all painted with mud and with grass stuck all over themselves came up to them when they were still out on the grassland she didnt even see where they came from they were just there all of a sudden rachel was afraid at first because the men pointed arrows at them and their voices sounded scary and she couldnt understand what they said but chase just got off the horse and held her in his arms while he watched them he didnt even draw his sword or anything she didnt think anything scared him he was the bravest man she ever saw the men had looked at her as she stared at them and chase stroked her hair and told her not to be afraid the men stopped pointing the arrows at them and led them to the village when they got here she saw siddin siddin knew her and chase from before when kahlan had saved him from queen milena back in the castle zedd kahlan chase siddin and she had all been together when they were running with the box she couldnt speak siddins language but he knew them and told his father who they were after that everyone was real nice to them chase pointed with one finger to one of the pictures of a person the finger of his other hand to the other picture and then held the fingers together and pointed away moving his hands like they were going over hills richard and kahlan left three weeks ago and they went north to aydindril the men all shook their heads and started jabbering again siddins father held up his hand for quiet he pointed at himself and the other men and held up three fingers then he pointed at the picture on the ground that had a dress and said kahlans name and then he pointed north chase pointed at the picture of the sun then the picture of kahlan then at the men holding up three fingers then north three weeks ago kahlan and three of your men went north to aydindril the men all nodded and said kahlan and aydindril chase put a knee to the ground as he leaned forward tapping the picture of the other person but richard went too he pointed north again richard went to aydindril too with kahlan the men all turned to the man with the long silver hair he looked at chase and then shook his head the carved piece of bone hanging from a leather thong around his neck swung back and forth he pointed down at the picture of the man with a sword and then pointed in a different direction chase stared at the man for a long minute then he frowned as if he didnt understand the man leaned over with the stick and drew three more people each with a dress he looked up from under his eyebrows as if he wanted to make sure chase was watching and then he drew an x across two of the figures his eyes returned to chase again as he folded his arms over his knees waiting what does that mean dead is that what you mean they are dead the men stared not moving chase pulled a single finger like a knife across his throat dead the man with the silver hair gave one nod and said dead but it sounded a little funny the way he made the word seem longer than it should he pointed with his stick to the picture of the sun then the picture of kahlan and then he pointed over his shoulder to the way they went he pointed to the sun again then at the picture of richard then at the picture of the woman without the x then he pointed in a different direction chase stood his chest rose and then fell as he let out the deep breath he was awfully tall he stared in the direction the man with the silver hair said richard had gone east thats deeper into the wilds he whispered to himself why isnt he with kahlan he rubbed his chin rachel thought he looked worried it couldnt be that he looked scared nothing scared chase dear spirits why would richard go deeper into the wilds what could possess kahlan to let that boy go into the wilds and who is he with the men all glanced at each other as if they were wondering why chase was talking to the air chase squatted back down all his leather creaking and pointed at the drawing of the third woman and frowned and shrugged at the men he pointed at the picture of richard and the woman and pointed east again he held the palms of his hands up near his shoulders as he shrugged and made faces to show he didnt understand the man with the long silver hair gave chase a sad look as he let out a long breath he pointed at the third woman the one without an x and then he turned and took a rope from a man behind him he wrapped the rope around his own neck he looked to chases frown and then he pointed to the picture of richard when chase looked up and their eyes met the man pulled the rope tight with a snap he pointed east he touched the stick to the picture of kahlan and then pulled his fingers down his cheeks from the corners of his eye like tears then pointed north chase stood it was almost a jump his face was pale she took him he whispered this woman captured richard and took him into the wilds rachel stood next to him what does it mean chase why didnt kahlan go with him he looked down at her his face had an odd still look that made her stomach knot up she went for help she went to aydindril to get zedd no one made a sound he stared back out to the east as he hooked a thumb behind his big silver belt buckle dear spirits he whispered to himself if richard really did go into the wilds turn him north dont let him go to the south or even zedd wont be able to help him rachel hugged her doll tight whats the wilds a very bad place little one he stared out unblinking toward the darkening sky a very bad place the way he said it all calm and quiet gave her goose bumps zedd could feel the muscles in the horses back flexing under him as he ducked beneath a branch while slowing the animal zedd favored riding bareback if he needed to ride a horse he preferred to let the animal feel as unencumbered as possible he thought it only fair most seemed to appreciate his consideration this one especially she gave him more than she ever would have under a saddle and he had taken everything she had given he had proffered his saddle and the rest of the tack to a man named haff haff had the biggest ears zedd had ever seen how a man with ears the like of those had ever found a wife was a wonder but have a wife he did and four children too and he looked to have more need of the tack than zedd not to ride of course but to sell his crops and stores had been carried off by soldiers of the dharan army it was the least zedd could do after all rachel was soaked to the bone and haff offered them a dry place to sleep even if it was in a dilapidated little barn and his wife offered them a cabbage soup thin as it was asking nothing in return it was worth a saddle just to see the look on chases face when zedd said he wasnt hungry the big man ate enough for three men though and he should have known better there was going to be much hunger this winter the tack wouldnt bring its worth not with hunger spreading like a dark wind before a thunderhead but it would bring something maybe enough to take the hardest edge off the winter zedd saw chase put a coin in each of the four childrens pockets when he thought no one was looking growling at them in a tone that would make a grown man blanch but which for some odd reason made children only smile not to look in the pocket until he was gone he hoped it wasnt gold the boundary warden could smell a thief open a window in the next town and probably tell you his name too but he had no wits about him around children haff suspiciously wanted to know what he was to do in return for the tack zedd told him he was to swear his undying loyalty to the mother confessor and the new lord rahl of dhara both of whom had put a stop to things the like of which had been done to him the man had stared at him his big ears sticking out under that ridiculous knit hat with a tassel on each side that only served to draw attention where it wasnt needed and had said done with a firm nod a small start one loyal for the price of a saddle that it would all be so easy but that was weeks ago now he was alone the sweet smell of a birch fire drifted to him through the thick woods the horse lifting her nose to it as she stepped carefully along the narrow path in the still air gathering darkness sent deepening shadows across the way even before the small house came into view he could hear the racket the sound of furniture being overturned the crash of pots and pans and demons being cursed the horses ears pricked toward the commotion as they rode down the twisting trail zedd gave her a reassuring pat on the neck the little house wood walls dark with age and a roof thickly layered with ferns and dry pine needles was set back into the towering trees nestled among rough trunks dark in the days end he dismounted to the side of the brown dead ferns spreading like a garden in front of the house the horse rolled her eyes toward him as he came around to give her a scratch under her jaw be a good girl and find yourself something to eat he put a finger under the horses chin forcing her head up but stay close the horse nickered with a smile zedd rubbed her gray nose good girl from inside the house came a low growl interspersed with angry clicks something heavy thudded to the floor accompanied by a thick oath in a foreign tongue come out from under there you vile beast zedd grinned at the sound of the familiar raspy voice he watched the horse stroll off a ways to graze on tufts of dry grass lifting her head while she chewed to look back toward the house at each sharp thump zedd sauntered up the curving walk toward the house he paused turning full around twice to admire the beauty of the surrounding woods they truly were a wonder calm and peaceful in a place that had been a pass through one of the most dangerous spots in the world the boundary but the boundary was gone now yet the woods were a serene refuge imbued with an almost palpable tranquillity that zedd knew wasnt natural they had been infused with those qualities at the skilled hands of the woman who at that very moment was throwing curses bold enough to make a battlehardened sandarian lancer blush and he had seen one of those curse his own queen into a dead faint that of course had only earned the man the rope the fellow had had a few things to say to the hangman too which in turn didnt bring him a clean drop but did offer him the opportunity to get off one last eloquent if vulgar oath the other lancers seemed to think the trade worth the price for her part the queen never seemed to fully recover her delicate air and thereafter always flushed a fabulous red at the mere sight of one of her lancers needing to be fanned furiously by her attendants in order to remain conscious she would probably have had them all hanged had they not saved her throne to say nothing of her dainty neck on more than one occasion but that was a long time ago in another war clasping his hands together behind himself zedd inhaled deeply relishing the clean crisp air bending over he plucked a dry wilted wild rose and with a wisp of magic brought it to fresh bloom the yellow petals spread and swelled with new vitality closing his eyes he took a deep whiff of the flower and then idly stuck it in his robes over his breast he was in no hurry it was not wise to interrupt a sorceress in a snit through the open door came a more serious curse as the object of the sorceresss ire was at last brought to account with a whack from the blunt end of an axe the thing was sent flying through the doorway the small armored beast landed on its back at zedds feet wobbling it clicked and growled as it raked the air with its claws trying to right itself it appeared no worse for the axe or for its brief flight and rough landing filthy gripper it was a gripper that had attached itself to adies ankle before once a gripper had you there was virtually no way to get it off it held on with those claws and rasped its teeth into you down to bone sucking your blood with its puckered fangringed mouth they never let go as long as there was blood to feed on and that armor shed any counterattack adie had used an axe to chop off her foot where the gripper had been attached chopped off her own foot to save her life thinking about it turned his stomach he watched the beast at his feet for a moment then gave it a casual kick sending it a goodly distance landing right side up it waddled off into the woods in search of easier prey zedd looked up at the figure standing in the doorway scowling at him with her completely white eyes her breast still heaving she wore robes the same light burlap color as his but unlike his hers were decorated at the neck with yellow and red beads sewn in the ancient symbols of her profession she put her fists on her hips the scowl held a firm grip on her features not that it diminished in the least how handsome they were she still held the axe in one hand though a worrisome sign best not to trouble her too quickly with what he wanted zedd smiled you really shouldnt play with grippers adie thats how you lost your foot the last time you know he plucked the yellow rose from its place at his chest his thin lips pushed his wrinkled cheeks back farther as his smile widened got anything to eat im starving she watched him silently for a moment without moving then slipped the axe head to the floor and leaned the handle against the wall just inside the door what do you be doing here wizard zedd stepped onto the tiny porch and gave a dramatic bow when he came up he offered her the flower as if it were a priceless jewel i just couldnt stay away from your tender embrace dear lady he flashed his most irresistible smile adie studied him a moment with those white eyes that be a lie zedd cleared his throat and pressed the flower closer he thought maybe he needed to practice his smile is that stew i smell without taking her gaze from him she accepted the flower sticking it in her straight jawlength black and gray hair she truly was handsome it be stew her soft thin hands took his a small smile stole onto her finely wrinkled face and she gave a slight nod it be good to see you again zedd for a time i feared i never would i spent many a night in a sweat knowing what would happen had you failed when winter came and the magic of orden didnt sweep the land i knew you had succeeded zedd was encouraged that his best smile hadnt been wasted after all but he was careful with his answer darken rahl has been defeated what of richard and kahlan do they be safe zedd puffed up with pride yes in fact richard was the one who defeated darken rahl she nodded again i think there be more to the story he shrugged trying to make it seem less important than it was a bit of a tale though the small smile still rested easily on her face her white eyes seemed to be weighing his soul and there be a reason you be here a reason i fear i wont like he pulled his hands out of hers and pushed some of his unruly wavy white hair back while frowning bags woman are you going to feed me any of that stew or not adie finally withdrew her white eyes from him and turned back into her home i think there be enough stew even for you come in and shut the door i do not wish to see another gripper tonight invited in well things were going smoothly he wondered how much he was going to have to tell her not all he hoped wizards work using people the worst of it was using people he liked especially people he liked deeply as zedd helped her right the chairs and table and pick up the pots and tin plates strewn about the floor he began telling her of the things that had happened since he had been with her last he started with the harrowing tale of going through the pass protected somewhat by the bone she had given him to hide him from the beasts he still had the bone on a thin leather thong around his neck seeing no need to be rid of it after he had gotten safely through she listened without comment as he wove the tale and when he told of richards capture by the mordsith she didnt turn to show her face but he saw the muscles in her shoulders tense for the briefest of moments with no small amount of emphasis to make his point he related how darken rahl had taken the night stone from richard the night stone she had given him to see him safely through the pass he scowled at her back as she picked a plate off the floor i was nearly killed by that stone darken rahl used it to trap me in the underworld i escaped by the thinnest of hairs you almost got me killed giving that thing to richard do not be a thickheaded fool she scoffed you be smart enough to save yourself had i not given the night stone to richard he would have died in the pass and then darken rahl would have won and right now would no doubt be torturing you you would soon be dead by giving the stone to richard i saved your life he shook a leg bone of some sort at the glance she cast over her shoulder that thing was dangerous you shouldnt go handing out dangerous things as if they were a stick of candy not without warning people anyway he had a right to be indignant he had been the one sucked into the underworld by that wretched stone the woman could at least pretend to be contrite zedd went on with the story of how richard had escaped although he had a web around him hiding his identity and how the quads had attacked chase kahlan and himself he had to make an effort to control his voice at the telling of what had almost happened to kahlan and how she had called forth the con dar and killed their attackers he finished with how richard had tricked darken rahl into opening the wrong box he told her how the magic of orden had taken darken rahl for his mistake zedd smiled to himself as he reached the end of his story telling her that richard had somehow gotten past kahlans power that they were free to love each other he wasnt about to tell her how that was not for anyone to know and they were happily together now he was pleased that he had managed to tell the story without having to delve too deeply into some of the more painful events he didnt want to have to revisit some of those hurts she didnt ask any questions but came and put a hand on his shoulder saying that she was relieved all of them had survived and won zedd was silent after the telling at least as much as he wanted to tell of the tale he set to stacking the pile of loose bones into the corner where she said they belonged by the way they were scattered about the gripper must have sought refuge in them a sorry mistake that people called adie the bone woman was small wonder the house had little else in it her life seemed devoted to bones a sorceress dedicated to bones was a troubling concept he saw little evidence of potions powders or the usual type of charms any of the typical things he knew to expect from a woman of her talents he knew what she was probing into just not why sorceresses usually confined their concerns to things living she was a searcher into things dark and dangerous things dead unfortunately that was what he was doing too if you wanted to know about fire you had to study it he guessed of course it was a good way to get burned he knew he didnt like the analogy the moment it popped into his head he looked up from the bone pile as he placed the last of them if you dont want grippers in your house adie you should keep your door closed his perfectly apt scolding frown was wasted as she didnt turn from her task of stacking the firewood back in its bin at the side of the hearth the door be closed and bolted she said in her dry rasp in a tone seemingly meant to wither his unseen scowl this be the third time picking up a bone that had been hiding behind a stick of firewood she straightened and carried it to him before the grippers never came near my house her voice lowered as if in a threat to unseen ears i saw to that she handed over the thick white rib bone peering down at him as he squatted on the floor next to the bone pile now since winter they come near the bones no longer seem to keep them away the reason be a mystery to me adie had lived in this pass a long time no one knew as well as she its dangers its quirks its vagaries none knew better than she what it took to be safe here to live on the cusp between the world of the living and the world of the dead at the edge of the underworld of course the boundary was gone now it should be safe here now he wondered what else was going on that she wasnt telling him sorceresses never told all they knew what was she doing still living here with strange and dangerous things happening stubborn women sorceresses the lot of them adie limped slightly as she walked across the room lit only by the fire light the lamp following behind zedd swept a hand in the direction of the table the lamp lit itself adding a soft glow to that of the fire in the large hearth made of smooth river stones and helped illuminate the dark walls of the room every wall held white bones shelves lined one wall and were stuffed to overflowing with the skulls of dangerous beasts many of the bones had been made into ceremonial objects some had been made into necklaces decorated with feathers and beads and some had been inscribed with ancient symbols some had spells drawn on the wall around them it was the oddest collection he had ever seen zedd pointed a bony finger down at her foot why are you limping adie gave him a sidelong glance as she stopped and lifted a spoon from a hook set into the mortar at the side of the fireplace the new foot you grew me be too short zedd stood with one hand on a knobby hip and the sticklike fingers of the other holding his smooth chin as he looked down at her foot he hadnt noticed it wasnt long enough when he had grown it back he had needed to leave soon after it was done maybe i could grow the ankle a little longer he wondered aloud he took his hand from his chin and flourished it in the air make them even adie glared over her shoulder as she stirred the stew no thank you zedd arched an eyebrow wouldnt you appreciate having them both even i appreciate you growing my foot back for me life be easier with two of them i did not realize how much i hated that crutch but the foot be fine the way it is she lifted the longhandled spoon to her lips blowing on the hot stew it would be easier if they were even i said no she tasted the stew bags woman why not adie tapped the spoon clean on the edge of the iron kettle and hung it back on its hook then lifted a dented tin from the side of the mantel unscrewing the lid her voice was quiet her rasp softer i do not wish to revisit that pain had i known what it would be like i would have chosen to live the rest of my life without the foot reaching her hand into the tin she took a threefingerandthumb pinch of fivespice and flung it into the stew zedd tugged at his ear perhaps she was right growing the foot back for her had nearly killed her he hadnt expected what had happened her reaction to his using that much magic on her still he had been successful and managed to draw away the pain of the memories though he still didnt know what they had been about but he should have taken into account that she could have had memories that held that much pain he should have taken the wizards second rule into account but he had been intent on doing something good for her that was the way it worked with the second rule it was usually hard to tell if you were violating it you know the price of magic adie almost as well as a wizard and besides i made it up to you for the pain i mean he knew it wouldnt take as much magic to make the ankle longer as it had to grow the foot back but after what she had suffered he could understand her reluctance perhaps you are right maybe i have done enough her white eyes settled on him again why be you here wizard he gave her an impish grin i wanted to see you you are a hard woman to forget and i wanted to tell you about darken rahl being defeated by richard that we won he frowned at her stare why do you think the grippers are coming here she shook her head with a sigh you talk like a drunk man walks in every direction but where he be headed she flicked a finger toward the table indicating that she wanted him to get the bowls i already knew we won the first day of winter has come and past had rahl won things wouldnt be so peaceful as they are though i be pleased to see your bones again her voice lowered became even more raspy why be you here wizard he strode over to the table glad to elude the scrutiny of those eyes for a moment you didnt answer my question why do you think the grippers are coming here her voice lowered into a deeper harsher rasp bordering on anger i think the grippers be here for the same reason you be here to cause an old woman trouble zedd grinned as he returned with bowls my eyes dont see an old woman they see only a handsome woman she regarded his grin with a helpless shake of her head i fear your tongue be more dangerous than a gripper he handed her a bowl have the grippers ever come here before no she turned and began spooning stew into the bowl when the boundary be in place the grippers stayed in the pass with other beasts after the boundary went down i not see them for a time but when winter came so did the grippers that not be right i think something be wrong he exchanged the empty bowl for the full holding it to his nose and inhaling the aroma maybe when the boundary finally failed there was no longer any hold over them and they simply came out of the pass maybe when the boundary failed most of the beasts went with it back into the underworld some were freed of their bonds and escaped into the surrounding country i never saw any grippers until the winter came nearly a month ago i fear something else happened for them to be here zedd knew very well what had happened but didnt say so instead he asked adie why dont you leave come away with me to aydindril it would be no her mouth snapped closed she seemed almost surprised by her own voice she smoothed her robe with her hand letting the anger leave her face and then took the spoon out of the hand with the bowl and returned to dishing out stew no this be my home zedd watched silently as she worked over the kettle when finished she carried her bowl to the table set it down and retrieved a loaf of bread from over the counter from a shelf behind a blueandwhitestriped curtain she pointed with the bread to the other empty chair zedd set his bowl on the table and sat hiking his robes up as he folded his legs underneath himself adie lowered herself into the chair opposite him and sliced off a chunk of bread using the knifepoint to push it across the table before she looked up to meet his eyes please zedd do not ask me to leave my home i am only worried for you adie adie dunked a chunk of bread in her stew that be a lie he looked up from under his eyebrows as he picked up his bread its not a lie she ate without lifting her head only be a lie zedd went back to his stew and ate in earnest umm thish ish womerful he mumbled around a hot chunk of meat she nodded her thanks he ate until his bowl was empty then took it to the fireplace and filled it once more on his way back to the table he swept his hand around at the room pointing with his spoon you have a lovely home adie quite lovely he sat and picked up the bread she passed to him he put his elbows on the table his sleeves slipping up his forearms as he broke the bread in half but i dont think you should be living here all alone not with the grippers and all he gestured with the bread to the north why dont you come with me to aydindril its a lovely place too you would like it there theres plenty of room kahlan could see to it you have your choice of places to live why you could even stay at the keep if you preferred her white eyes stayed on her meal no why not we could have a good time there a sorceress could have a grand time in the keep there are books and i said no he watched her as she went back to eating stew he pushed his sleeves up farther and did the same he couldnt eat long he set the spoon in the bowl and looked up from under his eyebrows adie there is more to the story more i havent told you she lifted an eyebrow i hope you do not expect me to look surprised i not be good at pretending she bent back over her bowl adie the veil is torn her hand paused with the spoon halfway to her mouth she didnt look up baa what do you know of the veil you do not know what you speak of the spoon completed its journey i know its torn she scooped up the last piece of potato from her bowl you speak of things that are not possible wizard the veil not be torn she stood picking up her empty bowl be at ease old man if the veil be torn we would have a lot more than grippers to be worried about but we dont zedd turned putting a hand on the back of his chair watching her limp toward the kettle hanging from the crane in the fireplace the stone of tears is in this world he said in a quiet voice adie halted her bowl fell to the floor clattering in the thick silence and rolled away her hands were held out before her as if she still held it her back was stiff do not say such a thing aloud she whispered unless you be certain beyond doubt unless you be certain on your honor as first wizard unless you be willing to offer your soul to the keeper if you be lying zedds fierce hazel eyes watched her back i pledge my soul to the keeper if im telling you a lie may he take me this instant the stone of tears is in this world i have seen it dear spirits protect us she whispered weakly still she did not move tell me what fool thing you have done wizard adie come and sit down first i want you to tell me what you are doing living here in the pass or what used to be the pass what you have been doing living at the edge of the underworld and why you wont leave she spun to face him one hand gripping the skirt of her robe that be my business with his hand on the chair back zedd pushed himself to his feet adie i must know this is important i must know what you have been doing so that i may know if it can be a help i know very well the pain you live with i saw it remember i dont know what caused it but i know how deep it is i would ask you to share the story with me i ask you as a friend to confide in me please dont make me ask as first wizard her eyes rose to meet his at the last of what he said the flash of anger faded and she nodded very well perhaps i have kept it to myself too long perhaps it would be a relief to tell someone a friend perhaps you will not want my help after you hear if you still do i expect you to tell me all that has happened she thrust a finger in his direction all zedd gave her a small smile of encouragement of course she limped to her chair just as she sat down the largest skull on the shelves suddenly thudded to the floor both stared at it zedd walked over and picked it up in both hands his thin fingers stroked tapered curved fangs as long as his hand the skull was flat on the bottom it shouldnt have been able to roll off the shelf he replaced it solidly as adie watched it seems she said in her rasp that the bones want to be on the floor lately they keep falling down zedd returned to his chair after a final frown to the skull tell me about the bones why you have them what you do with them everything start at the beginning everything she folded her arms across her lap briefly looking as if she wanted to run for the door it be a painful story to tell not a word of it will ever touch my lips adie chapter adie drew a long breath i be born in the town of choora in the land of nicobarese my mother did not have the gift of sorcery she be a skip as it be called my grandmother lindel be the one before me to have it my mother be grateful to the good spirits she be a skip but bitter at them that i be gifted in nicobarese those with the gift be loathed and distrusted it be thought the gift be allied to the flows of power not only from the creator but also from the keeper even ones using the gift for good be suspected of being a baneling you know of the banelings yes zedd tore off a piece of bread yes ones turned to the keeper sworn to him they hide in the light as well as the shadows serving his wishes working to his ends they can be anyone some work for good for years hiding waiting to be called but when they are called they do the keepers bidding they are also called by different names but they are all agents of the keeper some books call them that agents some are important people like darken rahl used for important tasks some are everyday people used for dirty little deeds those with the gift like darken rahl are the most difficult for the keeper to turn those without it are easier but even they are rare adies eyes widened darken rahl be a baneling zedd lifted an eyebrow as he nodded admitted it to me himself he said he was an agent but its the same thing whatever the word and ive heard any number they all serve the keeper this be dangerous news zedd sopped up some stew with the piece of bread i bring very little of any other kind you were saying about your grandmother lindel in the time of grandmother lmdels youth sorceresses be put to death for anything that fate brought sickness accidents still births put to death wrongly for being banelings some of the gifted fought back at being wrongly persecuted they fought well it deepened the hatred and only served to confirm the fears of many of the nicobarese people at last there was a truce nicobarese leaders agreed to let the gifted women be if they would give a soul oath as a way of proving they not be banelings an oath not to use their power unless permission be granted by a governing body the kings circle of their town for instance it be an oath to the people an oath not to use the gift and bring the keepers notice zedd swallowed a mouthful of stew why would people think sorceresses were banelings because it be easier to blame a woman for their troubles than to admit the truth and more satisfying to accuse than to curse the unknown those with the gift use power that can help people but it can also be used to harm them because it can be used to harm it be believed the power must be given at least in part by the keeper superstitious nonsense he growled as you well know superstition needs no grounding in truth but once rooted it grows a strong though twisted tree he grunted his assent so no sorceress used her power adie shook her head no unless it be for some common good and they went before the kings circle of their town first and asked permission every sorceress went before the circle of their town or district and swore an oath to the people an oath on her soul to abide by the wishes of the people swore a solemn oath not to use her power on or for another unless asked to do so by the agreement of the circle zedd put his spoon down in disgust but they had the gift how could they not use it they used it but only in private never where anyone could see and never on another zedd leaned back in his chair shaking his head in silent wonder at the wizards first rule at the things people would believe while adie went on grandmother lindel be a stern old woman who lived by herself she never wanted anything to do with teaching me about using the gift she told me only to let it be and my mother of course could teach me nothing so i learned on my own as i grew as the gift grew but i knew very well the wickedness of using it i be lectured on that almost every day to use the gift in a manner not permitted was made to seem like touching the taint of the keeper himself and i believed it so i feared greatly going against what i be taught i be a fruit of the tree of that superstition one day when i be eight or nine i be in the town square with my mother and father on market day and across the square a building caught fire there be a girl about my age on the second floor trapped by the flames she screamed for help no one could reach her because the fire be all through the first floor her screams of terror burned every nerve in me i started to cry i wanted to help i could not stand the screams adie folded her hands in her lap and looked down at the table i made the fire to go out the girl be saved zedd watched her placid expression as she stared at the table i dont suppose anyone except the girl and her parents were happy adie shook her head everyone knew i had the gift they knew it be me who had done it my mother stood and cried my father just stood looking the other way he would not look at me at an agent of the keepers evil someone went for grandmother lindel she was respected because of how she stood by the oath when grandmother lindel came she took me and the girl before the men of the kings circle grandmother lindel switched the girl who i saved she bawled a good long time zedd was incredulous she beat the girl why for letting the keeper use her to bring forth the use of the gift adie sighed the girl and i had known each other had been friends of a sort she never spoke to me again adie hugged her arms across her stomach and then grandmother lindel stripped me naked in front of those men and switched me until i was covered with welts and blood i screamed more than the girl had in the fire then she marched me naked and bloody through the town to her house the humiliation be worse than the beating when we got to her house i asked how she could be so of hers still on her face and then she said though you be wild of spirit child you have worked to tame it the people have asked for your oath and you have given it may i not live to see you break it you owe no debt beyond that i will take care of the circle and see to mathrin galliene you will wed pell i wept into the hem of her dress adie was silent staring into the fire lost in the memories zedd lifted an eyebrow well did you wed your love yes she whispered in her soft rasp she took the spoon off its hook and stirred the stew while zedd watched her at last she hung it back at its place for three months i thought life be beyond bliss her mouth worked soundlessly as she stared into nothingness zedd put an arm around her shoulder and gently led her back to the table sit adie let me bring you a cup of tea she was still sitting her hands folded together on the table staring off when he returned with the steaming cups he placed one in her thin hands as he sat opposite her he didnt press her to go on before she was ready at last she did one day the day of my birth and nineteen years pell and i had taken a walk in the country i be with child she lifted the cup in both hands and took a sip we spent the day walking past farms thinking of names for our child holding hands and well you know the foolishness of love at that age on our way back we had to walk past the choora mill just outside of town i thought it strange no one be there someone always be at the mill adie closed her eyes for a moment and then took another sip of tea as it turned out there be people there the blood of the fold they be waiting for us zedd knew of them in the larger cities of nicobarese the blood of the fold were an organized corps of men who hunted banelings rooted out evil as they saw it in other lands there were men like them who went by other names but they were the same none were especially picky about proof a corpse was the only proof they need show of their job well done if they said the body was that of a baneling then it was in the smaller towns the blood were usually selfappointed toughs and thugs the blood of the fold were widely feared with good reason they took us her voice broke but only that once into separate rooms in the bottom of the mill it be dark and smelled of the damp stone walls and grain dust i did not know what be done to pell i be almost too terrified to breathe mathrin galliene said pell and i be banelings he said i would not wed as i should have because i wished to bring the keepers notice to choora there be a sickness a fever in the country that summer and it brought death to many a family mathrin galliene said pell and i brought the sickness i denied it be so and spoke the oath to show proof adie turned the cup in her fingers as she stared at it zedd touched her hand drink adie it will help you he had put a pinch of cloud leaf into her tea to help relax her she took a long swallow mathrin galliene said pell and i be banelings and the graveyard be full of the proof of that he said he wanted only for pell and i to tell the truth to confess the other men of the blood be growling like hounds around a rabbit ready to tear us apart i be terrified for pell as they beat me i knew they would be doing worse to him to make him name me a baneling nothing be better for the blood than to have someone name a loved one as a baneling they would not listen when i denied it she looked up into his eyes they would not listen anything you said zedd offered quietly would have made no difference adie it wouldnt have mattered when you are in a leghold trap reasoning with the steel does no good she nodded i know her face was a calm mask over a thunderhead i could have stopped it had i used the gift but it be against everything i be taught believed it be as if using the gift would prove to myself that what the men said be true i felt it would have been blasphemy against the creator i be as helpless while the men beat me as if i did not have the gift she drained the tea from her cup even as i screamed i could hear pells screams echoing from another room zedd went to the fire and brought the pot back filling her cup again it wasnt your fault adie dont blame yourself she flicked a glance up at him as he poured himself another cup they wanted me to name pell as a baneling i told them i would not that they could kill me but they could not make me say that it be so mathrin bent close to me put his face close to mine in my head i can still see his smile he said i believe you girl but it doesnt matter because it not be you we want to name the baneling it be pell we want to speak the name of the baneling it be you we want pell to name you be the baneling then the men held me down mathrin tried to pour something down my throat it burned my mouth he held my nose it be swallow or drown i wished to drown but i swallowed without wanting to it burned my throat like swallowing fire i could not speak i could not make a sound i could not even scream no sound be there only burning pain more pain than i had ever known she took a sip of tea as if to soothe her throat then the men took me in the room with pell and tied me to a chair in front of him mathrin held me by my hair so i could not move it broke my heart to see what they had done to my pell his face be white as snow they had cut off most of his fingers one knuckle at a time her own fingers tightened around her cup as she stared into the vision mathrin told pell that i had confessed that pell be a baneling pells eyes be big looking at me i tried to scream that it not be true but no sound came i tried to shake my head that it not be true but mathrin held me so i could not pell told them he did not believe them they cut off another finger they told him they only do it because i named him only do it on my word pell kept his eyes on me as he shook and kept telling them he did not believe them they told pell i had told them i wished him to be killed because he be a baneling still pell said he did not believe them he said he loved me then he told pell i had named him a baneling and that if it not be so i could deny it and they would let us both go free he told pell that i had promised i would not deny it because he be a baneling and i wanted him to die for it pell screamed for me to tell them screamed for me to deny it he screamed my name screamed for me to say something i tried but i could say nothing my throat be fire my voice did not work mathrin held me by my hair i could not move pells eyes be big as he stared at me as i sat silent then pell spoke to me how could you do that to me adie how could you name me a baneling then he cried mathrin asked him to name me a baneling he said that if he did they would believe him over me because i had the gift and he would be freed pell whispered i will not say that of her to save my life even though she has betrayed me those words broke my heart as she stared off at nothing zedd noticed a candle on the counter behind her melt into a puddle he could feel the waves of power radiating from her he realized he was holding his breath he eased it out mathrin cut pells throat she said simply he severed pells head and held it before me he said he wanted me to see what following the keeper had brought on pell he said it be the last thing he wanted me to ever see the men held my head back and pulled my eyes open mathrin poured the burning liquid in them i be blinded in that moment something happened inside me my pell was gone he died thinking i had betrayed him my life was about to end i suddenly realized how it be my own fault for holding to an oath the life of my love for an ignorant oath for a foolish superstition nothing mattered anymore everything be gone to me i turned the gift loose turned the rage loose i broke my oath not to use the gift to harm another i could not see but i could hear i could hear their blood hit the stone walls i struck out wildly i shredded every living thing in that room be it man or mouse i could not see so i simply struck at any life i could feel i could not tell if any had escaped in a way i be glad to be blind or seeing what i be doing i might have stopped before i finished when all be still dead i felt my way around the room counting the bodies one be missing i crawled to my grandmother lindels how i made my way i cannot imagine except to think the gift guided me when she saw me she be furious she pulled me to my feet and demanded to know if i had broken my oath zedd leaned forward but you couldnt speak how did you answer adie smiled a small cold smile i picked her up by the throat with the power of the gift and slammed her against the wall i walked up to her and nodded my head i squeezed her throat in anger she fought me she fought me with all her power but i be stronger much stronger i never knew until that moment that the gift be different in different people she be as helpless as a stick doll but i could not hurt her as much as i wished to for her asking that question before any other i released her and sagged to the floor i could stand no longer she came to me and began tending to my wounds she told me i had done wrong by breaking my oath but that what was done to me was a more grievous wrong i never feared grandmother lindel again not because she be helping me but because i had broken the oath i be beyond the laws i had been taught and because i knew i was stronger than she from that day on she be afraid of me i think she helped me because she wanted me well so i could leave a few days later grandmother lindel came home to tell me that she had been called before the kings circle and questioned she said all the men at the mill all the blood of the fold be dead except mathrin he had escaped she told the circle she had not seen me they believed her or said they did because they did not want to confront her and additionally a sorceress who had killed that many men in such a shocking manner so they let her go about her business some of the tension seemed to ease from her shoulders she studied the teacup a moment and then took another sip she held the cup out for him to warm zedd poured a little more he idly wished he had put some of the powdered cloud leaf in his own tea he didnt think that was the end of the story i lost my child adie said in a soft rasp zedd looked up im sorry adie she looked up to meet his eyes i know she took one of his hands in both hers after he set down the kettle i know she took her hands back my throat healed she touched her fingers lightly to her neck then knitted them together but it left me with a voice like dragging iron over rock he smiled at her i like your voice iron fits the rest of you the ghost of a smile passed across her face my eyes though did not grow better i be blind grandmother lindel not be as strong as me but she be old and had seen many a trick with the gift she taught me to see without my eyes she taught me to see with the gift it not be the same as eyes but in some ways it be better in some ways i see more after i be healed grandmother lindel wanted me to leave she not be fond of living with one who had broken the oath even though i be of her blood she feared i would bring trouble whether from the keeper for breaking my oath or from the blood of the fold she did not know but she feared trouble would come because of me zedd leaned back in his chair stretching his tense muscles a bit and did trouble come oh yes adie hissed raising her eyebrows as she leaned forward trouble came mathrin galliene brought them twenty blood of the fold ones paid by the crown professionals battlehard men big men grimfaced savage men all pretty on horseback in neat ranks with swords shields and banners every spear held just so at the same angle all pretty in their chain mail and polished breastplates shining with the embossed crest of the crown and all wearing helmets with red plumes that flicked as they rode every horse white i stood on the porch and watched with the eyes of the gift as they spread rank before me with perfect precision like they be performing for the king himself every horse put every foot the same stopping in a line at the lifting of a finger from the commander they be spread out before me ready eager to do their grisly duty mathrin waited behind them on his horse watching the commander called out to me you be under arrest as a baneling and are to be executed as such adie lifted her head from the specters of her memory her eyes meeting zedds i thought of pell my pell her expression hardened into an iron mask not one sword cleared a scabbard not one spear be leveled not one foot touched the ground before they died i swept the line from left to right one man at a time everything i had into each in turn quick as a thought thump thump thump every one except the commander he sat still and stonefaced upon his white horse as men in armor crashed to the ground to each side of him when it be finished when the last shield had clattered into silence i met his eyes armor i told him be of no use against a true baneling or a sorceress it only be of use against innocent people then i told him he was to deliver a message to the king for me from one sorceress named adie in a calm firm voice he asked the message i said tell him that if he sends another of the blood of the fold to take me it will be the last living order he ever gives he looked at me for a moment without a hint of emotion in his cold eyes and then he turned his horse and walked it away without looking back her gaze sank to the table my grandmother turned her back to me she told me to leave the shelter of her roof and never to return a little wince touched zedds face before he caught it at the thought of a sorceress with enough power to kill men in that fashion it was exceedingly rare for a sorceress to be that strong in the gift what of mathrin you didnt kill him she shook her head a humorless smile played across her lips no i took him with me took him with you i bonded him to me bonded his life to mine bonded him so that he always knew where i be and so that every new moon he was compelled to come to me no matter where i be no matter what he wished he had to follow me at least close enough so that he could come to me every new moon frowning zedd studied the dregs in his tea cup i met a man once in winstead the capital and crown seat of kelton his name was mathrin he was a beggar missing the fingers on one hand as i recall he was blind his eyes had been zedds eyes suddenly fixed on hers she was watching him his eyes had been gouged out adie nodded indeed they had her face was iron again every new moon he came to me and i cut something off him letting his screams try to fill the emptiness in me zedd leaned back his hands pressed to the tabletop iron indeed so you made a new home in kelton no i made no home i traveled seeking out women with the gift ones who could help me in my studies none knew very much of what i sought but each knew at least a little that others did not mathrin followed and every new moon he came to me and i cut something else from him i wanted him to live forever to suffer forever he be the one who beat me down there with his fists so i would lose pells child he be the one who killed pell he be the one who blinded me her white eyes shone red in the lamplight as she stared off again he be the one who made pell believe i had betrayed him i wanted mathrin galliene to suffer forever zedd gestured vaguely with his hand how long did he last adie sighed not long enough and too long zedd frowned one day a thought occurred to me i had never used the gift to prevent mathrin from killing himself why would he still come to me let me make him to suffer like i did why would he not simply end it so the next time he came and i cut something else off i also cut the bond cut his need to come the next time but i did it in a way so as he would not notice so he could simply forget about me if he wished so that was the last you saw of him she gave a grim shake of her head no i thought it would be but he returned with the next new moon returned when he neednt have it made my blood run cold to wonder why i decided that it be time for him to pay with his life for what he had done to me and pell and all the others but i resolved that before he gave me his life he would give me the answer in my travels i had learned many things things for which i thought i would never have use that night i found use i used them to learn what torture mathrin feared above all others the trick be used to learn fears but be useless to learn other secrets against his will the words tumbled out of him his fears spilled out i left him to sweat all that night and the whole next day while i went in search of the things i needed the things he feared above all else when i finally returned with them he be nearly insane with fright his fears be well founded i asked him to confess his secret he said no i dumped out the sack put the little cages and the other things in front of him as he sat naked and helpless on the floor i picked up each held it before his sightless face and described it told him what be in each little cage or basket or jar again i asked him to confess he be sweating and panting and shaking but he said no mathrin thought i be bluffing that i did not have the courage mathrin be wrong i steeled myself and brought his worst fears to life for him zedds brow bunched up into wrinkles curiosity won out over dread what did you do she lifted her head to look into his eyes that be the one thing i will not tell you it not be important anyway mathrin would not talk and suffered so much that i almost stopped several times each time i wanted to stop i thought about the last thing my eyes had seen before he blinded me pells head held in mathrins fist before me adie swallowed her voice so low zedd could hardly hear her and i remembered pells last words i will not say that of her to save my life even though she has betrayed me she closed her eyes for a moment they came open and she went on mathrin be on the edge of death i thought he was not going to tell me why he came to me but just before he died he became still despite what was being done to him and then he said he would tell me because he be about to die because this too had been by plan i asked him again why he had come back he leaned toward me dont you know adie he asked me dont you know what i be i be a baneling i have been hiding right under your nose all this time you have kept me near you all this time and the keeper knew right where you be the keeper lusts for those with the gift above all else i had thought that that be it that he be a baneling i told him he had failed it had done him no good as he be about to die for his crimes he smiled at me she leaned forward smiled and he said you be wrong adie i have not failed i have done the keepers bidding i have fulfilled my task perfectly all this be by plan i have made you do exactly as he wished i shall be rewarded i be the one who started the fire when you be little i be the one who did those things to pell not because i thought him or you a baneling i be the baneling i did it to make you break your oath to make you welcome the keepers hate into your heart breaking your oath be the first step and look what you have done since look at what you be doing right now look at how far you have slipped toward him you be within his grasp now you may not have given him your oath but you do his bidding you have become what you hate you have become me you be a baneling the keeper smiles upon you adie and thanks you for welcoming him into your heart mathrin slumped and fell back dead adie dissolved into tears her head sagging into her hands zedd unlocked his joints and swept around the table holding her to him as he stood next to her holding her head against his stomach stroking her hair comforting her as she cried not so dear lady not so at all she wept against his robes shaking her head you think you be so smart wizard you not be so smart as you think you be wrong about this zedd knelt beside her chair holding her hands in his looking up into her stricken face im smart enough to know that the keeper or one of his minions would not let you have the satisfaction of knowing you had won a battle against him but i you fought back you struck out from your hurt not for a lust of the things you did not for a want to help the keeper her brow wrinkled together with her effort to stop the tears you be so sure sure enough to trust one such as i zedd smiled im sure i may not know everything but i know you are no baneling you are the victim not the criminal she shook her head i not be so sure as you after mathrin died did you go on killing seeking vengeance against any innocent no of course not had you been an agent you would have given yourself over to the keeper to his wishes and gone on to hurt those who fought him you are no baneling dear lady my heart weeps for the things the keeper took from you but he did not take your soul that is still yours put those fears aside he held her hands and gave them soft squeezes she didnt try to take her hands back but let them stay in his as if to soak up the comfort as they trembled adie wiped the tears from her cheek pour me some more tea but no more powdered cloud leaf or i will fall asleep before i can finish the story zedd arched an eyebrow she had known what he had done he patted her shoulder as he rose to his feet he poured her tea and then pulled his chair forward and sat again while she sipped after she drank half of her cup she looked to have regained her control the war with dhara be burning hot but it be near the end i felt the boundary go up felt it come into this world so you came here right after the boundary went up no i studied with a few women first some taught me a few things about bones she pulled a little necklace from under her robes she fingered the small round bone with red and yellow beads to each side it was just like the one she had given him to get him through the pass he still wore it around his neck this be a bone from the base of a skull like that on the shelf over there the one that fell on the floor the beast be called a skrin skrin be guardian beasts to the underworld something like the heart hounds except they guard in both directions the best way to explain it is that they be part of the veil though that not be accurate in this world they be solid have form but in the other they be only a force zedd frowned force adie held out her spoon and let it drop on the table force we cannot see it but force be there it makes the spoon drop and keeps it from flying up into the air it cannot be seen but it be there something like that with the skrin on rare occasions in their duty to repel all from the cusp where the world of the living and the world of the dead touch they be pulled into this world few people know of them because it so rarely happens zedd was frowning it be very complex i will explain it better another time the important thing be that this bone from the skrin hides you from them adie took a sip of her tea while zedd pulled his necklace out of his robes taking a new look at it and it must hide you from other beasts too to get through the pass she nodded how did you know about the pass i put the boundary up and i didnt know the pass existed she turned the teacup around and around in her fingers after i left my grandmother i sought out women with the gift women who could teach me things about the world of the dead after mathrin died i studied harder with more urgency each woman could tell me only what small bit she knew but they usually knew one who knew more i traveled the midlands going among them gathering knowledge i collected all those bits of knowledge piecing them together in this manner i learned a little of how the worlds interact by putting up a boundary across parts of this world it be a little like stoppering up a teakettle and then putting it on the fire without a vent something will blow off i knew that if there be magic wise enough to know how to bring the underworld into this it must have a way to equalize each side of the boundary a vent of some sort a pass zedd lifted an eyebrow staring off into his thoughts as he drew his thumb down his chin of course that makes sense balance all force all magic must be balanced he focused his eyes on her when i brought up the boundary i was using magic i didnt fully understand it was in an ancient book from the wizards of old who had more power than i can fathom using their instructions to bring up the boundary was an act of desperation it be hard for me to imagine you being desperate sometimes thats all life is one desperate act after another adie nodded perhaps you be right i was desperate to hide from the keeper i remembered what mathrin had said he be hiding right under my nose i reasoned that the safest place for me to hide from the keeper would be where he wouldnt look right under his nose right at the edge of his world so i came to the pass the pass did not be this world yet it did not be the underworld either it be a mix of both a place where both worlds boiled together a little bit with the bones i be able to hide from the keeper he and the beasts from his world could not see me hide the woman had more iron in her than the kettle hanging on the fire if he knew adie there was more to it zedd gave her a stern stare you came here simply to hide she averted her eyes as she fingered the small round bone on her necklace and then at last tucked it back into her robes there be another reason i made an oath to myself i swore i would find a way to contact my pell to tell him i did not betray him she took a long swallow of tea i have spent most of my life here in the pass trying to find a way to reach into the world of the dead to tell him the pass be part of that world zedd pushed at his cup with a finger the boundary the pass is gone adie i need your help in this world she laid her arms on the table when you grew my foot back for me it brought back everything that had happened made it fresh as if i be reliving it it made me remember some things i had forgotten for a long time it made me remember hurts that still be there though time had dimmed them im sorry adie he whispered i should have taken your past into consideration but i didnt suspect you had lived through that much pain forgive me there be nothing to forgive you gave me a gift by giving me my foot back you did not know the things i have done it not be your fault i did them you did not know i be a baneling he cast her a harsh glare you think that because you have fought back against wickedness you have become wicked i have done worse than a man like you can understand zedd nodded slightly is that so let me tell you a little story i had a love once like your pell her name was erilyn my time with her was like your time with pell a slow smile came to his lips as his memory touched the mist of those pleasant times the smile withered until panis rahl sent a quad after her adie reached out and laid a hand on his zedd you do not need to zedd brought his other fist down on the table making the cups jump you cant imagine what the four of them did to her he leaned forward his face standing out red against his white hair he ground his teeth together i hunted them down what i did to each of them would make whatever you did to mathrin seem a lark i went after panis rahl but couldnt reach him so i went after his armies for every man you killed adie i killed a thousand even my own side feared me i was the wind of death i did what was needed to stop panis rahl and maybe more he settled his weight back in the chair if there is such a thing as a man of virtue you do not sit with him now you did only what you had to that does not diminish your virtue he arched an eyebrow wise words spoken by a wise woman perhaps you should listen to them she remained silent he put his elbows on the table and idly picked up the cup rolling it in his palms as he went on in a way i was luckier than you i had more time with my erilyn and i didnt lose my daughter panis rahl did not try to kill your daughter too yes indeed he thought he had i cast a death spell to make them think they had seen her death it was the only way to protect her to keep them from trying until they succeeded a death spell adie whispered a benediction in her native tongue that be a dangerous web i would not reproach you for doing such a thing you had cause but such a thing does not go unnoticed by the spirits you be lucky it worked and it saved her you be very fortunate the good spirits be with you on that day i guess sometimes its hard to tell which side of luck youre looking at i raised her without a mother she had grown into a fine young woman when it happened darken rahl had been standing next to his father when i sent the wizards fire through the boundary he was standing next to his father when my fire found him some of it burned darken rahl he spent his growing years learning so he could finish what his father had started and extract his vengeance he learned how to cross the boundary he was coming into the midlands and i never knew he raped my daughter he didnt know who she was everyone thought my daughter was dead or he would have killed her sure but he hurt her he pressed his palms together the cup shattered he turned his hands up to see if they had been cut and was a little surprised they werent adie said nothing after that i took her to westland to hide to protect her i never knew if it was more of that bad luck or if somehow wickedness found her but she died burned to death in her house though i always suspected the irony was more than coincidence i never found proof it was so perhaps after all the good spirits hadnt been with me on the day i cast her death spell i be sorry zedd adie said in a soft rasp he waved off her pity with a flourish of his hand i still had her boy with the side of his finger he pushed the shards of the cup into a little pile in the center of the wooden tabletop darken rahls son the spawn of an agent of the keeper but my daughters son too and my grandson innocent of the crimes that brought him to be a fine boy he looked up at her from under his bushy eyebrows i believe you know him his name is richard adie lurched forward in her chair richard richard is your she leaned back shaking her head wizards and their secrets she scowled a little but then softened her expression perhaps you had just cause for a secret such as this does richard have the gift zedd lifted his eyebrows as he nodded indeed he does that was one reason i hid him in westland i feared he had the gift though i wasnt sure and i wanted him to be safe from danger as you said the keeper lusts for those with the gift more than any other i knew that if i began teaching him used magic very much myself the gaze of danger would settle on him i wanted to let him grow become strong of character before i tested him and if he had the gift taught him i had always suspected he had the gift sometimes i hoped he did not but i now know he does he used it to stop darken rahl used magic he leaned forward i suspect he has the gift from both his grandfather and his father from two different lines of wizards i see was all she said but we have more important things to worry about right now darken rahl used the boxes of orden he opened one the wrong one for him anyway but maybe the wrong one for us too there are books back at the keep that speak of it they warn that if the boxes are used if the magic of orden is used and even if the person who put them in play makes a mistake and it kills him it can still tear the veil adie i dont know as much about the underworld as you you have been studying it most of your life i need your help i need you to come to aydindril with me to study the books to see what can be done ive read many of them and dont understand much of their meaning perhaps you will even if you only see one thing i miss it could be important she stared at the table with a bitter expression i be an old woman i be an old woman who has welcomed the keeper into my heart zedd watched her but she didnt meet his eyes he pushed his chair back and stood an old woman no a foolish woman maybe she didnt reply her gaze stayed pointedly on the table zedd strolled across the room and inspected the bones hanging on the wall he clasped his hands behind his back as he studied the talismans of the dead maybe i am just an old man then hmm a foolish old man maybe i should let a young man do this work he glanced over his shoulder she was watching him but if a young man is good then even younger would be better in fact why not let a child do it that would be better yet maybe there is a tenyearoldboy somewhere who will be willing to do something to stop the dead from swallowing the living he threw his hands up in the air according to you it would seem knowledge is of no use only youth now you are being foolish old man you know what i mean zedd stepped back to the table and gave a shrug of his bony shoulders if you just sit here in this house instead of helping with what you know then you might as well be the thing you fear most an agent of the keeper he put his knuckles to the table and glowered as he leaned over her if you dont fight him then you help him that is what his plan has been all along not to turn you to him but to make you fear stopping him she looked into his eyes uneasiness stealing into her expression what do you mean he has already done all he needed adie he made you afraid of yourself the keeper has an eternity of patience he doesnt need you to work for him it takes effort to turn one with the gift you werent worth the trouble he needed only for you not to work against him he did all that was necessary he didnt waste an effort to do more in some ways he is as blind to this world as we are to his he has only so much influence here he must choose his tasks carefully he doesnt spend what power he has here frivolously realization took the place of unease perhaps you not be such an old fool zedd smiled as he pulled the chair forward and sat that has always been my opinion hands nestled in her lap adie studied the tabletop as if hoping it would come to her aid the house was silent except for the slow crackle of the fire in the hearth all these years the truth be hiding right under my nose she lifted her head giving him a puzzled frown how did you come to be so wise zedd shrugged but one of the advantages of having lived so long you view yourself as just an old woman i see a striking dear lady who has learned much in her time in this world and has gained wisdom from what she has seen he pulled the yellow rose from her hair and held it before her your loveliness is not a mask layered over a rotten core it blossoms from the beauty inside she lifted the flower from his fingers and laid it on the table your clever tongue cannot cover the fact that i have wasted my life zedd shook his head cutting her off no you have wasted nothing you simply have not seen the other side of things yet in magic in all things there is a balance if we look for it the keeper did as he did sending a baneling to you to keep you from interfering in his work and to plant a seed of doubt in you that would perhaps turn you to him one day but in that too there was something to balance what he did you came here to learn about the world of the dead in order to contact your pell dont you see adie you were manipulated to prevent you from interfering with the keepers plans but in so doing the balance is that you have learned things that might be of aid in stopping him you must not surrender to what he had done to you you must strike back with what he has inadvertently given you her eyes glistened as she cast her gaze about her house looking to the bone pile the walls covered with talismans of the dead she had collected over the years and to the shelves holding more yet but my oath my pell i must reach him tell him he died thinking i betrayed him if i cannot redeem myself in his eyes then i be lost my heart be lost if i be lost then the keeper will find me pell is dead adie gone the boundary the pass is gone you would know better than i if it would have ever been any use in what you wanted but in all these years you have not found a way to make it so if you wish to continue the pursuit of your oath you will find no help here perhaps in aydindril you will helping to stop the keeper does not mean you must break your oath to yourself if my knowledge and help can be of any aid in what you seek i offer it gladly just as you know things i do not i know things you dont i am after all the first wizard perhaps what i know will help you pell would not want you to bring him your message that you did not betray him if it meant you must betray everyone else adie picked up the yellow flower twirling it between her finger and thumb a moment before setting it down again gripping the edge of the table she pushed herself to her feet she stood a moment and then lifted her head to gaze with her white eyes around the room once more smoothing her robes at her hips as if to make herself presentable she limped around the table to stand behind his chair zedd felt her hands rest on his shoulders unexpectedly she leaned over and kissed the top of his head and smoothed his unruly hair with gentle fingers zedd was relieved the fingers hadnt gone around his throat he thought they might after some of the things he had said thank you my friend for hearing my tale and for helping me to find the meaning in it my pell would have liked you you both be men of honor i accept your word that you will help me tell my pell zedd twisted around in his chair and raised his face to her soft smile and kind eyes i will do whatever i can to help you keep your oath you have my oath on that her smile widened as she smoothed down a stray lock of his white hair now tell me of the stone of tears we must decide what is to be done with it chapter the stone of tears well it is hidden she gave a single firm nod good it not be something to be loose in this world her brow wrinkled in a little frown it be hidden well it be safe zedd winced a little he didnt want to tell her he knew what she would say but he had promised i put it on a chain put it on a chain and hung it around the neck of a little girl i dont know exactly where she is right now you touched it adies eyes widened the stone of tears you touched it and hung it around the neck of a little girl she gripped his chin firmly in her suddenly powerful fingers and leaned close to his face you have hung the stone of tears the stone that it be told was hung by the creator himself around the keepers neck to lock him in the underworld you hung that around a little girls neck and let her wander off zedd scowled defensively well i had to do something with it i couldnt just leave it lying about adie smacked the palm of her hand to her forehead just as he makes me think him wise he shows me he be a fool indeed dear spirits save me from the hands you have placed me in zedd shot to his feet and just what would you have done with it well i would have certainly given it more thought than you seem to have done and i wouldnt have touched it it be a thing from another world she turned her back to him shaking her head and whispering things in her foreign tongue zedd shifted his robes straightening them with a firm tug i didnt have the luxury of time to give it any thought we were attacked by a screeling if i had left it there adie spun around a screeling you be full of good news old man she jabbed a finger against his chest that still be no good excuse you still should not have not have what not have picked it up i should have let the screeling pick it up instead screelings be assassins they not be there to take the stone zedd jabbed a finger right back at her you know that are you so sure would you have been willing to have risked everything on it and if you were wrong let the keeper have the stone to do with as he would are you so sure adie her hand dropped to her side as she stared at his frown no i guess not it could be as you say there be a chance the screeling may have taken it perhaps you did the only thing you could do she shook the finger at him but to hang it around the neck of a little girl and where would you have had me keep it in my pocket in the pocket of a wizard in the pocket of one with the gift where the keeper is sure to look first or perhaps you would have had me hide it in a place only i knew where if a baneling gets his hands on me and somehow makes me talk i could tell him it would be so he could go and collect it adie folded her arms with a muttered curse at last her expression relaxed well perhaps perhaps nothing i had no choice it was an act of desperation i did the only thing i could do given the circumstances she let out a tired sigh then nodded you be right wizard you did the best you could have done she patted the top of his shoulder foolish as it be she added under her breath her hand gave a gentle push sit let me show you something zedd sat as he watched her limp across the room toward the shelves i would rather have done anything else adie he said sorrowfully than what i had to do she nodded as she walked i know she stopped and turned a screeling you say zedd nodded you be sure it be a screeling he arched an eyebrow yes of course you be sure her brow creased in thought screelings be the keepers assassins they be singleminded and extremely dangerous but they not be very smart they must have something to show them the one they be after a way to find them they not be good at searching in this world how could the keeper know where you be how could the screeling know to find you know it be you he be after zedd shrugged i dont know i was where the boxes had been opened but it had been some time since it had happened there would be no way to know i was still there and did you destroy the screeling yes that be good the keeper will not waste the effort to send another not after you have proven you be able to defeat it zedd threw his hands up oh yes just wonderful screelings are sent to eliminate a threat to the keeper it was probably sent to rid the keeper of my meddling just as the keeper sent a baneling to rid himself of your interference youre right he will not send another screeling now that ive proven that i can defeat one he will send something worse if indeed it be sent for you she touched a finger to her lower lip as she mumbled to herself where be the stone when you found it next to the box that had been opened and where came the screeling in the same room as the boxes as the stone she shook her head in puzzlement perhaps it could be as you say that it came to get the stone but it makes no sense for a screeling to come for the stone i wonder how he found you she limped on toward the shelves something had to guide him balancing on her toes she peered to the back of a shelf carefully pushing aside various objects at last retrieving what she sought holding it in one hand she limped back and placed it carefully on the table it was a little bigger than a hens egg round and agedarkened with a deep patina that was a brownish black in the recesses it was masterfully carved into the shape of a vicious beast all balled up but glaring with eyes that seemed to watch you no matter which way it was held it looked to be bone and very old zedd picked it up testing its weight it was much heavier than he thought it should have been whats this a woman a sorceress gave this to me when i went to her to learn she be on her deathbed she asked if i knew of the skrin i told her what i knew she sighed with relief and then said something that made my skin prickle she said she had been waiting for me as the prophecies had told her to do she placed this in my hand saying it be carved from the bone of a skrin adie flicked her hand toward the walls and then toward the bone pile i have a whole skrin here among the bones i did battle with one once in the pass his bones be here his skull be on the shelf it be the one that fell on the floor she put a thin finger on the carved bone sphere in zedds hand as she leaned toward him and lowered her raspy voice this the old one said must be guarded by one who understands she told me it be of ancient magic made by wizards of old possibly with their hand guided by the creator himself made because of prophecies she said it may be the most important thing of magic i would ever touch that it be invested with more power than she or i would ever understand she said that it be of skrin bone and of skrin force that it be a talisman that be of importance if the veil ever be in danger i asked how it was to be used how the magic worked and how it had come into her hands she be very exhausted from the excitement of my coming to her and said she must rest she told me to come back to her in the morning and she would tell me everything she knew when i returned she had died adie gave him a meaningful look her death be a little too timely to suit me zedd had had the same thought but you have no idea what it is or how it is to be used no already zedd was using magic to lift it on a cushion of air floating it in space watching it slowly spin the whole time the finely carved eyes of the beast peered back as the ball revolved before him have you tried using any magic on it i be afraid to try zedd held his bony hands to each side of the floating carving probing gently with different kinds of force different sorts of magic letting them shift and slide over the round bone testing searching gingerly for a crack a shield a trigger it had the oddest feel to it the magic reflected back as if it had touched nothing as if the thing werent there at all perhaps it could be a shield he had never seen before he increased the force it slipped against the carving like new shoe leather on ice adie wrung her hands i do not think you should be the flame of the lamp puffed out a thin thread of greasy smoke curled from the abruptly dead wick the room was left to the flickering shadows cast from the fire in the hearth zedd frowned at the dark lamp a sudden crash brought both their heads jerking around the skull rolled across the floor toward where they sat halfway there it wobbled and rocked to a stop right side up empty eye sockets stared up at the two of them long fangs rested on the wood floor the carved bone ball thumped to the table bouncing twice as zedd and adie came to their feet what foolish thing did you do old man zedd stared at the skull i didnt do anything more bones tumbled from the shelves bones hanging on the wall clattered to the floor some bouncing and flipping back into the air as they struck zedd and adie both turned to a racket behind them the bone pile rattled apart bones toppling and spilling over one another as the pile pulled itself apart some of the bones as if alive slid or rolled across the floor toward the skull sliding along the floor a rib bone caught the leg of a chair and spun around but continued on zedd twisted to adie but she was hurrying to the shelf above the counter behind the table the one covered with the blueandwhitestriped cloth adie what are you doing whats going on bones collected in increasing number around the skull she yanked the cloth away ripping it from its hooks leave before it be too late whats going on jars and tins clanged together as she shoved them aside she pushed her hand farther along the shelf fingers searching blindly canisters thudded to the floor a jar tumbled out shattering on the edge of the counter throwing sparkling shards of glass over the table and chairs a thick dark mass from the jar oozed over the edge of the counter carrying splinters of glass with it making it look like nothing more than a melting porcupine do as i say wizard leave now zedd rushed toward her glass crunching under his feet he jerked to a halt when he glanced over his shoulder toward the skull it was level with his eyes bones collecting and assembling under it as it rose into the air a few rib bones ranked themselves vertebrae slipped into line talons tipped claws leg bones erected to the side of each flank the jaw snapped into place as the skull rose toward the ceiling zedd spun toward adie snatched her by the arm yanking her toward him she came away from the counter clutching a small tin in her other hand adie whats happening her head tilted up toward the skull brushing the ceiling what do you see what do i see bags woman i see a bunch of bones come to life the shoulders of the skrin hunched as the thing grew with the addition of more bones more yet were sliding across the floor toward it adie gaped at him i dont see bones i see flesh flesh bags i thought you said you killed that thing i said i battled it i do not know that a skrin can be killed i do not think they be alive you be right about one thing wizard since you be able to defeat a screeling the keeper sent worse how did he know where we were how does the skrin know where we are all these bones are supposed to hide us i do not know i cannot understand how a skeletal arm swept toward them zedd lurched back pulling her with him yet more bones assembled adie was frantically unscrewing the tin as he dragged her around the back of the table the lid came off dropping to the floor spinning like a top the skrin lunged bringing an arm down with a loud crack the table shattered into splinters the round carved ball bounced across the floor zedd tried to snatch it with a magic but it was like trying to pinch a pumpkin seed with greased fingers he tried to scoop it up with air compressed around it but it slipped away and rolled into the corner the skrin skeleton leapt at them they both went down in a heap as he yanked her back zedd hauled her to her feet as she thrust her hand into the little tin the skrin was having trouble moving quickly it had grown too large to fit beneath the ceiling the jaws of the beast opened wide as if to roar no sound came forth but zedd could feel a blast of air it made their robes flap and fly as if in a wind adies hand came out of the tin flinging sparkling white sand at the beast sorcerers sand the fool woman had sorcerers sand the skrin staggered back a step shaking its head it recovered in an instant lurching forward again zedd unleashed a ball of fire it passed among the bones to splatter liquid flame against the far wall the tongues of flame sputtered out leaving behind a sooty splotch zedd tried air since fire didnt work it had no effect the two of them sidestepped across the room as the beast whirled to attack again zedd tried different elements of magic while he pulled adie along with him she ignored the danger as she poured the rest of the sorcerers sand into her hand when the skrin made another silent roar she flung the sand with a foreign incantation the blast of air from the roar died as she spoke the words the skrin seemed to inhale taking in the sparkling white sand the jaws snapped closed as the head drew back that be all i have she said i hope it be enough the skrin shook its head then spat out the sand in a cloud of sparkles it came for them again but when he tugged on her sleeve she yanked her arm away zedd tried sending logs and chairs flying into the bone beast trying to distract it while she scurried around behind it they simply bounced off stabbing a hand into a pocket he brought out a handful of sparkling dust of his own with a quick flick he sent it into the center of the bone collection standing before him it had no more effect than had adies sorcerers sand nothing he could do seemed to be much of a distraction and it soon turned its attention to adie she was snatching an ancient bone from the wall feathers dangled from one end strings of red and yellow beads from the other zedd grabbed a bone arm but the beast flung him away as the skrin reeled to her she shook the bone at the thing casting spells in her own tongue the skrin snapped at her she yanked her hand back just in time to save it but not the bone talisman it was splintered in half that was it he had no idea how to fight the thing and adie wasnt having any success he dove under the head toward her rolling to his feet come on we have to get out of here i cant leave there be things of great value here grab what you can were leaving get the round bone i showed you zedd tried to dodge and lunge toward the corner but the skrin snapped and swept talontipped claws at him he fought back with blasts of every kind of magic he had before he realized it he was losing ground and had nowhere to retreat adie we have to get out now we cannot leave that bone it be important for the veil she ran for the corner zedd grabbed for her but missed the skrin almost did too it caught her with a claw ripping a gash down her arm she cried out as she was flung against the wall rebounding to sprawl facedown on the floor more bones crashed down around her zedd caught a handful of the hem of her robe dragging her back as talons raked the wall just missing his head adie clawed at the floor trying to get away from him to get to the round bone in the corner the skrin reared back with a silent roar the ceiling ripped open as the beast stood to its full height huge chunks and splinters of wood rained down claws raked wildly tearing the wood of the walls fangs ripped at the roof zedd pulled adie toward the door as she fought him there be things here i must take important things it has taken me a lifetime to find them theres no time adie we cant save them now she tore away from his grasp lunging toward the bone talismans on the wall the skrin went for her zedd used magic to yank her back he grabbed her in both arms and fell backward with her through the doorway just as a claw splintered it they rolled to their feet zedd scrambled into a run pulling her along as she fought him she tried using magic on him but he shielded against it the night air was frigid clouds of their breath streamed away with the cold wind as they both ran and fought each other adie wailed like a mother watching her child being slaughtered her arms one soaked with blood stretched toward the house please my things i must not leave them you do not understand they be important magic the skrin tore at the walls to get out to get at the two of them adie he pulled her face close to his they are no good to you dead we will come back for them after we get away from that thing her chest heaved tears welled up in her eyes please zedd please my bones you dont understand they be important they have magic they may help us to close the veil if they fall into the wrong hands zedd whistled for the horse he was moving again pulling her along with him she protested every step of the way zedd please dont do this dont leave them adie if we die we cant help anyone the horse galloped up skidding to a stop her wide eyes rolled in near panic as she saw the thing pulling itself through the walls of the house splintering and snapping boards and beams she gave a frightened scream but held her ground as zedd gripped her mane and threw himself on her back hauling adie up behind go fly like the wind girl hooves flung chunks of dirt and moss high into the air as the horse leapt out fangs snapping at her flanks zedd crouched forward adie clutching him around the waist as they galloped into the darkness the skrin wasnt ten strides behind and looked to be as fast as the horse at least it wasnt faster zedd could hear the teeth snapping the horse squealed when they did stretching to run with everything she had he wondered who could run the longest the horse or the skrin and he was afraid he knew the answer chapter richards eyes opened i think someone is coming sister verna was sitting on the other side of the small fire writing in the little book she kept tucked behind her belt she looked up from under her eyebrows you have touched your han yes no he admitted his legs ached he must have been sitting without moving for at least an hour but im telling you i think someone is coming they did this every night and it was no different this time he would sit and picture the sword on a blank background and try to reach that place within himself that she said was there but he could not find while she watched him or wrote in her little book or touched her own han he had not visualized the sword on a black square with a white border since the first night he had no desire to chance revisiting that nightmare i am beginning to think im not able to touch my han im trying my best but it just isnt working she drew the book close to her face in the moonlight and resumed writing i have told you before richard it is something that takes time you have not yet begun to have had enough practice do not be discouraged it comes when it comes sister verna im telling you someone is coming she kept writing and if you are not able to touch your han richard how would you know this hmm i dont know he raked his fingers through his hair ive spent a lot of time alone in the woods sometimes i can just feel when someone is near dont you ever know when someone is near havent you ever felt someones eyes on you only with the aid of my han she said as she wrote he watched as firelight flickered across her dispassionate face sister verna you said we were in dangerous lands im telling you someone is coming she leafed back through the book squinting as she read in the dim light and how long have you known this richard i told you as soon as i had the feeling just a moment ago she lowered the book to her lap and looked up but you say you did not touch your han you felt nothing within yourself you felt no power saw no light did not sense the creator her eyes narrowed you had better not be lying to me richard you had better never lie to me about touching your han sister verna youre not listening someone is coming she closed the book richard i have known since you began your practice that someone approaches he stared at her in surprise then why are we just sitting here we are not just sitting here you are practicing reaching your han and im tending to my business why havent you said anything you told me this land is dangerous sister verna sighed and began tucking her book back behind her wide belt because they were still some distance off there was nothing else for us to do but to continue you need the practice you must keep trying until you are able to touch your han she shook her head with resignation but i suppose you are too agitated now to continue they are still ten or fifteen minutes away we may as well begin packing our things why now why didnt we leave as soon as you sensed them because we had been spotted once we have been discovered there is no way to escape these people this is their land we would not be able to outrun them its probably a sentinel who has found us then why do you want to pack to leave now she regarded him as if he were hopelessly thick because we cant spend the night here after we kill them richard leapt to his feet kill them you dont even know who is coming and already you plan to kill them sister verna stood drawing herself up straight and peered into his eyes richard i have done my best to prevent this have we seen anyone else before now no even though these people cover this land like a swarm of angry ants we have seen no one i have led us between anyone i could sense with my han in an effort to avoid contact i have done my best to avoid trouble sometimes even when you do your best trouble cannot be avoided i do not want to kill these people but they are intent on killing us that certainly explained why they had been traveling such a peculiar route although they had been heading steadily southeast for weeks they had done so in an odd fashion without ever explaining she had directed them first one way then another occasionally backtracking but always relentlessly southeast the barren land had become progressively rockier and more desolate he had not bothered asking about their route because he didnt think she would tell him and because he didnt care wherever they went he was still a prisoner richard scratched his new beard as he started kicking dirt over the fire it was a warm night as most had been lately he wondered what had happened to winter we dont even know who they are yet you cant just go killing anyone that shows up richard she clasped her hands together not all the sisters who try to return are successful many are killed trying to cross these lands in every case there were three sisters i am but one not good odds the horses nickered and began moving about tossing their heads and pawing their hooves richard strapped the baldric over his shoulder he checked that the sword was clear in its scabbard you were wrong sister not to try to get away as soon as you knew if you have to fight it should be because there is no other way you didnt even try hands still clasped together she watched him her voice was soft but firm these people are intent upon killing us richard both of us if we had tried to run this one would have alerted the others and brought hundreds thousands to bring us down i have not run so as to embolden this one into trying to take us himself so we can end the threat im not killing people for you sister verna as they glared at each other he heard a scream a womans scream he stared out into the night trying to see into the shadows of the rocky spires trying to see where the scream came from he couldnt see anyone but the screams and cries were coming closer richard kicked dirt over the last of the flames and sprinted to the horses calming them with reassuring words and gentle strokes he didnt care what she said he wasnt killing people on her word the woman was crazy not to want to try to escape she probably wanted a fight just to see what he would do she was always watching him as if he were a bug in a box she questioned him every time he practiced trying to touch his han whatever the han was he hadnt been able to sense it much less touch it or call it forth just as well as far as he was concerned richard was starting toward the saddlebags to gather the rest of their things when a woman came running out of the night cloak flying behind and crying in terror she ran headlong into their camp she let out a wail and dashed desperately for him please she cried out please help me please dont let them get me her loose hair streamed behind as she ran the naked fear on her face ran a shiver up richards spine she stumbled as she reached him richard caught her frail form in his arms her dirty face was streaked with sweat and tears please sir she sobbed looking up at him with dark eyes please dont let them get me you dont know what those men will do to me richards mind filled with the fright of remembering kahlan being pursued by the quads he remembered how terrified she had been of those men and how she had spoken almost the same words you dont know what those men will do to me no one is going to get you you are safe now the womans arms came out from under her cloak slipping around him her dark eyes stayed on his as he held her weight she opened her mouth as if to speak but instead gave a little grunt and jerked light seemed to flash from within her eyes she went slack and heavy in his arms richard looked up into sister vernas unwavering gaze as she yanked the silver knife from the womans back richard felt himself letting the dead weight slip to the ground the woman slumped fluidly and rolled onto her back the night air rang with the sound of steel as richard drew the sword whats the matter with you he hissed you have just murdered this woman sister verna returned his glare in kind i thought you said you held no foolish prohibitions against killing women the wrath of the swords magic pounded through him raging to be set free you are mad he was rushing toward a lethal precipice the swords point rose in anger before you would think to kill me sister verna said in a measured tone you had better make sure you are not making a mistake richard didnt answer he was incapable of speaking through the fury look in her hand richard he looked down at the lifeless body her hands were covered by her heavy woolen cloak using the sword he flicked the cloak back off her arm to reveal a knife still gripped in her dead fist the point had a dark stain on it did she scratch you with the knife richards chest still heaved with anger no why her knife is coated with poison all it would take is a scratch what makes you think it was meant for me she was probably hoping to defend herself from the men who are chasing her there are no men chasing her she is a sentry you are always telling me to stop treating you like a child richard stop acting like one i know about these people how they do things she meant to kill us he could feel the muscles in his jaw flex as he gritted his teeth we could have tried to get away when she first spotted us she nodded yes and we would have died i am telling you richard i know these people the wilds are layered like an onion with different peoples all of whom will kill us if they find us had we let her reach her kind they would have caught us and killed us dont let the anger of your sword close your eyes she has a poison knife in her hand she had it to your back and she fell into your arms to be able to get close enough to use it you foolishly let her do so she turned a little and swept an arm behind where are the ones chasing her she let the arm drop to her side there is no one else i could sense them with my han if there were she was alone i have just saved your life he drove the sword of truth back into its scabbard you have done me no great favor sister verna he didnt know what to believe he knew only that he was sick of magic and weary of death what is that knife you keep up your sleeve whats the light in their eyes when you kill with it its called a dacra i guess it could be compared to the poison blade she was carrying with the dacra its not the wound itself that kills the dacra extinguishes the spark of life her eyes lowered its a painful thing to steal a life sometimes it is the only way this tonight was the only way to save our lives whether you choose to believe it or not all i know sister verna is that you use it without hesitation and that you didnt even try anything else he started to turn away im going to bury her richard she smoothed her skirt i hope you understand and that you dont misinterpret our actions but when we reach the palace we may have to take the sword of truth from you for your own good why how could that be for my own good she clasped her hands together again the prophecy that you have invoked the one that says he is the bringer of death and he shall so name himself is a very dangerous prophecy it goes on to say that the holder of the sword is able to call the dead forth call the past into the present what does that mean we dont know prophecies he muttered prophecies are just stupid riddles sister you invest too much concern in them you admit that you dont understand them yet try to follow them only a fool follows blindly what he doesnt understand if it were true i would call the dead forth and give this womans life back to her we know a lot more about them than you think i believe it would be for the best if we took the sword just for safekeeping until we understand the prophecy better sister verna if someone took the dacra from you would you still be a sister of course the dacra is simply a tool to help us in our job it doesnt make us who we are he smiled a cold smile its the same with the sword with or without it i am still the seeker i would be no less a danger to you taking it away from me will not save you her fists tightened it is not the same you are not taking the sword he said flatly you could never understand how much i hate this sword hate its magic and how much i wish to be rid of it but it was given to me when i was named seeker it was given to me to be mine for as long as i wish to hold it i am the seeker and i not you or anyone else will decide when i am to give it up her eyes narrowed named seeker you did not find the sword or purchase it it was given by a wizard you were named seeker a real seeker by a wizard i was who was this wizard the one i told you of before zeddicus zul zorander you met him just this once when he gave you the sword no i have spent my whole life with him he practically raised me he is my grandfather there was a long moment of dead silence and he named you seeker because he refused to teach you to control the gift to be a wizard refused when he realized i had the gift he practically begged to teach me to be a wizard he offered she whispered thats right i told him i didnt want to be a wizard something was wrong she seemed disturbed by this news he said the offer still stands why she rubbed her hands absently it is just unusual thats all many things about you are unusual richard didnt know if he believed her he wondered if maybe he didnt need the collar if zedd could have helped him without it but kahlan had wanted it on him she had wanted him taken away his insides twisted with that pain the sword was the only thing he had of zedd it was given to him when he was still back in westland when he was home he missed his home his woods the sword was the only thing left of zedd and home sister i was named seeker and given this sword for as long as i wish to keep it and be seeker i will be the one to decide when the time has come to give it up if you wish to take it away from me then try to do it now if you try one of us is going to die in the attempt at the moment i dont much care which one of us it is but i intend to fight to the death its mine by right and you are not taking it as long as there is a breath of life in me he listened to the distant howl of an animal dying a sudden violent death and then to the long empty silence that followed since you were given the sword and did not simply find it or purchase it you may keep it i will not take it from you i cannot speak for the others but i will try to see to your wishes it is the gift we must tend to it is that magic we must teach you to control she drew herself up and regarded him with an expression of such cold danger it made him have to fight the urge to shrink back but if you ever again draw it against me i will make you me the day the creator let you take your first breath her jaw muscles tightened do we understand each other whats so important about me that you would kill to capture me her cold composure was more frightening than if she had yelled at him our job is to help those with the gift because the gift is given by the creator we serve the creator it is for him we die ive lost two of my oldest friends because of you ive wept myself to sleep with grief for them ive had to kill this woman tonight and i may have to kill others before we reach the palace richard had the feeling it would be best to keep quiet but he couldnt she had a way of stirring the coals of his anger to flame dont try to assuage your guilt over what youve done at my expense sister her face heated with color that he could see even in the moonlight ive tried to be patient with you richard ive given you leeway because youve been pulled from the only life you have known and been thrust into a situation you fear and dont understand but my patience is near its end ive tried my best not to see the lifeless bodies of my friends when i look into your eyes or when you tell me im heartless ive tried not to think about you being the one standing at their burial not me and about the things i would have said over their fresh graves there are things going on that are beyond my understanding beyond my expectations beyond what i was led to believe were it up to me im of a mind to grant you your wish and remove your radahan and let you die in madness and pain but its not up to me it is the creators work i do although the hot coals of his temper hadnt been doused they had cooled sister verna im sorry he wished she would scream at him that would be better than her calm anger her quiet displeasure you are angered because you think i treat you as a child and not as a man and yet you have given me no reason to do otherwise i know where you stand in your abilities and where you have yet to travel in that journey you are no more than a babe who bawls to be turned loose in the world yet cannot even walk the collar you wear is capable of controlling you it is also capable of giving you pain great pain up until now i have avoided using it and have tried instead to encourage you in other ways to accept what must be done but if i have to i will use it the creator knows ive tried everything else we will soon be in a land much more dangerous than this we will have to deal with the people there to get through the sisters have arrangements with them to be allowed to pass you will do as i tell you as they tell you you will do the things you are told or there will be a great deal of trouble richards suspicion flared anew what things she glared at him do not test me further tonight richard as long as you understand youre not getting my sword without a fight we are only trying to help you richard but if you draw a weapon on me again i will see to it you greatly regret it she glanced to the agiel hanging at his neck mordsith hold no monopoly in giving pain cold confirmation of his suspicions spread through his gut they intended to train him the way a mordsith trained him that was the real reason for the collar that was how they intended to teach him with pain for the first time he felt as if she had inadvertently let him see the bones of her intentions she pulled the little book from her belt i have some work to do before we leave go bury her and hide her body well if its found it will tell them what happened and they will be after us and then i will have killed for nothing she sat in front of the cold jumble of firewood with a smooth sweep of her hand over the dark coals it burst into flame after youve buried her i want you to go for a walk and let your temper cool do not return until it has done so if you try to wander away or if you dont bring some reason into that thick head of yours by the time im ready to leave i will bring you back by the collar she gave him a menacing look from under her eyebrows you will not like it if i have to do that i promise you you will not like it one bit the dead woman was slight and little burden to carry he hardly noticed the weight as he walked away from the camp into the low rocky hills the moon was up and the way easy to see his mind swirled with his brooding thoughts as he trudged along kicking an occasional stone richard was surprised at his pang of pain for sister verna she had never before revealed how heartsick she was over the deaths of sisters grace and elizabeth he had thought that because she hadnt said anything she was callous he felt sorry for her now sorry for her anguish he wished she hadnt let him know it was easier to rail against his situation when he thought she was heartless he found himself a long way from their camp at the crest of a hump of ground with rocky walls and spires rising around him his mind came out of his twisting thoughts and returned to the body he carried on his back though the stab wound from the dacra might not have been what had killed her blood had nonetheless seeped down her back matting her hair and soaking his shoulder he felt sudden revulsion at carrying a dead woman around on his back he laid the body gently on the rocky ground and looked about searching for a place to lay her to rest he had a small shovel hooked to his belt but there didnt look to be easy digging anywhere maybe he could wall her up in one of the rocky crags while he peered into the shadowed gullies he absently rubbed the still sore burn on his chest nissel the healer had given him a poultice and every day he spread it on before covering the wound once more with a bandage he didnt like looking at it he didnt like seeing the scar of a handprint burned into his flesh sister verna had said it could have been that he had burned himself in the fireplace in the spirit house or that they might have indeed called forth the dark minions of the nameless one it obviously wasnt a burn from the fire it was the mark of the underworld of darken rani he was somehow ashamed of it and never let sister verna see it the scar was a constant reminder of his fathers true identity it seemed an affront to george cypher the man he thought of as his father the man who had raised him trusted and taught him given him his love and whom he had loved in return the mark was also a constant reminder of the monster he really was the monster kahlan had wanted collared and sent away richard swatted at a bug buzzing around his face he looked down they were buzzing around the dead woman too he went cold with a jolt of fright even before he felt the sting of a bite on his neck blood flies he drew his sword in a rush as the huge dark shape lunged from behind the rock the ringing sound of steel was drowned out by a roar wings spread wide the gar dove for him for an instant he thought he saw a second hunched in the shadows behind the first but his attention was immediately seized by the immense thing descending on him by the fierce glowing green eyes locked on him it was too big to be a longtailed gar and by the way it anticipated and avoided his first stab too smart it would have to be a shorttailed gar he cursed silently it was thinner than shorttailed gars he had seen before probably the result of poor hunting in this desolate land but thin or not it was still huge towering half again as tall as he richard stumbled and fell over the dead woman as he lurched back to escape the swipe of a massive claw he came up swinging the sword in fury letting the anger of the swords magic surge through him the tip of the sword sliced a gash across the smooth taut pink stomach the gar howled in rage as it rushed him again unexpectedly batting him to the ground with a leathery wing richard rolled to his feet whirling the sword as he came up the blade flashed in the moonlight taking off a wingtip in a spray of blood that only enraged the gar into lunging toward him long wet fangs ripped at the night air its eyes were ablaze with a furious green glow the howling roar hurt his ears claws swept in to each side of him the magic pounded through him demanding blood instead of dodging the advance richard ducked he sprang up driving the sword through the chest of the great furcovered beast he yanked the blade back with a twisting cut to the sound of a scream of mortal pain richard pulled the sword behind prepared to take the hideous head off with a powerful stroke but the gar didnt come at him claws clutched to the gushing wound at its chest it teetered a moment and then toppled heavily onto its back bones in its wings snapping as it fell on them a keening wail came from the shadows richard retreated a few paces a small dark form darted across the ground to the vanquished monster falling on top of it little wings wrapped around the heaving chest richard stared in disbelief it was a baby gar the wounded beast lifted a shaking claw to clutch weakly at the whimpering form it drew a gurgling breath that lifted the little gar sprawled atop its chest the arm dropped to the side faintly glowing green eyes drank in its little one and then looked up at richard with pleading pain a froth of blood bubbled as it expelled its last rattling breath the glow in its eyes waned and then it was still with plaintive cries the little creature seized small fistfuls of fur little or not richard thought it is still a gar he stepped close he had to kill it the rage pounded through him he lifted the sword over his head the little gar drew a trembling wing over its head as it shrank back as frightened as it was it would not leave its mother it whimpered in anguish and fear a terrified little face peered over the trembling wing wide wet green eyes blinked up at him tears ran down the deep creases in its cheeks as it sobbed in distress with a purling wail dear spirits richard whispered as he stood paralyzed i cant do this the little gar quivered as it watched the swords point sink to the ground richard turned his back and closed his eyes he felt sick both from the swords magic which inflicted upon him the pain of his vanquished foe and from the dreadful prospect of what he had been ready to do as he replaced the sword he drew a deep breath to steady himself then lifted the dead woman over his shoulder and started off he could hear the choking sobs of the little gar as it clung to its still mother he couldnt kill it he just couldnt besides he told himself the sword wouldnt allow it the magic only worked against threat it wouldnt allow him to kill the little gar he knew it wouldnt of course it would work if he turned the blade white but he couldnt bear that pain he would not subject himself to that agony not for no more purpose than to kill a defenseless pup he carried the dead womans body toward the next rise as he listened to the whimpers grow faint laying the body down again he sat to catch his breath he could just see the great beast in the moonlight a dark blotch against the lightcolored rock and the small form atop it he could hear the slow sounds of anguish and confusion richard sat a long time watching listening dear spirits what have i done the spirits as usual had nothing to say out of the corner of his eye movement caught his attention two distant silhouettes passed in front of the big bright moon they banked into a slow turn and began to descend two gars richard came to his feet maybe they would see the baby and help it he found himself cheering them on and then realized how absurd it was to hope a gar would live but he was beginning to feel an odd sympathy for monsters richard ducked down the two gars overhead came close to him as they swept in a wide circle around the scene on the next hill their spiral tightened the little gar fell silent the dark shapes dove down landing a ways apart with a flutter of wings they moved cautiously around the dead gar and its offspring wings held open they suddenly leapt toward the silent baby gar it broke its silence with a scream there was a flurry of wings vicious roars and frightened shrieks richard stood many animals ate the young of another of their own kind especially males and especially if food was scarce they werent going to save it they intended to eat it before he even realized what he was doing richard was racing down the hill he ran heedless of the foolishness he intended he pulled the sword free as he charged up the hill to the little gar its terrified wails urged him on the savage snarls of its attackers ignited the wrath of the swords magic steel first he rushed into the fur and claws and wings the two gars were bigger than the one he had killed confirming his suspicion that they were males his blade caught only air as they leapt back but one of them dropped the little gar it skittered across the ground and clutched its mothers fur the other two circled him charging and darting and swiping with their claws richard swung and stabbed with the sword one of them snatched at the baby richard scooped it away with his free arm and quickly retreated a dozen paces they fell on the dead gar with a cry the baby stretched its arms toward its mother its wings flapping against his face in an effort to free itself in a frenzy the two gars tore at the carcass richard made a calculated decision as long as the dead gar was there the pup wouldnt leave it the pup would have a better chance at survival if it had nothing to hold it to this place it squirmed mightily in his arm though fully half his size at least it was lighter than he would have thought he feigned a charge to hurry the two along they snapped at him too hungry to be frightened off without a meal they fought each other claws slashed and pulled ripping the body asunder richard charged again as the little gar tore free running ahead of him with a shriek the two leapt into the air each with half a prize in a moment they were gone the little gar stood where its mother had been keening as it watched the two disappear into the dark sky panting and weary richard returned his sword to its scabbard and then slumped down on a short ledge trying to catch his breath his head sunk into his hands as tears welled up he must be losing his mind what in the world was he doing he was risking his life for nothing no not for nothing he raised his head the little gar was standing in the blood where its mother had been its trembling wings held out limply its shoulders slumped and its tufted ears wilted big green eyes watched him they stared at each other for a long moment im sorry little one he whispered it took a tentative step toward him tears ran down the gars face tears ran down his it took another small shaky step richard held his arms out it watched and then with a miserable wail fell into them it clutched its long skinny arms to him warm wings wrapped around his shoulders richard hugged it tightly to himself gently stroking its coarse fur he hushed it with comforting whispers richard rarely had seen a creature in such misery a creature so in need of comfort that it would even accept it from the one who had caused its pain maybe he thought it was only recognizing him as the one who had saved it from being eaten by two huge monsters maybe given the terrible choice it chose to see him as a savior maybe the last impression of saving it from being eaten was simply the strongest the little gar felt like nothing more than a furry sack of bones it was half starved he could hear its stomach grumbling its faint musky odor while not pleasant was not repulsive either he cooed succor as the things whimpering slowed when it had at last quieted with a heavy tired sigh richard stood sharp little claws tugged at his pant leg as it looked up to his face he wished he had some food to leave with the pup but he hadnt brought his pack and had nothing to offer he pulled the claw from his pants i have to go those two wont come back now try to find yourself a rabbit or something youll have to do the best you can on your own now go on it blinked up at him its wings and one leg slowly stretching as it yawned richard turned and started off he looked over his shoulder the little gar followed after richard stamped to a halt you cant come with me he held his arms out and shooed it away go on be off with you he started walking backward the gar followed he stopped again and shooed it more firmly go you cant come with me go on the wings wilted again it took a few shaking steps back as richard started off again this time it stayed put as he went on his way richard had the womans body to bury and he needed to get back to camp before sister verna decided to use the collar to bring him back he had no desire to give her an excuse he knew she would find one soon enough he glanced behind to make sure the gar hadnt followed he was alone he found the body laid on its back where he had left it he noted with relief that there were no blood flies about he had to find either a patch of ground soft enough to dig a hole or else a deep crevice of some sort to hide her body in sister verna had been explicit about hiding it well as he was surveying the scene there was a soft flutter of wings and the little gar thumped to the ground nearby he muttered a quiet lament as the creature folded its wings and squatted comfortably before him peering up with big green eyes richard tried to shoo it away again it didnt move he put his hands on his hips you cant come with me go away it tottered to him and clutched his legs what was he going to do he couldnt have a gar tagging after him where are your flies you dont even have any blood flies of your own how can you expect to catch your dinner without your own blood flies he gave a rueful shake of his head well its not my concern the small wrinkled face peeked around his legs a low growl came from its throat as its lips pulled back to reveal sharp little fangs richard looked around it was growling at the dead woman he closed his eyes with a groan the pup was hungry if he buried the body the gar would dig it up richard watched as the gar hopped over to the body pawing at it as its growls grew louder richard tried to swallow back the dryness in his throat or maybe the things he was thinking sister verna had said to get rid of the body they mustnt know how the woman had died she had said he couldnt stand the thought of the remains being eaten but even if he buried it it would be eaten anyway by worms why were worms better than a gar another ghastly thought came to him who was he to judge he had eaten human flesh why was that any different was he any better and besides if the pup was busy eating he could be off and they would be gone before it had time to follow it would be on its own then he would be rid of it richard watched as the little gar cautiously inspected the body it experimentally tugged at an arm with its teeth the pup wasnt experienced enough to know what to do with a kill it growled louder the sight made richard sick the teeth dropped the arm and the gar looked at him as if to ask for help the wings fluttered with excitement it was hungry two problems at once what difference did it make she was dead her spirit had departed her body and wouldnt miss it it would solve two problems at once gritting his teeth at the task in mind he drew the sword pushing back the hungry gar with a leg richard took a mighty swing slashing open a great rent the little gar pounced richard walked quickly away without looking back the sounds turned his stomach who was he to judge lightheaded he broke into a trot back to the camp sweat soaked his shirt the sword had never felt so heavy at his hip he tried to put the whole incident out of his head he thought about the hartland woods and wished he were home he wished he could still be who he had once been sister verna had just finished currying jessup and was lifting on his saddle she eyed him with a sidelong glance before moving to her horses head speaking softly and privately to him as she scratched his chin richard took up the curry comb and brushed quickly at geraldines back cautioning her sharply to stand still and quit turning about he wanted to be away quickly did you make sure they wouldnt find the body his hand with the comb froze on geraldines flanks if they find whats left they wont know what happened i was attacked by gars they got the body she thought this over silently for a moment i thought i heard gars well i guess that will do he went back to brushing as she spoke again did you kill them i killed one he considered not telling her but decided it didnt matter there was a baby gar i didnt kill it gars are murderous beasts you should have killed it perhaps you should go back and finish it i cant it wont let me get close enough with a little grunt she pulled the girth strap tight you have a bow what difference does it make lets just be off all by itself it will probably die anyway she bent checking that the strap wasnt pinching her horse perhaps youre right it would be best if we were away from here sister why havent the gars bothered us before because i shield against them with my han you were too far away beyond my shields and so they came for you so this shield will keep all gars away from us yes well at least there was one thing the han was good for doesnt that take a lot of power gars are big beasts isnt it hard the question brought a small smile to her lips yes gars are big and there are other beasts i must shield against too all this would take much power you must always search for the way to accomplish the task using the least amount of han she stroked her horses neck as she went on i keep the gars away not by repelling the beasts themselves but by shielding against their blood flies its much easier if the flies cant get through the shield the gars wont think there is anything worthwhile and so wont come to us either it uses little of my strength this way yet achieves my aim why didnt you use this shield against the people here against the woman tonight some of the people in the wilds have charms against our power thats why many sisters die trying to cross if we knew how these charms or spells worked we might be able to counter them but we dont its a mystery to us richard finished saddling geraldine and bonnie in silence the sister waited patiently he thought she had more to say about their argument before he had gone to bury the woman but she remained silent he decided to speak first and get it over with sister verna im sorry about sisters grace and elizabeth he idly stroked bonnies shoulder as he studied the ground i said a prayer over their graves i just wanted you to know that a prayer to the good spirits to watch over them and treat them well i didnt want them to die you may think otherwise but i dont want anyone to die im sick of death i cant even eat meat anymore because i cant stand the thought of anything having to die just to feed me thank you for the prayer richard but you must learn that it is only the creator we must pray to it is his light that guides praying to spirits is heathenish she seemed to think better of her harsh tone and softened it but you are unschooled and would not know that i cant fault you for doing the best you could im sure the creator heard your prayer and understood its benevolent intent richard didnt like her narrowminded attitude he thought that perhaps he knew more about spirits than she did he didnt know much about this creator of hers but he had seen spirits before both good and bad he knew you ignored them at your own peril her dogmas seemed as foolish to him as the superstitions of the country people he knew when he had been a guide they had been full of stories of how people came to be each remote area he had visited had its own version of man created from this or that animal or plant richard had liked listening to the stories they were filled with wonder and magic but they were just stories rooted in a need to understand how the teller fit into the world he was not going to accept on faith the things the sisters said he did not think that the creator was like some king sitting upon a throne listening to every petty prayer to come his way spirits had been alive once and they understood the needs of mortals understood the exigencies of living flesh and blood zedd had taught him that the creator was simply another name for the force of balance in all things and not some wise man sitting in judgment but what did it matter he knew people held tightly to their doctrines and were closedminded about it sister verna believed what she did and he wasnt going to change it he had never faulted people for the beliefs they held he was not about to start now such beliefs true or not could be a balm he pulled the baldric off over his head and held the sword out to her ive thought about the things you said before ive decided i dont want the sword anymore her hands came up and he laid the weight of the sword scabbard and baldric in them she showed no emotion do you really mean this he nodded i do i am finished with it the sword is yours now he turned to check his saddle even without the sword at his hip he could still feel the tingle of its magic he could give up the sword but the magic was still within him he was the true seeker and could not be rid of that at least he could be rid of the blade and thereby the things he did with it you are a very dangerous man richard she whispered he looked back over his shoulder thats why im giving you the sword i dont want it any longer and you do so its yours well see now how you like killing with it he tucked the end of the girth strap through the buckle and drew it tight he gave bonnie a gentle pat before turning around sister verna was still holding out the sword until now i had no idea just how dangerous you are not anymore you have the sword now i cannot accept it she whispered it was my duty to take the sword from you when you came back to test you there was only one thing you could have done to prevent losing it and you have done it she lifted the sword to him there is no man more dangerous than one who is unpredictable there is no way to forecast what you will do when pushed it is going to be great trouble for you for us richard didnt know what she was talking about theres nothing unpredictable about it you wanted the sword and im weary of the things i do with it so i gave it to you you understand because it is the way you think others dont think that way youre an enigma worse your inexplicable behavior comes at the times you need it most that is the gift at work youre using your han without understanding what you are doing that is dangerous one reason for the collar is to open my mind to the gift thats what you said if im using the gift which is what you want me to do and if it is what i need then i dont see how that is dangerous what you need and whats right are not necessarily the same just because you want something that does not make it right she nodded to the sword take it back i cannot accept it now you must keep it i told you i dont want it then throw it in the fire i cannot take it its tainted richard snatched it out of her hands im not throwing it in the fire he put his head through the baldric and straightened the scabbard at his hip i think youre too superstitious sister its just a sword it is not tainted she was wrong it was the magic that was tainted and he had not offered that to her even if he wanted to be rid of its magic all magic he could not it was part of him kahlan had seen that and she had rid herself of it of him she turned from him and mounted jessup her voice was cold and distant we must be on our way richard settled into his saddle and followed after he hoped the little gar would have a chance at life after the meal it had needed he said a silent goodbye to it as he rode into the night behind sister verna though he had meant what he said about giving her the sword he felt strangely relieved to have it back it belonged with him and somehow made him whole zedd had given it to him it was what had changed him but it was also all he had to remind him of his friend and home chapter the horse was exhausted but still ran with wild abandon adie held a tight grip on zedds waist as he leaned over the horses withers clutching her mane muscles bunched and flexed rhythmically beneath him trees in the dense forest flashed by in an endless blur the horse leapt over rocks and logs without pause the skrin was only a heartbeat behind being taller than the horse it struck branches as it ran zedd could hear the limbs snap and splinter he had tried felling trees across the way right behind them but it didnt slow the bone beast he had tried tricks and spells and wizardry of every sort none had worked but he refused to admit defeat admitting defeat established a mental state of resignation that would make it certain i fear the keeper has us this time adie called at his back not yet he doesnt how did he find us the bones of the skrin have been in your house hiding you for years if they have been hiding you then how did he find us she had no answer they were running the path where the boundary had been headed toward the midlands zedd was thankful the boundary walls were no longer there or they could have inadvertently run into the underworld by now boundary or not this couldnt go on for much longer and then the skrin would have them boundary or not the underworld would have them the keeper would have them think he ordered himself zedd was using magic to lend strength and stamina to the horse but even so heart lungs and sinew could not endure long past their natural limits he was nearly as weary as the frightened animal this couldnt go on much longer he had to stop trying to slow the skrin and put his mind to solving the problem but that could be a dangerous shift in tactics it could be that although what he was doing wasnt stopping the skrin it was keeping it from them he thought he saw a flash of green light to the left a shade of green he had seen from only one place the boundary from the underworld impossible he thought the horses hooves thundered on adie do you have anything with you that the skrin would recognize like what i dont know anything it has to have found us by something something to connect us to the underworld i have nothing it must have found us by the bones at my house but the bones have been what have been hiding you there was no mistaking the flash of green light this time it was to the right another came to the left zedd i think the skrin be bringing up the underworld to force us into it bones can it do that her voice wasnt as loud this time yes bags he muttered into the cold wind at his face eerie green light flickered between the trees it was closer if he didnt think of something they were going to die think suddenly the green light seemed to ignite into a solid wall to each side it made a thump he could feel deep in his chest when it arrived whole in this world the horse galloped down the path between them the way between the walls was narrowing bones skrin bones adie give me the necklace around your neck the luminous green walls of the boundary pressed in to each side they were out of time they were out of options adie pulled off her necklace and put her arm around him again holding out the bone necklace her hand was slick with blood zedd yanked his own necklace over his head and snatched hers in the same hand if this doesnt work im sorry adie i just want you to know ive enjoyed sharing time with you what are you going to do hold tight the green walls of the boundary closed together ahead of them zedd held the horse firmly and gave her a silent command she dug in her hooves and spun around to a halt just before the trail ended in a wall of the underworld zedd flung the two necklaces made with skrin bone into the green light between a wide gap in the trees the skrin was upon them without pause it followed the necklaces as they sailed into the boundary into the green light there was a flash and a booming clap like a lightning strike as the skrin went through the green light and the skrin flickered and were gone the dark forest was silent but for ragged breathing adie laid her head wearily against his back you be right old man your life be one act of desperation after another zedd patted her knee before sliding off the sweaty horse the poor animal was so exhausted it was at the brink of death zedd held its head between his hands and gave it a dose of strength and his sincere thanks he laid the side of his face against her nose as he closed his eyes and gave reassuring strokes to her cheeks for a moment before going to check on adie blood still oozed from the wound on her arm the size of the horse made adie appear smaller than she really was her slumped shoulders and hanging head didnt help diminish the illusion she didnt acknowledge any pain as zedd inspected the wound i be a fool she said the whole time i thought i be hiding under the keepers nose he be hiding under mine he knew where i be the whole time all these years we can take solace in the fact that it earned him no profit he has wasted his investment now hold still i must tend to this wound there be no time for that we must get back to my house i must get my bones i said be still we must hurry zedd scowled up at her we will go back when im finished but the horse is exhausted she must be walked ill walk and let you ride if you give me no further trouble now be still or we will be here the whole night quibbling by the time they reached adies house dawn was breaking offering a cold weak light it was a sad sight the skrin had torn the place to splinters adie disregarded the leaning holed walls as she rushed inside stepping over debris picking up bones holding them in the crook of her other arm as she worked her way toward the corner where they had last seen the round carved bone zedd was inspecting the ground outside when he heard her calling to him come help me find the round bone wizard he stepped over a fallen beam i dont expect you will find it she pushed a board aside it be here somewhere she stopped looking back over her shoulder what do you mean you dont expect we will find it someone has been here she looked around at the ruin you be sure zedd waved his arm vaguely toward where he had been studying the ground i saw a footprint over there it isnt ours she let the bones in her arm drop to the floor who he laid his hand on a beam that hung from the ceiling its end resting on the floor i dont know but someone has been here it looks to be a womans boot but it isnt yours i suspect she will have taken the round bone adie pawed through the rubble in the corner searching at last she stopped you be right old man the bone be gone she turned seeming to inspect the very air with her white eyes banelings she hissed you be wrong about the keeper wasting his effort i fear youre right zedd brushed his hand clean on the side of his leg we had better get away from here far away adie leaned toward him her voice low but firm zedd we must have that bone it be important for the veil she has covered her trail with magic i dont have any idea where she went i only saw one footprint we must be away from here the keeper might expect us to return ill cover our trail so no one will know where were going you be so sure about that the keeper seems to know where we be and sends his minions for us at will he tracked us by the necklaces we wore he will be blind to us for the time being but we must get away from here he may have eyes watching the same eyes that took the bone her head sunk lower as she closed her eyes forgive me zedd for endangering you so for being a fool nonsense no one knows everything you cant expect to walk through life without stepping in the muck now and again the important thing is to maintain your footing when you do and not fall on your face and make it worse but that bone be important its gone we can do nothing about it now at least we foiled the keeper he didnt get us but we must be away from here adie bent to pick up the bones she had dropped i will hurry we cant take anything adie he said quietly she straightened i must take my bones some of them be important some have powerful magic zedd took up her thin hand adie the keeper knew where we were by one of the bones hes been watching you we cant know if he would recognize any of these too we must leave them but we cant risk having someone else taking them they must be destroyed her mouth worked for a moment before she found words i will not leave them they be important they were extremely difficult to obtain it took me years to find some of them the keeper could not have marked them he could not know the trouble i went to zedd patted her hand adie he wouldnt have placed one he wanted you to have to mark you right in your path he would have made you struggle for it so you would value it and keep it close she yanked her hand back then he could have marked anything she pointed how do you know this horse was not given by a baneling zedd gave her a level look because it was not the one offered i took another tears welled up in her eyes please zedd she whispered they be mine they be how i was going to reach my pell i will help you get your message to your pell i have given you my word but this is not the way to do it it hasnt worked yet ill help you find a new way she limped a step closer to him how he regarded her stricken face with sympathy i have a way to bring spirits through the veil for a brief time to speak with them even if i cant bring pell through i might be able to get a message to him but adie you must listen to me we cant do it now we must wait until the veil is closed her trembling fingers touched his arm how how can such a thing be done it can be done that is all you must know tell me her ringers tightened on his arm i must know you speak the truth i must know it can be done he weighed the decision a long moment he had used the wizards rock his father had given him to call the spirits of his father and mother to himself but they had told him explicitly not to call them again until this was finished or they would risk tearing the veil apart using the rock in such a fashion was dangerous even in the best of times and he had been cautioned not to do it except in the gravest circumstances opening a path to the spirits was always a great risk you never knew what you could be letting through unintended enough dark things were getting through without his helping them even though adie was a sorceress this use of the wizards rock was not for her to know it was a secret like many others that wizards must keep his heart felt heavy with that responsibility you will have to trust my word that it can be done ive given my word that ill help you and when it is safe ill try her fingers still dug urgently into his arm how can such a thing be are you sure how could you know such a thing he straightened his shoulders im a wizard of the first order but are you sure adie you must take my word i dont give it lightly im not sure it will work but i believe it may right now the important thing is to use what we know what you and i know to stop the keeper from tearing the veil it would be wrong to use what i know for selfish reasons and thus endanger the safety of everyone else maintaining the veil requires a delicate balance of forces this could disturb it it could even be that such a use would tear the veil she took her hand from his arm and wiped a stray strand of gray hair from her face forgive me zedd you be right i have studied the cusp between the worlds for most of my life i should know better forgive me he smiled as he hugged her around her shoulders im gratified that you hold your vows to be so important it means that you are a person of honor theres no better ally than a person of honor she looked around her shattered home it just be that i have spent my life gathering these things i have been their caretaker for so long others have entrusted them to me zedd walked her out of the rubble others have invested their trust in you to use the gift you were given to protect those without power they are the ones who wrote the prophecies you have been brought to this point for a reason thats the trust you must keep she nodded rubbing a thin hand on his back as they walked away from the remains of her home zedd i think several other bones be missing too i know they be dangerous in the wrong hands i know that too then what do you plan to do about it i plan to do what the prophecies say is the only thing that gives us a chance at closing the veil and what be that old man helping richard we must find a way to help him for the prophecies say he is the only one who can close the veil neither looked back as fire roared to life roiling and racing through the ruins dancing through the bones chapter queen cyrilla held her head high she refused to acknowledge how much the coarse fingers of the brutes who held her were hurting her arms she didnt resist as they walked her down the filthy corridor resistance was hopeless anyway and would bring her no aid she would conduct herself now as always with dignity she was the queen of galea she would endure with dignity what was to come she would not show her terror besides it was not what was being done to her that mattered it was what was going to happen to the galean people that grieved her and what had already happened nearly one hundred score of the galean guard had been murdered before her eyes who could have foreseen that they would be set upon in this of all places on neutral ground that a few had escaped was no solace they too would probably be hunted down and killed she hoped that her brother prince harold had been among those who had escaped if he had gotten away perhaps he could rally a defense against the worse slaughter that was yet to come the brutal hands on her arms brought her to a halt next to a hissing torch set in a rustencrusted bracket the fingers twisted so painfully that a small cry escaped her lips despite her will to stifle it are my men hurting you my lady came a mocking voice from behind she coolly denied prince fyren the satisfaction of an answer a guard worked keys at a rusty lock sending a sharp metallic sound echoing down the stone corridor when the bolt finally drew the heavy door groaned on its hinges as it was pulled open the viselike hands forced her on through the doorway and down another long low passageway she could hear the swish of her satin skirts and to the sides and behind the mens boots on the stone floor splashing occasionally through stagnant foulsmelling water the dank air felt cold on her shoulders which were unaccustomed to being uncovered her heart threatened to race out of control when she thought about where she was being taken she prayed to the dear spirits that there wouldnt be rats she feared rats their sharp teeth their clutching claws and their cunning black eyes when she was very little she had nightmares about rats and would wake screaming it an effort to bring her heart back under control she tried to think of other things she thought about the strange woman who had sought a private audience with her cyrilla wasnt at all sure why she had granted it but she now wished she had paid more heed to the insistent woman what was her name lady something a glimpse of her hair beneath the concealing veil had shown it to be too short for someone of her standing lady bevinvier yes that was it lady bevinvier lady bevinvier of someplace she couldnt will her mind to remember it didnt matter anyway it was not where the woman was from but what she had said that mattered leave aydindril lady bevinvier had warned leave at once but cyrilla had not come all this way in the teeth of winter to leave before the council of the midlands had heard her grievance and acted upon it she had come to demand that the council do its duty to bring an immediate halt to the transgressions against her land and people towns had been sacked farms burned and people murdered the armies of kelton were massing to attack an invasion was imminent if not already under way and for what nothing but naked conquest against an ally it was an outrage it was the councils duty to come to the defense of any land being attacked no matter by whom the whole point of the council of the midlands was to prevent just such treason it was their duty to direct all the lands to come to the aid of galea and put down the aggression though galea was a powerful land it had been gravely weakened by its defense of the midlands against dhara and was not prepared for another costly war kelton had been spared the brunt of the dharan conquest and had reserves aplenty galea had paid the price of resistance in their stead the night before lady bevinvier had come to her and had begged that she leave at once she had said cyrilla would find no help for galea from the council the lady bevinvier said that if the queen stayed she would be in great personal danger at first when pressed lady bevinvier refused to explain herself cyrilla thanked her but said she would not turn away from her duty to her people and would go before the council as planned lady bevinvier broke down in tears begging that the queen heed her words she at last confided that she had had a vision cyrilla tried to draw the nature of the vision out of the woman but she said that it was incomplete that she didnt know any details only that if the queen didnt leave at once something terrible would happen though cyrilla trusted well the powers of magic she had little faith in fortunetellers most were charlatans seeking only to fatten their purse with a clever turn of a phrase or a vague hint of danger to be avoided queen cyrilla was touched by the womans seeming sincerity though she reasoned it might be nothing but deception meant to trick her out of a coin a ruse for money seemed strange coming from a woman of such seeming wealth but times had been hard and she knew the wealthy were not immune to losses after all if gold and goods were to be seized it only made sense to seek them from those who had them cyrilla knew many who had worked hard all their lives only to lose everything in the war with dhara perhaps lady bevinviers short hair was the result of that loss she thanked the woman but told her that the mission was too important to be turned aside she pressed a gold piece into the womans hand only to have lady bevinvier throw the coin across the room before rushing off in tears cyrilla had been shaken by that a charlatan did not refuse gold unless of course she sought something more either the woman had been telling the truth or she was working in aid of kelton trying to prevent the council from hearing of the aggression either way it didnt matter cyrilla was resolute besides she was influential in the council galea was respected for its defense of the midlands when aydindril had fallen councilors who had refused to swear the allegiance of their land to dhara had been put to death and replaced by puppets those councilors who had collaborated were allowed to retain their position galeas loyal ambassador to the council had been executed how the war had ended was a puzzle dharan forces were told that darken rahl was dead and all hostilities were ended a new lord rahl had succeeded and the troops were simply called home or ordered to help those they had conquered cyrilla suspected darken rahl had been assassinated whatever had happened was good by her the council was now back in the hands of the people of the midlands the ones who collaborated and the puppets had been arrested things were said to be set back to the way they had been before the dictator she expected the council would come to the aid of galea queen cyrilla too had an ally on the council the most powerful ally there was the mother confessor though kahlan was her halfsister that wasnt what forged their alliance cyrilla had always supported the sovereignty of the various lands while also recognizing the fundamental need for peace among them the mother confessor respected that steadfastness and it was that respect which made her galeas ally kahlan had never shown cyrilla any favoritism and that was as it should have been favoritism would have weakened the mother confessor threatening the alliance of the council and therefore peace she respected kahlan for putting the unity of the midlands above any power games such games were a shifting bog anyway one was always better off in the end when dealt with fairly rather than by favor cyrilla had always been secretly proud of her half sister kahlan was twelve years younger smart strong and despite her young age an astute leader though they were related by blood they almost never spoke of it kahlan was a confessor and of the magic she was not a sister who shared the blood of a father but a confessor and the mother confessor of the midlands confessors were blood to no one but confessors still having no family of her own save her beloved brother harold she had often longed to take kahlan in her arms as kin as a little sister and speak of the things they shared but that was not possible cyrilla was the queen of galea and kahlan was the mother confessor two women who were virtual strangers who shared nothing save blood and mutual respect duty came before the heart galea was cyrillas family the confessors kahlans though there were those who resented kahlans mother taking wyborn as a mate cyrilla was not among them her mother queen bernadine had taught her and harold of the need for confessors their need for strong blood in that line of magic and how it served the greater cause of the midlands in keeping peace her mother had never spoken bitterly of losing her husband to the confessors but explained instead the honor cyrilla and harold had of sharing blood with the confessors even if it was mostly unspoken yes she was proud of kahlan proud but also perhaps a bit wary the ways of confessors were a mystery to her from birth they were trained in aydindril trained by other confessors and by wizards their magic their power was something they were born with and in a way they were slaves to it in some ways it was the same with her born to be queen without much choice though she had no magic she understood the weight of birthright from birth until their training was completed confessors were kept cloistered like priestesses in a world apart their discipline was said to be rigorous though cyrilla knew they must have emotions like anyone confessors were trained to subjugate them duty to their power was all it left them no choice in life save choosing a mate and even that was not for love but for duty cyrilla had always wished she could bring a little of the love of a sister to kahlan perhaps she also wished kahlan could have brought a little of that love to her too but it could never be maybe kahlan had loved her from afar as cyrilla had kahlan perhaps kahlan had been proud of her too in her own way she had always hoped it was so the thing that pained her the most was that though they both served the midlands she was loved by her people for doing her duty but kahlan was feared and hated for it she wished kahlan could know a peoples love it was a comfort that in part made up for the sacrifice but a confessor never could perhaps she thought that was why they were taught to subjugate their emotions and needs kahlan too had tried to warn her of the danger from kelton it had been at the midsummer festival several years ago the first summer after the death of cyrillas mother the first summer cyrilla had been queen the first summer too since kahlan had ascended to mother confessor that kahlan had become the mother confessor at such a young age spoke of both the strength of her power and of her character and perhaps of a need since the selection was made in secrecy cyrilla knew little about the succession of confessors except that it was done without animosity or rivalry and had to do with the strength of power weighed against age and training to the people of the midlands age was irrelevant they feared confessors in general regardless of age and the mother confessor in particular they knew she was the most powerful of confessors unlike most people however cyrilla knew that power in and of itself was not necessarily something to fear and kahlan had always been fair she had never sought anything but peace that day the streets of ebinissia the crown city of galea had been filled with festivities of every sort not even the lowest stableboy had failed to find welcome at the tables of the fair or at the games or around the musicians acrobats and jugglers cyrilla as queen had presided over the contests and given ribbons to the victors she had never seen so many smiling faces so many happy people she had never felt so contented for her people or been made to feel so loved by them that night there was a royal ball at the palace the great hall was filled with nearly four hundred people it was dazzling to see everyone in their most elegant dress food and wine were arrayed on the long tables in abundant and stunning variety only fitting for the most important day of the year it was grand beyond any ball that had come before for there was much for which to be thankful it was a time of peace and prosperity growth and promise new life and bounty the music trailed off in thin discordant notes and the loud drone of the gathering fell suddenly dead silent as the the mother confessor strode purposefully into the hall her wizard at her heels his silver robes flying behind her regallooking white dress stood out among the confusion of color like the full moon among the stars bright color and fancy dress had never looked so unexpectedly trivial everyone bowed low at her passing cyrilla waited with her advisors beside the table on which sat a large cutglass bowl of spiced wine kahlan crossed the hushed room followed by every eye and drew to a halt before the queen giving a prompt bow of her head her expression was as still as ice she didnt wait for the formality of the bow to her office to be returned queen cyrilla you have an advisor named drefan tross cyrilla held her open hand out to the side this is he kahlans emotionless gaze moved to drefan i would speak with you in private drefan tross is a trusted advisor cyrilla interrupted he was more than that he was a man she was very fond of a man she was just beginning to fall in love with you may speak to him in my presence she didnt know what this was about but thought it best if she were privy to it confessors did not interrupt banquets except for trouble this is neither the time nor place to conduct business of this sort mother confessor but if it cannot wait then let it be done and finished with here and now she thought that would put it in abeyance until a more appropriate time without expression the mother confessor considered this a moment the wizard at her back was anything but expressionless he appeared quite agitated in fact he bent toward kahlan to speak but she raised her hand to silence him before he could begin as you wish i am sorry queen cyrilla but it cannot wait she returned her attention to drefan i have just taken the confession of a murderer in his confession he also revealed himself to be an accomplice to an assassin he named you as that assassin and your target as queen cyrilla there were astonished whispers from those near enough to overhear drefans face went red the whispers died into brittle silence cyrilla could scarcely follow what happened next a blink of the eye and it would have been missed one instant drefan stood as he had with his hand in his gold and deep blue coat and the next he was driving a knife toward the mother confessor standing tall she moved only her arm catching his wrist seemingly at the same time there was a violent impact to the air thunder but no sound the cutglass bowl shattered flooding red wine over the table and floor cyrilla flinched with the sudden flash of pain coursing through every joint in her body the knife clattered to the floor drefans eyes went wide his jaw slack mistress he whispered reverently cyrilla was numb with shock to see a conffessor use her power she knew only of its aftereffects arid had never seen it being used few had the magic seemed still to sizzle in the air a long moment the crowd pressed closer a warning glare from the wizard changed their curiosity to timidity and they moved back kahlan looked drained but her voice betrayed no weakness you intended to assassinate the queen yes mistress he said eagerly licking his lips when tonight in the confusion when the guests were departing drefan looked to be in torment tears welled up and ran down his cheeks please mistress command me tell me what you wish let me carry out your command cyrilla was still in shock this was what had been done to her father this was how he had been taken as a mate to a confessor first her father and now a man she held dear wait in silence kahlan ordered hands hanging at her sides she turned to cyrilla her young eyes now heavy with sorrow forgive me for disturbing your celebration queen cyrilla but i feared the results of delay her face burning cyrilla twisted to face drefan he stood gaping at kahlan who ordered this drefan who ordered you kill me he didnt even seem to be aware she had spoken he will not answer you queen cyrilla kahlan said he will only answer me then you ask that would not be advisable the wizard offered quietly cyrilla felt a fool everyone knew of her fondness for drefan everyone saw now that she had been duped no one would ever forget this midsummer festival do not presume to advise me kahlan leaned closer and spoke softly cyrilla we think he may be protected by a spell when i asked his accomplice that question he died before he could answer but i believe i know the answer there are oblique ways of getting the information that might possibly circumvent the spell if i could take him somewhere alone and question him in my own way we might be able to get the answer cyrilla was near tears with fury i trusted him he was close to me he has betrayed me me not you i will know who sent him i will hear it from his own lips you stand in my kingdom in my home ask him kahlan straightened her face returning to the calm mask that showed nothing as you wish she redirected her attention to drefan was what you intended to do to the queen of your own volition he drywashed his hands in anxious anticipation of pleasing the mother confessor no mistress i was sent if it was possible kahlans face seemed to become even more placid who sent you one hand rose and his mouth opened as if in an attempt to do her bidding all that came from his throat was a gurgle of blood before he collapsed the wizard gave a knowing grunt as i thought the same as the other kahlan picked up the knife and offered it handlefirst to cyrilla we believe there to be a conspiracy of great magnitude brewing whether or not this man was part of it i dont know but he was sent by kelton kelton i refuse to believe that kahlan nodded at the knife in cyrillas hand the knife is keltish many people carry weapons forged in kelton they are some of the finest made that is hardly proof enough for such an accusation kahlan stood unmoving cyrilla was too upset at that moment to wonder what thoughts could have been going on behind those green eyes kahlans voice finally came without emotion my father taught me that the keltans will strike for only two reasons first out of jealousy and second when they are tempted by weakness he said that either way they will always first test by trying to kill the strongest highestranking of their opponents they can galea is now the strongest it has ever been thanks to you and the midsummer festival is the mark of that strength you are the cause of that jealousy and a symbol of that strength my father also said that you must always keep an eye to the keltans and never offer them your back he said that if you thwart them in the first attempt it deepens their hunger for your blood and they will always lie in wait for any weakness so they may strike cyrillas smoldering rage at being beguiled by drefan made her lash out without considering her words i would not know what our father said i never had the benefit of his teachings he was taken from us by a confessor kahlans face transformed from the calm cold blankness of a confessor to a look of ageless knowing benevolence that seemed well beyond her years perhaps queen cyrilla the good spirits chose to spare you the things he would have taught you and had him teach me instead be thankful they have looked kindly upon you i doubt the things he taught would have brought you any joy they bring me none save perhaps that they have helped me preserve your life this night please do not be bitter be at peace with yourself and cherish what you do have the love of your people they are your family one and all kahlan started to turn away but cyrilla gently caught her arm and drew her aside as men bent to carry the body from the hall kahlan forgive me her fingers worked a ribbon at her waist i have wrongly directed my anger over drefan to you i understand cyrilla in your place i would probably have reacted the same i could see your feelings for drefan in your eyes i would not expect you to be happy over what i have just done forgive me for bringing anguish to your home on a day that should be only joyful but i greatly feared the results of delay kahlan had made her feel like the younger sister she looked anew at the tall beautiful young woman standing before her kahlan was of the age to have a mate perhaps she had already chosen one for all she knew her mother must have been about this old when she took cyrillas father as hers so young looking into those depthless green eyes cyrilla let go of some of her anger over drefan this young woman her sister had just saved her life knowing full well it would bring no thanks and would probably earn her only deeper fear and possibly undying hatred from her half sister so young cyrilla felt shame at her own selfishness she smiled at kahlan for the first time surely the things wyborn taught you werent all grim he taught me only killing whom to kill when to kill and how to kill be thankful you know no more of his lessons and that you have never needed what he taught i have and i fear i have only begun to use what he taught me cyrilla frowned kahlan was a confessor not a killer why would you say such a thing we believe we have uncovered a conspiracy i will not speak of it until i know its nature and have proof but i think it may bring a storm beyond any you or i have ever seen before cyrilla touched her sisters cheek the only time in her life she had ever done so kahlan please stay enjoy at my side what is left of the festival i would love to have you with me kahlans face returned to the calm mask of a confessor i cannot it would only ruin your peoples light heart to have me present thank you for the offer but you should be able to enjoy your day with your people without my spoiling it further nonsense it would spoil nothing i would like nothing more than that it were so but it is not remember what our father said keep a wary eye to the keltans i must be gone there is trouble gathering and i must see that the confessors find its cause before i return to aydindril i will pay a visit to kelton and deliver my suspicions and a warning that what has happened not be repeated i will inform the council of the trouble of this day so that all eyes will be on the keltans what did they teach in aydindril that could turn what looked to be porcelain to iron thank you mother confessor was all she had been able to say to offer her sister the honor of her office as she watched her stride off her wizard in tow that had been the most intimate conversation she had ever had with her half sister the midsummer festival had not held much joy for her after kahlan had left so young yet so old at the council today cyrilla had been surprised to find that the mother confessor was not presiding over the council no one knew where she was it was to be expected she would have been absent when aydindril fell she was frequently gone in her capacity as a confessor and had probably been doing what she could to halt the threat from dhara all the confessors had fiercely fought the hordes from dhara she was sure kahlan would have done no less using in part what her father had taught her but that she had not immediately returned to aydindril when dhara withdrew was worrisome perhaps she had not yet had time to return cyrilla feared kahlan might have been killed at the hands of a quad dhara had sentenced all the confessors to death and hunted them relentlessly galea had offered refuge to the confessors but the quads implacable and without mercy had found them anyway worse absent the mother confessor there had not been a wizard overseeing the council meeting cyrillas flesh had prickled with apprehension at seeing no wizard she recognized that the absence of a confessor and a wizard created a dangerous vacuum in the council chambers but when she saw who presided over the council session her apprehension sharpened to alarm sitting in the first chair was high prince fyren of kelton the very man she had come to seek deliverance from sat in judgment to see him sitting in the chair that had always belonged only to the mother confessor was startling the council it would seem had not been put back to the way it should have been nonetheless she ignored him and instead pressed her demands to the rest of the council in turn prince fyren stood and accused her of treason against the midlands he had the unmitigated gall to accuse her of the very thing of which he was guilty further prince fyren assured the council that kelton was committing no aggression but was acting only in selfdefense against a greedy neighbor in a tirade he lectured them on the evils of women in positions of power the council took his word for everything they allowed her to present no evidence she stood stunned and speechless as the council heard fyrens charges and without pause found her guilty sentencing her to be beheaded where was kahlan where were the wizards lady bevinviers vision had proven true cyrilla should have listened or at least taken some precaution kahlans warning too had proven true kelton had first tried to strike out of jealousy and now years later they had renewed the attack when they saw tempting weakness the galean guard stood in the great courtyard ready to immediately escort cyrilla home she had needed to set about readying galeas defenses until the forces expected to be sent by the council could arrive but it was not to be at the pronouncement of sentence she heard the terrible shouts of battle outside battle she thought bitterly it was not a battle but a slaughter her troops had waited in the great courtyard without their weapons as a sign of respect and deference an open gesture of acquiescence to the rule of the council of the midlands queen cyrilla stood at the window a guard at each arm shaking in horror as she watched the slaughter a few of her men managed to take up weapons by overpowering their attackers and put up a valiant struggle but they had no chance they were outnumbered five to one and were by and large without means to defend themselves she couldnt tell if in the chaos any escaped she hoped they had she prayed harold had the white snow that lay upon the ground was turned to a sea of red she was aghast at the butchery there was mercy only in its swiftness cyrilla had been made to kneel before the council as prince fyren took up her long hair in his fist and with his own sword sliced it away she had knelt in silence her head held proudly up in honor of her people in honor of the men she had just seen murdered while he cut her hair as short as the lowest kitchen scullion what an hour before had seemed to be the near end of her peoples ordeal had become instead the mere beginning the powerful fingers on her arms jerked her to a halt before a small iron door she winced in pain a crude ladder twice her height lay on its side against the wall on the opposite side of the corridor again the guard with the keys came forward to work the lock he cursed the mechanism complaining that its lack of use made it stiff all the guards seemed to be keltans she had seen none of the aydindril home guard most she knew had been killed in aydindrils fall to dhara at last the man drew back the door to reveal a dark pit her legs felt as if they wanted to turn liquid only the hands gripping her arms held her up they were going to put her in that dark pit with the rats she willed her legs solid again she was the queen but her pulse would not slow how dare you put a lady in a ratinfested hole prince fyren stepped close to the black maw one hand on a hip held back his unbuttoned royal blue coat with his other hand he hefted a torch from a bracket rats is that what worries you my lady rats he gave her a derisive smile he was too young to be so well schooled at insolence had her arms been free she would have slapped him let me allay your fears queen cyrilla he tossed the torch into the blackness as it dropped it illuminated faces a husky fist caught the torch there were men in the pit at least six maybe ten prince fyren leaned into the doorway his voice echoing into the hole the queen worries there may be rats down there rats came a coarse voice from the pit there be no rats down here not anymore we et them all a hand with white ruffles at the wrist still rested on prince fyrens hip his voice taunted with feigned concern there you see the man says there are no rats does that ease your apprehension my lady her eyes darted between the flickering torchlight below and fyren who are those men why just a few murderers and rapists awaiting their beheading same as you quite vile animals actually what with all ive had to attend to i havent had time to see to their sentences im afraid being down in the pit for so long puts them in an ugly disposition his grin returned but im sure having a queen among them will mellow their mood cyrilla had to force her voice to come i demand my own cell the grin vanished an eyebrow lifted demand you demand he suddenly struck her across the face you demand nothing you are nothing but a common criminal a loathsome murderer of my people you have been tried and convicted her cheek burned with the sting of his handprint you cant put me in there with them her whispered entreaty was hopeless she knew but she couldnt keep it from her lips fyren rolled his shoulders straightening his back and coat as he regained his composure his voice rose to those below you men wouldnt defile a lady would you soft laughter echoed up from the pit why course not we wouldnt want to be beheaded twice the coarse voice deepened into cold menace well treat her real nice like cyrilla could taste warm salty blood at the corner of her mouth fyren you cant do this i demand to be beheaded at once there you go again demanding why cant it be done now let it be done now he drew his hand back to slap her again but then let it lower as his simper returned you see at first you proclaimed your innocence and didnt want to be executed but already you are reconsidering after a few days down there with them you will be begging to be beheaded you will eagerly confess your treason before all those gathered to witness your punishment besides i have other matters to attend to i cant be bothered right now you will be put to death when i deem i have the time with rising terror she was only now beginning to grasp the full extent of the fate that awaited her in the pit tears burned her eyes please dont do this to me im begging you prince fyren smoothed the white ruffles at his throat and spoke softly i tried to make it easy for you cyrilla because youre a woman drefans knife would have been quick you would have suffered little that way i would never have allowed a man in your place such mercy but you wouldnt have it the easy way you allowed the mother confessor to interfere you allowed yet another woman to infringe on the dominion of men women dont have the stomach for ruling theyre ill suited to the task they should never be allowed to command armies or to meddle in the affairs of nations things had to be set right drefan died trying to do it the easy way now we do it the other way he nodded to a man behind him the guard hauled the ladder to the doorway to lower an end into the pit as the hands on her arms moved her to the edge the other men drew swords apparently to prevent any in the pit from thinking to come up the ladder cyrilla could think of no way to stop this she voiced a protest knowing it was foolish but unable to check her panic i am a queen a lady i will not be made to scurry down a rickety ladder prince fyren blinked at her ludicrous objection but then motioned with his hand for the man to pull the ladder back from the doorway he gave a mocking bow as you wish my lady he rose giving a slight nod to the men holding her arms they released her before she thought to move a muscle he rammed the heel of his hand into her chest between her breasts the painful blow knocked her off balance she toppled backward through the opening down into the pit as she plummeted she fully expected to strike the stone floor and be killed she resigned to it with a last gasp as the futile flow of her past glory whirled before her minds eye had it all come to this all for nought to have her skull cracked like an egg fallen from a table to the floor but hands caught her hands were everywhere upon her unexpectedly upon the most indecent places her eyes opened to see the light of the doorway go dark with a loud reverberating clang faces were all around her in the haunting flickering torchlight scruffy whiskered faces ugly sweaty wicked faces cunning black eyes played over her hungry humorless grins showed crooked sharp teeth so many teeth her throat clenched shut locking her breath in her lungs her mind refused to function and flashed with confusing useless images she was pressed to the floor the stone was cold and painfully rough against her back grunts and low squeals assailed her from every side men were tight together above her against her struggles her limbs were pushed and pulled as the men willed clutching clawlike hands ripped at her fine dress and pinched brutally at suddenly shockingly exposed flesh and then cyrilla did something she hadnt done since she was a little girl she screamed chapter except for her thumb and forefinger idly turning the smooth round bone on her necklace kahlan stood motionless as she studied the sprawling city the surrounding rugged slopes seemed to tenderly cradle the buildings that filled nearly the length and breadth of the gently rolling valley steeply pitched slate roofs pricked the land within the ribbon of wall with the higher peaks of the palace off to the northern end but not so much as a wisp of smoke rose from the hundreds of stone chimneys into the clear air she saw no movement the arrowstraight south road leading to the main gate the smaller meandering roads that branched off to end at the lesser gates and those which bypassed the outer walls altogether to lead north were deserted the sloping mountain meadow before her lay buried beneath a white winter blanket a light breeze liberated the burden of snow from a sagging branch of a nearby pine freeing a sparkling cloud to curl away the same breeze ruffled the white wolf fur of the thick mantle snugged against her cheek but she hardly noticed prindin and tossidin had made the mantle for her to keep her warm on their way northeast through the bitter winter storms that raked the bleak land they had traveled wolves were fearful of people and rarely let themselves be seen so she knew little of their habits the brothers arrows had found their mark where she saw nothing if she hadnt seen richard shoot she would have thought the shots impossible the brothers were almost as good as he though she had always held a vague enmity for wolves she had never actually been harried by them since richard had told her of their close family packs she had come to feel an affection for them she hadnt wanted the two brothers to kill wolves to make the warm cape but they insisted that it was necessary and in the end she had acquiesced it had sickened her to watch the carcasses being skinned revealing the red muscle beneath and white of bone and sinew the substance of being so elegant when filled with life and spirit so suddenly morbid when left with neither as the brothers went about the grisly task she could think only of brophy the man she had touched with her power only to have it prove him innocent he had been turned to a wolf by her wizard giller to release him from the power of a confessors magic so he could start over in a new life she had wondered at how saddened these wolves families must have been when they never returned as she knew brophys mate and pack must have been when he was killed she had seen so much killing she was weary nearly to tears of it at the way it seemed to go on without an end in sight at least the three men had felt no pride or joy at having killed the magnificent animals and had said a prayer to the spirits of their brother wolves as they had called them we should not be doing this chandalen grumbled he was leaning on his spear watching her she knew but she didnt take her eyes from the silent city below the toostill scene his tone was not as sharp as it usually was it betrayed his awe at seeing a city the size of ebinissia he had never before been far from the mud peoples lands had never seen this many buildings especially none of such grand scale when he had first taken in the size of it his brown eyes had stared in silent wonder he could not conceal and his acid tongue for once had forsaken him having lived his whole life in the village out on the plains it must look to him as if he were seeing the result of magic not mere human effort she felt a small pang of sorrow for him and the two brothers that their simple view of the outside world had to be shattered well they would see more before this journey was ended that would astonish them further chandalen i have spent a great effort nearly every waking moment teaching you and prindin and tossidin to speak my language no one where we go will speak yours it is for your own good that i do this you are free to believe that i am being spiteful or that i am doing as i say being mindful of your safety outside your land but either way you will speak to me in the tongue i have taught you his tone tightened but still could not disguise how humbled he was at seeing a great city for the first time it was far from the greatest he would see perhaps too it betrayed something she had never before sensed from him fear i am to take you to aydindril not this place we should not be using our time at this place his inflection implied he thought a place such as this could be only evil squinting against the blindingly bright sun on white snow she saw the two figures far below starting up the slope she let the round bone slip from her fingers im the mother confessor its my duty to protect all the people of the midlands the same way i work to safeguard the mud people you bring no help to my people only trouble his protest seemed more habit than a heartfelt challenge she answered it in a quiet tired murmur enough chandalen thankfully he didnt press the argument but turned his anger elsewhere prindin and tossidin should not come up the hill in the open like that i have taught them not to be so stupid if they were boys i would strike their bottoms anyone can see where they go will you do as i say and come out of the open now she let him shepherd her back into the shroud of trees not because she thought it necessary but because she wanted to let him know she respected his efforts to protect her despite his animosity at being forced to go on this journey he had done his duty watching over her constantly as had the two brothers they with smiles and concern he with a scowl and suspicion all three made her feel like a precious fragile cargo that must be tended at all times the brothers she knew were sincere chandalen she was sure saw his mission only as a task that must be performed no matter how onerous we should go quickly from here he pressed again kahlan withdrew a hand from under the fur mantle and pulled a stray strand of her long hair back from her face it is my duty to know what has happened here you said your duty was to go to aydindril as richard with the temper asked kahlan turned away without answering moving deeper into the snowcrusted trees she missed richard more than she could bear every time she closed her eyes she saw his face as it had looked when he thought she had betrayed him she wanted to drop to her knees and let out the scream that seemed to be always there trapped just below the surface trying to find a way past her restraint a scream born of her horror at what she had done but what else could she have done if what she had learned was true and the veil to the underworld was torn and richard was in fact the only one who could close it and if the collar was the only thing that could save his life and give him the chance to close the veil then she had had no choice how could she have made any other decision how could richard ever respect her if she didnt face her responsibilities to the greater good the richard she loved would eventually realize that he had to but if any of it was not true then she had delivered the man she loved into his worst nightmare for nothing she wondered again if richard often looked at the lock of her hair she had given him and thought of her she hoped that he could find it in himself to understand and forgive her she wanted so much to tell him how much she loved him she yearned to hold him to her she wanted only to get to aydindril to zedd for help but she had to know what had happened here she stiffened her back with resolve she was the mother confessor she had intended to skirt ebinissia but for the last two days they had been coming across the frozen corpses of women never any men only women from young to old children to grandmothers most were half naked some without clothes at all and in the dead of winter while most had been alone a few were together huddled in frozen death too exhausted or too frightened or too disoriented to have sought shelter they had run from ebinissia not in disorderly haste but in panic choosing to freeze to death rather than remain most too had been badly abused before they had scattered in every direction into the mountainous countryside kahlan knew what had been done to them what had made them make the choice they did the three men knew too but none would voice it aloud she pulled her warm mantle tighter around herself this atrocity couldnt have been at the hands of the armies from dhara it was far too recent the troops from dhara had been called home surely they wouldnt have done this after they had been told the war was ended unable to stand for another moment not knowing what fate had befallen ebinissia she pushed her bow farther up on her shoulder and started down the hillside her leg muscles were at long last used to the widefooted gait needed to walk on the snowshoes the men had made from willow and sinew chandalen charged after her you must not go down there there could be dangerous danger she corrected as she hitched her pack up higher if there was danger prindin and tossidin would not be out in the open you may come or you may wait here but im going down there knowing argument was useless he followed in a rare fit of silence the bright afternoon sun brought no warmth to the bitterly cold day there was usually wind at the fringe of the rangshada mountains but thankfully there was little this day for a change it hadnt snowed for several days and they had been able to make better time in the clear weather still with every breath she took the air felt as if it were turning the inside of her nose to ice she intercepted prindin and tossidin halfway down the slope they brought themselves to a halt before her leaning on their spears breathing heavily which was unusual for them as nothing seemed to tire them but they were unaccustomed to the altitude their faces were pale and their handsome twin smiles long gone please mother confessor prindin said pausing to catch his breath from the strenuous climb you must not go to that place the ancestor spirits of those people have abandoned them kahlan untied a waterskin from her waist and pulled it from under her mantle where her bodys heat kept the water from freezing she held it up to prindin urging him to take a drink before questioning him what did you see you didnt go into the city did you i told you not to go inside the walls prindin handed the waterskin to his panting brother no we stay hidden as you told us we do not go inside but we do not need to he licked a drop of water from his lower lip we see enough from outside she took back the waterskin when tossidin finished and replaced the stopper did you see any people tossidin stole a quick glance over his shoulder down the hill we see many people prindin wiped his nose on the back of his hand as he looked from his brother to her dead people how many dead from what tossidin tugged loose the thong holding his fur mantle tight at his neck dead from fighting most are men with weapons swords and spears and bows there are more than i know the words to count i have never seen that many men in my whole life i have not seen that many men there has been war here war and killing of those defeated kahlan stared at them for a moment as horror threatened to choke off her breath she had hoped that somehow the people of ebinissia had escaped that they had fled a war had the dharan forces done this after the war was ended or was it something else her muscles at last unlocked and she started down the hill the mantle billowing open letting in the icy air her heart pounded with dread at what had befallen the people of ebinissia i must go down there to see what has happened please mother confessor do not go prindin called after her it is bad to see the three men jumped to follow as she marched down the hill the slope speeding her effort i have seen dead people before they began encountering the sprawled corpses apparently the sites of skirmishes a good distance from the city walls snow had drifted against them partially covering them in one place a hand reached up from the snow as if the man below were drowning and reaching for air most had not been touched by animals or birds there being an overabundance for scavengers all were soldiers of the galean army frozen in death where they had fallen bloodsoaked clothes frozen rocksolid to them ghastly wounds frozen open at the south wall where huge oak doors crisscrossed with iron strapping had stood was a gaping hole through the stone its edges melted and burned black kahlan stood staring at rock melted like wax from a candle that had guttered she knew of only one power that could do that wizards fire her mind fought to understand what she was seeing she knew what the results of wizards fire looked like but there were no more wizards except zedd and she guessed richard but this would not have been zedds deed outside the walls off to either side headless corpses were heaped in huge frozen mounds heads stared out from less orderly piles of their own swords and shields and spears were discarded to separate heaps looking like great dead steel porcupines this had been a mass execution carried out at a number of stations at once to handle the numbers more efficiently all were galean soldiers as she stared in numb shock at the splayed limbs draped over their fellows under them kahlan spoke softly to the three men behind her the word you did not know to use to count this many is thousand there are perhaps five thousand dead men here gently prindin planted the butt end of his spear in the snow giving it an uneasy twist i did not know there was a word needed to count this many men his fist twisted the spear again and his voice lowered to a whisper this will be a bad place when the warm weather comes it is a bad place now his brother murmured to himself in his own tongue kahlan knew this was the least of the dead she knew the tactics of defense for ebinissia the walls were not secure fortifications the way they had been in times long ago as the city had grown in the prosperity of the midlands alliance the older stronger fortified walls had been torn down and the stone used to build these newer more encompassing outer walls but they had been built less secure than in the past they were more a symbol of the size and pride of the crown city than a strong defensible perimeter under attack the gates would have been closed with the toughest most experienced troops on the outside to stop the attackers before they had a chance to reach the walls the real defense for ebinissia was the surrounding mountains whose narrow passes prevented a broad attack under darken rahls order dharan forces had laid siege to ebinissia for two months but the defenders outside the walls were able to hold them back in the surrounding passes pin them down and harry them relentlessly until the attackers finally withdrew licking their wounds in search of easier prey though the ebinissians had prevailed it had been at a great cost of lives to the defenders had darken rahl been less concerned with finding the boxes he could have sent greater numbers and maybe overrun the defenders in the passes but he didnt this time someone had these headless men were a part of that outer defensive ring backs to the wall they had been defeated and captured and then executed before the walls were breached apparently as a demonstration to those still inside to terrorize them to panic them into an ineffectual defense she knew that what was inside the walls would be worse the dead women they had been finding told her that much out of habit and without even realizing it she had put on the calm face that showed nothing the face of a confessor as her mother had taught her prindin tossidin i want you two to go around the outside of the walls i want to know what else is on the outside i want to know everything about what has happened here i want to know when this was done where the attackers came from and where they went when they were finished chandalen and i will go inside meet us back here when you are finished the brothers went quickly at her direction their heads close together as they whispered to one another while pointing analyzing tracks and signs they understood with hardly more than a glance chandalen walked silently at her side his bow with an arrow nocked and tension to the string at the ready as she stepped over rubble and moved on through the yawning hole none of the three men had objected to her instructions they were she knew astonished at the size of the city but more than that they were overwhelmed at the enormity of what had happened here they respected her obligation to the dead chandalens eyes ignored the bodies that lay everywhere and watched instead the shaded openings and alleyways among the small daubandwattle houses that were homes to the farmers and sheepherders who worked the land closer to the city there were no fresh prints in the snow nothing alive had been here recently kahlan chose the proper streets and chandalen stayed close at her right shoulder half a step behind she didnt stop to inspect the dead laying everywhere all looked to have died the same way killed in a fierce battle these people were defeated by great numbers chandalen said in a quiet tone many thousands as you called it they had no chance to win why do you say that they are bunched together between the buildings this is a bad place to have to fight but in a closedin place like this that is the only way that is the way i would try to defend against a larger number by blocking the enemy from spreading out behind me to trap me greater numbers would not be as much good in the small passageways i would try to keep the enemy from spreading out and come at them from all sides so they could not attack as they wished but must be always in fear of where i would be next you must not meet the enemy as they wish you to especially when they greatly outnumber you there are old men and boys among the soldiers boys and old men would not come to fight beside chandalen unless they saw it was a war to the death and i was greatly outnumbered for these men to stand and fight against vastly greater numbers they must have been brave old men and boys would not have come to help such brave men if the enemy were not so great she knew chandalen was right everyone had seen or heard the executions outside the walls they knew defeat was death the bodies were felled like reeds before a great wind as they ascended the rise to where the old city walls had stood the dead were more numerous it looked that they had fallen back trying to make a stand from higher ground it had done them no good they had been overrun all the dead were defenders none were the corpses of attackers kahlan knew that some believed leaving the dead where they fell in defeating an enemy augured ill luck in future battles and further that it abandoned their spirits to retribution by the spirits of those defeated likewise they believed that if they left their dead at the site of a defeat the spirits of their fallen comrades would live on to plague their enemies whoever had done this must have believed such and dragged their own dead away from the bodies of those they had vanquished kahlan knew of several peoples who believed that the act of dying in battle could bring about such thaumaturgy one nation above all sat at the head of her roster as they skirted an overturned wagon its load of firewood spilled in a heap chandalen paused beneath a small wooden sign carved with a leafy plant next to a mortar and pestle with a hand he shielded his eyes from the sunlight and looked into the long narrow shop set back a few feet from the buildings to each side what is this place kahlan walked past him through the splintered doorframe its an herb shop the counter was covered with broken glass jars and dried herbs all scattered together in a useless mess only two glass lids remained unbroken among the pale green debris this is where people went to get herbs and remedies behind the counter the wall cabinet which reached from floor to ceiling and almost the entire length of the narrow shop had held hundreds of small wooden drawers their patina darkened by the countless touches of fingers the ones still left in place were smashed in with a mace the drawers and their contents on the floor had been crushed underfoot chandalen squatted and pulled open the few drawers near the bottom that had remained untouched inspecting briefly their stores before sliding each drawer closed again nissel would be how do you say astonished astonished kahlan answered she would be astonished to see this many healing plants this is a crime to destroy things that help people she watched him pull open drawers and then slide them closed a crime she agreed he pulled open another drawer and gasped he squatted motionless for a moment before reverently lifting a bundle of miniature plants tied at their stems with a bit of string the tiny dry leaves were a dusky greenish brown with crimson veining a low whistle came from between his teeth quassin doe he whispered kahlan eyed the shadowed back of the shop as her vision adjusted to the darkness she saw no bodies the proprietor must have fled before he was killed or maybe he was one who had stood with the army against the invaders what is quassin doe chandalen turned the bundle over in his palm his eyes fixed unblinking on it quassin doe can save your life if you take tenstep poison by mistake or if you are quick enough when shot by an arrow with the poison on it how can you take it by mistake many poison bandu leaves must be chewed for a long time and made wet in your mouth before being cooked until they become a thick paste sometimes if you swallow some of the wetness in your mouth by accident or chew too long it can make you sick he opened a buckskin waist pouch and showed her a small carved bone lidded box inside was a dark paste this is tenstep poison we put on our arrows we make it from the bandu if you ate a very little of this it would make you sick if you ate a little more you would be a long time to die if you ate more you would die quick but no one would eat it after it is made and put in here he slipped the box of poison back in his pouch so you could take some of the quassin doe and it would make you well if you accidentally swallowed some of the bandu when you were chewing its leaves to make the poison he nodded in answer to her question but if you were shot with a tenstep arrow wouldnt you die before you could take the quassin doe chandalen turned the bundle of plants in his fingers maybe sometimes a man will scratch himself with his own tenstep arrow by not meaning to and he can take the quassin doe and he will be well again if you are shot with a poison arrow sometimes you will have time to save yourself tenstep arrows only work quick if you are shot in the neck then you have no time to take the quassin doe you will die too quick but if you are shot in another place maybe your leg the poison takes longer to work and you have time to take the quassin doe what if you arent near to nissel so she could give it to you you would die if you were out on the plains hunting and you scratched yourself accidentally with a poison arrow all hunters used to carry a few leaves with them so they may take it if they scratched themselves or were shot with an arrow and had time if there is not much poison on the arrow like if it has not much on it because it is used to hunt small animals you have longer in times long ago when there was war our men would swallow quassin doe just before a battle so the enemys tenstep arrows would not poison them he shook his head sadly but this is much trouble to get the last time we traded for this much every man in the village had to make three bows and two fists of arrows and all the women had to make bowls it is gone now for a long time years the people we traded with have been able to find no more two men have died since we no longer have it my people would trade much to have this much again kahlan stood over him watching him gently place it back in the drawer take it chandalen give it to your people they have need of it he slowly slid the drawer closed i cannot it would be wrong to take it from another people even if they are dead it does not belong to my people it belongs to the people here kahlan squatted down next to him pulled open the drawer and lifted out the little bundle she found a square of cloth lying on the floor nearby used for packaging purchases and wrapped the quassin doe plants take it she pushed the bundle into his hand i know the people of this city i will repay them for what i have taken since i will pay for it it belongs to me now take it it is my gift for the trouble i have caused your people he stared at the cloth parcel in his hand it is too valuable for a gift a gift of such great value would bind us to an obligation to you then it is not a gift but my payment to you and prindin and tossidin for guarding me on this journey you three are risking your lives to protect me that is a debt i owe you that is greater than this payment you will owe me no more obligation with a frown he studied the bundle a moment and then bounced it twice in his hand before tucking it in the buckskin pouch at his waist he tied the flap closed by its rawhide thong and stood then this is in trade for what we do we owe you no obligation beyond this journey none she said sealing the bargain the two of them walked on through the silent streets past the shops and inns of the old city quarter every door every window was broken in shards of glass sparkled in the sunlight shimmering tears for the dead the invading horde had swept through every building searching out anything alive how do this many thousands all living in this one place find land to feed their families there could not be enough game to hunt or fields for all to plant kahlan tried to see the city through his eyes it must be a great puzzle to him they dont all hunt or plant the land the people who lived here specialized specialized what is this it means that different people have different jobs they work at one thing they use silver or gold to buy the things they need that they dont grow or make themselves where do they get this silver or gold people who want the thing they specialize in pay for it with silver or gold and where do these others get this silver or gold they get it from people who pay them for the things they do chandalen looked at her skeptically why do they not trade it would be easier to trade well in a way it is trading often the person who wants what you have has nothing you want so they give you money silver or gold made into flat round disks called coins instead then you can use the money to buy things you need buy chandalen seemed to test the strange word with his tongue as he looked off down a street to their right while shaking his head in disbelief why would people work then why would they not just go and get this silver or gold money some do they hunt silver and gold but that is hard work too gold is hard to find and dig out of the ground that is why it is used for money because it is rare if it were easy to find like grains of sand then no one would take it in trade if money were easy to get or to make it would become worthless and then in the end this system of trade with worthless money would fail and everyone would starve he came to a halt with a frown what is this money made from what is this silver or gold you speak of she didnt stop with him and he had to take a few bounding steps to catch back up with her gold is the medallion the necklace that the bantak gave as a gift to the mud people to show they did not wish to make war that is made of gold chandalen nodded with a knowing grunt kahlan halted this time do you know where the bantak got that much gold chandalen swept his gaze across the slate rooftops of course they got it from us kahlan gripped his arm covered with his mantle and pulled him around what do you mean they got it from you he tensed at her touch he didnt like her hand a confessors hand on him that the fur mantle separated actual contact of flesh was of no consequence their flesh was close enough if she relaxed her restraint of the power that thin piece of hide would be no impediment kahlan had loosed her power through armor before she released her grip and he visibly relaxed chandalen where did the mud people get that much gold he looked at her as if she were a child asking where you might find dirt from the holes in the ground in our land to the north where it is rocky and nothing much will grow or live there are holes in the ground they have this gold in them it is a bad place the air is hot and bad it is said that men die if they stay too long in the ground the yellow metal is in these deep holes it is too soft to make good weapons so it is of no use he dismissed its importance with a wave of his hand but the bantak say their ancestors spirits like the look of the yellow metal and so we let them come onto our land and go in the holes so they may get it to make things their ancestors spirits may like to look upon when they come to this world chandalen do others know of these holes in the ground of the gold that is in them he shrugged we do not let outsiders come to our land but i told you it is too soft to make weapons with so it is of no use it pleases the bantak and they are good traders with us so we let them take what they want they do not take much though because it is a bad place to go into no one would want to go there except the bantak to please their ancestors spirits how could she explain it to him he didnt understand the ways of the outside world chandalen you must never use this gold he made a face that said he had already explained how useless it was and no one would want it you may think it is useless but others would kill to get it if people knew you had gold on your land they would swarm over you to get it the craving for gold makes men crazy and they would do anything to get it they would kill mud people chandalen straightened with a smug expression he took his hand from the bowstring and tapped his chest i and my men protect our people we would keep the outsiders away kahlan swept her arm around taking in the hundreds upon hundreds of dead around her against this many against thousands chandalen had never seen this many people he understood little of the numbers that lived outside his lands thousands who would never stop coming until they swept you aside his eyes followed the arc her arm had taken his brow wrinkled with the frown of a worry unfamiliar to him his arrogance evaporating as he took in the dead our ancestors spirits have warned us not to speak of the holes in the ground with the bad air we only let the bantak go there no one else see that it stays that way she said or they will come and steal it that would be wrong to steal from a people he put renewed tension to the bowstring as she let out a noisy breath of frustration if i make a bow to trade everyone knows it is the work of chandalen because it is such a fine bow if anyone steals it everyone knows what it is and where it came from and the thief would be caught and be made to give it back maybe he would be sent away from his people how do these people tell who the money belongs to if it is taken by a thief kahlans mind reeled from the effort of trying to explain such things to chandalen at least it was keeping her from having to think about the dead all about her she started walking again through the snow having to step over a mans back because there was no way around they were fallen so close it is difficult because of this people guard their money if anyone is caught stealing the punishment is severe to discourage thieving how are thieves punished if they didnt steal much and are lucky they might be locked in a small room until their family can make reparations for what they stole locked what is this a lock is way of barring a door the stone rooms that thieves are placed in have a door they are not able to open from the inside it has a lock on it and you must have a key the right key to open it so they cannot get out chandalen checked the side street beyond a silversmiths shop as they continued up the main road i would rather be put to death than be locked in a room if the thief stole from the wrong person or is unlucky that is what happens to him chandalen grunted she didnt think she was doing a very good job of explaining things to him he seemed to think the whole scheme unworkable our way is better we make what we want everyone makes what they need this specializing way is not our way we trade only for a few things our way is better you do the same as these people chandalen you may not realize it but you do no each person knows many things we teach all our children to know how to do everything they need you specialize youre a hunter and more than that youre a protector to your people she nodded once again to the dead around her some stared back with flat eyes these men were soldiers they specialized at protecting their people they gave their lives trying to protect their people youre the same as they a soldier youre strong you are good with a bow and a spear and you are good at discovering and preparing to thwart the various ways others would try to harm your people chandalen thought this over a moment as he stopped briefly to knock a heavy clump of snow from the binding of his snowshoe but that is only me because i am so strong and wise others of my people do not specialize everyone specializes chandalen nissel the healer she specializes at helping sick or injured people she spends most of her time helping others how does she feed herself those she helps give her what she needs and if there is no one to help so she can be offered food by them then others who have enough offer some of theirs so nissel will be well fed and ready to help us you see those she helps pay her with tava bread but its the same thing almost as they do here with money because she specializes in a service to the village everyone helps a little so she will be there for the village when there is need of her here thats called a tax when everyone pays a little toward the good of the group to help support those who work for all the people is this how you get your food the people all give for you like we do when you come to make trouble for us she was relieved that for the first time he didnt say it with enmity yes chandalen eyed empty secondfloor windows as they walked on among buildings that were becoming larger and more ornate the double ironstraphinged doors to an inn on their left were broken in and tables chairs pots dishes and linen embroidered with red roses apparently to echo the inns name the red rose had been thrown into the street where they were half covered over with the snow through the empty doorway she could see the body of an apronclad kitchen boy sprawled on the floor his eyes staring up at the ceiling frozen with the terror of his last vision he couldnt have been over twelve but that is just the hunters and nissel chandalen added after some thought others of us do not do this specializing everyone does to some degree the women bake the tava bread the men make the weapons nature is that way too some plants grow where it is wet some where it is dry some animals eat grass some leaves some bugs and some other animals every thing plays its part women have the babies and men she halted fists at her sides staring at the countless bodies fallen all around her she swept her arm out and men it would seem are here to kill everything you see chandalen womens specialty is to bring forth life and mens specialty is to take it away kahlan clenched her fist against her stomach she was dangerously close to losing her composure nausea swept through her her head spun chandalen stole a glimpse at her from the corner of his eye the bird man would say not to judge all by what some do and women do not make life alone men are part of that too kahlan gulped cold air with a struggle she started off again shuffling her snowshoes ahead chandalen let her set a quicker pace as he walked beside her she turned them up a street lined with fine shops as she moved up and then down a snowdrift he pointed with his bow seeming to look for an excuse to change the subject why do they have wooden people here a headless mannequin rested at an angle against a windowsill tipped halfway out of a shop the elaborate blue dress the mannequin wore was trimmed with white beads draped in layers about the waist glad to have a diversion from the thoughts swirling in her head kahlan changed direction a little toward the mannequin in the blue dress this is a tailors shop the people who owned this shop specialized in making clothes this wooden person is simply a form to display what they make so others may know the fine work they do its a demonstration of pride in their work she stopped before the large window all the panes of glass were broken out a few of the yellowpainted mullions hung crookedly from the top of the frame the shade of blue of the gorgeous gown reminded kahlan of her wedding dress she could feel the blood pounding in the veins of her neck as she swallowed back a cry chandalen watched both directions up and down the street as her hand slowly reached out to touch the frozen blue fabric her vision focused past the mannequin into the shop where a square of sunlight fell across the snowdusted floor and up and over a low work counter her hand faltered a dead man with a balding head was pinned to the wall by a spear through his chest a woman lay sprawled facedown over the counter her dress and underskirts bunched up around her waist exposing blue flesh a pair of tailors scissors jutted from her back in the gloom at the far end of the room stood another mannequin in a fine mans coat the front of the dark coat was shredded with hundreds of small cuts the soldiers had evidently used the mannequin as a target for knife throwing while they waited their turn on the woman apparently when they were finished with her they stabbed her to death with her scissors kahlan twisted away from the shop to find herself facetoface with chandalen his was red there was menace in his eyes not all men are the same i would cut the throat of any man of mine if he did such a thing kahlan had no answer for him and suddenly wasnt in the mood to talk as she started off again she loosened the mantle at her neck needing the feel of cold air in silence but for the low baleful moan of the breeze between the buildings they slogged past stables of horses their throats all cut and past inns and grand houses their cornices high overhead shading them from the bright slanting sunlight fluted wooden columns to each side of one door had been hacked at with a sword seemingly for no purpose but to deface the elegance of the home it was colder in the shade but she didnt care they stepped over corpses that lay facedown in the snow with wounds in their backs and around overturned wagons and coaches and dead horses and dead dogs it all melted into a meaningless madness of destruction eyes cast to the ground before her she trudged on through the snow the cold air bit into her flesh and she pulled her mantle closed once more the cold was sapping her of not only warmth but strength with grim determination she put one foot in front of the other continuing on toward her destination hoping somehow that she would never reach it with the frozen dead of ebinissia all about she filled her crushing loneliness with a silent prayer please dear spirits keep richard warm chapter naked under the suns fury the parched dead flat ground stretched endlessly before them in the distance offering up shimmering images to waver and dance in the suns furnace glare like phantom hostages surrendered to an omnipotent foe behind the fractured hills ended in a bank of rocky rubble the silence was as oppressive as the heat richard wiped sweat from his brow on the back of his sleeve the leather of his saddle creaked as he shifted his weight while he waited bonnie and the other two horses waited too their ears pricked ahead as they occasionally pawed the cracked dry earth and voiced apprehensive snorts sister verna sat motionless atop jessup scrutinizing the nothingness of the distance as if viewing an event of great import except for the way her brown curls hung limp she didnt appear to be affected by the heat i dont understand this weather its winter ive never heard of it being hot like this in winter the weather is different in different places she murmured no its not when its winter its cold its only hot like this in high summer have you ever seen snow on mountaintops in the summer richard reversed the positions of his hands resting on the pommel yes but thats just on mountaintops the air is colder up there were not on a mountaintop still she did not move not just mountaintops have different weather in the south the weather is not so cold as it is in the north but this place is different still its like an inexhaustible well of heat and just what is this place the valley of the lost she whispered who was lost in it those who created it and whoever enters at last she turned a bit to peer at him its the end of the world your world anyway he shifted his weight to the other side when bonnie did the same if its the end of the world why are we here sister verna held her hand up to the land behind just as there is westland where you were born separated from the midlands and the midlands from dhara so too are those lands separated from what lies on the far side of this place richard frowned and what lies on the other side of here she turned back to the expanse before them you lived in the new world across this valley lies the old world the old world i never heard of the old world few in the new world have it has been sealed away and forgotten this valley the valley of the lost separates them much the same way the boundary used to separate the three lands of the new world the last of the country we have been crossing has been inhospitable a desert wasteland anyone venturing through it and into this valley never returns people think there is nothing beyond that this is the southern end of the midlands and dhara with nothing beyond but what you see here an endless waste where one could die of thirst and hunger and you could have your bones baked by the heat of the sun richard eased bonnie up next to the sister so what is beyond and why cant anyone cross and if no one can cross how can we she looked over out of the corner of her eye simple questions but not simply answered she relaxed back in her saddle a little the land between the new and the old worlds narrows somewhat with the sea to each side the sea you have never seen the ocean richard shook his head in westland it lies far to the south and people dont live there or so ive been told ive heard others speak of the ocean but ive never seen it they say its more vast than any lake ever imagined sister verna gave him a little smile they speak true she turned ahead pointing off to the right some distance that way lies the sea she pointed left to the southeast off even farther in that direction is also the sea though the land is vast between them it is still the narrowest place between the new and the old worlds because of that a war was fought here a war between wizards richard straightened in his saddle wizards what war yes wizards it was ages ago when there were many wizards what you see before you is the result of that war its all that remains as a reminder of what wizards who have more power than wisdom can conjure he didnt like the accusing look she gave him who won at last she folded her hands over the pommel of her saddle and let her shoulders relax a bit no one the two sides were separated by this land between the seas though the fighting may have stopped no one prevailed richard leaned around for a waterskin how about a drink with a small smile she took the skin as he handed it over and took a long draw this valley is an example of what can happen when your heart rather than your head rules your magic her smile evaporated because of what they did the peoples of the two worlds are separated for all time it is one reason the sisters of the light work to teach those with the gift so they will not act out of foolishness what were they fighting about what do wizards ever fight about they fought over which wizards should rule i was told something about a wizards war over whether or not wizards should rule at all she handed back the waterskin and wiped her lips with one finger that was a different war yet part of the same after this place separated the two sides some of each camp were trapped on the new world side both groups had gone to enforce their rule on those who had traveled to live in the new world and on those who had always lived there once trapped one side went into hiding for centuries and worked to build their strength before they attempted to seize power over all the new world the war that had burned long ago flared again until their force was defeated except for a few who fled into their stronghold in dhara she lifted an eyebrow to him kin of yours i believe richard glared at her for a long moment before finally taking a swig of the hot water he dribbled a little on a strip of cloth something kahlan had taught him and tied it around his head both to cool his brow and hold back his lengthening hair richard hooked the waterskin back on his saddle so what happened here she swept her hand once from the southeast to the southwest where the land was narrowest here not only armies but wizards did battle and sought to prevent one another from advancing the wizards laid down spells conjuring every sort of magic in an attempt to snare their opponents both sides equally unleashed wickedness of unspeakable horror and danger that is what lies ahead richard stared at her glazed expression you mean to say that their magic their spells are still out there unabated how can that be wouldnt they wear away fade perhaps she sighed but they did more to maintain the power of their spells they built structures to sustain the force what structures could do that sister verna still stared out at nothing or perhaps to things he couldnt see the towers of perdition she whispered richard stroked bonnies neck and waited at last sister verna seemed to dismiss her private thoughts with a deep breath and continued from one sea to the other both sides built opposing lines of these towers invested with their power and wizardry they were begun at the sea and came together here in this valley but because of the force of the towers each side built neither side could get close enough to complete the last tower in their own line what they had wrought ended in a stalemate with each side prevented from completing their last tower it allowed a weakened place in the magic a gap richard shifted uneasily in his saddle if theres a gap then why cant people cross its only a lessening in the full strength of the line to each side all the way across the hills and mountains to lands end and beyond out into the sea where it somewhere diminishes perditions line is impenetrable to enter is to be claimed by the storms of spells the magic any who enter would be killed or worse they could wander the brume forever here in this valley the deadlock prevented the completion of the last tower on each side that would have sealed the line but the spells wander and drift between the gap like thunderclouds drifting on the wind clashing and coming together in places because of the weakness in this place there is a maze that can be passed through by those with the gift the clear passages are always shifting and the spells cannot always be seen they must be felt with the gift still it is not easy so thats why the sisters of the light can make it through because they have the gift yes but only twice at most the magic learns to find you long ago sisters who went through to the new world and returned were sent again but none ever returned a second time her gaze left his seeking the distant emptiness they are in there never to be found or saved the towers of perdition and its storms of magic claimed them richard waited until her eyes came back to him perhaps sister they became disaffected and chose not to return how would you know her expression sobered we know some who have been through have seen them she inclined her head toward the shimmering distance in there i myself saw several im sorry sister verna richard thought about zedd kahlan might find him and tell him what had happened he had to push away the painful memory of kahlan so a wizard could make it through not a wizard of his full power after we teach those with the gift to control it they must be allowed to return before their power is fully developed the whole purpose of the line is to prevent wizards from getting through the fully developed power of a wizard would draw the spells as a magnet draws iron filings it is they that the magic seeks it is for them that the towers were built they would be lost just as would anyone who didnt have some use of the gift to feel the gaps in the spells too little or too much and you are lost that is why those who created the line could not complete it the domain of the spells from the other side prevented them from entering their creation ended in deadlock richard felt his hopes sag if kahlan carried out his request to seek out his old friend zedd could not do anything to help him swallowing back the numbing loss of hope he reached up and felt the dragons tooth hanging on the leather thong at his chest what about going over could something fly over she shook her head the spells extend up into the air as they extend out into the sea anything that can fly cannot fly high enough what about by sea could you sail far enough out to go around sister verna shrugged i have heard tell that a few times throughout the ages it has been accomplished in my life i have seen ships leave to attempt it but i have never seen one return richard glanced back over his shoulder but saw nothing could someone follow you through one or two if they stayed close enough as you must greater numbers would surely be lost the pockets between spells are not large enough to allow many to follow richard thought in silence at last asking why hasnt anyone destroyed the towers so the spells could dissipate weve tried it cannot be done just because you havent found a way sister that doesnt mean it cant be done she gave him a sharp look the towers and the spells were created with the aid of not only additive but also subtractive magic subtractive magic how could the wizards of old have learned to use subtractive magic wizards didnt have command of subtractive magic but then darken rahl did richard gentled his tone how can the towers keep the spells from dissipating sister verna worked her thumbs on the reins each tower has a wizards life force in it despite the heat richard felt a chill you mean to say that a wizard gave his life force into the towers worse each tower contains the life force of many wizards richard stared in numb shock at the thought of wizards giving up their lives to invest the towers with their life force how close are the towers it is said some are miles apart some only yards they are spaced according to the fabric of lines of power within the earth itself we dont understand the sense of this alignment since entering the line to find them would be death we dont even know how many towers there are we know of only the few in this valley richard squirmed in his saddle will we see any of the towers when we cross theres no way to tell the gaps shift constantly occasionally on the way through the openings take you close to a tower i saw one on my first journey through some sisters never saw one i hope never to see another richard realized he was gripping the hilt of his sword with his left hand the raised letters of the word truth bit into his flesh he relaxed his hand releasing the hilt so what can we expect to see sister verna broke her gaze into the distance and redirected it to him there are spells of every sort some are spells of despair to be snared in one is to have your soul wander in despair for all time some are spells of joy and delight in which one is lost in enchantment for all time some are pure destruction and will tear you apart some will show you things you fear to make you run into the clutches of things that lurk behind some tempt with things you hope for if you give in to the desire she leaned closer to him you must stay close to me keep going you must ignore any desire you have both fear and longing to do otherwise do you understand richard finally nodded sister verna returned her gaze to the shimmering forms she sat motionless watching in the distance beyond the wavering light he thought he saw thunderheads dark and ominous drifting across the horizon he felt more than heard their thunder somehow he knew it wasnt clouds but magic when bonnie tossed her head richard gave her a reassuring pat on her neck after watching awhile he looked over to the sister she sat still and tense what are you waiting for sister courage she answered without moving exactly i am waiting for courage child he felt no anger this time at her calling him child but rather that it might be an appropriate characterization as far as his abilities were concerned in a whisper and still without looking away from the sunbaked inferno ahead she went on you were still in swaddling clothes when i came through but i remember every detail as if it happened yesterday yes i am waiting for courage he gave bonnie a squeeze with his legs urging her ahead the sooner we start the sooner were through or lost she walked her horse after him so anxious to be lost richard im already lost sister chapter they were confronted by steps twenty strides wide that revealed themselves for what they were only at the far right where the wind had funneled down next to the sweeping pink marble balustrade and kept the snow clear pausing for only a moment as she realized they had reached her destination kahlan set her snowshoes firmly into the snowdrift that covered the steps and ascended to the portico its fascia decorated with a row of statues swathed in cut stone that mimicked the drape of cloth so well it seemed as if it might move in the light breeze ten white columns to each side held the massive entablature at a dizzying height above the arched entrance bodies fallen in a desperate battle were sprawled atop one another all over the snowcovered lawns and sat as if in repose against the walls of the domed exterior entrance hall the ornate doors displaying delicately carved royal shields of the house of amnell held aloft by twin mountain lions lay in splinters on the floor of the vestibule flanking the ropecarved stone arch at the far end stood lifesize statues of queen bernadine and king wyborn each holding a spear and shield in one hand the queen a sheaf of wheat in the other and the king a lamb the queens breasts were broken away flakes of stone and stone dust littered the rust colored marble tiles both statues were without their heads with nearly numb fingers kahlan untied the bindings of her snowshoes and leaned them against the queens statue chandalen followed her example before following her into the reception hall lined with broken mirrors and torn tapestries she pulled her mantle tight around herself as clouds of their breath rose lazily into dead still air that was somehow much colder than that outside what is this place used for chandalen asked in a whisper as if afraid he might wake the spirits of the dead she had to force herself not to whisper it is the home of the queen of this land her name is cyrilla his doubting voice echoed down the stone hall one person lives in a place such as this many people live here there are advisors much like the elders among your people and others that are responsible for governing the needs of the land and people who tend to their needs so they may perform their duties many people call this their home but the queen is the head of the household as she is the head of her land she is above them all chandalen followed silently as she began to search the palace his eyes slid from one wondrous object to another from elaborately carved furniture that now lay everywhere in splinters to the heavy red blue gold or green draperies that adorned the tenfoottall squaretop windows all broken now she descended a flight of stairs to the lower rooms the oak treads creaking with every step in the cold he insisted on entering each room first pushing doors open with a foot and gliding in behind a fully drawn tenstep arrow before allowing her to search inside they found only the dead in a few of the rooms they found some of the staff who had been lined up against a wall and pincushioned with arrows in the kitchens it looked as if after executing the cooks cooks helpers wine stewards assistants dishwashers potboys spit boys and scullions the invaders had sat down and had a drunken feast the ale and wine casks were empty it appeared they had thrown more food at the walls than they had eaten while chandalen checked the ransacked larder kahlans eye was caught by the bodies of two young women kitchen help on the floor behind a long chopping block one was completely naked and the other had but one brown woolen stocking bunched down around her thin ankle her first assumption had been wrong not all the help had been killed before the drunken feast her face as still as those of the dead women she turned and strode from the kitchen and started up the servants stairs to check the upper floors chandalens thumping footfalls came charging up behind as he took three steps at a time to catch her she knew he didnt like it that she had left without him but he didnt voice it there is salted meat maybe we could take a little i do not think these people would think it wrong for us to do so they would not deny us a little food kahlan put her hand to the railing as she climbed with a steady cadence but then pulled the hand back inside her mantle because the polished maple was so cold to the touch it stung her fingers if you eat the meat you will die they will have poisoned it so that if any of the deads countrymen return to this place and eat any of the food here they too will die they found the main floor clear of bodies it looked to have been used as an army headquarters empty barrels of wine and rum lay about the ballroom floor food scraps mugs and cups broken dishes pipe ashes bloody bandages oily rags broken or bent swords spears and maces dark wood shavings from a walnut table leg someone had whittled away until it was nothing but a stub basins of frozen water dirty linen bedsheets ripped into strips and filthy quilted bedcovers of every color littered the carpeted floor dirty bootprints were everywhere even on the tabletops by the swirling scratches it looked as if men had danced atop them chandalen walked through the rubble inspecting various bits two maybe three days they were here she nodded her agreement as her eyes cast about it looks that way he rolled a wine barrel back and forth with his foot testing if it was empty it was i wonder why they stayed so long just to drink and dance kahlan sighed i dont know maybe they were resting and tending to their wounded maybe they just went on a drunken binge to celebrate their victory over these people he looked up sharply killing is not a thing to celebrate it is for the people who did this killing reluctantly kahlan at last climbed the stairs to the top floor she didnt want to look up there that was where the bedchambers were they checked the west wing first the mens apartments they looked to have been used by the troops as sleeping quarters with an army of as many men as had to have done this they would have had many men of rank the officers probably stayed here in the fine rooms the soldiers under their command would have used the inns and more common houses with a deep breath to strengthen her resolve she set her jaw and crossed the central hall with its balcony that overlooked the grand staircase to the eastwing rooms chandalen close at her heels wanted to open the doors for her and check the rooms first but here she wouldnt allow it her hand paused for a moment on the doorknob then finally opened the first door she stood for a time staring at the scene inside she went to the next door and flung it open and then to the next all the rooms were occupied each bedchamber had women in it none clothed room after room after room were all the same by the filthy condition of the carpets there looked to have been a steady stream of traffic wood shavings lay in little piles about the floor where a man had passed the time whittling on whatever was handy while he waited his turn now we know why they spent several days here kahlan said without meeting chandalens eyes he remained silent she couldnt bring forth more than a whisper so they could do this those few days had undoubtedly been the longest of these womens lives kahlan prayed that their spirits were at peace now she reached the door at the end the door to the room the younger women shared slowly she opened it and stood looking in chandalen close behind her looking past her shoulder stifling a gasp she turned and put a hand to his chest please chandalen wait here he nodded as he furiously studied his boots kahlan closed the door behind herself and stood with her back against it for a time one hand at her side and the other covering her mouth she skirted an overturned wrecked wardrobe and walked the length of the frigid room between the rows of beds looking from one side to the other the precious hand mirrors brushes combs and pins that at one time had been arranged with loving care on tables between the beds now lay scattered about the floor the blue moire curtains billowed slightly in the icy air coming through the broken windows these were the queens ladiesinwaiting young women of fourteen fifteen and sixteen a few a little older these were not just nameless corpses kahlan knew many of these young women the queen had taken them with her when she had traveled to aydindril to speak before the council kahlan could not have failed to notice them their vibrancy their wideeyed excitement at being in aydindril seeing the grandeur of aydindril through their young eyes had given kahlan new vision of the things around her and brought a smile to her lips she had longed to give them a tour personally but being with the mother confessor would have frightened them and so she hadnt but she had admired them from afar and envied their lives of possibility kahlan stopped at various beds her back stiff her head held high her jaw rigid as she reluctantly cast her eyes down at faces she knew juliana one of the youngest had always been selfconfident and assertive she knew what she wanted and wasnt timid about going after it she had always been smitten with young men in uniform soldiers one time it had brought her to grief with her chaperone mistress nelda kahlan had surreptitiously interceded on her behalf informing mistress nelda that despite julianas dalliances the aydindril home guard were all men of impeccable honor and would never lay a finger on a queens lady her wrists were now tied to the headpost and by the way they had bled looked to have been that way through the whole of her ordeal kahlan silently cursed the spirits for their cruel humor in giving the young innocent what she had thought she wanted little elswyth was in the next bloodsoaked bed her breasts had been stabbed countless times and her throat slit as were many of the rest like hogs at slaughter at the end of the room kahlan stopped at the foot of the last bed ashley one of the older teenagers had each ankle tied to a footpost she had been strangled with a curtain tieback her father was one of the galean aides to the ambassador in aydindril her mother had been thrilled to tears when queen cyrilla had agreed to take ashley on as one of her ladiesinwaiting how would she ever find the words to tell ashleys father and mother what had happened to their little girl while in the service of their queen as kahlan retraced her steps through the length of the room taking a last look at each dead body at each face frozen in horror or in blank submission she idly wondered why she wasnt crying shouldnt she cry shouldnt she fall to her knees scream in anguish pound her fists and cry until she drowned in tears but she didnt she felt as if there were no tears to be had perhaps there were too many perhaps she had seen so many that day that it had simply numbed her to it like when you get into a tub of water for a bath and at first you feel that it is too hot to stand that surely you are being scalded but after a few minutes it seems only warm she softly pulled the door closed chandalen stood in the exact same spot she had left him his knuckles were white on his bow kahlan walked past him expecting him to follow he didnt most women would cry he said as he stared at the door she felt a flush of heat in her cheeks i am not most women chandalen didnt take his eyes from the door no you are not his eyes finally left the door to look down at his bow the tension left his shoulders as he pulled a deep breath as if it was the first he had taken in a while i wish to tell you a story kahlan waited a few paces away i do not wish to hear a story right now chandalen perhaps later he turned his fierce brown eyes to her i wish to tell you a story he repeated a little louder this time she sighed if its important to you then tell me holding her gaze he closed the distance between them he was a scant inch shorter than she but right then he looked taller to her when my grandfather was as young and strong he tapped his puffedup chest as i am now he already had a wife and two sons many peoples came to our village to trade we let all come we kept no one away all were welcome the jocopo were one of these people who came to trade who are the jocopo kahlan knew every people in the midlands but had never heard of these people who lived to the west closer to where the boundary was kahlan frowned as her mind searched a mental map no one lives to the west of the mud people that land is deserted chandalen watched her from under his eyebrows the jocopo were big people he held his hand a head higher than he was before letting it fall to his side but they were always peaceful like the bantak like our people then they made war on us we do not know the reason but our people were very afraid they would shake at night in the fear that the jocopo might come again the next day they would come to our village and cut the mens throats and take women and do these things to them he flicked his hand selfconsciously at the door rape she said in an even tone it is called rape he nodded the jocopo would do this to our women they stole many women and did this rape to them he glanced at the door again in the way it was done to these women do you understand they were raped by many men and tortured and murdered he nodded relieved that he didnt have to elaborate the mud people did not have fighters like we do now like me his chest swelled again and his chin came up at last the wind left his lungs we never had to fight with anyone none of our people wanted to fight others they thought it was wrong but the jocopo made us want to fight they stole my grandmother my grandfathers wife the mother to my father my grandfather gave an oath to send the jocopo to the spirit world he gathered men together men who had their wives or sisters or mothers taken and he wiped his forehead as if he were sweating but in the cold he was not kahlan put a hand on his arm he didnt flinch this time i understand chandalen my grandfather called for a gathering and was visited by our ancestors spirits he wept for his wife before the spirits and asked if the ancestors spirits would teach him how to stop the jocopo they told him that first he must stop weeping until after the fighting was done kahlan took her hand back and absently stroked the fur at her neck my father taught me something very much like that he said dont shed tears over those already in the ground until after you have brought vengeance to those who put them there there will be time enough then chandalen appraised her approvingly then your father was a wise man kahlan waited silently until at last he seemed to mentally gather up the memories of the stories and continued the ancestors spirits came to my grandfather every night in a gathering they taught him what he must do how to kill he taught these men what he had learned he taught them how to put mud on themselves and tie grass to themselves so not to be seen our men became like the shadows the jocopo could not see them if they stood as close as we do now my grandfather and his men made war with the jocopo not war the way the jocopo made war but the way the spirits taught the jocopo made war in the day because they were many and had no fear of us the spirits told grandfather that he must not fight the jocopo the way they wanted but must make them fear the night and the empty grassland and every call of a bird or frog or bug for every one of the mud people there were five jocopo at first they were not afraid of us because of their numbers we killed jocopo when they hunted food when they tended their crops when they cared for their animals when they went for water when they went to squat when they slept any jocopo every jocopo we did not try to fight them we only killed them until there were no more jocopo in this world only in the spirit world she wondered briefly if he meant that they had killed the children too but she knew the answer there were no more jocopo something else her father had taught her came to mind if war is brought to you then it is incumbent upon you to show no mercy surely you will be shown none and you will be a traitor to your people and as good as their enemy if you let any clemency slip its bounds for your people will pay for your mistake with their lives i understand chandalen your people did the only thing they could your grandfather did what was necessary to protect his people my father also taught me if war is brought to you then let there be war like your enemy has never imagined in his most frightening nightmares anything less and you hand victory to your foe your father too must know the spirits of his ancestors he did well to teach you their lessons his voice lowered sympathetically but i know they are harsh lessons to live by and can make you look hard to others i know the truth of that your grandfather brought honor to the mud people chandalen im sure that when it was done he shed many tears for those of his people who were murdered chandalen untied the thong at his neck and shrugged back his mantle letting it drop to the floor he wore a heavy buckskin tunic and pants at each shoulder held with a band made of woven prairie cotton around his upper arm was a bone knife the lower end was sharpened to a point and the knuckle at the other end was covered with the same woven cotton for a better grip black feathers hung from the top he tapped one of the bones this is of my grandfather he touched the other this is of my father one day when i have a strong son he will wear one of me and of my father and the one of my grandfather will be put to rest in the ground when kahlan had first seen the bone knives when they had left the mud people village she had thought they were ceremonial with terrible certainty she now knew they were not they were real weapons spirit weapons what are the feathers he stroked the glossy black feathers on the one at his right shoulder the bird man we had then when this was made placed these he touched the ones on his left shoulder the bird man we have now placed these they are raven the raven was a powerful spirit to the mud people its image invoked death while she thought the idea of wearing a knife made from your grandfather and fathers arm bone was gruesome she knew it was an honor to chandalen and so didnt say anything to insult his beliefs it brings me honor chandalen that you would bring the spirits of your ancestors to protect me he didnt look happy the bird man says you are mud people too and must be protected so i wear these it is my duty he stroked his grandfathers bone again my grandfather taught my father and my uncle toffalar the man you killed to be protectors of our people he touched his fathers bone my father taught me i will teach my son when he comes and someday he will carry my spirit with him as he protects our people since the time we killed the jocopo we have not let many come onto our land our ancestors spirits teach us that to invite others to come as they wish is to invite death the spirits speak true you brought richard with the temper to us and because of him darken rahl came and killed many of our people so it came down to this chandalen was supposed to be a protector of his people but they had been killed and he hadnt been able to stop it the ancestors spirits helped us to save the mud people chandalen and countless others they saw that richards heart was true that he was risking his life the same as you to save others who did not want war he stayed in the spirit house while darken rahl killed our people he did not try to stop him he did not fight he let our people die do you know why she waited as he stood stonefaced but when he didnt reply she resumed the spirits told him that if he went out to fight darken rahl he would be fighting the way darken rahl fought and richard would die never to help anyone they told him that if he wanted to defeat darken rahl and save the rest of the mud people he must not fight the way darken rahl did but wait and fight his own way later just as the spirits told your grandfather he regarded her skeptically this is his story i was there chandalen i heard them say this richard wanted to fight he wept with frustration when the spirits told him he must not there was nothing that could have been done to stop rahl just then it was not richards fault nor was it yours you could have done nothing to stop it the same as richard could have done nothing if he had tried he would be dead and darken rahl would have won he leaned a little closer if you had not brought him it would not have happened darken rahl would not have come looking for him she drew herself up straight chandalen do you know what i do what my specialty is yes like all confessors you make people afraid of you so you may tell them what to do and because they are afraid they will do as you say in a way i lead the council of the midlands i represent all the people and protect their rights i make it possible for those like the mud people to live as they wish we protect ourselves she gave him a sober nod you think so for every one of the mud people there were five jocopo your grandfather was brave and defeated an enemy that outnumbered him but for every man woman and child of the mud people there are over a hundred dead soldiers here and this is only one city of this land they were defeated as if they were nothing one hundred fighting men for every mud person and they fought bravely you said so what chance do you think you would have against an army that could defeat this many against an army half that size chandalen shifted his weight without answering there are lands chandalen that have no say like the mud people and the bantak they are not represented on the council the larger lands like this one and the one that defeated them are very powerful yet darken rahl conquered them i speak for the lands that have no voice on the council i protect your wish to be left alone and forbid others to come onto your land without me to make them afraid and tell them what to do they would take your land for themselves you have seen the country we have traveled through much of it is difficult to plant people would take your land for farms and to raise animals your sacred grasslands would be burned and tilled and planted with crops to trade for gold as brave and strong as you are you would not be able to protect your people these outsiders would blacken your land with their numbers just because you are brave and strong does not mean you will win the soldiers here were brave and strong and a hundred times your number and look what happened to them and this is only one city there are many larger being brave does not mean you have to be stupid chandalen you saw what was done here how long do you think you could fight against an army like that which did this even if every one of your men killed fifty they would hardly notice you would be like the jocopo gone every last one of you kahlan jabbed a finger at her own chest i am the one who tells them they may not they do not fear you but they fear me and the alliance i represent there are good people in the midlands people who are willing to fight to protect others who are less powerful the dead here are one of those peoples they are one that has always backed me when i said no land may attack another to gain land i head the council of the midlands and hold together the lands that want peace under me they would fight any who would make war on others yes i make people afraid so they will do what i say but not to have the glory of power i hold power to keep the people of the midlands including the mud people free of oppression these people here have fought before to keep all the people of the midlands free to live as they wished they have fought for you for your rights though you have never known of the blood they have shed on your behalf she clutched her mantle more tightly you have never before had to fight for them until darken rahl threatened all i came to the mud people with richard to seek help your ancestors spirits saw the truth of our struggle and they helped us so that the mud people and all others could live free for the first time mud people had to shed blood for the midlands your ancestors spirits saw the truth of this and they helped us the people of the midlands owe the mud people a debt for their sacrifice but you also owe them richard with the temper put his life at risk for your people he lost loved ones in the struggle the same as you he suffered things you could never understand you could not imagine what was done to him by darken rahl before richard killed him kahlan stood in fury clouds of her hot breath rising into the cold air i make people afraid of me so you may continue to be blind and stubborn richard and i have fought to keep all the people of the midlands including the mud people from being murdered as the jocopo murdered mud people even though you would deny us your help or simple gratitude silence echoed around them chandalen walked slowly to the railing idly running a finger along its polished surface she watched each slow cloud of his breath dissipate to be followed by another he spoke softly you see me as stubborn i see you too as stubborn maybe our fathers should have also taught us to see that sometimes people do as they do not because they are stubborn but because they fear for those they protect maybe you and i should be able to see each other not as harsh but as doing the best we know to keep our people safe a small smile came unexpectedly to kahlans lips perhaps chandalen is not so blind as i thought i will try myself to see better see you for the man of honor you are he gave a nod and a small smile of his own richard with the temper is not a stupid man he put his hands to the railing looking out over the first floor he said that if he had to pick one man to fight beside him he would pick chandalen you speak the truth she said softly he is not a stupid man richard also sacrificed himself as your mate he has saved our men from being chosen as surely you would have picked one of us because we are so strong his voice rose with pride you would probably have picked me so that you might have the strongest mate richard has saved me kahlan smiled again in spite of herself as he stared out over the railing im sorry you feel the task of being my mate is so onerous a thing chandalen came back to her he stood a moment studying her eyes and then began untying the band at his right arm he pulled the band and bone knife free holding it out before her grandfather would be proud to protect you one of his own one of his mud people he flipped her mantle back over her left shoulder chandalen i cannot accept this it holds the spirit of your grandfather he ignored her words and tied the band to her left arm i have the spirit of my father with me and i am strong you fight to protect our people grandfather would want to be with you in your fight you do him an honor she held her chin up as he slipped the bone knife into the band im honored then to have your grandfathers spirit with me this is good you have the duty now to fight as my grandfather fought to protect your people all of your people he lifted her right hand and placed it on the bone knife swear to carry this duty in your heart i have already sworn to protect the mud people and the others of the midlands i have already fought and will continue to fight for all of you he squeezed her hand tighter to the bone swear to chandalen she studied his grim expression a long moment you have my vow chandalen i swear it before you he smiled as he pulled her mantle back over her shoulder over the bone knife chandalen will thank richard with the temper when i see him again for saving me from being chosen as the mate to the mother confessor i will wish him no bad fortune he fights too for the mud people as the bird man has told us kahlan bent to pick up his mantle here put this back on i dont want you to freeze you must still get me to aydindril he nodded still wearing the small tight smile as he threw the mantle over his shoulders his smile died as he glanced at the doors someone has been here since this was done kahlan frowned what makes you think that why did you close the doors after you had looked out of respect for the dead when we came to them they were closed those who did this rape had no respect they would not have closed all the doors they wanted anyone who came to see what they had done someone else has been here and closed the doors kahlan glanced to the doors seeing the meaning of what he said i think youre right she shook her head those who did this would not have closed the door chandalen leaned on the railing again looking down at the wide stairs why are we here because i had to know what happened to these people you saw that outside why are we here in this house kahlan glanced at the steps leading up to the top floor because i have to know if the queen was killed too he looked over his shoulder toward her she means something to you kahlan was suddenly aware of the pounding of her heart yes do you remember the statues near the door we entered a woman and a man she nodded the statue of the woman is a statue of her mother my mother was a confessor the statue of the man is a statue of her father king wyborn he was also my father chandalen lifted an eyebrow you are sister to this queen half sister summoning courage she started for the stairs lets see if she is here and then we can be on our way to aydindril kahlans heart was still pounding as she stood before the door to the queens chambers she couldnt bring herself to open it it smelled dreadful in the hall but she hardly noticed do you wish me to look for you no she said i must see with my own eyes she turned the knob the door was locked the key still in place she touched the icy metal plate this is a lock the thing i told you of before she lectured as she pulled the key out and held it up this is a key replacing the key she twisted it with shaking fingers if you have a key you can open the lock and then the door someone had obviously locked the door out of respect for the queen the windows were intact as was the furniture the room was as freezing cold as the rest of the palace but the smell made them suddenly gag and hold their breath human excrement covered everything in the outer sitting room the two of them stared in shock dark piles dotted the carpets and sat on the desk and table the blue velvet chairs and couches were soaked with yellow frozen urine someone had even squatted neatly in the fireplace holding their mantles across their noses they stepped carefully across the room to the next closed door the queens bedchamber was worse there was hardly a place to put a foot without stepping in it but as covered as the floor was the worst was the bed it was heaped with feces delicately painted floral scenes on the walls were smeared with it if everything hadnt been frozen solid they would have been driven from the room by the stench as it was it was barely tolerable thankfully there were no bodies the queen was not here the names on kahlans mental roster of who could have done all this fell away and only one nation was left the ones who had been at the top before keltans she hissed to herself chandalen was dumbfounded why would these men do this are they children who do not know better after a last look around kahlan led them back out into the hall locking the door once more at last taking a full breath its a message its meant to show their disrespect for the people who lived here it says that they have nothing but scorn for these people and anything thats theirs theyve soiled their foes honor in every way they could think of at least your half sister is not here kahlan snugged the thongs of her mantle tight at her neck at least there is that she descended the steps pausing to look once more at the closed doors on the second floor chandalen watched her after he too glanced to the row of doors she sought to fill the silence we must go and find prindin and tossidin his face was lined with ire does this not make you angry she realized only then that she was wearing her confessors face it would do no good for me to show my anger right now when the time is right you will know just how angry i am chapter in a cramped daub and wattle house next to the hole in the citys wall kahlan watched as chandalen built a small fire for her in the central pit the two brothers were nowhere to be seen warm yourself he said i will see if prindin and tossidin are close and tell them where we wait after he had left she drew off her mantle even though she knew it wasnt a good idea to get too used to the warmth because it would only make the cold seem worse later drawn by the lure of the fire she squatted close rubbing her hands together over the flames shivering as the warmth seeped into her bones the small room was one of only two that had been a large part of some familys world the table was broken but the crude bench sitting against the wall was not a few pieces of clothing were scattered about along with bent tin plates and a broken spinning wheel three bobbins were crushed into the dirt floor kahlan retrieved a dented pot from among the rubble deciding it was easier to use it than to unpack one of their own she heaped it full of snow from outside the door placed the pot on three stones in the fire then warmed her icy fingers again finally pressing them against the cold flesh of her face there was tea in a crushed canister in the corner but she instead pulled her own from her pack while she waited for the snow to melt and the men to return try as she might she couldnt get the faces of the dead young women out of her mind several times she added snow as that in the pot melted down as the water was just starting to bubble prindin came through the door he leaned his bow against the wall and with a sigh slumped down heavily on the bench kahlan stood and glanced to the empty doorway wheres your brother he should be here soon we took different ways back to be able to look at more tracks he craned his neck looking through the doorway into the second room where is chandalen he went to find you and tossidin then he will be back soon my brother is not far what did you find more dead people he didnt seem to want to talk about it at the moment so she decided to wait until chandalen returned with tossidin before questioning him i was just warming water well have some hot tea he nodded flashing her his handsome smile it would be good to have hot tea kahlan bent over the pot shaking tea from a leather pouch with one hand and holding her long hair back from her face with the other you have a finelooking bottom came his voice from behind she straightened and turned to him what did you say prindin pointed toward her middle i said you have a finelooking bottom it is a good shape kahlan had learned not to be startled or insulted by the strange customs of different peoples of the midlands among the mud people for example a man complimenting a woman on her breasts was the same as saying she looked to be capable of being a fit and healthy mother able to nurse her future children it was a compliment that brought smiles of pride from the flattered womans family and was a sure way for a suitor to make friends with her father at the same time asking to see a woman with the sticky mud washed from her hair was likely as not to raise drawn bows it was tantamount to asking the young woman for improper favors the mud people treated matters of sex in an especially casual manner kahlan had more than once been brought to blushing by weselans unexpected and cavalier descriptions of coupling with her husband worse she was as likely as not to do it in his presence as she stared at prindin the visions of the young womens faces too floated before her eyes though prindin had not complimented her on her breasts it seemed to her that a womans hips could be construed to carry the same maternal compliment she knew he meant no disrespect but still his beaming smile made the hairs on her arms stand on end maybe it was just the inappropriate timing with the dead all about that unnerved her but he hadnt seen the dead young women prindins smile faded only a little as a frown came to his brow you look surprised doesnt richard with the temper ever tell you how fine your bottom is kahlan fumbled for words not sure how to bring this to an honorable halt he has never mentioned it specifically other men must have told you this before it is too fine for them not to notice the shape of your body is very good to look at it fills me with desire to he frowned in puzzlement i dont know your word for blood went to her face in a red rush as she took a step toward him prindin she relaxed her fists and brought her voice back in check prindin i am the mother confessor he nodded his grin returning but not quite as confident yes but you are a woman too and your shape prindin he blinked at her as she ground her teeth in your land it may be proper to speak to a woman in this fashion but in other places in the midlands it is not in other places speaking in this manner is offensive very offensive more than that im the mother confessor and its not proper to speak to me in this way his smile vanished but you are now one of the mud people that may be true but im still the mother confessor his face blanched i have offended you he leapt up from the bench and fell to his knees before her forgive me please i meant no disrespect i meant only to show my favor for you her red face glowed in embarrassment she had done it now she had humiliated him i understand prindin i know your words are harmless but you must not speak this way outside your land others would not understand your ways and would be greatly offended he was nearly in tears i did not know please say you forgive prindin he clutched at her pants and gripped her upper thighs with his powerful fingers yes of course i know you meant no harm she took hold of his wrists pulling them gently from her legs i forgive you chandalen came through the door his face set in a grim cast he took a quick glance at prindin before looking up into her eyes what is this nothing she hastily helped prindin to his feet as his brother entered the room but were going to have to have a talk about the proper way to speak to ladies in the midlands there are things you three will need to be taught to keep you out of trouble she smoothed her pant legs and the lingering sting of where prindins strong fingers had been and then straightened herself tell me what youve found chandalen cast a withering glare at prindin what have you done prindin took a half step back diverting his eyes i did not know it would be wrong i told her she had a fine i said it was nothing kahlan said cutting him off its just a small misunderstanding forget about it she turned to the fire i made hot tea get some cups there are some we can use on the floor over there and we will have some tea while you tell me what you found tossidin made for the cups thumping the back of his brothers head along the way adding a whispered reprimand chandalen shrugged off his mantle and squatted before the fire warming his hands the brothers brought the cups prindin rubbing the back of his head and passed them around in an attempt to let them all know prindin hadnt lost any honor in her eyes kahlan directed her attention and first question to him tell me what you found prindin glanced briefly at the other two before setting his face with a serious expression ten maybe twelve days ago this killing was done the enemy came mostly from the east but there were many and some came from farther to the north and south they had war in the narrow places in the mountains with men from this city those men from the city not killed ran away as they were overrun and gathered their numbers here and tried to make a stand while they ran to here they were chased by their enemy fighting and dying as they ran more and more of the invaders poured through the passes sweeping around to the south here where they had a battle after they defeated those men and killed the ones they captured the enemy came through the wall when they were finished in this city all of them together went east again tossidin leaned in a little before they left they took their dead from the city they used wagons there are many tracks from the wheels it took them maybe two days to take all their dead from here many thousands the people here must have fought like demon spirits the ones who did this lost more men than they killed where are the bodies she asked in a bowl in a pass to the east prindin said the wagons took the dead along the road and then they were thrown down into the low place they are piled so deep we do not know how low the ground is there what did they look like she took a sip of tea holding the tin cup with both hands wrapped around it soaking up the warmth how were they dressed prindin reached under his shirt and pulled out a folded cloth he handed her the bloodred bundle there were poles with these on them many of the men wore clothes with the same symbols on them but we did not want to take the clothes from the dead kahlan unfolded the banner and stared in shock at the long red triangle draped over her hands in the center was a black shield with an ornate silver letter on it the letter r it was a war banner with the shield and symbol of the house of rahl dharan soldiers she whispered how could that be she looked up were there keltans too the three men looked at one another they didnt understand they didnt know the keltans there were some with other clothes prindin said but most had this symbol on them or on their shields and they went east tossidin nodded i do not know the way to tell you their numbers but there were so many that if you stood in the same spot on the wide road they took you would be there all day watching them pass also prindin said as they were going others joined them from the north where they had been waiting and went with them kahlans eyes narrowed as she frowned in thought did they have many wagons big wagons prindin snorted a laugh they must have hundreds these men do not carry anything they use wagons they have victory because they are many but they are lazy they ride in wagons or use them to carry their things it takes a lot of supplies she said to support an army that big and if they ride in wagons it keeps them fresh for fighting it also makes them soft chandalen said defiantly if you carry what you need like we do then you grow strong if you walk without carrying what you need or ride in wagons or on horses then you grow soft these men are not strong like us they were strong enough to crush this city kahlan said looking up from under her eyebrows they were strong enough to win the battle and destroy their opponent only because they are many chandalen argued like the jocopo not because they are strong or good fighters large numbers she said quietly has a strength all its own none of the three men disagreed with that prindin downed the last of his tea before speaking their numbers are all gone now they stay together as they go east east she thought a moment while the three waited did they go through a pass that has a thin rope bridge stretched above it a bridge that can only be crossed by one person at a time on foot the brothers nodded kahlan stood jara pass she whispered to herself as she turned to stare out the door its one of the few big enough for their wagons there is more tossidin said as he stood too maybe five days after they left more men came here he held up the spread fingers of both hands this many did the killing here he closed all but a lone little finger on his right hand this many came here after it was done kahlan glanced to chandalen the ones who closed the doors he nodded as the two brothers frowned they searched the city tossidin went on there were no people left here to kill so they followed the tracks followed those that went east to join with them no kahlan said they were no allies of those who did this they didnt go to join them theyre going after them though prindin considered this a moment then if they catch the ones who did this then they too will die they have no numbers like those they chase they will be like fleas trying to eat a dog kahlan snatched up her mantle and flung it around her shoulders lets get going jara pass is wide and easy enough for large wagons but its also very long and meandering i know small passes like the one that takes that rope bridge over the jara and then up through harpies cleft that an army cannot travel but we can and its much shorter what they travel in three or four days we can travel in one chandalen stood but did so in an easy manner mother confessor following these men will not take us to aydindril we have to go over one of the passes to get us to aydindril harpies is as good as any chandalen still made no move to recover his mantle but that way lies an army of thousands you wanted to get to aydindril with as little trouble as possible that way lies trouble kahlan squatted with her boot over a snowshoe and began lacing on the binding the faces of the dead young women wavered before her eyes im the mother confessor i will not allow this to happen in the midlands its my responsibility the men glanced uneasily at one another the brothers moved to retrieve their snowshoes chandalen did not you said your responsibility was to go to aydindril as richard with the temper asked you said you must do as he asked kahlan paused her work at the binding of the second snowshoe anguish seared though her she considered chandalens words but only briefly im not abandoning that responsibility she finished the binding and stood but were mud people we have other responsibilities too other responsibilities kahlan tapped the bone knife that was tied to her arm under her mantle to the spirits the jocopo the bantak and now these men have listened to spirits that would have them do great evil spirits that come through the tear in the veil we have responsibilities to the spirits of our ancestors and their living descendants she knew that to close the veil she needed to reach zedd to get help for richard it was possible that richard was the only one who could close the veil chandalen was right they must reach aydindril but the faces of the young women still filled her mind the horror of what had been done to them still coursed through her the two brothers were sitting on the bench putting on their snowshoes chandalen stepped close to her and lowered her voice what good will come of us catching this army it is wrong she looked into his brown eyes they were not filled with defiance as they had been in the past but with genuine concern chandalen the men who did this killing and went east are perhaps fifty thousand strong the ones who closed the doors in the palace and are chasing that army are perhaps five thousand they are filled with anger but if they catch the ones theyre chasing theyll be slaughtered too if i have a chance to prevent five thousand men from dying then i must try for that chance he lifted an eyebrow and if you are killed in this then what greater evil will break its bounds thats what you three are supposed to prevent my being killed she started for the door chandalen gently gripped her arm and brought her to a halt he spoke calmly it will be dark soon we can rest here tonight and cook food we can leave in the morning after we are rested the moon will be up soon to light our way we have no time to waste she leaned toward him im going on now if youre as strong as you say youll go with me if youre not you may rest here chandalen put his hands on his hips his lips tightened as he let out a deep breath he appraised her with frustration you cannot walk more than chandalen we go too kahlan gave him a quick tight smile and swept through the door the brothers snatched up their bows and jumped to fall in behind her while chandalen bent to tie on his snowshoes chapter richard watched the horses eating grass that wasnt there and scratched his itchy beard the surface of the valley was baked and barren but the horses seemed contented in their grazing as if there were lush green grass beneath their feet illusion it seemed deluded and enticed even the horses he wondered what wasnt there that he was going to see sister verna at last moved pulling up on jessups lead line pulling him away from his browsing this way ominous dark clouds hugged the ground ahead boiling as if alive and eagerly awaiting them richard pulled the other two horses on following after the sister she had told them that they must walk because the horses could be suddenly spooked by things unseen and could carry them helpless into a spell sister verna abruptly altered her course across the featureless ground taking them a little to the right the dark cloud of dust and dirt lifted and tumbled driven by the gusts that as of yet didnt touch them sister verna looked over her shoulder her expression as dark as the cloud whatever you see you ignore it whatever it is it isnt real you just ignore it do you understand what am i going to see she redirected her attention to the way ahead her white blouse was damp with sweat as was his shirt i cant tell you the spells seek those things in your own mind you fear or long for so everyone sees different things yet some visions are the same some fears are the same in all of us some of the magic we will see is not visions but real like those clouds of dust and what did you see the last time that youre so afraid of she walked in silence for a time one i loved if she was a loved one why would you be afraid to see her because he tried to kill me richard blinked at the stinging sweat in his eyes he do you have a man you love sister she watched the ground as she walked not anymore her voice was soft with sorrow she glanced up at him a moment before seeking the ground once more with her eyes when i was young i had a love jedidiah she was silent so he asked he is not your love anymore she shook her head why not pausing only a moment she wiped her brow with a finger before moving on i was young perhaps younger than you when i left the palace of the prophets left to find you we didnt know if you had been born yet we knew that if you had not been you would be but we didnt know when so three sisters were sent but that was many years ago ive spent better than half my life away from the palace from jedidiah she stopped again peering first right then left before starting ahead once more he will have long ago forgotten me and found another if he really loved you sister he wont have forgotten you and found another you havent forgotten him she tugged on her horses line pulling him away from something he wanted to investigate too many years have passed weve grown older apart i have grown old we are not the same people we were he is one with the gift and has his own life it would not include me youre not old sister if you really love each other time shouldnt matter he wondered if he was talking about her or himself sister verna gave a soft private laugh youth youth holds much hope but not much wisdom i know the ways of people of men he has been too long from my skirts he will long ago have sought another richard felt himself blushing in the heat love has more to it than that ah so you know so much of love yes you too will soon be searching the charms of a new pair of pretty legs richard was about to vent a rush of sudden anger when sister verna stopped she looked up the dark cloud swirled in closing in on them from somewhere richard heard the faint sound of someone screaming his name something is wrong sister verna whispered to herself what is it she ignored him pulling jessup to the left this way lightning lit the air about them a blinding bolt struck the ground ahead sending a shower of the chalky earth skyward the ground shook with the impact every muscle flinched from the nearness of the strike when the lightning tore the dark wall open for an instant richard saw kahlan she was standing watching him and then she was gone kahlan sister verna reversed course this way now richard i told you it is not real whatever you saw you must ignore it he knew it was an illusion but the sight ran a sharp pang of longing through him he groaned inwardly why did the magic have to attract him with visions of her his own mind sister verna had said would bring forth the things he feared or those for which he longed which was this he wondered fear or longing is the lightning real real enough to kill us but its not lightning in the sense of what you know this is a storm of spells that are battling each other the lightning is a discharge of their power as they fight each other at the same time it also seeks to destroy any intruder our way is among the gaps in their battle again he heard the distant scream of his name but it wasnt kahlans voice it was a mans voice another lightning bolt struck directly in front of them he and the sister both protectively threw an arm up before their faces the horses didnt start it must be as the sister said horses would have panicked had it been real lightning as the dirt thrown up by the lightning rained down around them sister verna turned and snatched him by his shirtsleeve richard listen to me something is wrong the way is shifting too fast im not able to feel it as i should be able to why would that be youve been through here before you were able to do it before i dont know we dont know a great deal about this place its tainted with magic we dont entirely understand it could be that the magic has learned to recognize me from when i was here before going through more than twice is not possible going through the second time is said to be more difficult than the first it could just be that but it might be something else what something else you mean me her eyes glanced past him to things she was seeing but he knew werent there she refocused her gaze on him no not you if it were you i would still be able to feel the pass as i did before but i cant i can only feel it some of the time i think its because of what happened with sisters elizabeth and grace what do they have to do with it the dark storm was all about them now swirling and howling their clothes flapped in the gusts he had to squint against the dust in their death they passed on their gift that is the reason they gave their lives when you refused the offer to pass their gift to the next to make her stronger so she might succeed at the next try that was why he had felt the pull to accept the collar more strongly each time the offer had been made kahlan had said that that might have been the reason they killed themselves when he refused to add to their power make them stronger you mean you have the power the han of the other sisters she nodded as her eyes darted about it gives me the power of all three her eyes came back to his it could be that i have too much power to make it through she clutched his shirt tighter and pulled him closer to her face if i dont make it you must go on alone try to make it on your own what i dont know how to make it through i dont feel anything of the spells about us dont argue with me you felt the lightning you felt that much of it one without the gift would not feel it until it was too late you must try sister you will be all right you will sense the way but if i dont you must try ignore anything you see that tempts you richard if i die you must try to make it through to the palace of the prophets if anything happens to you ill try to make it back to the midlands its closer she gave a sharp tug on his shirt no must you always challenge what i tell you she scowled at him a moment before letting her expression cool richard if you dont have a sister to teach you to control the gift you will die the collar alone will not save you you must have a sister for the radahan to be of use without a sister it would be like having lungs but no air to fill them we are the air some of us have already given our lives to help you dont let them die in vain he took her hand from his shirt and gave it a gentle squeeze youre going to make it i promise you youll make it if there is anything i can do to help ill try dont be afraid ignore what youre seeing isnt that what you said she released an exasperated breath and then took her hand back turning away you dont know the things i see she looked over her shoulder squinting at him dont test me richard im not in the mood you do as youre told richard heard the thunder of horses hooves as sister verna quickly led them ahead the darkness swirled around them as lightning crackled through it he found it difficult to accept the calmness of the horses could it be that he really was using the gift to feel it to his left the wall of dust lifted light beyond shone through richard stared at the sight it was the hartland woods the woods he knew longed to return to they were here before him he had only to step through the peace of the place he stared at made him ache with longing as if stepping through to them would be his salvation but he knew it was an illusion a spell of longing meant to trap him and let him wander for all time in ensorcellment he wondered what would be so bad about that even if it wasnt real if it was a place he loved and he would be happy there what would be so bad about that he heard his name called again again in a scream horses hooves were almost upon him he spun around realizing it was chases voice screaming his name ignore it richard came the sisters growl keep moving richard longed for his friend as much as he longed for the hartland woods he walked backward watching chase was riding at a full gallop his black cloak flying behind his weapons glinting in the light of the merciless sun the horse was covered with lather someone else was with him in his lap richard squinted trying to see better and realized it was rachel that was natural rachel would be with chase rachel was screaming his name too richard watched the illusion as it bore down upon him something about rachel riveted his attention something about her gave richard the strong sense of zedds presence his eyes were lured to an amber stone hanging by a gold chain about her neck the sight of the stone drew richards interest as if it were zedd himself calling to him richard chase was screaming dont go in there dont go in there zedd needs you the veil is torn richard chase suddenly drew the horse to a skidding stop richard took slow backward steps as he watched the illusion chase had gone calm and was no longer screaming with rachel in his arms he dismounted looking about in wonder the dust was passing between them again and richard was having difficulty seeing his old friend chase set rachel down and took her hand as they both turned about staring off at nothing richard thought that an odd thing for a vision to do but then decided it must just be a way of trying to entice him to go see what they were looking at richard turned to the sister as she called his name come on or ill make you wish i had left you here you mustnt stop she surveyed each side as she moved ahead this opening is closing around us hurry before were trapped richard glanced behind the vision was disappearing beyond the swirling darkness chase and rachel appeared to be walking off toward something the roiling clouds passed between richard and the vision of his friends and they were gone richard trotted to catch up with sister verna he wondered at the reason for such an odd vision why would the magic pick those two from his mind to tempt him they had seemed so real it had felt as if he could have reached out and touched the two of them perhaps the magic was trying to seduce him in to following someone he trusted with his life but it had seemed so real chase had looked so desperate he cautioned himself to pay attention of course it seemed real to him that was the whole purpose of the magic to appear real in order to fool you to draw you in it wouldnt be very effective magic if it didnt seem real richard put a hand to jessups flanks as he came up behind him to let him know he was there and keep from startling him he ran the hand along the length of the muscular horse as he trotted by pulling bonnie and geraldine along by their lines in his other hand richard gave jessup a pat on the neck as he went past jessup dropped his head and once again browsed at grass that wasnt there his lead line dragging the ground richard froze in his tracks sister verna was gone lightning exploded in every direction with deafening noise a bolt blasted the ground at his feet he leapt to the side to avoid the next strike his hair seemed to stand on end as the lightning hit he could feel the searing heat his vision was laced with bluewhite afterimages of the jagged flashes richard screamed out the sisters name as he gathered up the lead lines pulling the horses on as he frantically scanned about the lightning seemed to follow him striking the ground repeatedly where seconds ago he had been balls of flame ignited in the air shrieking as they came apart it seemed as if the very air burned the wail of the fire was everywhere richard ran toward the gaps left after each dissipated dodging the lightning and the flames covering his head with a hand even though he knew that if the magic hit him that hand wouldnt save him the cacophony seemed enough to drive a person mad the dark dust clouds prevented him from seeing anything if indeed there was anything to see he ran on heedless of direction just trying to avoid the blue bolts and yellow flames abruptly the corner of white polished marble walls loomed up before him lurching to a panting halt he looked up but couldnt see the top it disappeared into the dark cloud above a strike that was too close for comfort started him running again pulling the three horses behind the middle of the wall had an arched opening in it rounding the corner he found that that wall too held an arched opening as he ran he counted each of the five sides of the structure was about thirty strides in the center of each wall was an arched opening six strides wide and about as tall he stopped catching his breath outside one of the openings it was empty inside and through the opening he could see each arch in the other walls lightning hammered the ground flinging dirt into the air he threw his arms up in front of his face the strikes marched toward him their sound thundering in his ears he had nowhere to go he let go of the horses and dove through the arch rolling across the sandy ground inside silence echoed in his ears as he sat up leaning back on his hands inside the structure was barren empty the air wasnt sweltering as it had been outside but felt almost cool in comparison and smelled sweet like a grassy meadow through the arched openings he could see the boiling black clouds that hugged the ground the lightning arced violently but its sound was only a dim rumble the horses wandered slowly grazing on the grass that wasnt there this must be one of the towers of perdition sister verna had told him about the interior of the walls soared up into the darkness high above and were black with the results of wizards life fire richard ran a finger through the black grit and tasted it he winced at the bitter tang it left on his tongue the wizard who had died to give his life to this fire had not done so willingly he had done it to save himself the torture of what they had intended to do to him or perhaps what they were doing to him the ground was covered with white sand that sparkled with prismatic light it was drifted into the corners like snow richard remembered seeing sand like this before it was in the peoples palace in the garden of life in a circle in the center of the room darken rahl had drawn spells in that sparkling white sand when he had been trying to open the boxes of orden richard paced around the inside of the tower trying to decide what to do it seemed safe in this place but for how long surely sooner or later the magic would find him maybe the seeming safety of this place was simply an enchantment meant to trap him keep him here for all time afraid to venture out he couldnt stay he had to find the sister she needed his help she was afraid he had told her she would make it through but why should he want to help her she kept him prisoner if he left her here he would be free but free to do what if she didnt help him learn to control the gift he would die or so she said richard turned at a sound from behind kahlan stepped out of the darkness of an archway her long hair didnt flow over her shoulders but was tied back in a single braid instead of her white confessors dress she wore the red leather of a mordsith richard stood stiffly his chest heaving kahlan i refuse to think of you in this way even in an illusion drawn from my own mind she arched an eyebrow but isnt this what you fear most change it or be gone the red leather shimmered and became the white confessors dress he knew so well the braid came undone better my love im afraid it still wont save you i have come to kill you die with honor defend yourself richard drew the sword of truth the unique ring of its steel echoed throughout the tower wrath surged through him as the magic was loosed he endured with detached misery the sensation of murderous need while looking upon the face of the only person who made his life worth living his knuckles tightened on the braided wire hilt on the bumps of the word truth his jaw muscles flexed as he gritted his teeth he felt a rush of understanding at how the wizards could have made life fire and have given themselves into it rather than endure what was to be done to them some things were worse than death richard tossed the sword to the ground at kahlans feet not even in an illusion kahlan i would rather die her green eyes shone with a sad timeless knowing look better you had died my love that you wouldnt see what i have come to show you it will bring you more pain than death her eyes closed as she sank to her knees leaning forward bending into a deep bow the whole of the time she was slumping forward her hair shortened by the time her head touched the sparkling white sand her hair looked as if it had been chopped short close to the nape of her neck this must be or the keeper will escape stopping it will aid him and he will have us all speak if you must these words but not of this vision without looking up she spoke in a detached rote of all there were but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive when the shadows threat is lifted therefore comes the greater darkness of the dead for there to be a chance at lifes bond this one in white must be offered to her people to bring their joy and good cheer as richard stood staring at the illusion at the back of her head a ring of blood blossomed around her neck richards breath halted as if it had been cleaved off kahlans head tumbled away her body fell to its side blood gushing spreading in a pool beneath it turning the white sand and white dress to red richard drew a gasp of a breath noooo his chest heaved he felt his fingernails cutting into his palms his toes curled in his boots its an illusion he told himself as he shook an illusion nothing more an illusion meant to terrorize him kahlan stared up at him with flat dead green eyes though he knew it had to be an illusion it nonetheless was working panic paralyzed his legs fright raced recklessly through his mind the image of kahlan wavered and then vanished suddenly as sister verna stormed through an archway to the side richard she shrieked in fury what are you doing in here i told you to stay with me cant you follow the simplest instructions must you always act like a child she took two strides forward her face red with rage his heart thumped violently with the pain of what he had just seen he blinked at sister verna he was in an ill humor to tolerate the surly side of her disposition you were gone i couldnt find you i looked but dont talk back to me her curls sprang up and down as she yelled ive had all the talk from you i can stomach i told you i was in no mood for it my patience is at an end richard he opened his mouth to speak but the collar yanked him backward his feet leaving the ground it felt as if he had been jerked by a rope around his neck with a grunt he slammed into the wall the impact knocked the wind from his lungs and the sense from his head he hung his feet clear of the ground pinned to the wall by the radahan the collar was choking him he tried to focus his eyes but his vision only blurred uselessly its time you had a lesson i should have given long ago the sister said in a growl as she stalked toward him i have suffered enough of your disobedience i will suffer it no longer richard struggled to breathe each breath burned as he drew it through the constriction at his neck his vision cleared and finally focused on sister vernas face his anger heated sister dont pain took his words it ignited in his chest with such intense burning force it made his fingers tingle he couldnt draw a breath to scream ive had enough of your words i will hear no more no more of your excuses your arguments your harsh judgments from now on you will do as you are told when you are told and you will offer me no more of your insolence she took another step toward him her expression twisted with menace do we understand each other she somehow made the pain worse he shook with the crushing hurt in his chest stinging tears flooded from his wide eyes i asked you a question do we understand each other air rushed into his lungs sister verna im warning you dont do this or you are warning me you are warning me whitehot pain knifed through his chest twisting tighter with each breath a scream ripped from his lungs his worst fears were coming to life this was what wearing a collar had brought him to again this was what the sisters had in mind for him this was his fate if he allowed it richard called the swords magic summoned by its master the power swept into him hot with promise hot with wrath hot with need richard welcomed it embraced it letting his own rage join with the rage of the sword and spiral through him his fury consumed the pain using it to draw power dont you dare fight me or i will make you rue the day you were born fiery flames of agony bloomed anew richard drew them into the wrath though he wasnt touching the sword he didnt need to he was one with the magic and he called forth all its force now stop this he managed through gritted teeth or i will sister verna with her fists at her side stepped closer now you threaten me i warned you before about threatening me you have made your last mistake richard though he was nearly blinded by the pain she suddenly unleashed into him he was able to see one thing the sword of truth it lay in the sand near the sister the seeker focused the swords magic into the power that bound him to the wall with a loud crack the bond broke and he tumbled away from the wall rolling through the sand his hands found the sword sister verna charged toward him he came up swinging the sword in an arc the need for her blood seared through his soul beyond retrieval nothing else mattered bringer of death he didnt try to direct the track of the blade but simply focused his need to kill into the power of its swing the swords tip whistled through the air bringer of death the blade exploded through the sister at shoulder level the cool air erupted with a spray of hot blood the smell of it filling his nostrils as the sight of it filled his vision her head and part of her shoulders tumbled up into the air as the blade severed her in two blood and bone hit the walls the lower half of her body collapsed fluidly to the ground blood soaked into the white sand spreading beneath her what was left of her shoulders and head hit the ground a good ten feet away sending up a spray of white sand the gore of her insides glistened in a line away from the body richard collapsed to his knees panting the pain finally gone he had told himself he would not allow this to be done to him again he had meant it like a distant memory his insides ached with the pain of what he had done it had all happened so fast before he had had time to think he had used the swords magic to take a life and the magic would want its due he didnt care it was nothing to compare to the pain of what she had been doing to him what she would have done to him as he focused on the rage the pain evaporated and was gone but what was he going to do now he needed the sisters to teach him how to keep the gift from killing him he would die without sister vernas help how could he go to the other sisters and ask for their help now had he just sentenced himself to death too but he would not allow them to hurt him any more he would not he knelt recovering resting on his heels trying to think in front of him near the side of sister vernas body lay the little book she had kept tucked behind her belt it was the little book in which she was always writing richard picked it up and thumbed through the pages it was blank no not entirely near the back there were two pages with writing i am the sister in charge of this boy these directives are beyond reason if not absurd i demand to know the meaning of these instructions i demand to know upon whose authority they are given yours in the service of the light sister verna sauventreen richard reflected on the fact that sister verna had been temperamental even in her writing he looked to the next page it was in a different hand you will do as you are instructed or suffer the consequences do not presume to question the orders of the palace again in my own hand the prelate well it looked as if sister verna had managed to raise the ire of someone besides himself he tossed the book back on the ground next to her he sat staring at her body at what he had done what was he going to do now he heard a sigh and lifted his head to see kahlan in her white confessors dress standing again in an archway with a sad expression she slowly shook her head and you wonder why i would send you away kahlan you dont understand you dont know what she was going to a quiet laugh drew his attention to the other side of the room darken rahl stood in another archway his white robes aglow richard felt the scar of his fathers handprint on his chest tingle and burn with heat the keeper welcomes you richard darken rahls grim smile widened you make me proud my son with a scream richard tore across the sand the rage ignited anew sword first he launched himself at darken rahl the glowing form evaporated as richard flew through the archway laughter echoed and then faded outside the tower the lightning went wild three hot bolts traced through the darkness toward him instinctively he lifted the sword as a shield the lightning struck the sword flashing and twisting like a snake in a snare thunder jarred the ground beneath his feet richard squinted against the blinding light he gritted his teeth with the strain of forcing the sword downward taking the flaring liquid lines of fire with it they dulled and diminished as they were dragged to the ground where they writhed hissing as if in death until at last they faded and were gone enough of these visions richard angrily sheathed his sword and collected the horses from their grazing he didnt know where he was going to go but he was getting away from this tower away from the dead sister away from what he had done chapter the lightning didnt come anymore the clouds still roiled around him but the lightning didnt come he walked without giving thought to where he was going when he felt inexplicable danger he skirted it to the sides visions tempted him to look but he stoically ignored them almost not seeing it at first because of the dark clouds he came upon another tower it looked like the first except it was a glossy black at first thinking he would avoid it he found himself walking to one of the arches and peering in the ground inside was covered with sand that was drifted into the corners the same as the last tower but it was black instead of white it glimmered with the same prismatic light as the white sand curiosity overcame caution and he reached inside running a finger through the black grit covering the walls it tasted sweet the wizard who had given his life into this fire had done so to save another not to save himself torture this wizard had been altruistic the other ignoble if having the gift meant he was a wizard richard wondered which kind he was he would like to think of himself as highminded but he had just killed another to save himself from torture but was he not within his rights to kill to protect his life must he wrongly die to be honorable who was he to judge which of these wizards had been wiser or which had done what was within his rights the sparkling black sand fascinated him it seemed to draw light from nowhere and reflect it about the inside of the tower in winking colors richard retrieved an empty spice tin and scooped it full of the black sand he tucked the tin back in his pack hanging from geraldines saddle while he whistled for bonnie she was off browsing again her ears swiveled toward him as her head came up dutifully she trotted over and joined him and the other two horses pushing her head against his shoulder in hopes of a neck scratch as they left the tower behind he gave her the scratch she wanted his shirt was soaked with sweat as he hiked quickly across the barren ground he wanted to be out of this valley and away from the magic the spells and the visions sweat rolled from his brow as he walked trying to ignore familiar voices that called to him he ached with desire to see the faces of loved ones who called his name but he didnt look other voices hissed with menace and threat but he kept moving at times the spells tingled against his flesh burning with pricks of heat or cold or pain and he rushed away from them even faster as he wiped sweat from his eyes they focused on the baked earth before him and he saw tracks his own he realized that in trying to avoid the feelings of danger the visions and the voices he must have been walking in circles if in fact the footprints were real he began to have the queasy feeling that the magic was trapping him maybe all this time he had been walking he had not been making any headway out of the valley of the lost maybe he too was lost how was he going to find a way out he tugged the horses on and kept moving but with a rising sense of panic unexpectedly out of the dark fog before him came a vision that startled him into a dead stop it was sister verna she was wandering aimlessly her hands clasped prayerfully her eyes skyward and a blissful smile upon her lips richard stalked toward her be gone ive had enough of these specters leave me alone she didnt seem to hear him that was impossible she was easily close enough to hear him he stepped closer the air feeling abruptly thick and sparkling around him as he did so until he seemed to step beyond it do you hear listen to me i said be gone distant brown eyes focused on him she held her arm out her hand held up in forbidding leave me i have found what i seek leave me to my peace my bliss as she turned away richard felt an apprehensive tingling sensation all the way down to his toes she wasnt trying to entice him as the other visions had his hair tried to stand on end sister verna could it be true could she be alive maybe he hadnt really killed her maybe it had all been a vision sister verna if it really is you talk to me she regarded him with a puzzled frown richard of course richard go she whispered as her eyes turned up once more i am with him him him who please richard you are tainted go away if youre a vision then you go away she regarded him with pleading please richard youre disturbing him dont ruin what ive found what have you found is it jedidiah the creator she said in a hallowed tone richard peered skyward i dont see anyone she turned her back to him and strolled away leave me to him richard didnt know if this was the real sister verna or an illusion or maybe the dead sisters spirit which was true how could he tell he had promised the real sister that she would make it through that he would help her he followed after her before she could disappear into the dark fog what does the creator look like sister verna is he young old does he have long hair short does he have all his teeth she turned in a rage leave me the menace in her expression froze him in his tracks no listen to me sister verna youre coming with me im not leaving you trapped in this spell thats all you see an enchantment spell he reasoned that if she was a specter and he took her with him she would vanish when they left the magic of the valley if she was real well then he would be saving her she would be alive though he wished to be free of her he wished more that she was alive and that she wouldnt really do to him what she had done back in the tower he didnt want that to be the true sister verna he started toward her again her hand came up as if to push him even though he was a good ten paces away the force of the impact threw him to the ground he rolled over clutching his chest clutching at the receding agony it felt like what had been done to him in the tower hard burning pain but it faded faster wincing he sat up quickly gathering his wits as he gasped for breath he looked up to check where the sister was in case she was about to hurt him again what he saw halted his breath only half out of his lungs as the sister once again stared skyward the dark fog around them swirled and coalesced into forms the forms of wraiths insubstantial figures seething simmering with death their faces churned with steaming shifting shadows that conjoined into glowing red eyes set in inky faces hot tongues of flame alive with hate glowering out from eternal night bumps rippled and tingled across the backs of his shoulders when he had been in the spirit house and felt the screeling on the other side of the door when he had sensed the man about to kill chandalen and when he had first encountered the sisters he had felt an overwhelming inexplicable sense of danger he felt that danger now there wasnt the slightest doubt in his mind that these things were part of the magic of this valley and that that magic had at last found an intruder him verna he screamed she scowled down at him i told you richard i am to be addressed as sister verna is that what you do to your charges hurt them with your power she looked startled but i is this your eternal paradise quarreling with people hurting them he rushed to his knees eyeing the drifting forms about them sister we have to get out of here i wish to stay with him i have found my bliss this is your idea of paradise giving pain answer me sister verna is that what your creator wishes of you to hurt the people you are responsible for she gaped at him quickness suddenly coming to her movements as she rushed to him did i hurt you she gripped his shoulders oh child im sorry i didnt mean to he came the rest of the way to his feet and shook her sister we have to get out of here i dont know how tell me how to get out of here before its too late but i wish to stay look around sister verna what do you see she jerked her head woodenly about from one dark form to another then to him richard richard angrily pointed skyward look sister thats not the creator its the keeper she peered where he directed with a gasp her fingers flew to her mouth the red glow in the eyes of one of the dark shifting forms intensified into burning embers the sense of danger flamed through richards very soul the sword was out in a blink the vaporous wraith solidified into solid bone and muscle claws and fangs into a frightening beast covered with a dark cracked leathery hide dappled with hideous suppurating sores it descended upon him in a terrifying rush with the sword gripped in both hands richard screamed with unleashed fury driving the sword through the beasts chest as it rushed at him soft flesh and hard bone hissed at contact with the blade the monster slid from the sword and hit the ground like a bucket of slop its hide not entirely able to contain its contents a drop of blood splattered on richards arm burning through his shirt and into his flesh from the inside the beast boiled and frothed worms wriggled from the abscessed sores sister verna stared wideeyed at the bubbling smoking mass he grabbed her curly hair in his fist and twisted her head to look at the forms that were closing in is this your idea of paradise look look at them he dragged her backward with him as the dark watery blood running from the beast ignited sending acrid oily black smoke curling from the flames richard halted when he remembered what she had told him before about backing into worse danger he smelled burning flesh and realizing it was his own spat on the painful smoking spot of the beasts blood on his arm he took in a quick sweep of the area there were more of the forms behind another of them solidified into a beast this time with cloven hooves and a broad snout razorsharp tusks sprouted growing into long curved weapons snorting it charged them richard drove his sword downward through the things skull as it tried to gore him with a squeal the beast collapsed heavily by the time the bulky body hit the ground it had mutated to a writhing mass of snakes they tumbled and rolled as they hit the tangled pile of them wriggling apart hundreds of hooded red eyes glowered up at him red tongues flicked the air as the yellowandblackbanded bodies slithered toward the two of them richard didnt think they were mere incorporeal illusions the place on his arm where the drop of blood had splattered burned painfully the snakes hissed some coiled to strike revealing dripping fangs richard we have to get out of here come child they turned and ran the floating redeyed forms following richard felt the thick air as he went through the air around him sparkled sister verna cried out he turned to see her on the ground before the snakes she sprang to her feet and tried again but could not pass through to her the air was solid she stood silently a moment going calm she clasped her hands richard i am trapped in this spell i cannot leave it it is me the spell captured and recognizes it is too late for me save yourself run without me you may have a chance hurry go there seemed to be a lot more snakes than richard had seen at first the ground was alive with them they were surrounding him he struck as they did and beheaded three that came too close the headless bodies writhed and then disassembled into hundreds of huge glossy blackandbrownbanded bugs they skittered in every direction some ran up his pant leg he frantically shook his legs trying to get them out each bite felt like a hot coal on his flesh he stomped his feet to get them off from the ground where he had killed the snakes more of the bugs poured out their hardshelled bodies tumbling over each other rustling like the sound of dry leaves blowing across parched earth dancing among the clicking bugs and between the squirming snakes he stepped back into the sparkling air without you i dont have a chance youre coming with me he enfolded her in his arms and threw himself swordfirst at the sparkling barrier the wall seemed hard at first but then the air about them exploded in glittering flashes lines of light like crazed glass shot in every direction the air erupted in a burst of sparkles and a crack of thunder the darting sparkles slowed and then drifted to earth like fat flakes of snow their light extinguishing when they touched the ground the two of them moved past the vanished barrier free of the spell the dark forms followed the snakes followed bugs popped and crunched under his boots richards grip tightened on the sword lets get out of here she took two strides and then froze whats wrong i cant feel the way she whispered richard i cant feel the gaps she turned to him do you feel anything he shook his head try richard try to feel where there is less danger he stomped his feet to knock the bugs off his legs and swiped off one that had made it to his face snakes were still pouring from the ground where the monster had fallen they boiled up like water from a spring i cant i feel danger all about its the same everywhere which way she clutched her skirt in a fist i dont know richard heard a scream the familiar voice wrenched his attention before he could stop himself kahlan was standing where the snakes poured from the ground they slithered up and over her as if she were a rock in a living stream of snakes she held her arms out to him richard help me you said you would love me always please richard dont leave me to this help me his own voice came in a shaky whisper sister verna what do you see jedidiah she answered quietly there are snakes all over him he wants my help may the creator have mercy on us why should he start now do not speak blasphemy he forced himself to turn from the vision gripping the sisters arm he led her away they sidestepped as they watched the forms drifting around them they avoided the snakes but it was impossible not to step on the huge bugs he knew that moving anywhere without knowing where to go could be more dangerous than standing still now that the magic had found them even so he couldnt make his feet stop finally they reached ground that was clear of snakes and bugs for the moment were running out of time do you feel anything yet do you feel the way yet nothing im sorry richard i have failed in my duty failed the creator ive killed us both not yet richard whistled for the horses they came at a trot ignored by the dark forms bonnie nuzzled her head against him forcing him back a step sister verna took up the lead line and started leading jessup away no richard leapt up onto bonnie he swatted two clicking bugs from his pant leg mount up hurry sister verna stared at him richard we cant ride the horses i told you that they are just dumb animals they will be spooked and take us into a storm of spells we cant control them without bits sister you told me you read the adventures of bonnie day do you remember when the three heroes were taking the injured people to safety and they came to the poison river that couldnt be crossed what did they say they said that the people just had to have faith that it could be done bonnie geraldine and jessup led them across the river have faith sister mount up hurry you want me to do something i know will get us killed because of some fool thing you read in a book we must walk bonnie tossed her head and danced about richard took up the slack in the reins to keep her in place you dont know the way i dont know the way if we stay we die then what good is riding going to do she had to give a sharp tug to keep jessup still he was roused by bonnies excitement sister what have the horses been doing all day whenever we let them browsing on grass that isnt there theyre having visions are they do you know that what if what were seeing is the illusion maybe they see whats really here now lets go the dark forms were closer their eyes glowing a brighter red sister verna glanced at them and then pulled herself up onto the saddle but have a little faith sister bonnie pranced sideways eager to be off i promised you i would save you and i intend to ill lead dont hold back richard gave his horse a sharp kick in the ribs with his heels while shouting the command she leapt out into a dead run the other two horses sprang to follow he leaned forward over bonnies withers as she stretched into the gallop he let her have free rein without giving her any hint of direction he focused on her ears instead of what lay ahead not wanting to influence her richard sister verna screamed from behind in the name of the creator watch where youre going dont you see what youre leading that horse into im not leading her he called out over the sound of thundering hooves she is picking her own course the sister galloped up beside him her eyebrows knit together in fury are you insane look at where youre headed richard snatched a glance they were rushing headlong for the edge of a cliff close your eyes sister have you lost your close your eyes its a vision a vision of a fear we all have in common falling just like we both saw snakes the snakes were real if youre wrong we will be killed close your eyes if its really there the horses wont run over the edge of a cliff he hoped he was right about that unless its really there and the magic shows them a vision of flat ground so as to kill us if we stay we die we have no choice he heard a growled curse from her as she hauled in on her left rein trying to turn her horse but jessup stayed with bonnie bonnie was leading jessup and geraldine wouldnt leave her i told you destroying those bits was foolish we cant control them theyre running away with us i told you i would save you destroying those bits is what will save you my eyes are closed if you want to live close yours sister verna was silent as the three horses thundered on richards eyes were squeezed shut when he judged they should be at the brink he held his breath he prayed that the good spirits would be with him this time his legs tingled in anticipation of plummeting over a cliff he tried not to think of what it would be like on the way down shared fear thats all it was he realized he was holding bonnies mane in a death grip he relaxed his fingers but kept his eyes closed the plunge didnt come the three horses galloped on he did nothing to slow them but let them run as they would they were in a frisky mood from grazing all day and he could tell they were enjoying the run they were running for the sheer joy of it after a time richard realized that the sound of their hooves was changing it wasnt as sharp it had grown softer richard were out of the valley he looked back over his shoulder to see the wisp of dark storm clouds boiling at the edge of the horizon the golden sun hung low in the sky over the grassy undulating ground beneath them their horses slowed to a canter are you sure are you sure were away from it she nodded this is the old world i know this place but it could still be an illusion to give us confidence and trap us before were clear must you always question what i tell you i can feel it with my han this is no illusion we are safely out of the valley and away from its magic it cannot reach us now richard wondered briefly if she could still be an illusion but he too sensed that the danger was no longer there he leaned forward and gave bonnies warm neck a big hug the immense hills they were entering were barren of trees covered with clumps of grass and wildflowers the low places sprinkled throughout with sandycolored rocks the sun shined warmly but it no longer scorched the land richard laughed into the wind at his face he grinned at sister verna but she wasnt smiling her brow was creased with a scowl as she scanned the sweep of hills before them wipe that grin off your face she snapped im just happy we made it im happy youre alive sister if you had any idea how angry i am with you right now richard you would not be quite so pleased i am still with you take this advice seriously you would be doing yourself a great favor right now if you kept that tongue of yours still he could only shake his head chapter you must cut off my arm zedd drew the sleeve of the sky blue satin robe down her arm covering the wound that wouldnt heal and the faint green glow of her flesh im not cutting off your arm adie how many times do i have to tell you he set the cutglass lamp back on a side table inlaid with silver worked in floral patterns next to the tray of brown bread and halfeaten lamb stew and strolled across the carpets to draw the heavy embroidered curtains back a bit with a thin finger he peered without seeing out the frostlaced window at the dark street the glow from the fire in the outer room cast a warm dim light through the open double doors the rooms were fairly quiet considering the size of the crowd down in the dining room the rams horn did a bustling business despite it being the dead of winter or perhaps because of it the open road was no place to sleep in this cold and snow and trade couldnt stop simply because of the season merchants drivers and travelers of every sort filled this inn as well as all the others in penverro he and adie had been lucky to find lodging or perhaps the innkeeper had been the lucky one lucky that someone would come along who was willing to pay the outrageous price he asked for his finest rooms but the price of the rooms did not concern zedd producing the required price in gold was no problem for a wizard of the first order he had real problems though the gash where the skrin had cut adie with its claw wasnt healing in fact it was getting worse and it would do no good trying to use more magic to cure the wound magic was the trouble listen to me old man adie levered herself up in the bed onto one elbow it be the only way to stop it you have tried and i do not fault your efforts but if we dont stop it i will die what be one arm compared to my life if you do not have the courage then give me a knife i can do the work myself he scowled over his shoulder of that dear lady i have no doubt but it would do no good im afraid what do you mean she asked in a low rasp he plucked a cold chunk of lamb from the goldrimmed bowl and popped it in his mouth before he hiked his lavish robes up a bit and sat on the edge of the bed he took up her good hand as he chewed it seemed thin and frail but he knew her to be more the stuff of iron adie do you know anyone with knowledge of this sort of taint she ignored his question why do you say it will do no good zedd patted her hand answer the question do you know anyone who would know anything about this i would have to think on it some but i do not think there be anyone still alive who would have such knowledge you be a wizard who would know better than you wizards be healers she took back her hand and what do you mean cutting off the arm would do no good she was silent a moment and then her eyes widened you mean it be too late zedd stood and turned away from her he put a hand on his bony hip as he considered the options there was not much to consider think on it adie and do so with haste this is beyond my knowledge and it is serious he heard the bed squeak as adie sank back down onto the pillows she released a tired sigh then i be dead at least my spirit will be with my pell at last you must go on now do not waste any more time i have already slowed you too much been in this bed too many days you must get to aydindril please zedd dont let me be responsible for what will happen if you dont get to aydindril go help richard and leave me to my end adie please do as i ask and think who would be able to help us too late he realized he had just made a mistake he winced and waited for what he knew what was coming he heard the bedsprings squeak again us i simply mean she snatched the sleeve of his fine robes and spun him around her brow was set in a serious scowl she gave a firm tug forcing him to sit on the bed next to her her eyes seemed more pink than white in the lamplight yet he could see the dim haze of green in them us she repeated this time it came out in a growling rasp and you complain about the small secrets a sorceress would choose to keep to herself out with it or i will make you sorry you dragged me along with you zedd gave a tired sigh it was just as well he couldnt keep it from her much longer anyway he drew the dark sleeve of his robe up his arm the flesh of his upper arm in the same place where her arm had been cut was blotched with cloudy black circles about the size of gold coins and had the same faint green glow as her arm she stared at it without reaction wizards use the magic of empathy to cure people we take the pain and the essence of the discordance the sickness or injury into ourselves we have passed the test of pain so in this as in other things we are able to endure what we take from another we use the gift to sustain us and to give strength to the person allowing the magic to cure what is out of order the harmony within us corrects the disharmony sickness and injury is an aberration and the magic restores the flows of power in a person to what it is intended to be he stroked her hand within limits of course we are not the hand of creation but from it we have the gift to use when it is appropriate but why be your arm like mine the actual transfer of the sickness or injury is blocked only the pain and disharmony of it is taken on so we may pass strength healing and wellness to the one we are helping he took hold of the silver brocade at the cuff and drew the sleeve back down his arm somehow the taint of the skrin passed through that barrier concern creased her features then we must both lose our arms zedd worked his tongue to wet it no im afraid that wouldnt help when i try to cure someone i can sense where the injury or sickness the disharmony lies he stood again turning his back to her though the wound is on your arm the taint of the skrins magic is evident throughout your body his voice dropped to a whisper it is also throughout me now zedd could hear the muffled laughter from down in the dining room merry music seemed to ooze up through the elegant richly colored carpets a bard was singing a bawdy tale about a princess masquerading as a serving wench her father and king had pledged her to a prince she loathed after having exposed the suitor as a scoundrel and greedy opportunist she found that despite having to endure her bottom being pinched she preferred the occupation of serving wench to that of princess and went on to live a life of singing and dancing the crowd roared their approval thumping their mugs in time with the tune adies voice came softly from behind him we be in a great deal of trouble old man he nodded absently indeed i be sorry zedd forgive me for what i have brought upon us he dismissed her regrets with a wave of his hand whats done is done its not your fault dear lady if anything its mine for not thinking before i used magic on this the price of using your heart before using your head the price too for violating the wizards second rule he thought but did not voice it the heavy folds of his robes swirled around him as he turned back to face her adie think there must be someone who would know about this taint someone who knows about the skrin is there anyone you visited when searching knowledge of the underworld who would know something even if its just a little it might give me the clue i need to rid us of this her weight settled deeper into the pillows as she frowned in thought finally her head rolled from side to side when i visited the women with the gift i be young they be old at least older than i they would all be dead by now zedd stepped closer did any have daughters daughters with the gift adies eyes came to his her eyebrows lifted and a smile grew on her finely wrinkled face yes one who taught me some of the most important things about the skrin had daughters she propped herself up on her good elbow three daughters her grin grew they all had the gift they be little at the time but they had the gift they would not be nearly as old as i if their mother lived long enough she would have taught them what she knew that be the way of a sorceress despite the dull ache of a foreign magic in his bones zedds step was lively with excitement then we must go to them where are they adie winced as she sank back down on the pillows she drew the blanket up to her chest nicobarese they be in a remote part of nicobarese bags zedd let out a sigh thats a long way in the wrong direction he stroked a thumb and finger down opposite sides of his smooth jaw can you think of anyone else adie whispered to herself as one at a time she lifted open the fingers of a closed hand sons she muttered she had only sons she lifted open another finger no she didnt know anything of the skrin finally she lifted open the last finger no children her hands fell limp to her sides i be sorry zedd the three sisters be the only ones who might know something and they be in nicobarese and this woman their mother where did she learn these things maybe we could go there adie smoothed the blanket against her stomach her hand slipped away to rest at her side the light only knows the only place i know we can go to seek answers be nicobarese zedd pointed a bony finger skyward then we go to nicobarese adie looked at him dubiously zedd there be blood of the fold in nicobarese my name be remembered there and not remembered fondly that was an awfully long time ago adie two kings ago time means nothing to the blood he rubbed his chin as he thought well no one knows who we are weve been hiding our identity to remain out of the keepers sight we will simply continue to be two wealthy travelers he scowled at her im already wearing this ridiculous outfit the lavish robes they both wore had been her idea and not one he enjoyed adie shrugged it would appear we have no choice what must be done must be done she grunted with the effort of sitting up in the bed we must be on our way zedd waved his hand dismissively you are weak and need rest i will secure us transportation its too difficult to ride horseback anymore ill hire us a coach or something he lifted an eyebrow as he gave her a sly smile after all if were going to wear these garish outfits and feign being wealthy travelers it would be best to play the part with a coach she watched as he scrutinized himself in front of the tall standing mirror he held the full robes out examining their volume the robe was a heavy maroon fabric with black sleeves and cowled shoulders the cuffs of the sleeves had three rows of silver brocade around the neck and down the front were bands of gold brocade woven in a coarser design the waist was held with a flashy red satin belt set with a gold buckle the whole effect was so ostentatious it made him groan inwardly well necessary was necessary zedd swept his arm across his middle while bowing dramatically how do i look dear lady adie plucked a slice of brown bread from the tray foolish he straightened in a rush and finally shook a finger at her may i remind you that you picked it out she shrugged revenge you picked mine i thought it only fitting to seek redress he strode across the expanse of carpets in a huff muttering that he thought she had gotten the better of the bargain by far you get a little rest ill see about our transportation adie tore a chunk of bread off with her teeth and spoke around the mouthful as he headed for the door dont forget your hat zedd froze with a wince he spun on the balls of his feet bags woman must i wear the hat too she chewed a moment and then swallowed the man who sold us the outfit said it be all the rage among noblemen zedd forced out a noisy breath and then snatched the limp red hat off the marble tabletop beside the double doors to the outer room he plopped it atop his wavy white hair better the feather be crooked he clenched his fists at last he reached up and rearranged the floppy hat straightening the long peacock feather happy she smiled at his expense he presumed zedd i said you look foolish only because you be such a handsome man that the fancy clothes look silly in trying to improve upon perfection a grin stole back onto his face he gave another quick bow why thank you madam she pulled the piece of bread in half and zedd be careful he cocked his head with a questioning frown masquerading in that outfit like the princess in the song you may get your bottom pinched zedd gave her a mischievous wink i wont let any stray wench trespass on your territory he canted his hat to a jaunty angle and humming a merry tune swept through the doors a cane he thought perhaps he should have a cane an ornate one of course it seemed to him that a gentleman should have a proper cane chapter warm air ascended the stairs from the dining room along with the buzz of the packed room the aroma of roasting meats drifted in from the kitchen to mix pleasantly with the sweet tang of pipe smoke zedd rubbed his stomach as he descended the stairs wondering if he might spare the time to sample a plate on the landing sat a tall basket holding three canes zedd pulled the most ornate a straight black cane with an elaborate head worked in silver from the basket he tapped the flamboyant cane on the wood landing testing its length and heft seemed a tad heavy he thought but it would do as a proper accessory the proprietor master hillman a rotund man with his white shirtsleeves rolled up above his dimpled elbows and wearing a sparkling white apron spied him as he reached the bottom of the steps and immediately rushed across the room shoving men out of his way the mans round pink cheeks plumped out farther as his small mouth spread with a familiar grin master rybnik so good to see you again zedd almost turned to see to whom the man was speaking before he remembered that was the name he had given he had told the innkeeper that his name was ruben rybnik and had given adies name as elda saying she was his wife zedd had always favored the name ruben ruben he rolled the sound pleasantly through his mind ruben please master hillman call me ruben the mans head bobbed of course master rybnik of course zedd held out the cane i find i have need of a cane of late could i convince you to part with this one the man opened his arms in a wide gesture for you master rybnik anything my nephew makes them and i let him display them here for my discriminating guests but this one is special and costly he came forward at zedds skeptical expression lifting the cane he leaned close to speak confidentially let me demonstrate master rybnik i dont show this to anyone might give them the wrong impression of my establishment you know here you see you twist and here at the silver band it comes open he separated the two parts a few inches to reveal a gleaming blade nearly two feet of keltish steel discreet protection for a gentleman but im not sure that for your simple purposes you would want such a costly zedd pushed the thin blade away and gave a twist the finely worked mechanism emitting a soft click as the parts locked together it will do nicely i like its looks not too flashy add the cost to my tally for the room wealthy gentlemen werent supposed to ask the price master hillman bowed his head up and down of course master rybnik of course and a fine choice i might add quite dashing he wiped his clean meaty hands on the aprons corner and then held an arm out to the room may i offer you a table master rybnik let me clear a table for you i will have someone move let me see to it no no zedd gestured with his new cane that empty one in the corner near the kitchen will do splendidly the man looked with worry to where zedd had pointed there oh no sir please let me get you a better table perhaps near the bard you would like to hear a lively tune im sure he knows any tune you could name let me know your favorite and i will have him play it for you zedd leaned close and gave the man a wink i much prefer the wonderful aromas coming from your kitchen to the singing master hillman beamed with pride and then swept his arm in the direction of the empty table ushering zedd toward it you do me such honor master rybnik i have never had anyone swoon over my cooking as do you let me get you a plate ruben please remember and i would be delighted to sample a slice of that roast i smell yes master rybnik of course wringing the corner of his apron he leaned over the table as zedd sat against the wall how is mistress rybnik i hope she is feeling better i pray for her every day zedd sighed much the same im afraid oh dear oh dear im so sorry ill continue to pray for her he started through the kitchen door let me get you that plate of roast zedd leaned his new cane against the wall and removed his hat after the man had left tossing it on the table the balding bard sat on a stool on a small platform hunched over his lute as if permanently deformed around it strumming with vigor and singing a spirited song about the adventures of a wagon driver his journey along bad roads from one bad town to another with bad food and worse women and how he loved the challenge of steep hills and twisting passes driving rain and blinding snow zedd watched one man alone in a booth against the wall across the room roll his eyes and shake his head as he listened to one improbable adventure after another a whip lay in a neat coil on the table before him other men at tables thought the song a proper tale and thumped their mugs as they sang along some of the drunker men tried to pinch the smiling serving girls that swept past but caught only air at other tables sat nattily dressed men and women probably merchants and their wives talking among themselves and ignoring the singing fashionable nobility wearing gleaming swords sat at a few tables off to the quieter side of the room in an empty area between the bard and the lone man in the booth couples danced some were serving girls and men who had paid them for the turn zedd noted with pique that while there were many men with hats all the hats looked to be functional and none were embellished with a feather zedd reached into a pocket to count the gold coins two he sighed it was expensive playing the part of the wealthy he didnt know how even the wealthy could afford it well he would just have to do something about that if he was to get transportation all the way to nicobarese he couldnt have adie riding that horse anymore she was too weak springing on light feet master hillman swooped through the kitchen door he set a goldrimmed white plate heaped with roasted lamb in front of zedd pausing before he straightened to return a finger to each edge of the plate and turn it just so quickly producing a clean towel he buffed a spot off the tabletop zedd decided that although he was hungry he had better eat carefully lest master hillman whisk out to wipe his chin for him may i bring you a mug of ale master rybnik on the house please call me ruben thats my name a pot of tea would be splendid of course master rybnik of course anything else i could do besides the pot of tea zedd leaned a little toward the center of the table master hillman did the same whats the current gold to silver exchange ratio forty point five five to one he answered ticking the numbers off without hesitation he cleared his throat i believe at least thats what i seem to remember he smiled apologetically i dont keep track but thats what i believe it is forty point five five to one yes i think thats right zedd made a show of considering this at last he pulled out one of his two gold coins and slid it with one finger across the table toward the proprietor i seem to be short of smaller coinage if you would be so kind could you exchange this for me and i would like it divided into two purses from one take one silver and exchange it for copper and put that in a third purse and please keep the odd bits for the house master hillman gave two quick deep bows of course master rybnik of course and thank you he swept the coin off the table so fast zedd could scarcely see it go after he left zedd dug into the lamb roast watching the people and listening to the singing as he chewed near the end of the meal master hillman was back placing his broad round back between zedd and the crowd he set two small purses on the table the silver master rybnik nineteen in the light brown one and twenty in the dark zedd slipped them into his robes as the other set a heavier green purse down sliding it across the table and the copper in this zedd smiled his thanks and the tea the big man slapped his forehead forgive me in handling the exchange i forgot one of the noblemen was waving a hand trying to get his attention he snagged the arm of a serving girl coming from the kitchen with a tray of mugs julie fetch master rybnik a pot of tea and quickly dear she gave zedd a smile and a nod before rushing on with her tray smiling hillman turned back julie will see to it master rybnik if there is anything else i can do please ask why yes you could call me ruben master hillman chuckled absently and nodded of course master rybnik of course he rushed off toward the nobleman zedd cut another piece of lamb and stabbed it with his fork he liked the name ruben he shouldnt have told the man any more of it than that while he pulled the meat off the tines with his teeth he watched julie cross the room weaving between the crowded tables he chewed as he watched her plunk down mugs around a table of raucous men all wearing longcoats as she set the last one before the last man he said something to her she had to lean over to hear above the din the men suddenly burst into laughter julie straightened and thumped the man on the head with her tray as she strutted away he pinched her she yelped but hurried on as she went past zedds table she leaned toward him and smiled ill be getting your tea for you right now master rybnik its ruben he flicked a finger toward the table of noisy men i saw what happened do you have to put up with that all the time oh thats just oscar hes harmless for the most part but he has the foulest mouth ive ever heard and ive heard my share sometimes i wish that when he opened his mouth to spew some of his filthy talk at me hed get the hiccups instead she huffed a wisp of hair back off her face and now he wants another mug im sorry i talk too much ill get your tea master ryb ruben ruben she gave him a pretty smile before hurrying off eating while he waited zedd watched the table of noisy men a small wish what could it hurt julie returned with the tea and a cup as she set them on the table zedd crooked his finger urging her to bend closer she leaned over tightening the apron strings behind her back as she did yes ruben the wizard gently touched a finger to the underside of her chin you are a very lovely woman julie oscar shouldnt speak to you in foul language or touch you again his voice lowered to a slow powerful whisper that almost seemed to make the air sparkle when you give him his ale speak his name and look him in the eyes as i look into yours now and you shall have your wish as you have spoken it to me but you wont remember asking it or that i have granted it julie blinked as she straightened im sorry ruben what did you say zedd smiled i said thank you for the tea and i asked if anyone here has a team of horses and perhaps a carriage for hire she blinked again oh well she looked around as she pulled her bottom lip through her teeth half the men in here well half the men who arent dressed as fine as you are drivers some hire out some haul freight and are regulars just passing through she pointed at a few tables they and they might hire out if you can sober them up zedd thanked her and she went to get the ale he watched as she carried it back across the room and set it in front of oscar he leered up at her with a drunken grin she stared into his eyes zedd saw her lips speak his name oscar opened his mouth to speak but hiccupped instead a bubble floated from his mouth up into the air it popped everyone at the table erupted in laughter zedds brow pulled together in a frown as he watched thats odd he thought every time oscar opened his mouth to speak to julie he hiccupped and bubbles floated up the men roared with laughter accusing her of soaping his ale they all agreed that if she had it would serve him right she left the men to their laughter when the lone man in the booth caught her attention she nodded after he asked for something and then headed for the kitchen julie paused at zedds table giving a nod back toward the lone man he might have a team he smells more like a horse than a man she giggled that wasnt kind forgive me its just that i cant get him to spend any money on ale he wants me to bring him some tea i have more than i can drink ill go share mine with him he winked at her save you a trip thanks ruben heres another cup then zedd put the last large piece of roast in his mouth as he surveyed the room the men had quieted down and oscar had stopped hiccupping as they all listened to the bard singing a sad song about a man who had lost his love zedd picked up the teapot and cups and started from his table he cursed under his breath when he remembered his hat and swept it up noticing the cane and snatching that up too he deliberately passed close to oscar looking him over carefully he couldnt figure out why he had hiccupped bubbles zedd gave a mental shrug the man seemed normal enough now if a little too drunk the wizard paused next to the booth with the single man he held up the pot and cups i have more tea than i can drink could i share it with you the man watched with a forbidding scowl from under bushy eyebrows zedd smiled the man did indeed smell like a horse he unfolded his huge arms slid the coiled whip to the side of the table and pointed for zedd to sit before folding his arms again well delighted thank you im ruben zedd tossed his hat on the table and lifted his eyebrows in invitation to reply ahern he said in a deep resonant voice what do you want zedd placed his cane between his knees with one hand and with the other tugged at the heavy robes as he sat on the bench trying to pull a thick fold from under his bony bottom well i just wanted to share my tea ahern what do you really want zedd poured the man tea i thought perhaps you might need some work got work zedd poured tea for himself really what sort ahern unfolded his arms and sat back in the booth appraising his new table companions eyes and nothing else he wore a longcoat draped around his massive shoulders over a dark green flannel shirt his thick mostly gray hair was long enough to nearly cover his ears and looked to be infrequently pestered by a comb his deeply creased weatherworn face was splotched with pink windburned patches why do you want to know zedd shrugged as he took a sip of tea so i can gauge if i can make you a better offer zedd of course could produce any amount of gold the man could ask for but judged that not to be the best tack he took another sip of tea as he waited i haul iron from tristen down here to the smiths in penverro sometimes over to winstead we keltans make the finest weapons in all the midlands you know i heard differently aherns frown darkened zedd folded his hands over the silvertopped cane i hear them to be the finest swords in all the three lands not just the midlands the bard started a new song about a king who lost his voice and had to command by written instruction but had never allowed any of his subjects to learn to read and so lost his kingdom too heavy loads to haul this time of year ahern gave the slightest hint of a smile worse in the spring in the muck thens the time we find out who can drive and who can talk zedd pushed the full cup a few inches closer to the man steady work ahern finally took up the cup enough to keep me fed zedd lifted one coil of the braided leather i thought you looked to be a man familiar with the use of this theres different ways to get effort from a team he pointed with his chin in the general direction of the room these fools think they get what they want by laying to with the whip and you dont ahern shook his head i crack my whip to get their attention to let them know what i want where to put their feet my team works for me because i trained them to work not because they get the whip if im in a tight spot i want a team that understands what i want not one that jumps when they feel a whip there are enough gorges strewn with bones of man and horse dont want to add mine to the lot sounds like you know your work ahern gestured with his cup to zedds elaborate robes what line of work you in orchards zedd said pointing a finger skyward the finest fruits in all the world sir ahern grunted you mean you own land and others work to grow you the finest fruits in all the world zedd chuckled you have it true now anyway it didnt start that way though i started by myself working struggling for years tending my trees day and night trying to produce the best fruit anyone ever tasted many of the trees failed many times i failed and went hungry but i finally was able to do better i saved every copper and bought more land in the years i could planted tended picked hauled and sold it all by myself over time people came to know my fruit as the best and i became more successful in the last few years ive hired people to tend things for me but i still keep my hand to the work so that it lives up to what people know me for would you hope for any less success in your work zedd sat back smiling proud of the story he had just invented on the spot ahern held out his cup for more tea where are these orchards in westland moved there before the boundary went up and why are you here now zedd leaned forward lowering his voice well you see my wife is not doing well were both old and now that the boundary is down she wants to visit her homeland she knows healers there who may be able to help her id do anything to help that woman shes too sick to travel on horseback any longer what with this weather so id like to hire someone to take us to her healers id pay any price any price i can afford to get her there aherns face softened somewhat sounds a fair enough journey where do you be headed nicobarese ahern slammed his cup down on the table some of the tea sloshed out what he lowered his voice and leaned forward the tables edge pressing into his husky middle its the dead of winter man zedd ran his finger around the rim of his cup i thought you said spring was the worst ahern grunted with a suspicious glare thats back northwest the other side of the rangshada mountains if you came from westland to go to nicobarese why would you cross the rangshada first now you just have to cross it back again zedd was caught off guard and had to scramble to find an answer at last he did im from up near aydindril we were going to go there for a visit to my homeland before we went in the spring to nicobarese i thought to cross the mountains to the south then go northeast to aydindril but elda thats my wife she took sick and i decided that well it would be better we go see her healers you would have been better off to have gone to nicobarese first before you crossed the mountains zedd folded his hands over his cane so ahern do you know how to undo something done in error so i may relive my life as you suggest ahern grunted a laugh guess not he thought a moment finally letting out a tired sigh ill tell you ruben its a long way youre asking for trouble i dont know that i want any part of it zedd arched an eyebrow really he made a deliberate survey of the room tell me then ahern if you find the task so formidable which of these men here would be up to the job which are better drivers than you ahern regarded the crowd with a sour look im not saying im the best there is but this lots more boast than brains dont think theres a one of them that would make it zedd shifted irritably on his bench ahern i think youre simply trying to boost price and i think youre trying to lower it zedd let his slightest smile touch his lips i dont think it as difficult a job as you make it aherns frown returned you think it easy zedd shrugged you drive in the winter now i simply want you to drive in a different direction thats all ahern leaned forward his jaw muscles tightening well the direction you want to go in is trouble first of all there are rumors of civil war in nicobarese worse the shortest way unless you want to spend weeks going to the passes far to the south is across galea his voice lowered theres trouble between galea and kelton i hear tell theres fighting along the border keltish towns have been sacked the people here in penverro are nervous what with being so close to the border with galea its all the talk going into galea is sure trouble fighting wagging tongues of gossips the war is ended the dharan troops have been called home ahern slowly shook his head not dharan raids galean piffle zedd snapped keltans think its a galean attack every time a farmer knocks a lantern over and a barn catches fire and the galeans see keltans every time a lamb is taken by wolves id like to have the price of all the arrows that have been shot into shadows he shook a finger at the man if either kelton or galea were to attack the other the central council would have the heads of those who spoke the orders no matter who they were he thumped his cane it would not be allowed ahern shrank back a little i dont know anything about politics and less about those wicked confessors i just know that going through galea can get a man shot full of arrows coming out of those shadows what you want is not as easy as you think zedd was tiring of the game he didnt have time for this something adie had said was nagging at the back of his mind something about light deciding to resolve the discussion one way or the other he drained his tea in one gulp thank you for conversation ahern but i can see youre not the man able to get me to nicobarese he rose reaching for his hat ahern laid a big paw on zedds arm and urged him down he squirmed forward on his bench look ruben times have been hard the war with dhara disrupted trade kelton was spared the brunt of the war but many of our neighbors werent its hard to trade with dead people theres not as much cargo as there used to be but we still have more than enough men wanting to haul you cant blame a fellow for trying to get his best price when an opportunity comes along his eyebrows lifted as he leaned in a little more trying to get the best price for the best fruit as it were best fruit indeed zedd waved his hand impatiently toward the room any one of these men will gladly offer to hire out any one of them can offer me a boastful story just as good as yours as to why they would be the best driver youre working up to asking top price thats fair enough but stop playing games with me ahern i want to know why i should pay it with the tip of one thick finger ahern slid his cup to the middle of the table indicating he wanted a refill zedd smoothed out his sleeves before obliging him ahern drew his cup into the protective shroud of his big arms as he leaned in he glanced around the room everyone was watching the bard sing a love song to one of the serving girls he was holding her hand singing words of eternal devotion the girls face was red she held her tray behind her back with her other hand as she studied her feet and giggled ahern extracted a chain with a silver medallion from under his green flannel shirt the reason i want top price is because of this zedd frowned down his nose at the regal image on the medallion that looks to be galean ahern gave a single nod in the spring and summer dhara laid siege to ebinissia the galeans were slowly being choked to death and no one would help them everyone had troubles of their own with the dharans and didnt want a piece of theirs the people there needed weapons i took loads of weapons and some badly needed salt up through some of the more isolated passes the galean guard had offered to escort any who would risk the run but few took the offer those back passes are treacherous zedd lifted an eyebrow very noble of you nothing noble to it they paid handsomely i just didnt like to see them folks trapped like that especially knowing what dharan soldiers do to those they vanquish anyway i reasoned that some keltish swords might give them a better chance to defend themselves thats all like i said we make the best zedd lifted a hand from where it was folded over his cane and gestured to the medallion now back under aherns shirt so what is that about after the siege was lifted i was called before the galean court queen cyrilla herself gave this to me she said i had helped her people defend themselves and i was always welcome in galea he tapped his chest where the medallion hung under his shirt this is a royal pass it says i may go anywhere i wish in galea unhindered and so now zedd said looking up from under his eyebrows you wish to put a price on something that is priceless aherns eyes narrowed what i did was a small bit they bore the brunt of the hardship i helped those people because they needed help and because i was paid well im not claiming to be a hero i did it for both reasons i wouldnt have done it for one alone now i have this pass and if it will help me to make a living well i dont see anything wrong with that zedd leaned back youre right ahern the galeans after all put a price in gold to your work for them i shall too if i can name your price to take us to nicobarese the teacup looked tiny in aherns big hands as he rolled it back and forth thirty gold not one less zedd arched an eyebrow my my dont we think a lot of ourselves i can get us there and thats my price thirty gold twenty now ten more when you get us to aydindril aydindril you never said anything about aydindril i dont want anything to do with aydindril with their wizards and confessors besides wed have to cross the rangshada again you will have to cross anyway to come back here so you cross in the north its hardly out of your way if you dont like the offer then ill offer twenty to take us to nicobarese and im sure i can find someone there more than willing to take us to aydindril for the other ten if we even need carriage after my wife is healed if you want all thirty then ill commit to it now if you agree to take us all the way thats my offer ahern rolled his cup back and forth all right to aydindril twenty now ten in aydindril he pointed a meaty finger in zedds direction but you have to agree to one condition such as aherns finger moved to point at zedds red hat you cant wear that hat that feather will spook the horses sure zedds wrinkly cheeks spread in a grin one condition of my own then ahern cocked his head you have to tell my wife that its your condition ahern grinned back done his grin vanished as quickly as it had come this isnt going to be an easy journey ruben up into and across those mountains i have a coach i bought with my earnings from hauling to ebinissia i can mount runners to it make easier going in the deep snow he tapped a finger against the side of the cup now the gold the bards fingers danced across the strings playing an enthralling tune without words practically every toe in the room was moving in time with it adding a drumlike accompaniment zedd reached into his robes and put a hand around the two purses of silver coins he watched the room without seeing it and then the wizard did again that which he had had to do far too often of late he channeled a warm flow of magic into the bags of silver coins and changed them to gold but what choice did he have to fail in this endeavor was to see the world of the living die he hoped he was not simply providing himself justification for an act he knew was dangerous nothing is ever easy he muttered under his breath what was that i said i know its not easy this journey he plunked the dark brown bag of gold on the table this should make it possible twenty now as agreed ahern pulled open the draw top and put two big fingers into the bag counting while zedd idly watched people enjoying the food and drink and music he was anxious to be off to nicobarese this some kind of joke zedd brought his attention back to ahern with two fingers the big man drew a coin from the bag and flicked it across the table the coin spun with a dull color before finally toppling over making a sound just as dull zedd stared incredulously the coin looked just like an ordinary coin except it was wood instead of gold i i well ahern had poured the rest of the gold coins into his big mitt and was now letting them tumble back into the purse and there are only eighteen here youre two short im not taking wooden coins zedd smiled indulgently as he pulled the light brown purse from his robes i apologize ahern he swept the wooden coin from the table it would seem i gave you the wrong purse the one with my lucky coin i would never give that away of course its more valuable to me than gold he peered into his purse seventeen and two of those were wood too there should have been nineteen altogether his mind reeled as he tried to make sense of it could master hillman have tried to short him no that would be too clumsy a theft besides to carve a coin from wood hoping to pass it off as gold would be witless my other two gold oh yes yes zedd pulled two gold coins from the purse and slid them across the table ahern added them to his purse jerked the drawstring tight and stuffed the dark brown bag into a pocket im at your bidding now when would you like to leave the silver coins that were turned to wood instead of gold did not concern the wizard that could be explained somehow but there were three coins missing vanished that could not be explained that did concern him concern him down to the bones in his toes i would like to leave as soon as possible at once you mean tomorrow zedd snatched up his hat no i mean at once he glanced at the mans puzzled frown my wife there is no time to waste she needs to get to her healers ahern shrugged well i just got back from tristen ill need to catch a little sleep its going to be a long hard run zedd reluctantly nodded his acquiescence first ill put the runners on the coach thatll take a couple of hours less if i can get one of these fellows to help me zedd thumped his cane no tell no one what youre doing or where youre going dont even tell anyone youre leaving he snapped his mouth shut when he saw aherns frown and thought he had better say something to ease it those shadows you spoke of does no good to let them know where to point an arrow ahern stared down suspiciously as he stood to his full towering height drawing his longcoat on first you talk me into taking you to the accursed land of wizards and confessors and now this i think i asked too little he flicked the ends of the coats belt together into a loose knot but a bargain is a bargain ill get the coach set up and get some provisions together before i snatch a little sleep ill meet you back here three hours before dawn well be across the border and into galea before midday tomorrow i have a horse at the stables we might as well take her along stop by and fetch her before you come for us zedd dismissed the man with an absent wave of his cane three hours before dawn his mind was racing in other directions this was more serious than he had thought it was imperative that they have help as soon as possible maybe the woman in nicobarese who had had the three daughters had studied somewhere perhaps someplace closer maybe they could find what they needed without going all that way time was of the essence the light only knows adie had said where the woman had learned about the skrin the light was a common reference to the gift it was also an obscure reference to something else entirely he thumped his cane on the floor must adie always speak in sorceresss riddles as ahern headed for the door the wizard rose and headed for the stairs chapter zedd opened the door to be confronted by a haze of smoke that smelled of creosote the window was opened letting in icy cold air and letting out the smoke adie sat on the bed wrapped nearly to her neck in a blanket brushing her straight black and gray jawlength hair whats going on what happened she pointed with the hairbrush i be cold i tried to start a fire zedd glanced to the hearth you need wood adie you cant have a fire without wood he expected a scowl instead it was a look of disquiet there be wood i used magic to try to light the fire from where i be in bed but there be a big puff of smoke and sparks i opened the window to let out the smoke when i looked to the hearth the logs be gone zedd stepped closer to her gone she nodded and went back to brushing something be wrong wrong with my gift zedd stroked a hand down her hair i know i had a similar problem it must be the taint he sat and took the brush from her hand setting it down adie what can you tell me about this taint about the skrin we must have answers i have already told you all i know the skrin be force on the cusp between the world of the living and the world of the dead but why wont the cut heal why wont my magic work to heal it what made the logs disappear when you used magic skrin be from both worlds do you not see she shook her head in frustration skrin be magic magic of both worlds so it can work in both worlds additive and subtractive we be touched by that force the taint be subtractive you mean that you think the taint of subtractive magic is corrupting our magic our gift she nodded it be like you have just cleaned ashes from a hearth with your bare hands and without washing them clean you try to hang up freshly washed white sheets to dry your hands be tainted with the ash and it gets on the clean damp white sheets sticks to them zedd silently considered the problem for a time adie he whispered we must somehow clean our hands wash the taint away you have a talent for stating the obvious old man zedd checked his tongue and took a different tack adie i hired us a coach to take us to nicobarese but youre getting weaker and im not going to be long behind i dont know if we can wait if theres another way maybe someone else closer who can help us i must know there be no other way there be no one else well what about this woman who had the three daughters perhaps she studied somewhere closer to learn some of these things maybe we could go there instead it not be a help why not adie considered him a moment and at last yielded she studied with the sisters of the light zedd shot to his feet what he paced back and forth between the bed and the fireplace bags and double bags i knew it i knew it zedd she studied with them to learn then she returned home she not be a sister the sisters not be so unreasonable as you think he halted to peer at her with one eye and how would you know that adie gave a resigned sigh the round skrin bone the one that be given to me just before the woman died the one i told you be important the one we lost back at my house the gifted woman who gave it to me be a sister of the light and what was she doing in the new world zedd asked in a level tone she not be in the new world i be in the old world at the time zedd put both fists on his hips as he leaned toward her you crossed the valley of the lost you went into the old world youre just filled right up full with little secrets adie shrugged with one shoulder i told you i searched out women with the gift to learn from them what i could some of them be in the old world i used my one passing through the valley and back to learn what i could of what i needed to know adie snugged the blanket tighter around her shoulders the sisters some of them taught me the little bits they knew important little bits the sisters view it as their province to know about the keeper the nameless one as they call him in order to keep souls from his grasp i did not stay at their palace long they would not let me stay unless i wished to be one of them but for a time they let me study with them study things in their vaults there be sisters in the palace i would not trust to cook me breakfast but there be some who were great help muttering zedd started pacing again the sisters of the light are misguided zealots they make the blood of the fold look to be reasonable men he came to a halt and when you were there did you see any of their boys did you see if they even had any with the gift i had my own learning to attend to i not be there to argue theology with the sisters that not be a wise thing to do they did not let me have anything to do with their charges if indeed they had any i be sure that if they had any boys they be ones from their side they know better than to risk violation of that truce they strongly fear what wizards on this side would do if they did they let me learn what i could from them and let me study in the vaults but they never let me see any boys nor would they tell me if they had any well of course they dont have any he snapped there are almost never any born with the gift anymore too many wizards have been killed in the wars we are a dying breed and as first wizard i would never turn down the teaching of one with the gift as happened thousands of years ago nor would any wizard i taught and the sisters know that they know the rules they may not take a gifted one unless every wizard declines to teach him to go against the rules just once would mean a death sentence to any sister that ever again crossed that valley they know that zedd they take that threat seriously well they ought to know it i met up with one of them once when i was young and i sent my warning to the prelate he flexed his fists as he stared off they are barbaric in their methods they are children teaching surgery if i knew how to get past those accursed towers id go down there and lay waste to the palace of the prophets zedd in that time past many with the gift died because there be none who would teach them to control it those with the power were possessive of it and did not want to train another who one day might be a threat to their power they abandoned those born with the gift left them to die by the power of the thing they be born with but didnt know how to control the sisters didnt want to let those abandoned boys die they just be doing what they think best to help people he cast her a withering glare the sisters of the light do only what is best for the sisters of the light maybe so but they are sworn to follow the rules the truce just as you do by letting them be when they come here he stared off shaking his head to let those with the gift die simply for their own selfish gain if they had lived up to their responsibilities as wizards the sisters of the light would never have come to be never been needed with his boot he brushed a dead ember on the flagstone hearth back into the fireplace they would never think of allowing a wizard to teach a young sorceress to use her gift yet they presume to teach a young wizard how to use his zedd i believe as you but listen to me dead and buried causes and wars not be our concern the veil be torn the stone of tears be in the world of the living those be our concerns i went to those women to learn magic i learned there and have taught you though insufficient to stop the taint has been able to slow it we must purge the taint before it claims us his mood cooled under the scrutiny of her white eyes of course you are right adie we have pressing problems to deal with she favored him with one of her little smiles i be glad you be wise enough to listen to wisdom he rubbed the ache in the back of his neck squeezing the tight muscles do you really think this woman with the three daughters would have known about this taint its a long way to go on a hunch and a hope she studied with the sisters of the light many years they liked her and wanted her to stay to be a sister but she did not believe as they and so finally went home i dont know the extent of her knowledge but if the sisters know anything about the taint and taught her she would have taught her daughters as much as i dont like the idea they be in nicobarese when zedd saw adie wrapping the blanket up around her shoulders he closed the window kneeling at the hearth he placed a handful of kindling on the grate and stacked on wood from the bucket to the side he was about to use magic to start the fire but thought better of it and instead lit a stick in the lamp he squatted touching the flame to the curls of the kindling zedd my friend adie said in a quiet gentle voice i not be a sister of the light i know that be what you are wondering i not be one of them that was exactly what zedd had been wondering and if you were he asked without turning would you tell me she was silent he looked over his shoulder to see her smiling at him the sisters of the light value honesty above almost anything else but to them lying in the service of their creator be a virtue the fire took a good start zedd stood before her looking down without returning her smile that is no comfort to me she took hold of his hand patting it with her other zedd i will tell you the truth i be in debt to some of them for the things they did for me but i give you an oath on the soul of my dead pell i not be a sister of the light i would never let them have one of the gifted from our side as long as i knew there be a wizard to teach him i would never allow a boy to be taken and subjected to their ways had i a say zedd smoothed the fringe of a carpet with his foot i know youre not one of them dear lady its just that i hate the thought of those women doing those things to ones with the gift when i can show them the joy of their talent its a gift they treat it like a curse with a thumb she rubbed the back of his hand i see you have yourself a dashing new cane zedd grunted i hate to think what master hillman is scheming to charge me for it and did you find us transportation zedd nodded a man named ahern we better try to get a bit of sleep hes going to be here with a coach three hours before dawn he gave her a grim look adie until we get to nicobarese and can rid ourselves of this taint i think we had better consider the consequences very carefully before using magic are we safe here a soft hand extended from the fog of dim light brushing her cheek comforting her you are safe here rachel both of you are safe now and always you are safe rachel smiled she did feel safe safer than she ever felt before not just safe like she felt when she was with chase but safe like she had felt in her mothers arms she hadnt been able to remember her mother before but she remembered now remembered the encircling arms holding her to a breast the terrible fright she had shared with chase whilethey raced to catch richard was melting away the bonetired worry of whether or not they would catch him in time was melting away the terror of the people who had tried to stop them the fights chase had had the horror of the blood she had seen all the blood she had seen it was all melting away as she stood before the sparkling pool the hands reached to her again reached to her from the gentle smiles of reassurance the hands helped her undo the buttons of her dirty sweaty dress and pull it off she flinched when her dress pulled against the bruise on her shoulder the bruise she got when a man chasing them had knocked her down the smiles turned to sad looks of concern for her pain the soft gentle voices cooed comfort to her the glowing hands caressed the shoulder and when they lifted the bruise was gone the hurt was gone all better rachel nodded yes its all better thank you the hands pulled off her shoes and stockings she sat on a warm rock and dangled her bare feet in the soothing water it would be so wonderful to bathe and be rid of the dirt and sweat the hands reached for the stone hanging on the necklace around her neck the hands drew back as if afraid we cannot remove this thing you must do it without our help through the soothing warmth and security of the beautiful land around her through the comfort of the peace she had found through her desire to do as the gentle murmurs had asked a voice rose up in her mind it was zedds voice telling her that she must not give the stone to anyone for any reason telling her how important it was for her to guard it always she looked up from the circles of ripples her feet made in the water to the gentle faces i dont want to take it off cant i leave it on the smiles returned and widened of course you can rachel if that is what you wish if that is what would make you happy i want it to stay on that would make me happy then it will stay on now and forever if you wish she smiled a smile of peace and security as she slipped into the soothing water it felt so good she floated and drifted she felt all her troubles sloughing away with the dirt one moment it seemed she couldnt feel any more safe or happy and then the next moment she did and the next yet more she drew her arms through the healing cleansing golden water swimming toward the other side of the pool where she remembered leaving chase she found him almost up to his neck in the water his head tilted back resting on a soft mat of grass at the bank his eyes were closed and he had a wonderful smile on his face father yes daughter he whispered without opening his eyes she swam up beside him he lifted an arm and she slipped under it it felt so good to have his arm around her shoulders comforting her father do we ever have to leave this place no they say we can stay forever she nuzzled against him im so glad she slept really slept like she couldnt remember ever sleeping before so safe and sheltered though she didnt know how long when she dressed her clothes were clean and seemed to sparkle like new chases clothes too were bright and shiny she held hands and danced in circles with other children glowing children whose voices and laughter echoed it made her laugh too laugh with happiness like none she had ever felt before when she was hungry she and chase lay in the grass the warm fog and glowing smiling faces around them and ate things that were sweet and delicious when she was tired she slept never having to worry about where she slept because she was safe safe at last and when she wanted to play the other children came to play with her they loved her everyone loved her she loved everyone sometimes she walked alone filmy shafts of sunlight streamed through the trees glowing meadows were filled with wildflowers bowing in the gentle breeze winking with bright specks of color sometimes she walked with chase holding his hand she was so happy that he was contented now too he never had to fight anyone anymore he was safe too he said he was at peace he sometimes took her for walks and showed her the woods where he said he grew up where he said he had played when he was as little as she she smiled with delight at the look of happiness in his eyes she loved him and was fulfilled knowing he like she had found peace at last she looked up and a small smile touched her thin lips she hadnt heard a sound and she neednt turn to look in the near darkness she knew he was there on the other side of the door she knew how long he had been there her legs still crossed she rose smoothly on a cushion of air hovering above the strawcovered floor the boys limp arms swung as they dangled like weighted fishing line lacking any life or rigidity his back bent backward draping over her arm in her other hand was clutched the statue she unfolded her legs and stretched her slippered feet to the floor settling her weight on them as the boy slid from her arm the dead weight of his head thunked against the floor his arms and legs flopped askew to one side his clothes were filthy disgusted she wiped her hands on her skirts why dont you come in jedidiah her voice echoed from the cold stone i know youre there dont try to pretend youre not the heavy door squeaked slowly open and the shadowed figure strolled into the light of a single candle burning on a rickety nearby table that was the lower rooms only accoutrement he stood relaxed silently watching as the orange glow faded from her eyes and they returned to the pale pale blue shot through with violet flecks his gaze went to the statue in her hand the owner sent me to find that she wants it back the thin smile grew does she now she shrugged well im through with it she held it out to him for now jedidiahs face was a calm mask as he took the statue she doesnt like it when you borrow her things she ran a finger down his cheek she is not the one i serve i dont really care what she likes and what she doesnt you would be wise to care a little more her smile brightened really i could give her the same advice she twisted holding an arm out to the body on the floor he had the gift slowly her hard eyes came back to his the smile gone as if one had never touched her features in all her life her voice came in a venomous hiss i have it now the slightest frown of puzzlement touched his cool expression think we must have the ceremony jedidiah the ritual in the hagen woods she slowly shook her head not anymore that is only the first time because we are female and female han cannot absorb the male her voice lowered to a derisive whisper not any longer now that i have the gift of a male i can accept others without the ritual her face glided to within inches of his so can you jedidiah she breathed with the quillion so can you i could teach you its sooo easy i simply showed him the joining rite to try to show him his han her cheek brushed his as she whispered into his ear but he didnt know how to control his gift i created a vacuum in the quillion she drew back to appraise his eyes it sucked the life right out of him sucked the gift right out of him its mine now he studied her eyes a time before glancing down at the body i dont recall seeing him before she continued to whisper to him from only inches away dont play games with me jedidiah what you really mean is where did i find him and why havent the sisters if he has the gift he shrugged nonchalantly if he has the gift why isnt he collared she cocked her head to the side because he is so young his han is too weak to be detected by the other sisters she tilted her head to the other side but not by me she touched her nose to his he was right here in the city right under their noses probably the offspring of a dalliance by one of you naughty boys very efficient saves having to bother with reports avoids awkward questions she glanced down at the body be a good boy and dispose of him for me i found him living in squalor down near the river dump him back there no one will think anything of it he lifted an eyebrow you wish me to clean up after you she ran a finger down his neck and across his throat across his radahan you make a serious mistake jedidiah if you think of me as a mere sister i have the male gift now same as you and i know how to use it you wouldnt believe how much that power increases when you add the han of another it would appear that you are becoming a sister to be reckoned with a wise person would take care with you she patted his cheek smart boy jedidiah she gave him a little frown as she slipped her hands to his waist you know jedidiah you may think of yourself as powerful in the gift but i think you should worry about that you have never had one to challenge your abilities before your rightful place among the wizards here but a new one comes he will be here soon and you have never seen one like this before i think you may no longer be the pride of the palace his countenance showed no reaction but his face slowly heated to red he lifted the statue well you did say you would like to teach me she waggled a finger in front of his face uh uh uh he is mine you may have another any gift will swell your power but this one is mine he waggled the statue in front of her face she might have something to say about that she has plans of her own plans for him she smiled with one side of her mouth i know and you are going to keep me informed of her plans he lifted an eyebrow you have plans for me the smile grew to both sides of her mouth very special plans her hands roamed lower down the sides of his hips feeling the firmness of his young muscles under his robes youre good with your hands good at making things making things in metal i have something i want you to make for me something invested with magic i hear thats one of your talents with the gift you wish a trinket an amulet perhaps in silver or gold no no dear boy youre to make it from steel youre to gather the steel of a hundred sword points very special sword points sword points from the armory old ones ones that have been used ones that have pierced flesh in combat he arched an eyebrow and what is it you wish made she slid a hand up the inside of his thigh well talk about it later she smiled at how quickly he responded to her touch you must be lonely since margaret ran away sooo lonely i think you need a friend who understands you did you know jedidiah that with the male han comes a unique understanding of the male i now understand in a new light what it is that men appreciate i think were going to be very special friends as a special friend you get the reward before performing the task she trickled a thread of magic into him focusing it where it would do the most good her smile widened as his head rolled back his eyes closed and he let out a throaty groan and then gasped panting he clutched his hands to her bottom drawing her to him and crushed his open mouth to hers she kicked the body out of her way as she let him force her to the strawcovered floor chapter the wolverine grew larger in his vision the arrow waited for the flat dark head to lift a low growl came from behind his left shoulder quiet richard hissed the gar fell silent the wolverines head rose with a zip the arrow was away wings aquiver the little gar bounced on the balls of its feet its attention riveted to the flight of the arrow wait he whispered the gar froze with a solid thunk the arrow found its target the gar squealed in glee wings spreading and flapping it bounced higher and turned to him richard leaned close and pointed a finger at the gars wrinkly nose the gar watched him attentively all right but you bring me back my arrow head bobbing in quick agreement the gar bounded into the air richard watched by the dim early dawn light as it swooped down on the dead quarry pouncing as if it were about to escape fur flew as claws ripped the dark silhouette lowered its wings folding against its back as it hunched over the prey growling and pulling its meal apart richard turned from the sight and watched instead the streaks of cloud change color against the brightening sky sister verna would be awake soon he still stood his watch despite her insistence that it wasnt necessary she finally relented but he knew she was angry because he wouldnt back down that made her angry what didnt she was more angry than usual since coming through the valley the day before she was silently livid richard glanced toward the little gar to see it was still eating how it had managed to follow him through the valley of the lost he couldnt imagine he had thought it was a mistake to keep feeding it before they reached the valley but he felt responsible for it every night when he had taken his watch it had come to him and he had hunted food for it he had thought he had seen the last of it when they crossed over into the old world but somehow it had followed the little gar was passionately devoted to him when he was on watch it ate with him played with him and slept at his feet if not on them when his watch was over it hardly made a fuss about him leaving richard never once saw the gar at any other time it seemed to instinctively know to stay away from the sister to avoid letting her see it richard was reasonably certain she would try to kill it maybe the gar knew that he was continually surprised by the intelligence of the furry little beast it learned faster than any animal he had ever seen kahlan had told him that shorttailed gars were smart now he knew how right she was he had only to show it something once or twice to make it understand it was learning to understand his words and tried to imitate them although it didnt seem to have the capacity for speech some of its sounds came strangely close richard didnt know what to do about the gar he thought perhaps it should strike out on its own learn to hunt and survive but it wouldnt leave it followed out of sight wherever they went even through danger perhaps it was too young to get by on its own maybe it saw richard as its only way to survive maybe it saw him as a surrogate mother in truth richard didnt really want it to leave it had become a friend as they had traveled through the wilds it gave him unconditional love never criticized him and never argued with him it felt good to have a friend how could he deny the same thing to the gar the flap of wings brought him out of his thoughts the gar thumped to the ground before him it had gained a lot of weight since richard had first found it he would have sworn it had grown nearly half a foot too the sinew under the pink skin of its chest and belly had become taut and its arms were no longer all hide and bone as they had been but were thickening with muscle he was afraid to think of how big it would eventually get he hoped it would be on its own by then hunting enough food to feed a fullgrown shorttailed gar would be a fulltime occupation after wiping the shaft on its furcovered thigh to clean off the blood the gar flashed richard its hideous bloodstained grin and held out the arrow richard pointed over his shoulder i dont want it put it back where it belongs the gar reached over richards shoulder and slid the arrow back into the quiver that leaned against a stump it contorted its features seemingly to question if it had done it correctly richard smiled as he patted its full belly good boy you did it right the gar flopped happily on the ground at his feet contenting itself with licking blood from its claws and coarse fur when it finished it laid its long arms over richards lap and rested its head on them you need a name the gar looked up cocking its head to the side its tufted ears turned toward him name he tapped his chest my name is richard the gar reached out and tapped richards chest in imitation richard richard it cocked its head to the other side raaaa it growled through sharp fangs its ears twitching richard nodded rich ard it tapped richards chest again raaaa gurrrr it said in its throaty growl this time showing less teeth rich ard raaaach aaarg richard laughed thats close now what are we going to call you richard thought about it trying to think of something appropriate the gar sat its brow bunched into deep furrows watching him intently after a moment it took richards hand and tapped it against his chest raaaach aaarg it said it pulled richards hand to its own chest tapping it against the fur grrratch gratch richard sat up straighter in surprise your name is gratch he tapped the gar again gratch the gar nodded and grinned as it tapped its own chest grrratch grrratch richard was a little taken aback it had never occurred to him that the gar might have a name gratch it is then he tapped his own chest again richard he smiled and patted the gars shoulder gratch the gar spread its wings and thumped its chest with open claws grrrratch richard laughed and the gar leapt on him letting out its throaty giggle as it wrestled him to the ground gratchs love of wrestling was second only to its love of food the two of them tumbled across the ground laughing and struggling to gently get the best of each other richard was gentler about it than gratch the gar would put its mouth around richards arm though thankfully at least it never bit its needlesharp fangs were long enough to easily go all the way through his arm and he had seen the gar splinter bone with those teeth richard brought the wrestling match to an end by sitting up on the stump gratch sat straddling him arms legs and wings wrapped around him it nuzzled against richards shoulder gratch knew that at dawn richard left richard spied a rabbit in the underbrush some distance off and thought that perhaps sister verna would appreciate some meat for breakfast gratch i need a rabbit gratch climbed off his lap as richard took up his bow after the arrow was off he told the gar to bring him the rabbit but not to eat it gratch had learned to retrieve and was happy to do it he always got what was left of the skinning and gutting after richard was done and had bid gratch goodbye he hiked back to camp his mind wandered back to the vision of kahlan he had had in the tower and the things she had told him the sight of her being beheaded haunted him he recalled her words speak if you must these words but not of this vision of all there were but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive when the shadows threat is lifted therefore comes the greater darkness of the dead for there to be a chance at lifes bond this one in white must be offered to her people to bring their joy and good cheer he knew who the this one in white was he knew what bring their joy and good cheer meant he thought too about the prophecy that sister verna had told him of the one that said he is the bringer of death and he shall so name himself she claimed the prophecy said that the holder of the sword is able to call the dead forth call the past into the present he wondered and worried what that could mean at the camp he found sister verna squatted at the fire cooking bannock the aroma made his stomach grumble the sparsely wooded country was coming to life with sounds of animals and bugs heralding the dawn clusters of small dark birds sang from the tall thinly foliated trees and gray squirrels chased each other up and down their branches richard hung the the skewer with the rabbit over the fire as sister verna continued to mind the bannock i brought you some breakfast i thought you might like some meat she gave only a grunt of acknowledgment you still angry with me for saving your life yesterday she carefully laid another small stick on the fire i am not angry with you for saving my life richard i thought you said your creator hated lies do you think he believes you i dont her face turned so red richard thought her curly hair might catch fire you will not speak blasphemy and lying is not you do not understand richard why im angry richard sat on the ground and grasping his ankles folded his legs in maybe i do youre supposed to be my protector not the other way around maybe you feel that you have failed but i dont feel that you failed we both just did what we had to to survive did what we must fine wrinkles radiated around her eyes as they narrowed as i recall from the book when bonnie geraldine and jessup led the people across the poison river some of those people died richard smiled to himself so you really did read it i told you i did that was foolhardy we could have been killed taking that risk we didnt have any choice you always have a choice richard that is what i am trying to teach you she sat back on her heels the wizards who created that place thought they had no choice but they made things worse you were using your han back there and you were doing it without understanding the consequences what choice did we have hands on her knees she leaned forward we always have a choice richard you were lucky this time that your use of magic didnt get you killed what are you talking about sister verna drew a saddlebag close and started rummaging through it finally pulling out a green cloth bag you got some blood from that beast on your arm did any of the bugs bite you on my legs show me richard pulled up his pant legs and showed her the swollen red bites she shook her head and whispering to herself pulled first one and then a second bottle from the bag with a stick found on the ground nearby she dipped a white paste from one bottle and wiped it onto the flat of a knife blade she threw the stick in the fire taking up another stick she dipped a dark paste from the other bottle and mixed it with the light on the flat of the blade then spread it along the edge she threw the second stick with some of the mixed paste on it into the fire richard flinched when it exploded in a whitehot ball of fire that lifted skyward dissipating as it rose turning to a boiling cloud of black smoke she held up the knife to reveal a gray paste spread on the blade light and dark earth and sky magic to heal what would otherwise kill you by tonight you have a way of getting yourself out onto thin limbs richard each step you take only makes your predicament worse now come over here closer richard dug his heels in and scooted around the fire were you trying to decide whether or not you were going to help me of course not this is made from powerful magic constructed magic to smother the venom injected into you by the conjured creatures too soon and the cure would kill you too late the bites would kill you it must be the right kind of magic at the right time i was simply waiting for the proper time richard wanted to argue with her but instead said thank you for helping me she frowned at him before leaning over his bites sister how was i making things worse you were being reckless using magic is dangerous not only to others but to the one who calls it forth as well richard winced as she drew the edge across one of the bites first one way then the other cutting an x on it the sting made his eyes water how can it be dangerous to me she concentrated as she leaned over his leg whispering an incantation while stroking the knife across his swollen flesh he tried not to jump when she cut the next bite she was only making light cuts but they stung fiercely it is like starting a fire in the center of a tinder dry wood you find yourself in the center of the fire in the center of what you have started what you did was foolish and dangerous sister verna i was trying to stay alive she jabbed a finger at one of the painful bites and look what happened if i dont heal you youll die she finished with his legs and turned her attention to his arm when we were being attacked by those beasts you thought to save us but everything you did only increased the danger when she finished she held the knife blade over the fire a thin stream of white flame roared up from the steel consuming the remaining paste she held the blade to the fire until the paste and the white flame were gone if i hadnt acted sister we would be dead she shook the hot blade at him i did not say you were wrong to act i said you acted in the wrong way you used the wrong kind of magic i used the only thing i had the sword she pitched the knife with a thunk it stuck solidly in a piece of firewood acting without knowing the consequences of the magic you call forth is perilous behavior well nothing you were doing was helping sister verna rocked back on her heels stared at him for a moment and then turned to busy herself with replacing the bottles in the green bag im sorry sister i didnt really mean that it didnt come out the way i intended i only meant that you werent able to sense the way and i knew if we stayed we would be killed the bottles clinked together as she moved them around in the bag she seemed to be having difficulty getting them packed the way she wanted richard you think that controlling the gift using magic is what you are to learn with us that is the easy part knowing what kind of magic to use how much to use when to use it and the consequences of using it that is the hard part that is the meaning of everything how how much when and what if just like the magic i have put on your bites she fixed him with a deadly serious expression without that knowledge you are a blind man swinging an axe in a crowd of children you have no idea of the danger you invoke when you use magic we try to give you sight and some sense before you swing that axe richard picked at a clump of grass at his feet i never thought about it that way perhaps if anything i should be angry with myself for being foolish i didnt think there was anything powerful enough to tempt me into a trap i was wrong thank you richard for saving me he wrapped a long stalk of grass around his finger i was so relieved to find you i thought you were dead im glad youre not she had pulled all the little bottles out of the bag and set them on the ground i could have been lost in that spell for all time i should have been what do you mean there seemed to him to be more bottles than would fit into the bag but then he had seen them all come out we have tried to rescue sisters before we have seen some and their charges lost in those enchantment spells i saw one the first time i went through we have never been able to get them out sisters have died trying she started replacing the bottles you used magic i used the sword the sword has magic you know no you didnt use the swords magic you used your han even though you didnt realize it using your han through desire without wisdom is the most dangerous thing you can do sister i think it was just the swords magic when you called to me i heard you we have tried to call to others and they have never heard us not once you just didnt know how you couldnt hear me either until i stepped through some sort of sparkling wall around you then you could hear me you just have to step through that wall first she pushed bottles to each side to make more room as she spoke softly we know that richard we have tried every sort of magic and have never been able to pass through or break the wall of one of these spells or been able to get the attention of one captured by it no one has ever been brought out of an enchantment spell before she replaced the last bottle and finally turned to face him thank you richard he shrugged as he pulled the grass off his finger well it was the least i could do to make up for what i did for what you did richard occupied himself with carefully rolling his pants back down well before i saved you i kind of killed you she leaned closer you did what you were hurting me with your magic with the collar tm sorry richard i was in the spell and didnt realize what i was doing i didnt intend to hurt you he shook his head not then before in the white tower she leaned even closer and gritted her teeth you went into a tower are you mad i told you what those towers are how could you be so sister i had no choice we have already discussed choice i told you how dangerous those towers are i told you to stay away from them look there was lightning all around it was trying to strike me i well i didnt know what else to do so i dove through an archway into the tower for protection cant you follow the simplest instructions must you always act a child richard looked up from under his eyebrows those were your exact words you came into the tower i was sure it was you you were angry with me much as you are now and you used those exact words he gritted his teeth as he put a finger to the collar at his neck you used this you used it to throw me against the wall and pin me there with it can this collar do that sister she sat much quieter yes we dont have the power of a wizard the male han the collar amplifies our power so we may be stronger than the one wearing it so we can teach them his voice was deep with anger then you used it to give me pain like the pain you did for real when you were in the spell only it was stronger and went on and on can the collar do that too sister she pulled a clump of grass to her side and began cleaning her hands with it avoiding his glare yes but that was a vision richard i wasnt really doing it i told you to stop hurting me or i would put a stop to it you wouldnt stop so i called the swords magic and broke the bond of the power holding me you were furious you said that i had made my last mistake you said you were going to kill me for fighting you you were going to kill me sister im sorry richard she whispered as she looked up that you had to suffer that her voice regained some of its strength so what did you do to me to the vision of me he leaned over and touched the edge of his first finger to the side of her shoulder i cut you in half with the sword right here her hands stopped she was stone still some of the color had left her face finally she regained her composure richard picked at the clump of grass by his foot again i didnt want to do it but i was positive you were going to kill me she tossed the grass aside im sure you were richard but that was only a vision if it were real it wouldnt have turned out that way you would not have been able to do what you did who are you trying to convince sister me or yourself she met his glare the things you saw were not as they are in the real world they were simply illusions richard let it drop he turned the stick with the rabbit to cook the other side and slid the iron plate with the bannock to the side of the fire to let it cool anyway when i saw you again i didnt know if you were a vision or real but i truly hoped you were alive i didnt want to kill you he looked up and smiled besides i promised you that you would get through the valley of the lost she nodded yes you did more desire than wisdom indeed sister i was only doing what i could think of to survive to help you survive too she sighed and shook her head richard i know youre trying to do your best but you must understand that what you think is best is not necessarily right youre calling your han without knowing what youre doing or even realizing youre doing it in so doing you tempt danger you cant fathom how was i using my han wizards make promises that their han strives to keep you promised me you would help me through the valley save me but in so doing you have invoked prophecy richard frowned ive given no prophecy not only given it but used your han without realizing it used prophecy without knowing its form to do something in the past to aid you in the future what are you talking about you destroyed the horses bits i told you at the time why i did that theyre cruel she shook her head thats what im talking about you think you did it for one reason but it served another purpose your conscious mind is simply seeking to rationalize what your han is doing when we were running from the valley i didnt believe in what you were doing and i tried to turn my horse because he didnt have a bit i was unable to so what she leaned closer destroying the bits in the past satisfied a need of a promise in the future that was using prophecy youre swinging the axe blindly richard gave her a skeptical expression thats a stretch sister even for you i know how the gift works richard richard thought about it and finally decided he didnt believe her but decided too that he didnt want to argue with her about it there were other things he wanted to know is your little book full i havent seen you writing in it i sent a message yesterday that we have come through the valley i have nothing else to write thats all the book is magic with magic we erase old messages i erased all but two pages but with what i added yesterday there are now three pages full richard tore off a corner of the hot bannock who is the prelate she charges the sisters of the light she is her eyes narrowed ive never mentioned her how do you know of her richard licked the crumbs from his fingers i read it in your book her hand flew to her belt groping for the book it was there where it always was youve read my private writing you have no right i will you were dead at the time her mouth snapped shut and he went on when i killed you or the illusion of you the book fell on the ground i read it the tension left her muscles oh well thats simply part of the illusion i told you its not as things are in life richard tore off another corner of bannock there were only two pages with writing just as the real book not until after we were through the valley did you add the third back then there were only two she watched him eating the bannock illusion richard he looked up one page said i am the sister in charge of this boy these directives are beyond reason if not absurd i demand to know the meaning of these instructions i demand to know upon whose authority they are given yours in the service of the light sister verna sauventreen the second page said you will do as you are instructed or suffer the consequences do not presume to question the orders of the palace again in my own hand the prelate the sisters face had drained of color you had no business reading something belonging to another as i said you were dead at the time what instructions did they give you about me that made you so angry the color came back to her face in a rush it has to do with a technicality its nothing you would understand and anyway it is not your business richard lifted an eyebrow not my business you claim you are only trying to help me yet youve taken me prisoner and you say its not my business i have this collar around my neck and with it you can hurt me perhaps kill me and you say it is not my business you tell me i must do the things you say that i must take them on faith even though that faith is shaken with every new thing i discover yet its not my business you tell me that the illusion i saw was not as things are in the real world yet i find it was and you tell me its not my business sister verna was silent she watched him without emotion watched him he thought as if he were a bug in a box sister verna will you tell me one thing ive been wondering about if i can he pulled his legs up tighter under himself he tried to keep any hostility out of his tone when you first saw me you were surprised that i was grown you thought that i would be young thats right we have ones at the palace who can sense one born with the gift but you were hidden from us so it took us a very long time to find you but you told me just the other day that you had spent over half your life away from the palace searching for me if youve spent twentyodd years looking for me how could you expect me to be young you would have expected me to be grown unless you didnt know i had been born and started searching for me long before anyone at the palace sensed me her answer came in a cautious quiet voice it is as you say it has never happened this way before so why would you come looking for me before any of you sensed that one with the gift had been born she chose her words carefully we didnt know precisely when you would be born but we knew you would be so we were sent in search how did you know i would be born you are spoken of in prophecy richard nodded he wanted to know about this prophecy and why they thought he was so important but he didnt want to stray from the trail he was following at the moment so you knew it might be many years before you found me yes we didnt know when you would be born we were only able to narrow it to a range of decades how are the sisters who are to be sent chosen were selected by the prelate you have no say in the matter she tensed as if suspicious she might accidentally be slipping her neck through a noose yet was unable to keep from voicing her faith we work in the service of the creator we would have no reason to object the whole purpose of the palace is to help those with the gift to be selected to save one with the gift is one of the greatest honors a sister may receive so none of the others sent have ever had to give up so many years of their lives to rescue one with the gift no ive never heard of it taking more than a year but i knew this assignment could last for decades richard smiled to himself in triumph he leaned back stretching his muscles he took a deep breath now i understand her eyes narrowed what do you understand i understand sister verna why you treat me the way you do i understand why were always fighting why were always at each others throats i understand why you resent me why you hate me she looked like someone waiting for the trapdoor to fall put from under her i dont hate you richard he nodded and pulled the catch on that trapdoor yes you do you hate me and i dont blame you i understand you had to give up jedidiah because of me she flinched as if a noose had just tightened around her neck richard you will not speak to me in you resent me because of that not because of what happened to the other two sisters its because of jedidiah if it werent for me you would be with him you would have been with him for the last twenty years you had to give up the love of your life to go on this accursed quest to find me they sent you you had no choice you had to go its your duty and it cost you your love and the children you might have had thats what ive cost you why you hate me sister verna sat and stared she neither spoke nor moved finally she said the seeker indeed im sorry sister verna no need to be richard you dont know what you are talking about she slowly lifted the rabbit from the fire setting it on the iron plate with the bannock for a moment she stared off into nothing we had better finish eating we must be on our way fine but i just want you to consider sister that its not by my choice i didnt do this to you the prelate did you should either be angry with her or if youre so devoted to your duty to your creator as you claim then you should have joy in his service either way please stop blaming me she opened her mouth to speak but then instead fumbled with the stopper on the waterskin finally getting it off and took a long drink drawing deep breaths when she finished she dabbed her sleeve to her wet lips her unwavering gaze locked on his soon richard we will be to the palace but first we have to pass through the land of a very dangerous people the sisters have an arrangement with them to be allowed to pass you will have to do a task for them you will do it or there will be great trouble what will i have to do you will have to kill someone for them sister verna i promise you im not going to her index finger rose from her fist commanding silence dont you dare swing the axe this time richard she whispered you have no idea of the consequences she rose to her feet get the horses ready we must be leaving richard stood arent you going to have your breakfast she ignored his question and stepped close to him it takes two to argue richard youre always angry with me with everything i tell you you resent me you hate me because you think i made you put on that collar but i didnt and you know it kahlan made you put it on its because of her you wear the radahan if it werent for her you

or if youre so devoted to her as you claim then have joy in carrying out her wishes perhaps she has valid reasons for them maybe she has your interests at heart either way please stop blaming me richard tried to swallow but couldnt chapter the bloodred light of days death oozed through the bones of trees lining the spine of the next ridge her greeneyed gaze left the wellhidden places where outposts of sentries were stationed they were too far apart she noted or she would not be standing unnoticed where she was she tallied the men in rank upon rank of tents marching up the valley floor below five thousand would be generous she concluded horses were picketed to her left near supply wagons all neatly lined up to the far side of the valley latrines had been dug in the snow cook wagons stationed between the men and the supply wagons were packing up for the night colorful battle flags flew over the command tents it was probably the most orderly army she had ever seen afield galeans did have a penchant for order they look very nice chandalen said in a quiet voice for men about to be slaughtered the two brothers gave nervous chuckles of agreement kahlan nodded absently that morning they had seen the army these men were chasing they were not neat they were not orderly they were not pretty and their sentries were not stationed too far apart still chandalen and the two brothers had managed to get her close enough to see what she had wanted to see and to take a tally she had guessed their numbers at fifty thousand and that was not being generous she let out a long breath its thin white cloud drifting away in the cold air i have to stop this she hiked her pack and bow up on her back lets get down there chandalen prindin and tossidin followed behind as she slogged down the hillside of fluffy snow it had taken her longer than she had hoped to catch these men a blizzard high in jara pass had left the four of them holed up in the shelter of a wayward pine for two days wayward pines always reminded kahlan of richard and as she had lain in her fur mantle listening to the howl of the wind she had dreamed of him while she slept and while she was awake she was furious that she had to lose valuable time on the way to aydindril to stop this army from their suicide pursuit of the forces that had destroyed ebinissia but as the mother confessor she couldnt allow nearly five thousand men to die to no purpose she had to stop them before they got close to the army that had plundered ebinissia they were too close now they would surely make contact by the next day the army sprang to alert as the four figures in white wolfpelt mantles marched toward them shouts erupted and were repeated back through the ranks tent flaps were flung open and men poured out swords were drawn sending the ring of steel into the cold twilight air men with spears came running through the snow men with bows took up positions nocking arrows a wall of several hundred men put themselves between her and the command tents more were coming at a run pulling on clothes shouting to others still in their tents kahlan and the three men with her came to a halt she stood tall and still behind her chandalen prindin and tossidin leaned lazily on their spears a man of rank tumbled out of the largest tent as he pulled on a heavy brown coat he made his way through the wall of men shouting at the archers to hold their arrows he was joined by two others of rank as he stumbled through the line of defenders she recognized his rank as he approached he was the captain the two men with him one to each side were lieutenants when he drew himself to a panting halt before her she let the hood of her mantle drop back her long hair fell across the white fur what is the the captains eyes went suddenly wide he and the two lieutenants collapsed to a knee every man as far as she could see fell to his knees every head bowed the rustle of wool the creek of leather and the clang of steel fell silent the three men with her cast one another glances of wonder they had never seen the mother confessor greeted by anyone but mud people before the only sound was the slow creak of branches in the cold breeze rise my children accompanied by the renewed racket of movement all came to their feet the captain stood and gave her a smart bow from the waist he came up with a proud smile mother confessor what an honor kahlan stared in disbelief at his square jaw his wavy light brown hair his clear blue eyes his young handsome face youre a child she whispered she looked around to the hundreds the thousands of young bright eyes all fixed on her she blinked at them she could feel the blood going to her face her fists tightened as she shook with rage youre children youre all children the captain glanced back to his men with an embarrassed expression bordering on hurt mother confessor were new recruits but were all soldiers of the galean army you are all children she whispered children silence swept over the gathered recruits most looked to be fifteen or sixteen years the captain and his two lieutenants shifted their weight and hung their heads some of the men couldnt help staring openly at chandalen prindin and tossidin they had never seen anyone like them before kahlan grabbed the captains lapels and began dragging him off she growled to the two lieutenants you two come along with us she glared over their heads everyone go back to what you were doing there was a rattle of swords being returned to scabbards and arrows to quivers as she dragged the captain out of earshot of his men when she reached the trees she pulled him toward a log and released him with an angry shove kahlan flopped down on a snowcovered log as if it were a throne she folded her arms chandalen stood to her right prindin and tossidin to her left they planted the butts of their spears and waited in silence she gritted her teeth what is your name captain he fumbled with a brass button on his open coat im bradley ryan his blue eyes came up captain bradley ryan mother confessor he quickly glanced away to the man at his right this is lieutenant nolan sloan he pointed to the other side this is lieutenant flin hobson how many children do you have along with you captain ryan he stiffened a little mother confessor we may be younger than you although not by much and you may not think highly of us but were soldiers good soldiers good soldiers she was hardly able to keep herself from screaming at him if youre such good soldiers why was i able to walk unnoticed through your line of sentries his face reddened and he made a visible effort to remain silent and is there a one of these good soldiers including you three that is beyond eighteen he pressed his lips tighter and shook his head then i repeat how many children do you have along with you there are four and a half thousand under my command and do you know captain ryan that you are about to stumble upon a force ten times your size captain ryan lifted an eyebrow and a littleboy grin grew out of one side of his mouth were not about to stumble upon anyone mother confessor were about to catch them weve been chasing them i think well have them tomorrow she gritted her teeth anew have them tomorrow if i hadnt caught up with you young man you and all your men would die you have no idea of the army you are about to catch he lifted his chin we know what we are chasing we have scouts you know i get reports kahlan shot to her feet thrusting her arm to the right and pointing there are fifty thousand men around that mountain fiftytwo thousand and a few hundred he shrugged were not stupid we know what were doing her arm dropped as she glared oh you do do you and just what were you going to do once you caught them captain ryan smiled as he leaned in sure that he could prove to her that he indeed did know what he was doing well theyre about to come to a divergence in the pass im going to send a force up there around them to come in from each fork theyll think theyre being attacked by a large force were going to drive them back this way where were going to be waiting for them beyond the narrows just ahead then were going to retreat back this way to the narrows then split the flank let them in until they have nowhere to go the pikemen will be bunched in the narrowest place theyre called the anvil archers to the sides will hold the enemy to the center the force driving them is called the hammer his grin widened well crush them in the middle he flicked his hand in a casual manner as he straightened a little its a classic tactic its called the hammer and anvil dumbfounded kahlan stared at him i know what its called young man the hammer and anvil is a bold maneuver under the right conditions against a force ten times your size its beyond foolhardy you are a badger trying to swallow an ox whole we were taught that with good timing and determination a small force of good men in a tight place like this valley good men you think thats going to count with the spirits is that what your pride and presumption leads you to think the captains eyes descended to the ground you cant push a boulder with a stick the only way to move them back this way is to frighten them into moving back she thrust her arm out pointing off toward the enemy again those are experienced battlehardened men theyve been fighting and killing for a good long time do you think they dont know what a hammer and anvil is do you think that just because theyre the enemy they are stupid well no but i think she jabbed a finger at his chest as she cut him off do you want me to tell you whats going to happen captain you dont have enough men to push them when you send that detachment around them they will accommodate you and move a little and as they do theyll wing out to let your force in thats called a nutcracker guess who the nut is then they will move for your anvil they will be hounds roused to the scent of blood after theyve wiped out your hammer there will be nothing to contain them nothing to keep their flanks from wheeling as they drive in they have battle experience and know exactly what to do theyll split your pikemen and their archers and cut them off from their supporting swordsmen a flying wedge protected by shields will drive into those pikemen crescents to the sides will trap them their armored cavalry will come at a full charge and rake down your wings of archers who will by then have no pikemen to blunt the charge you will all fight bravely but you will be outnumbered perhaps twenty to one because youve already sacrificed part of your force to be the hammer and they will all be dead by then to fight a larger force you must divide them and conquer them one bit at a time instead you will have done the opposite you will have divided yourself in half for them so they can kill half at a time at their leisure the captain stood his ground we can make a good show of ourselves you dont know how good we are were not novices every one of those children under your command will die have you ever seen anyone die captain not die like an old man in bed but in battle you will be run through with spears shot through the eyes with arrows swords will hack off arms split open ribs blades will rip your bellies open and spill your guts across the cold ground faces you know your friends these children will look up at you in panic as they choke on their own blood and vomit others will be screaming for help as your enemy moves through the wounded on the ground and eviscerates them to make them suffer a gruesome death the ones who surrender will be executed while your enemy dances and sings about the great battle they have just won captain ryans head finally rose his lieutenants still stared at the ground you sound like prince harold mother confessor he has given me close to the same speech on a number of occasions prince harold is a smart soldier captain ryan buttoned two of the brass buttons on his dark brown wool coat but that doesnt change my decision of all our choices the hammer and anvil is the best chance we have against them i believe we can make it work we must chandalen leaned toward her and spoke in his tongue mother confessor these men are the walking dead we should be away from them so we do not get caught in their foolishness they are going to die to a man the captain frowned whatd he say kahlan leaned close to the young captain he says you are all going to die tomorrow captain ryan looked chandalen up and down what does he know about battle hes just a savage from the wilds kahlan lifted an eyebrow savage hes a pretty smart man he speaks two languages his and ours captain ryan swallowed and he has fought in battles he has killed men how many men have you killed bradley he glanced to his two lieutenants well none i guess look im sorry i meant no offense but i know about war and what do you know about war child she whispered were all volunteers myself three years ago almost no man here has less than one year weve all trained hard prince harold himself has worked with us taught us tactics weve won mock battles against him several times we may be young but we have experience we were sent on this expedition as a final test before our assignments weve been afield nearly a month practicing war games and battle tactics we know what we are about just because were young that doesnt mean we cant fight we may be young but that also means were strong chandalen laughed strong you travel like women he cleared his throat when kahlan lifted an eyebrow to him well some women you are not so strong as you think you are soft you have wagons to carry your needs that makes you soft you will die tomorrow kahlan turned back to the three soldiers my friend is wrong you are not going to die tomorrow the captain brightened were not you believe in us then she shook her head you are not going to die tomorrow because i will not allow it im sending you back you are to take your division back to your command unit that captain is an order im on my way to aydindril to take care of this i will put a stop to that army of killers captain ryans expression hardened we have no command to return to they were wiped out in ebinissia that was where we were training but we were out on maneuvers we have the trail of the ones who did it and we are going after them those soldiers in ebinissia were many times your number and they were crushed by the force you chase we know those were men we lived with ate with slept with they were our teachers they were our brothers our fathers they were our friends and companions he shifted his weight and cleared his throat in an effort to keep his voice steady we should have been there with them we should have been there to stand with them kahlan turned her back to the three galean soldiers she put her fingers to her temples closing her eyes as she rubbed in little circles she had a headache from the worry of these young men all being slaughtered she grieved for the friends of these men friends and comrades who were killed defending their city the faces of the young women floated before her minds eye kahlan spun around looking into the eyes of the young captain eyes she realized that had seen more than she had at first thought you were the one she whispered you were the one who closed the doors you closed the doors in the palace the doors on the rooms of the queen and her ladies he swallowed and then nodded his blue eyes were wet his lower lip quivered why would they do that to those poor people kahlan answered in a gentle tone the object of a soldier is to make his enemy do foolish things either by making them too frightened or too angry to think they do it to strike fear into your hearts but more than that to make you so angry you will do something foolish so they can kill you too those men we chase are the ones who did that we have no command to return to its upon us now that is the foolish thing they want you to do you will not you will go to another command you are not going to attack that army mother confessor im a soldier sworn to serve galea and the midlands in my life young though you think it is ive never once entertained the idea of disobeying my commanders my queen or the mother confessor captain ryan lifted her wrist with his finger and thumb and placed her hand on his shoulder but in this i must disobey your orders if you wish you may take me with your power but i will not otherwise do as you say lieutenant sloan spoke up for the first time and then you will have to take me because ill take his place and lead our men to the fight lieutenant hobson stepped forward and then youll have to take me after the three of us captain ryan said you will have to move through the officers and then every one of the men if there is one left he will attack and die in battle if need be she drew her hand back im going to the central council and will take care of this what you want to do is a suicide mother confessor we are going to attack for what for glory you want to be heroes avenging the murdered you want to die in a glorious battle no mother confessor he said in a quiet tone we saw what those men did to ebinissia we saw what they did to the soldiers they captured we saw what they did to the women and children back there many of the men under my command had mothers and sisters back there we all saw what was done to them and what was done to our fathers and brothers our people he drew himself up tall and straight as he looked with resolve into her eyes were not doing this for glory mother confessor we know its a suicide mission but were all single we have no families to leave without fathers were doing it because those men will go on to another city and do to them what they did in ebinissia were doing this to stop them if we can our lives are sworn to protect our people we cannot shirk our responsibility we must attack and try to stop these men before they kill any more innocent people i pray to the good spirits that you succeed in aydindril but still that will take too long how many more cities will be plundered before you can bring the midlands to bear on these men one city is too many were the only ones in contact with these killers our lives are all that stand between them and their next victims when i took the oath to serve i swore that no matter the choices no matter the orders i would always put the protection of my people first thats why i must disobey your orders mother confessor not for glory but to protect the defenseless i wish to have your blessing in this but i will try to stop those men with your blessing or without it she sank to sit on the log again and stared off into the distance pondering the three soldiers the six men waited in silence children indeed they were older than she had thought and they were right it would still take her some time to get to aydindril and more time yet to raise armies to hunt down these killers in the meantime they would go on killing how many would have to die waiting for help from the central council she wished she could be anyone right now but who she was the mother confessor she disregarded her feelings and considered the problem as the mother confessor must she weighed lives those spent and those spared kahlan stood and turned to chandalen we must help these men chandalen pushed his hands farther up on his spear and leaned toward her mother confessor these men are foolish children and they are going to die if we stay with them they will bring a storm of killing around us we will be killed with them they will die just the same and you will not reach aydindril chandalen these boys are like the mud people they are chasing their jocopo if we dont help them then more will die like we saw back in the city prindin leaned in mother confessor we will do whatever you wish but there is no way to help these boys we are only four tossidin nodded and then you would fail in your duty to reach aydindril is that not important of course it is she pulled some hair back off her face but what if the army who killed everyone in that city were going next to the mud people would you not want me to help if it were your people they would murder next the three men straightened they twisted their spears while they thought glancing over her shoulder occasionally to the three soldiers who also stood silently what would you do to defeat this enemy she asked as she moved her gaze among the three if you had to at last tossidin leaned in again there are too many it cannot be done chandalen angrily backhanded tossidins shoulder we are mud people fighters we are smarter than these men who ride in wagons and murder women do you think them better fighters than us the two brothers shuffled their feet as they averted their eyes well prindin said we know that the way they want to do it will only get them killed there are better ways chandalen smiled of course there are the spirits taught my grandfather how to do such things he taught my father and my father taught me the numbers may be larger but it is the same problem we know better than these men what to do he looked kahlan in the eye you too know better than these men what to do you know you must not fight the way the enemy wants that is what these men are about to do kahlan smiled at him and nodded maybe we can help these men protect other innocent people she turned to captain ryan he had been watching her speak in a foreign tongue with the three strange men all right captain we are going to go after this army he gripped her shoulders thank you mother confessor he jerked his hands back realizing with a fright that he had actually touched her he instead rubbed his hands together it will work youll see well have the jump on them well surprise them and have them all on a pike she leaned toward him he backed away surprise them surprise them she grabbed him by his collar and pulled his face close they have a wizard you idiot the captains face paled a wizard he whispered she released his collar with an angry shove you were at ebinissia didnt you see the hole melted through the wall well i guess i didnt pay attention i only saw the dead his eyes darted about as if seeing them now they were everywhere she cooled at the pained expression on his face i understand they were your friends and family i can understand why you wouldnt have noticed but that is no excuse for a soldier a soldier must notice everything missing details can get you killed captain this is a good example of a little detail that would have done you in he swallowed and then nodded yes mother confessor do you want to kill the men who destroyed ebinissia the three soldiers spoke up that they did then i am taking command of this legion if you want to stop the men who are up there then you will do as i say and as chandalen prindin and tossidin say you may know about battle tactics but we know about killing people this is not a battle captain this is killing people we are only going to help you if you really want to stop those men if you are interested in having a battle then we will leave you right now so you can get yourselves slaughtered captain ryan fell to a knee the two lieutenants followed his example mother confessor it would be my greatest honor to serve under you you have my life and the lives of every one of my men if you know how to stop those men from murdering any more people we will do whatever you ask she nodded down to the three men this is no war game captain for us to win every man must do as he is ordered anyone who doesnt do as we order is aiding the enemy that is treason if you want to stop those men then you all are going to have to turn command over to me and you cant change your mind if the task becomes grim do you understand yes mother confessor i understand she looked to the other two and you i am honored to serve under you mother confessor as am i mother confessor kahlan motioned them up and then drew her fur mantle closed i must get to aydindril it is of the utmost importance but i will help you begin this we will tell you what must be done i can give you only a day or two we will help you begin the killing and then we must be on our way mother confessor what of the wizard kahlan looked at him from under her eyebrows you leave the wizard to me do you understand he is mine i will handle it all right what do you want us to do first kahlan walked between the captain and one of the lieutenants the first thing you have to do is get me a horse chandalen leapt forward and gripped her arm slowing her as he put his head close to hers his tone was angry with suspicion why do you want a horse where are you going she came to a halt pulling her arm free she took in all six men do you have any idea what it is im about to do im about to choose sides i am the mother confessor if i choose sides i choose sides for all the midlands i commit all the midlands to war she met chandalens eyes i cannot do that on the word of these men chandalen erupted in fury what more proof do you need you saw what they did back at that city what i saw does not matter i must know why i cannot simply declare war i must know who these men are for whom they fight she had another reason to go a more important reason but she didnt speak it they are killers youve killed people would you not want others to know the reason before they sought vengeance you foolish woman prindin put a cautionary hand on chandalens arm attempting to bring a little prudence to chandalens words chandalen angrily wrenched his arm away you say these men are foolish and they have thousands you are one you have no chance to escape if they decide to kill you im the mother confessor none may lay a weapon to me she knew it was an absurd pretext but she had to do this and could think of no other justification to allay his fears chandalen was too angry to speak he finally turned away with a growl she knew that in the past he would have been angry because if she were killed he couldnt return home she thought that perhaps now he was genuinely afraid for her she didnt like the idea either but had no choice she was the mother confessor she had a duty to the midlands lieutenant hobson please get me a horse a white or gray if you have one he nodded and ran off to do as asked captain i want you to get all your men together and tell them whats happening chandalen stood with his back to her she stroked a hand down the white fur over his shoulder over his fathers bone knife you are fighting for the midlands now not just the mud people he let out an angry grunt while im gone i want you three to start explaining to these men what must be done i hope to be back before dawn when she saw hobson returning with the horse her knees tried to buckle dear spirits what had she gotten herself into she turned to face captain ryan if im if anything she took a breath and started again if i get lost and cant find my way back youre to take your orders from chandalen do you understand youre to do as he says yes mother confessor he said in a quiet tone as he put his fist to his heart in salute may the good spirits be with you from my experience ill take a fast horse instead then you have your wish lieutenant hobson said nick is fast and hes fierce he wont let you down the captain cupped his hands giving her a boost up onto the big warhorse she looked down at the men as she gave the gray an introductory pat on his neck nick snorted and tossed his head before she lost her nerve she pulled the big stallion around and urged him toward the slopes toward a trail that would circle her around to come into the enemy camp from the other side chapter the snowcrusted trees loomed all about her in the eerie light the moon would be down soon but for the time being it gave the snow a luminescence that made the way easy to see as she trotted her horse into the open valley she was almost glad to be free of the pressing trees that could hide anyone intent on ambush she made no attempt to conceal her approach and the sentries saw her but they made no move to stop a lone rider ahead the armys camp was alive with fires men and noise as large as a small city it could be spotted easily and heard from miles away confident in their numbers they feared no attack with the hood of her fur mantle pulled up and drawn close around her face kahlan walked nick among the confusion of men wagons horses mules tents gear and roaring fires she sat tall on her horse and above the din she could almost hear her heart thumping the strong aroma of roasting meat and woodsmoke filled the still air the snow had been trampled and packed flat by tens of thousands of feet both man and beast and by wagons of every sort men were gathered around fires drinking and eating and singing pikes were stacked upright in circles leaning in with their heads all resting together in bristling cones lances were everywhere sticking up from snowbanks looking like forests of stripped saplings tents sprouted all about without any order to their layout men roamed far and near stumbling from one fire to another to try the food to join in song around men with flutes to gamble at dice or to share the drink sharing the drink seemed to be what occupied most of them no one paid any attention to her they seemed too preoccupied to notice her she kept her horse at a trot and passed the ones who did stare up before they had a chance to wonder at or confirm what they had seen the whole place seemed to be in an uproar of activity her warhorse didnt so much as flinch at the pandemonium all about from some of the tents in the distance she heard the screams of women followed by the raucous laughter of men despite her attempt to stop it a shiver ran down her spine kahlan knew that armies like this one were accompanied by prostitutes who rode along in the supply wagons with other camp followers she also knew that armies like this one took women as part of their plunder considering them a simple privilege of victory much as taking a ring from a dead man and worth little more whatever the reasons for the screams feigned delight or true terror she knew she could do nothing about it and so tried not to hear them turning her attention instead to the men she passed at first she saw only dharan troops she knew their leather and mail and armored uniforms all too well each of the breastplates bore an ornate embossed letter r for the house of rahl soon though she was able to pick out keltans among the dharans she saw one group of a dozen men from westland each with an arm around the next fellows shoulders as they danced in a circle and at the same time drank from mugs she saw men of other lands too a few from nicobarese some sandarians and to her horror a handful of galeans maybe she thought they were simply dharans in the uniforms of men they had killed somehow she didnt believe that sporadic quarrels were going on throughout the camp men argued over a lay of the dice food casks or even bottles of drink some of the disputes erupted into fights with fists and knives she saw one man stabbed in the gut to the uproarious laughter of onlookers at last she spotted what she was looking for the tents belonging to the commanders though they hadnt bothered to put up their flags she knew by their size what they were outside the largest a small table had been set up next to a roaring fire with spitted meat over it lanterns on poles surrounded the group of men gathered there as she approached a huge man who sat with his feet up on the table was yelling and i mean right now or ill have your head a full one you bring a full cask or ill have your head on a pike when the soldier scurried off the table of men erupted in laughter kahlan brought her huge warhorse right up to the edge of the table she sat tall and still as she appraised the halfdozen men sitting around the table four were dharan officers the one with his boots resting on the table had been the man who had been yelling one was a keltish commander in an ornate uniform unbuttoned to reveal a filthy shirt soaked with wine and meat drippings and one man wore plain tan robes with a large knife the man with his feet up on the table carved a long strip of meat from a bone he tossed the bone over his shoulder to a snarling pack of dogs behind him he tore the strip of meat in half with his teeth and pointed with the knife to his right to the young man in plain robes as he added a swig from a mug to the meat already in his mouth he spoke around it all wizard slagle here told me he thought he smelled a confessor he peered up with bloodshot eyes and where is your wizard confessor huh everyone at the table laughed with him ale ran down his thick blond beard bring anything to drink confessor were nearly out no well not to mind with the knife he pointed over to the keltish commander karsh here tells me theres a nice city a week or so down the mountains and theyre bound to have some ale for us thirsty boys after they welcome us to their town and swear allegiance kahlans eyes slid to the wizard it was for him she had come she coolly calculated whether or not she could make the jump from the horse to the wizard and touch him with her power before she was caught by that big knife the man wielding the knife didnt look to be able to react too quickly still she judged it to be poor odds she was willing to give her life to the task but only if she could be reasonably sure of success but it was for him she had come the wizard was this armys eyes he saw things before they could and things they couldnt see like her and dharans feared things magic and spirits a wizard was their defense against magic and those spirits her gaze moved from the wizards deepset eyes and drunken leering smirk to what he was doing with his hands he was whittling before him on the table was a pile of shavings she remembered the piles of wood shavings in the palace at ebinissia outside the girls rooms the wizard waggled the stick he had whittled for the first time she noticed what it was it was a largerthanlife phallus his smirk grew the man with the knife pointed it to the wizard slagles got something for you confessor been working on it for two hours since he realized you were coming for a visit he made a feeble attempt to hold back his laughter but it came in fits through his restraint and he finally gave in to it two hours they had just told her the limits of this wizards power she had left the galeans four hours ago but nearly an hour of that had been spent at her task up on the ridges that meant the galean boys werent yet close enough for the wizard to know of them but were only concealed from discovery by a dangerously thin margin any closer and the wizard would know of them long before they could bring any surprise to bear she waited for the dharan mans laughter to sputter out before she spoke you have me at a disadvantage not yet but i will the men roared and hooted again with every beat of her heart she became more calm she pushed her hood back she wore her confessors face what is your name soldier soldier he lurched forward and stuck the knife in the table im no soldier im general riggs im supreme commander of all our troops all our men old and new answer to me and in whose name are you fighting general riggs he swept his hand around why the imperial order is fighting a war on behalf of those who join us a war against all the oppressors against all who fight us those who dont join us are against us and will be crushed we fight to bring order under the imperial order all who join us will find protection and in turn they will help protect all all the lands will join with us or they will be swept aside it is a new order for which we struggle the imperial order they command all the lands and i command them kahlan frowned trying to make sense of what she was hearing i am the mother confessor and i command the midlands not you mother confessor he clapped the wizard on the back you didnt tell me she was the mother confessor well you dont look like any mother ive seen but after tonight youll be a mother sure enough you have my word on that he roared with laughter darken rahl is dead that brought the laughter to an end the new lord rahl has declared the war ended and called all the dharan troops home general riggs rose to his feet darken rahl was a man of limited foresight a man too much concerned with his ancient magic and too little concerned with order he was too preoccupied with his own quests his old religions magic until it is eradicated is a tool of men not a master of them darken rahl failed to use the opportunity he had we will not fail darken rahl himself in the underworld knows this and repents he is allied to our struggle now the good spirits have declared it we no longer bow to the house of rahl but they as all houses districts and kingdoms to us the new lord rahl will join us too or well crush him and any heathen dogs who follow him we will crush all the heathen dogs in other words general you fight for no one other than yourself your purpose is simply to murder people i do not fight for myself this is a larger purpose than one man we offer all the opportunity to join with us if they dont join with us its because theyre aligned with our enemies and we must kill them he threw his hands up its useless trying to explain such matters of state and canon to a woman women have no intellect for rule men have no exclusive talent to rule general its profanity for men to bow down to a woman for protection right men concern themselves only with getting under a womans skirts not with hiding behind them women rule from their nipples offering only their sympathetic pap men rule from their fist they make and enforce the law they provide and protect every king and patrician will be offered the chance to join with us to bring his land and his people under our protection all queens will be offered the chance to ply their wares in a brothel or perhaps to be the humble wives of an indentured farmer but either way make a proper use of themselves he swept his mug up from the table and took a few gulps cant you see woman are you that stupid even for a woman what has your midlands alliance accomplished under the rule of women accomplished the alliance is to accomplish nothing but to let all the lands live in peace to leave their neighbors lands to their neighbors and know that their own is safe from covetous hands and that all will stand to protect each even the weak and defenseless so none will stand alone and naked he smiled in triumph as he looked to his comrades truly spoken from the teat he gestured with disgust you provide no leadership no law each land proscribes and pronounces as they see fit what in one place is a crime in another is virtue your alliance shies from bringing order to all youre nothing but fragmented tribes each jealously guarding whats his with no thought to the union other than fits their own greed and in so doing lets all be vincible you are wrong that is exactly what the central council in aydindril is for to bring all lands together for the common defense the common defense against murderers like you it is not a feeble union as you seem to think but one with teeth a noble ideal one in fact which i share but one you only give pap to you bring them together only timidly not under common canon he held his hand out to her closing it into a fist as he sneered at her in so doing you leave all lands ripe for the squeezing you are lost souls in search of true leadership and in desperate need of protection as soon as the boundaries fell you were ravaged by darken rahl and he was only halfhearted about it seeking only his magic had he let the generals run as they would there wouldnt be even a shell of this play alliance of yours left and who is it we all need protection from he stared off whispering almost to himself from the horde who will come what horde he looked up as if he had just awakened the horde spoken of in the prophecies he frowned at her as if she were hopelessly thick and then held his hand out to the wizard the good wizard here has counseled us on the prophecies you are one who spent your life with wizards and you never sought their knowledge your eloquent claim to want to join people in peace and law are highminded words general riggs but your atrocities in ebinissia put the lie to them for all time ebinissia will bear mute but irrefutable testimony to your true cause you and your imperial order are the horde kahlan glowered to the wizard whats your part in this wizard slagle he shrugged why to assist and facilitate the joining of all people under the rule of common law whose law the law of the victors he smiled that would be us the imperial order you have responsibilities as a wizard those responsibilities are to serve not to rule you will report at once to aydindril to take your place in that service or you will answer to me you he said with a derisive sneer you demand that good and decent men whimper and snivel before you and at the same time you blindly let banelings have a free run of the land banelings she glowered at riggs i suppose you would be foolish enough to seek council from the blood of the fold theyve already joined with us general riggs said offhandedly our cause is theirs and theirs ours they know how to expunge those who would serve the keeper and thus our enemies we will cleanse the land of all who serve the keeper goodness must triumph you mean your cause it is you who would rule are you blind confessor i rule here now but this is not about me its about the future i simply fill the post for now furrow the field so it may produce its not i who is the focus we offer everyone the chance to serve with us and every man with me has taken that offer others have joined our troops in our battle we are no longer dharan troops they are no longer troops of their homeland we are all the imperial order any of right mind can lead us if i fall in our noble struggle another will rise up to take my place until all the lands are joined under united rule and the imperial order can flower either the man was too drunk to know what he was saying or he was mad she glanced about at the dancing drunken singing men at campfires all about mad as the bantak mad as the jocopo general riggs he had been muttering angrily under his breath but stopped and looked up at her i am the mother confessor like it or not i represent the midlands in the name of the midlands i call upon you to to halt this war immediately and either return to dhara or come to the council with your grievances you may petition the central council with any dispute you have and it will be heard but you may not visit war upon my people you will not like the consequence if you choose not to heed my orders he sneered up at her we make no compromises well annihilate all who dont join us we fight to stop the killing to stop the murdering as the good spirits have called upon us to do we fight for peace until we win peace we will have war she frowned who told you this who told you that you must fight he blinked at her its selfevident you stupid bitch you cannot possibly be so stupid as to think the good spirits tell you to wage war the good spirits do not act in such overt ways ah well then we have a disagreement that is the purpose of war is it not to settle such matters the good spirits know us to be in the right else they would easily join against us our victory will prove they side with us or we could not win in our struggle the creator himself wishes to see us triumph and our victory will be proof of that the man was a lunatic she redirected her attention to the keltish commander karsh general karsh you demean the rank general why did you slaughter the people of ebinissia ebinissia was given the opportunity to join us as will all be given the opportunity ebinissia chose to fight we had to make an example of her heathen people to show others what awaits them if they fail to join us in peace it cost us nearly half our men but it was a goal worth the cost even now those lost are being replaced by others joining with us and we will swell in rank to take in all the known lands this you call leadership extortion and murder general karsh slammed his mug down on the table his eyes were fire we visit upon them what they visit upon our people they raid our farms our border towns they kill keltans as if we were bugs to be stepped on yet we offered them peace it is they who chose to shun our mercy they were offered a chance at peace a chance to join us they chose war in that way they chose to aid us theyve made an example for others of the folly of fighting us and what have you done with queen cyrilla did you slaughter her too or is she back there in your whores tents they all laughed she would be riggs put in if wed found her kahlan almost sighed aloud with relief she looked back to karsh who was taking another swig what has prince fyren to say of this fyrens in aydindril im here so perhaps the crown wasnt a part of this perhaps this was little more than a band of murdering outlaws who fancied themselves as more kahlan knew prince fyren knew him to be a reasonable man of the keltish diplomats assigned to aydindril he was the one who had done the most to bring kelton forward into the alliance of the midlands through the central council he cajoled and persuaded his mother the queen to go the route of peace rather than conflict prince fyren was a gentleman in every sense of the word besides being a murderer general karsh you are also a traitor to your own land and crown to your own queen he hammered his pewter mug down on the table im a patriot a protector of my people she leaned the slightest bit forward youre a treasonous bastard and an outlaw cutthroat without conscience i leave to prince fyren the honor of condemning you to death it will of course be a posthumous sentence karsh pounded his fist the good spirits know of your treachery against the people of the midlands this proves their words true theyve told us we cannot be free as long as you live theyve called upon us to kill all those like you all those who blaspheme the good spirits will not abandon us in our struggle we shall defeat all who do the keepers bidding no real officer she said contemptuously would listen to the babbling of the blood the wizard had made an angrylooking ball of liquid fire and was slowly juggling it back and forth between his hands while he watched her the flames spit and hissed dropping little sparks general riggs belched and then put his knuckles on the table as he leaned toward her enough talking get down here you little wench so we can start the party us brave freedom fighters need a little fun general karsh at last smiled and then tomorrow or perhaps the next day you will be beheaded our men our people will rejoice at your death they will exult in our triumph over the mother confessor the symbol of oppression by magic his smile left as he turned redfaced once more the people must see your punishment to know that good can prevail to have hope when we have your head our people can rejoice rejoice that all you brave freedom fighters are strong enough to kill a single woman no general riggs said he appeared for the first time sober as he looked up at her you miss the true meaning of what we do you fail to see its significance his voice lowered his tone softened its a new age we enter confessor an age that has no place for your old religions the line of confessors and their wizards is at an end there was a time three thousand years ago when nearly everyone was born with the gift magic held sway over all things that magic was used to vie for power wizards abused their power in their greed they killed one another they killed others who had the gift and so fewer lived to pass it on over time those with the gift were culled from the race of men yet those left still contested for rule and further thinned the ranks of those born with the gift the magic the other creatures of magic who were their charges such as you have been steadily stripped of their protection and fount of magic today there are almost none born with the gift magic itself is dying with them they have had their chance to rule just as did darken rahl with his magic and they have failed their time the time of wizards is past their protection of the twilight beings is at an end and so the age of magic is at an end the time of man is upon us now and there is no place in that world for the ancient dying religion you call magic it is time for man to take his place as inheritor of the world the imperial order is upon the world now and if it were not them it would be man by another name it is time for man to rule for magic to die kahlan felt a sudden hollowness an unexpected tear ran down her cheek a choking feeling of true panic clawed at her throat do you hear that slagle she whispered hoarsely you have magic the ones you aid would put an end to you too he tossed the little ball of fire to his other hand the light of its flames dancing across his grim face it is as it must be magic chaste or foul is the keepers conduit to this world when i have helped extinguish magic in all its forms then i too must die in that way i will serve the people riggs gazed up to her almost sorrowfully as he went on our people must see the last living embodiment of that religion die you are its symbol the last creature of magic created by wizards with your death they will be filled with hope for the future and be emboldened to extinguish all the remaining pockets of filth and perversion that are magic we are the plowshare those lands now infested with magic will be freed of its taint and can be resettled by pious people then at last we shall all be free of your dogmas which have no part in the glory of the future of man he straightened taking a drink from his mug the harshness returned to his voice after we finish with you then well bring galea to heel and the rest of the lands he slammed the mug down until complete and total victory is ours we demand war rage swelled in her banishing the momentary sensation of loss and panic swelled on behalf of all those beings the twilight beings who depended upon her for voice and protection she nodded slowly as she held the generals gaze in my capacity as mother confessor the highest rank of authority in the midlands to whose mandate all must bow i grant your wish she leaned forward and spoke in a hiss let there be war on my word and office not one of you shall be granted quarter kahlans fist came up to the wizard it was for him she had come her chest heaved with wrath and with terror at the madness of these men she let the magic surge within her demanding release demanding this wizards death it was for him she had come she must not fail the blood rage screamed through her she called the lightning forth nothing happened she froze for an instant in the panic of the failure of the magic then riggs lunged for her leg kahlan hauled back on the reins the ferocious warhorse sprang into battle he bellowed as he reared kicking his front legs kahlan grasped his mane for dear life a lashing hoof caught riggs across the face throwing him back the thrashing hooves crashed down on the table shattering it to splinters men in chairs toppled backward nicks front hooves crushed the head of one of the dharan officers the leg of another the horse spun and kicked at the men kahlan gave him her heels and he leapt into a gallop as the wizard was rising to his feet surprised men threw themselves out of the way she took a quick glance over her shoulder to see the wizard throwing his hands out a ball of wizards fire exploded to life before him turning in the air awaiting command he threw his arms out again sending the fire on its way toward her the warhorse leapt over fires and men kicking up both snow and flaming firewood his legs caught tent lines yanking them down kahlan spotted what she wanted what she wanted more than life itself and maneuvered the horse for it she could hear the wail of the wizards fire coming for her she could hear the screams of men unexpectedly caught up in it she stole another glance to see the blue and yellow ball of flame tumbling through the tents and men growing all the time taking a course as drunken as the wizard wizards fire had to be guided and in his state the wizard was having difficulty controlling what he had wrought were he sober she would be dead by now dear spirits she prayed if im to die let me have time enough first to do what i must kahlan reached her goal as she galloped past she yanked a lance from a snowbank and wheeled her horse she dug her heels in and nick leapt ahead at a full gallop the ball of fire wailed toward her setting tents and men afire it grew and tumbled as the distance closed the lance was unexpectedly heavy made for men who had more muscle than she and she had to carry it upright to save her strength the warhorse didnt flinch as he galloped not at the noise the confusion the running men or the wizards fire she pulled to one side and then the other nicks hooves digging into the packed snow she dodged obstacles weaving her way toward the wizards fire at full speed toward the wizard slagle tried to change the course of the fire to block her advance each time she wove in her headlong rush his reactions were slow but as the distance closed she knew he wouldnt need to be fast to catch her up in it at the last instant she wheeled her horse around to the right the fire roared by so close she could smell burnt hair and then she was racing again as she charged the horse ahead the wizards fire exploded behind cascading across the ground like a burst dam the horrifying death screams of man and beast caught in the conflagration filled the night air dozens of men all afire rolled through the snow trying to put out the flames but wizards fire was not so easy to extinguish it was alive with purpose the howls of pain panicked those around who didnt know what was happening men screamed in fear of spirits they thought were setting upon them swords were drawn and wielded hacking at those running for their lives from the fire battle erupted out of nothing the air carried not only the choking stench of burning flesh but now blood she ignored the screams and sought the silence within the wizard stumbled backward and fell he came to his feet whirling his arms fire formed in the air at the arc of his fingertips though there was confusion all about only one thing filled her vision the wizard she couched the lance tucking the base under her right armpit jamming her grip tight against the leather stop gritting her teeth she used all her strength to lift the heavy lance over nicks bobbing head to the left side so as not to unbalance herself in the saddle nick took her direction as if he could read her mind she steered him at full speed but it seemed to her that the last ten yards took hours a race between her charge and the wizard calling forth fire wizard slagle looked up to direct the fire just as her lance caught him in the chest the impact shattered the lance to splinters at midlength and nearly tore the wizard in half she and her horse flew through a spray of blood kahlan swung the half lance at a man lunging for her catching him across the head the impact tore the lance from her grip she wheeled the horse and leaned forward over his withers as she galloped at full speed back through the confusion around the command tents her heart pounded as fast as the horses hooves one of the dharan officers from the table was up and screaming for a horse men leapt onto horses bareback as she began putting distance between them she could hear him yell that if they failed to catch her they would be drawn and quartered to a man a quick glance showed a good three dozen riders joining the chase away from the command tents back the way she had come men didnt know what was happening and saw a galloping rider as simply part of the drunken festivities none moved to stop her men tents fires polearms and lances stuck upright in the snow stacks of pikes horses and wagons all flashed by in a blur nick jumped anything he couldnt dodge the threat of him not jumping or dodging had men diving for cover men at games tumbled out of the way coin and dice flying into the air tents pulled up when nicks legs caught their lines flew up and billowed in a tangle behind snaring her pursuers horses and riders crashed to the ground others ran over their own men in their frenzied attempt to keep her in sight kahlan spotted a sword hanging in a scabbard that was fastened to the side of a wagon and as she ran past she pulled it free galloping past picket lines she swung the sword cutting the lead lines she hacked the rump of one horse as she charged past he kicked and screamed in fright and pain panicking the rest of the horses they bolted headlong in every direction lanterns on poles toppled onto tents setting them afire the horses in pursuit balked at the fires rearing and bucking throwing their riders to the ground a man lunged suddenly into her path avoiding nicks flying hooves and grabbing for her kahlan drove the sword home through his chest as she flew by the hilt tore from her hand she leaned forward and held on as nick raced through the endless camp the men chasing werent as close but they were still coming suddenly she was free of the camp galloping through the open snow kahlan followed her own tracks across the flat by the waning light of the moon the muscular horse plowed through the snow almost as if it werent there she reached the trees at last and before plunging in and ascending the steep slopes she checked over her shoulder a good fifty men were not three minutes behind she would be able to open the lead as she went up along the forest trail but they would still catch her she would see to that chapter easy now she cautioned one hesitant hoof slipped back back back come on boy back from down the slope behind she could hear the sounds of the chase a man probably one of the dharan officers yelling angrily at the top of his lungs not to let her get away and others urging their horses up the steep trail when they reached the flat where she was they would be in a full gallop again kahlan tugged gently on the reins nick lifted his hoof from the ice and backed up into the tight gap between the snowcrusted pines back along his trail she found the long branch with the forked end she had whittled to a pushing pole stuck upright in the snow where she had left it beside the twin trunked spruce she hefted it up and started pushing the heavy snowladen branches her shoulder ached from having the lance shattered as she held it under her arm as she backed nick between the trees off her trail she held the long pushstick out over his head jostling the limbs relieved of their loads they sprang up partly screening the gap between the trees more importantly the snow tumbled to the ground piling over her tracks she pushed at a branch here another there sprinkling their snow over nicks backing trail covering it in making it look natural as if wind had simply freed the branches of their load she said a silent thankyou to richard for teaching her about tracks he had said he would make a woods woman of her she ached for richard she was sure he wouldnt approve of the desperate risk she was undertaking with the aid of what he had taught her but she couldnt allow these men to track her back to the galean boys there was a chance that some would carry word of what they had seen back and then the galeans would be slaughtered if none of these men returned it would be a long while before any more were sent if ever even if they were by then it would be too late she would have long been up and over the passes from which she had come where the wind howled and drifted the snow constantly and her tracks would be lost to them they would not know where she had gone from there the mountains and forests went on in endless tracts and her trail would have been last seen leading steadily away from her true destination those back at camp would have confidence that these soldiers would have her sooner or later and with the prospect of plunder only days away they would turn their attention to it instead the snowmuffled thundering of hooves brought her mind back to what she was doing the men had reached the flat and were charging at full speed again steadily she worked her way back into the trees shaking branches covering her trail backing toward the way she had come on her way to the army of the imperial order the sounds of chase were almost upon her kahlan leaned almost all the way over stroking an arm along her horses neck she whispered toward his ears and they swiveled back to the sound of her voice quiet now nick please dont move or make a sound she stroked his sweaty neck again good boy quiet now it sounded to her as if anyone would be able to plainly hear her heart beating in her chest the pursuers had reached her as they charged along her trail right in front of her they broke through the screen of trees to her left not ten yards away at full speed kahlan held her breath she heard the clop of hooves as they hit the sloping ice hiding in the moon shadows beyond those trees beyond her false trail she had led her tracks between those trees to the edge of a steep rocky stream where its water would tumble were it not frozen over a cliff it was a small stream but as it froze more water had bubbled and frothed over that which was already frozen growing the area into an ice palace snow had been washed away as it fell leaving the rounded downwardsloping humps of ice bare and slick as the men broke through the trees they had not twenty feet to halt their headlong rush before the cliffs edge before the rock and ice halted and only thin air lay beyond and they had to do it on cascading mounds of ice were it flat ice like a lake the horses could have dug their iron shoes in and tried to skid to a halt but this was not flat it was water slicked tumbledown ice and as they slipped and slid and tripped and fell at a charge they had no chance kahlan could hear the pop of horses legs breaking as thousands of pounds of muscle moving at full speed could not be stopped by hooves catching in crevices the bareback riders were helpless passengers the men shouted encouragement to their mounts and the ones behind didnt recognize quickly enough the change in shrieking from anger to fright those behind crashed into those ahead tumbling over and past each other bareback with only halters and no aggressive battle bits the riders didnt have the control they were accustomed to and were carried helplessly forward some leapt from their mounts as they came through the trees and could see what lay ahead but their momentum was too great the distance too short their fate beyond retrieval the horses behind their leg bones snapping crashed down atop the ones already fallen who were desperately grasping for a hold there was none it became a waterfall of living flesh cascading over the edge kahlan sat still wearing her confessors face as she listened to the screams of men and horses mingled together into one long wail as they disappeared over the mountainside in the span of mere seconds it was finished more than fifty men and their mounts had plunged to their deaths when the night had been silent for a time she dismounted and circled around to keep her false trail free of any offleading tracks to the edge of the ice flow in the dim light she could see the dark stains of blood over the ice mounds blood from broken legs blood from cracked skulls there were none of the enemy left on the cliff as she turned to leave she heard low grunts of desperation kahlan pulled her knife and carefully inched her way to the source of the sounds toward the edge grasping a stout limb she leaned out over the slanting ice flow forest debris was frozen in the ice sticks and leaves had made a small dam at the edge to be covered over as the ice grew it left a few branches sticking out of the wall of ice around one of these branches were clutched fingers a man clung by his fingertips to the branch his legs dangling over a drop of close to a thousand feet he was grunting with effort as he tried to catch his feet up on the ice but it was too slippery to give him any toehold kahlan stood at the edge holding the branch for support as she watched him shivering dribbles of water bubbled over the ice over his face matting his hair and soaking his keltish uniform his teeth chattered he looked up to see her standing over him in the moonlight help me please help me he couldnt have been past her age she regarded him without emotion he had big eyes the kind of eyes young women would surely have swooned over but the young women in ebinissia would not have swooned when they saw those eyes in the name of the good spirits help me kahlan squatted down closer to him what is your name huon my names huon now please help me kahlan lay down on the ice hooking a foot around a tangled root taking a good grip on the stout spruce limb with one hand she extended her other hand partway out but not far enough for huon to reach i will help you huon on a condition i have sworn no mercy and none shall be granted if you take my hand i will release my power into you you will be mine now and forever if you are to live it will be as one touched by a confessor if you would think to pull me over the edge with you before i can release my magic let me assure you i would not make the offer were there that chance i have touched more men than i can count you will have no time you will be mine he blinked icy water dripping down on him from his eyes shook it from his face and stared up at her kahlan extended her hand toward him from now on huon either way your old life is ended if you live it will not be as who you are now that man will be gone forever you will be mine please he whispered just help me up i wont hurt you i swear to let you be on your way it would take me hours to make it back to camp on foot and youll be long gone by then anyway please just help me up how many people in ebinissia did you hear beg for their lives to how many did you grant mercy her words came as cold as the ice she lay on i am the mother confessor i have proclaimed war without quarter on the imperial order the oath stands as long as one of you lives choose huon death or to be touched by my power either way who you are dies the people of ebinissia got what they deserved id rather take the hand of the keeper himself than be touched by your filthy magic the good spirits would never accept me to them if i were touched by your dark and profane magic his lip curled in a sneer to the keeper with you confessor huon threw his arms open and silently dropped away into the darkness as she rode back to the galean recruits she thought about the things riggs karsh and slagle had told her she also thought about the creatures of magic living in the midlands she thought about the beautiful land of the night wisp with open fields deep in ancient remote forests where the wisps gathered at twilight to dance together in the air above the grasses and wildflowers like joyous fireflies she had spent many a night lying on her back in the grass as they hovered above her and spoke with her of things common to all life of dreams and hopes of loves she thought about the creatures living in long lake translucent things hard to see seeming almost made of liquid glass or of the water that was their home with whom she had never spoken but whom she had watched emerge at night to bask in the moonlight on rock and shore creatures who had no voice but with whom she had shared understanding and had promised to protect she thought about the whispering tree people whom she had spoken with in a hauntingly beautiful experience frighteningly eerie but somehow gently peaceful at the same time the whispering tree people were all joined as one through their roots touching under the earth and each spoke as if they were all but one as if there were no individuals yet each had a name to whisper to you if you made it promises of simple favors a mass community that was at the same time all only one to cut down a tree there would be to bring the pain of that ones death to all they could not escape the contact they felt with each other if people went into that land and cut down the trees it would be torture to all kahlan had seen them in pain before their wails could make the stars cry there were other creatures too that were magic and people too who possessed it sometimes it was hard to place a line between creatures of the wild and people some people of the midlands were part creature or perhaps some creatures were part people they were strange and delightful and very shy and so it went throughout various forms of magic from the simplest things in the howling caves that could let you peek through solid rock to see their nests to people like the mud people who had only simple magic that would do but one thing as mother confessor all these and many more were her charges and as mother confessor she commanded all to protect these magic places so no one people would bear the brunt of burden against others it was an arrangement backed by confessors and wizards extending back for thousands of years the twilight beings riggs had called them that was the name given to these magical creatures by the blood of the fold among others because many of them came out only at night for this reason the blood associated them with darkness and so out of fear with the darkness of the keeper of the dead the blood considered magic the force through which the keeper extended his influence into this world into the world of the living the blood were as unreasonable and thickheaded as any men alive and they considered it their duty to send to the land of the dead any who they thought served the keeper that was just about anyone who disagreed with their view of things in some lands the blood were outlawed and in some like nicobarese they were encouraged and paid by the crown maybe riggs was right maybe she should have brought the rule of law to stop men like this but that had never been the intent of the council to make all to bow in all things to one the strength and beauty of the midlands was in its diversity even if some of that diversity was ugly what was ugly to one was beautiful to another and so it was that each land was to be left to rule itself as long as it brought no force of arms to another it was a tolerant suffering of things repugnant to allow things beautiful to blossom it was a sometimes difficult and fine line to hold the council to forcing lands to work together in some things but allowing them to be autonomous in others but perhaps riggs was right people in some lands suffered the cruel or poor rule of their greedy or inept leaders with no hope of matters being brought to change from without though the wise but smaller lands had not to live in fear of outside conquest if the suffering of the people under less fortunate rule could be ended with wise central rule would not matters be improved yet when all lived under the same rule every other form of existence was extinguished never to have the chance to grow though one of them might have been a superior way the kind of single rule the imperial order represented was slavery kahlan was surprised to encounter galean sentries farther from their camp than before they were no longer spread too far apart and they were well hidden popping up with drawn bows and bared steel when she was almost upon them chandalen prindin and tossidin had obviously been at work the sentries put fists to hearts when they recognized her the dawn was turning the sky to a dark steel gray it was warmer than it had been with the clouds covering the land like a warming quilt she was dead tired in the saddle as nick plodded through the snow toward the camp but as she came into sight of men rushing about she came alert with the thoughts of what needed to be done chandalen prindin captain ryan and lieutenant hobson were speaking with a group of men when they saw her riding toward the camp the four came at a run to meet her at the edge of the activity men were cooking eating stowing gear preparing weapons and tending to wagons and horses she spotted tossidin in his white wolf mantle off some distance with lieutenant sloan waving his arms in explanation as he talked to men who stood mute with their spears all standing upright in the snow the tight mob of them looking like a dark porcupine against the white ground kahlan let out a weary moan as she dismounted before the four men who had come to greet her other men all around kept to their tasks but moved more slowly as they watched her with great interest the four before her stared openly with wide eyes none said a word what are you all staring at she said a little shorttempered mother confessor captain ryan said youre covered in blood are you hurt kahlan stared down at the white wolf fur of her mantle only it was no longer white she realized for the first time that the skin of her face was tight with dried blood her hair stiff with it oh she said in a quieter tone its all right im fine chandalen and prindin sighed with relief lieutenant hobson still wideeyed swallowed what of the wizard did you see him she lifted an eyebrow to him what you see on me is whats left of him chandalen appraised her with a sly smile and how many others did you kill kahlan gave a tired shrug i was awfully busy i didnt take the time to count but all things considered i would guess including the fires well over a hundred the wizard is dead thats what matters two of their commanders are dead also and at least two more are wounded captain ryan and lieutenant hobson paled chandalens proud grin widened i am surprised you left any for others to kill mother confessor she didnt return his smile there are plenty left kahlan rubbed her horses nose nick did most of the work i told you he wouldnt let you down mother confessor hobson said that he did not he was better aid than the good spirits he kept me alive this day kahlan lowered herself to one knee in the snow before the two galean officers she bowed her head i find i must beseech your forgiveness she took a hand of each in hers though you are ignorant of how to accomplish what must be done you have put your duty to the midlands before my orders that was courage of the highest order i want you all to know i was wrong you acted of noble intent she kissed each hand i laud your righteous hearts you have kept in mind your duty above all else i beg you forgive me there was silence as she knelt on one knee at last captain ryan whispered down to her mother confessor please get up everyones watching not until you forgive me i want everyone to know you did the right thing but you didnt realize what we were doing or why you had only our safety in mind kahlan waited and he was silent in embarrassment a moment longer all right i forgive you dont do it again she came to her feet releasing their hands and giving them a small humorless smile see that that is the last time you ever disobey me captain ryan nodded in earnest i will he shook his head i mean no i wont i mean i we will do as you command mother confessor i understand what you mean captain she let out a tired sigh we have a lot of work to do before we attack those men we chandalen shouted we were only to teach them some things and then we are to be on our way to aydindril we cannot become caught up in this battle you have already taken enough chances we must kahlan interrupted him i must talk to you three bring tossidin captain please collect the men including the sentries i want to speak to you all together please wait with your men i will be with you shortly and leave a tent up for me i need a few hours sleep while things are being prepared she walked off a ways out of earshot of the camp with chandalen in tow as prindin went to get tossidin when they were all together she turned to them chandalen was scowling the other two waited without emotion the mud people she began in a soft tone have magic we have no magic chandalen argued yes you do you do not think of it as magic because you were born with it and it is the only way you know you do not know of other peoples of their ways the mud people can speak with their ancestors spirits they can do this because they have magic you think this is simply the way things work but they do not work so in other places with other people your ability to do these things is magic magic is not some strange and powerful force its simply the way some people some creatures are others can speak with their ancestors if they wish chandalen said a few can but most cannot to them its speaking with the dead and that is magic frightening magic you and i know it is not to be feared but you will never convince others that what you do is good they will always think it evil people believe as they were raised and they were raised to believe that talking to the dead is evil but our ancestors spirits help us prindin said they never bring harm they only bring help kahlan laid a hand on his shoulder as she looked to his worried eyes i know thats why i help to keep others away from you so you may live as you wish there are a few other people who talk with their ancestors as you do and they too have this magic there are other peoples and other creatures that have magic different from you but just as important to them as yours is to you she looked to each do you understand yes mother confessor tossidin said prindin nodded his agreement chandalen grunted and folded his arms the important thing though is not if you believe what you have can be called magic the important thing is for you to understand that others believe what you do is magic many fear magic they think you are evil because you practice this magic kahlan pointed in the direction of the army of the imperial order those men the ones we chase the ones who killed all the people back at the city they are joined in a cause they wish to rule all the people of the midlands they do not want any to live as they wish but to bow to their rule why would they wish to rule the mud people prindin asked we have nothing they would want we stay to our lands chandalen unfolded his arms and spoke softly they fear magic and they wish us to stop speaking with our ancestors kahlan squeezed his shoulder thats right but more than that they think its their duty to the spirits they worship to kill you all they are on a mission to destroy all who have magic because they think magic is evil they believe people like you have magic she met chandalens eyes if they are not killed to a man like the jocopo sooner or later they will come and destroy the mud people just as they destroyed the city of ebinissia the three men studied the ground in thought she waited for them to weigh her words chandalen at last spoke and they would kill the other people those who wish not to have outsiders come to them to live alone like the mud people they would i spoke with the men of that army they are like crazy men they sound as if they have been visited by evil spirits like the bantak did like the jocopo they will not listen to reason they think we are the ones who listen to evil spirits they will do as they promise you saw the city they destroyed and the size of the army defending it it is not an empty threat i must get to aydindril so i can raise an army to fight these men the councilors should already be doing that but i must get there to make sure the extent of the threat is known to make sure all of the midlands join together in this but there are no forces at hand to fight these men now except these boys there are cities that will be destroyed before help can arrive worse the threat these men pose will convince some to join with them some see honor as an inconvenience and will side with the army they think will win this will swell their ranks further before aydindril can send troops to find and defeat these men many will die we must call upon these boys to join the fight now before more innocent people are slaughtered these boys volunteered to become fighters like you to protect their people the people of all the midlands we must help them in this we must not let this army of evil men escape to wander the midlands killing and destroying and winning more to their side we must begin the battle with these boys help them show them to make sure they will know how to fight and to know they will continue without us to lead them we must lead them into the first battle to give them confidence in the ways we teach them before we can be on our way to aydindril chandalen gave her a level look and you will call the lightning to help us no kahlan whispered i tried last night but it didnt come its difficult to explain to you but i believe that because i invoked this special magic on behalf of richard it will not work except to protect him im sorry chandalen unfolded his arms then how did you kill so many kahlan patted his arm where the bone knife was the same way as your grandfather taught your father and he you i did not do as they expected i did not fight their way the two brothers leaned in intently as she spoke they like to drink and when theyre drunk they dont think so well and they are slow tossidin pointed behind with a thumb these men too like to have drink at night they have a wagon of it among their supplies we would not let them have any some were angry they said it was their right kahlan shook her head these boys also thought it would be right to march right up to an enemy who outnumbers them ten to one and have a battle in broad daylight we must help them in this we must teach them what to do they do not like to listen prindin glanced back over his shoulder at the men he had been trying to teach they wish always to argue they say this is the way it is done and we must do it so they are filled only with the way they were taught and do not like to be told another way yet thats what we must do kahlan said we must lead them in the way that will work thats why i need you three i need you to help me in this or many people including eventually the mud people will die i need your help in this i must lead them into battle chandalen stood mute and unmoving the two brothers pushed snow with their feet considering prindin finally looked up we will help my brother and i will do as you ask thank you prindin but its not you who must decide chandalen must be the one who agrees it is for him to decide the two brothers took sidelong glances at him as he stood glaring at her at last he let out an exasperated breath you are a stubborn woman you are so stubborn you will get killed if we three are not there to bring some reason to your head we go with you to kill these evil men kahlan sighed with relief thank you chandalen she bent and took up a handful of snow using it to scrub the dried blood from her face now i must go and tell these boys what they must do she shook the snow from her hands when she had finished with her face did you three get any sleep last night some chandalen said good after i speak with them i need to get a few hours sleep you can begin showing them how to travel without their wagons we must teach them to be strong like you we will begin the killing tonight chandalen gave a grim nod tonight chapter kahlan climbed atop a wagon before the assembled men they stood in brown wool coats packed tightly together before her in the gray morning light captain ryan with his two lieutenants flanking him stood at the front of the men he leaned an arm on the wagon wheel waiting kahlan looked out at all the young faces boys she was about to ask boys to die but what choice did she have dear mother she wondered is this the reason you chose wyborn as my father to teach me what i am about to do im afraid i have only one bit of good news for you she began in a quiet voice that carried through the cold air out over the faces all watching her and so i will give you that first to give you courage for the other things i have to tell you kahlan took a deep breath your queen was not killed in ebinissia nor did the men who attacked the city find or capture her either she was away when the attack came or she escaped queen cyrilla lives the boys seemed to take a deep breath as if hoping she wouldnt add anything more and then they erupted in wild cheering they threw their arms in the air shaking their fists at the sky they yelled and hooted with joy and relief kahlan stood in her bloodsoaked wolf mantle her hands at her sides letting them have their time of celebration and hope some of the boys forgetting for the moment that they were soldiers hugged each other she watched tears of happiness run down many a cheek as men leapt and shouted kahlan stood feeling small and insignificant as the mob of boys poured out their adoration for her half sister she couldnt bring herself to halt their rejoicing at last captain ryan climbed up onto the wagon next to her he held his arms up calling for silence all right all right hold it down stop acting like a bunch of children in front of the mother confessor show her what men you be the cheering finally died out to be replaced by grins and bright eyes captain ryan clasped his hands together and cast her a somewhat sheepish look before taking a couple of steps away atop the wagon to give her room the people of ebinissia she went on in the same quiet tone were not so fortunate the winter silence became brittle light breezes rustled icy branches on the trees ascending the slopes to either side of the flat valley pass holding their camp the grins withered every one of you at the least had friends who were murdered there many of you had loved ones family who died at the hands of the men a few hours up this pass kahlan cleared her throat and swallowed as her eyes found the ground i too knew people who died there her eyes came up last night i went to their camp to discover who they were and if they could be called upon to return to their homelands they have no intention of doing anything but conquering all the lands and putting them under their rule they have vowed to kill everyone who refuses to join them ebinissia refused the boys shouted and shook their fists they themselves they said would bring an end to the threat she spoke over their words bringing them to silence as she did so the men who slaughtered your countrymen and countrywomen are called the imperial order they fight on behalf of no country or land they fight to conquer all lands and to rule all lands they answer to no government to no king to no lord to no council they believe themselves to be the fountain of law they are made up of mostly dharan men but others have joined them i saw among them keltans waves of angry whispers swept back through the crowd kahlan let it go on for a moment i saw also among them men from other lands and i saw galeans this time shocked and angry voices called out that it wasnt true and said she was wrong i saw them with my own eyes they fell once more to silence she quieted her tone i wish that it were not true but i saw them men of many lands have joined with them more men will join with them if they believe they can be part of the victory part of the new law if they believe they can be in on the plunder and awarded positions of authority and power the city of cellion lies hardly more than a hand of days ahead the imperial order will have their surrender and allegiance or their death other cities towns villages and farms will suffer these men if they are not stopped eventually all will come under their sword i am going to aydindril to marshal the forces of the midlands against the imperial order but that will take time in that time their numbers will swell with those who would think to be on the side of might right now there is no one able to stop these men from killing everyone in their path who resists them except you kahlan stiffened her back as she let what she had said sink in and in preparation for what she was going to tell them next she let the silence settle once more over the valley as the mother confessor of the midlands and absent the luxury of conferring with the central council i have had to do that which no mother confessor for a thousand years or more has had to do on my authority alone i have committed the midlands to war the army of the imperial order is to be killed to a man no negotiation or compromise will be offered by the midlands under no circumstances will the orders surrender be accepted i have given an oath on behalf of the midlands that no quarter shall be granted astonished faces stared at her whether i live or die this decree is irrevocable any land or people who willingly join with the imperial order cast their lot under the shadow of this edict it is not in the name of galea that i call upon you to fight in the office of the mother confessor i call upon you to fight for the midlands for it is not galea that is under threat but all lands and all free people there was confident grumbling that they were up to the task some in the ranks called out their assurance that they were the men to do it that they were in the right and would triumph kahlan nodded to them all you think so i want each of you to look to the faces around you they mostly stared at her do as i say look to all the faces around you look to your comrades a little confused they began looking around twisting to see those to the sides and those behind smiling and laughing among themselves as if it were a game when they seemed to have finished with the task she went on a few of you will remember the faces you have looked upon today remember and grieve the rest if you take up this battle will not be around to remember they will die in the struggle in the cold silence kahlan heard the distant chatter of a squirrel and then the sound of that too died away the smiles were all gone as she finally spoke again these men the imperial order are led by and are mostly dharan troops dharan soldiers are trained from the time they are half your age they fight internal conflicts in their land put down riots and rebellions they do not simply practice battle tactics they live them day in and day out they know only a life of fighting they have been exposed to it in every form i have taken the confessions of many dharans most do not know the meaning of peace since spring when darken rahl sent them against the midlands they have been at what they do best war they have fought in battle after battle all who have come before them have fallen they relish fighting they delight in it they are as close to fearless as men come they hold contests often lethal to win the right to be in the van of battle to win the right to be the first to strike a blow at the enemy to win the right to be the first to fall she surveyed the young faces you have confidence in your training your battle tactics the faces nodded looking to one another smiling their knowing confidence kahlan pointed to one a sergeant by the look of his coats braids tell me then you are now in the field of battle having chased down these men and here comes the enemy back at you you are in charge of the pikes and archers here they come thousands of them yelling running coming to rend your force in two to break your armys back you see they have heavy spears called by them argons with long thin barbs if they pierce you they are nearly impossible to remove they cause ghastly wounds that are almost always fatal here they come with their argons thousands of men what is your tactic the young man held his chin out knowingly form a tight rank of the pikes formed into a box or wedge to protect the archers the pikemen face the pikes out and overlapping the shields present the enemy with a tight impenetrable wall the shields protect the pikemen who protect the archers the archers take them down before they can get close enough to use their argons the few who do fall on the pikes their drive is repelled and in all likelihood they have lost a good many men in the failed attempt making another less likely kahlan nodded as if impressed well stated he beamed the men around him grinned with pride in their knowledge of their business i have seen some of the most experienced armies of the midlands use those very same tactics when the dharans first came over last spring when the boundary went down well there you have it the man said they lose their charge against the archers and on the point of our pikes she gave him a small smile the dharan van those men i told you about the biggest the fiercest the ones who won the right to be the first at you well theyve developed special tactics of their own for use against your plans first of all they have arrow shields so as they run in theyre protected from the brunt of the archers work and i guess i forgot to tell you one other thing about those argons of theirs these spears have ironsheathed shafts for most of their length and a unique purpose as the enemy is charging in mostly unaffected by your archers they heave their argons at you we have shields the man pointed out their argons expended they will be on the point of our pikes she folded her arms nodding to him the van the men who won the right to be the first wave are big men i doubt the smallest has arms less than twice the average of yours the argons are needle sharp thrown by those powerful arms they penetrate and stick in your shields the long barbs prevent them from being withdrawn the confident smiles were fading as she looked from face to face as she went on you now have argons stuck solidly in your shields you drop your pikes drawing swords to hack the heavy spears away but the shafts are covered in iron and dont yield the spears are heavy and the butts drag the ground dharans can run almost as fast as their spears fly as they reach you now they jump on the shafts of the spears stuck in your shields dragging them to the ground leaving you on your knees and naked to their heavy axes arms still folded she leaned toward them i have seen men split from scalp to navel by those axes men glanced sideways at one another their confidence shaken she nodded mockingly as she unfolded her arms i am not giving you conjecture ive seen a dharan force take down an experienced army nearly ten times their size in just this fashion in the space of an hour the battle turned from a rout of the dharans to a rout of their foes a dharan charge of the argon is almost as devastating as a classic cavalry charge except they have far greater numbers than any cavalry and their own cavalry is anything but typical you dont even want to know about them they lost half their number in the slaughter of ebinissia and they are in camp now singing and drinking would you if you lost every other one of you be of good cheer i know you believe you can win a battle against a force ten times your size and i know also that such a thing can be done but it is those experienced dharan troops who on a battlefield fighting by the tactics of common war could bring about such a feat please believe me i mean no disrespect to your bravery but in the field of war you are not their equal not yet you could not defeat an army half their size were the battle fought the way your enemy would fight that does not mean you cannot win it means only that you must do it in another way i believe you can win and im going to tell you what you must do and lead you in the first strike to start you in this the imperial order is not invincible they can be defeated from this day forward i shall never again call you boys from this day forward you are men you think of yourselves as soldiers of your homeland galea but you are not in this you are not you are soldiers men of the midlands for it is not just galea who will be conquered but all of the midlands if these men are not stopped i call upon you to stop them the tightly packed crowd of soldiers tempered by what they had heard shouted that they would do the job she watched from under her eyebrows as they confidently pledged to fight to the end there were angry whispers from some in the crowd to her right men were jostling each other and arguing some men wanted to speak and others were seeking to prevent it if you should choose to join in this battle you will follow orders without question she said but for this time only you may speak your mind freely without retribution if you have something to say then let all hear it now or else hold it to your grave one man pulled his arm free of another he glowered up at her were men we dont follow women into battle kahlan blinked at him you follow queen cyrilla she is our queen we fight on her behalf she doesnt lead us in battle thats left to men to do kahlan narrowed her eyes what is your name he glanced around at his fellows and then held his chin up im william mosle and weve been trained by prince harold himself and i kahlan said was trained by his father king wyborn king wyborn was my father too i am half sister to queen cyrilla and prince harold there were astonished murmurs throughout the crowd without taking her eyes from mosle she lifted a hand to silence them but that does not count for command you are soldiers your duty is to follow the orders of your commanders and they the queen and she must follow commands of the central council of the midlands the council of the midlands follows the orders of the mother confessor for now i fill that office my family name is like your queens amnell but im of confessor blood first and last i am the mother confessor of the midlands and as such if i say youre to march into a lake then its your duty to march until youre breathing water and seeing fishes does that make it clear enough for you soldier a few other men were shoving at mosle urging him to go on with their grievances it means you can order us it doesnt mean you know what youre doing kahlan let out a sigh and pulled some bloodstiffened hair back hooking it behind an ear i dont have the time today to tell you of all the training ive had or of all the fighting against impossible odds ive been through or the men ive had to kill in that fighting i would tell you only that last night i went alone to the camp of the imperial order to save your life the men of the order dharans fear the things of the night spirits and for protection from that and to assist them they had a wizard in their company had you in your confidence of battle knowledge tried to attack those men that wizard would have known what you were doing and probably used magic to kill you all mosles defiant expression didnt diminish but some of the others broke into worried whispers fighting against steel was one thing fighting against magic quite another captain ryan stepped forward the mother confessor killed the wizard he said with pride there were relieved sighs among the men if it hadnt been for her experience we would have marched to our deaths without even having the chance to lay steel to steel i for one intend to follow those ive sworn my life to serve my land my queen the midlands and the mother confessor were going to stop this threat against the midlands and were going to do it by following those we are sworn to follow we go into battle under the command of the mother confessor im a soldier in the galean army mosle seemed only to get more defiant not a soldier in any midlands army i fight for galea not to protect lands like kelton kahlan watched as other men shouted their agreement this army the imperial order or whatever they call themselves is marching toward the border cellion is a border city and most of its on the other side of the river in kelton most of its citizens are keltish why should we die for the keltans men in the crowd were starting to argue with one another captain ryans face was red mosle youre a disgrace to kahlan held a hand out to silence him no soldier mosle is only speaking as he believes as i asked him to you men must understand me im not ordering you to do this im asking you to fight for the lives of innocent people of the midlands tens of thousands of your fellow soldiers have already died in this battle i would not ask you to lay down your lives for something you do not believe in most who go into this war will die its your decision to stay or not you are not commanded to stay but if you choose to stay it will be under my command i want no man with us who does not believe in what we do decide now if you will be with us or not if not then you are free to go because you will be of no help to your comrades her voice turned as cold as the thin morning air if you decide to go with me into this war then you will follow the orders of your superiors in the midlands there is no one to outrank me you will follow my orders without question or your punishment will be unsparing too much is at stake to have to suffer men who cant follow orders if i say you will do something then you will do it even if you know its to cost you your life because its to save many more lives i give no orders without sound reason but i wont always have time to explain them your duty is to trust in your superiors and do as youre told she held out a finger and swept it slowly over their heads choose then with us or not but choose this day for all time kahlan drew her hands back inside her warm fur mantle and waited in silence while men discussed and argued among themselves tempers flared and angry oaths were given men gathered around mosle and others moved away from him im leaving then mosle called out to the others he thrust his fist in the air ill follow no woman into battle no matter who she is whos leaving with me about sixty or seventy men gathered about cheered their support for him go then kahlan commanded before you become caught up in a battle you do not believe in having made their choice mosle and the men with him cast her glares of contempt he swaggered forward well leave as soon as we can get our things together well not be rushed out on your word the men in the crowd pushed in before it came to blows kahlan held her hand up stop let them be theyve made their choice let them get their things and be gone mosle turned and pushed his way back through the throng his new men in tow as they left the gathered soldiers kahlan carefully counted their numbers sixtyseven sixtyseven who would leave she looked out at all the faces any more do any more wish to leave no one moved a muscle then do all of you wish to join in this fight a united cheer went up so be it i wish i did not have to call upon you men to do this but there is no one else to ask my heart weeps for those of you who will die know that none of those who live will ever forget the sacrifice you make for them and the people of the midlands from the corner of her eye she watched the sixtyseven men moving among the wagons taking the supplies they thought they would need and now to what must be done slowly she shook her head you men must understand what it is i call upon you to do it is no glorious battle as you think where you move like pieces on a game board no tactics to outwit an opponent in a grand engagement we will not face them in the field of battle but kill them in every other way but mother confessor someone near the front timidly called out its the code of honor for soldiers to face one another in battle to best him in a fair fight there is nothing fair about having to fight in war the only fair thing would be to live in peace the purpose of war is singular to kill you must all understand this for its central to your survival there is no honor in killing no matter the method dead is dead killing your enemy in war is done to protect the lives of those for whom you fight their lives are no better protected by killing your enemy sword to sword than by slaying him while he sleeps but only put at risk by it there is no glory in this task its an onerous deed we do not intend to give them a chance to engage in pitched battle to see who is the better at the game our chore is simply to kill them if you have difficulty seeing the right of this then i call upon you to consider the honor of the soldiers you are up against consider them as they stood waiting in gangs to rape your mothers and sisters consider what your mothers and sisters in ebinissia thought of honor as they were tortured and raped and slaughtered the chill of her words sent visible shudders through the stonesilent men kahlan had to restrain herself from bringing any more horror to their eyes but before her still floated the vision of the young women in the palace if the enemy is looking the other way so much the better because they will not thrust a knife into you if it is from a distance with an arrow so much the better because they will not have a chance to impale you on an argon if it is while they have food in their mouths so much the better because they will not be able to raise an alarm if it is while they are sleeping so much the better because they will not have a chance to cleave you with their sword last night my horse crushed the head of one of the dharan commanders there was no glory in that no honor only the knowledge that perhaps that deed will prevent some of you from dying by his hand and wits in that my heart sings with joy joy that maybe it has saved some of your precious lives what we do is done to save the lives of men and women yet alive and yet unborn you saw what was done to the people in ebinissia remember the faces of those dead remember the way they died and the horror they suffered before they did remember those soldiers captured and beheaded it is up to us to prevent that from happening to any more people to do that we must kill these men there is no glory in the doing only survival in the back two men gestured obscenely to those around them and walked off to join with mosles men sixtynine but the rest stood in firm resolution to take up the fight the time had come she had dissuaded them from their raw thoughts of glorious battle and told them of the true nature of their task she had brought most to an understanding of the larger temper of the battle ahead she had told them some of what must be done she had brought them to a more focused understanding of their importance in the scheme of this struggle the time had come to charge them irreversibly to the burden to forge them into an instrument of retribution that could annihilate the threat kahlan opened her arms to the men before her her blood soaked mantle hanging limp i am dead she called to the gray sky frowning they all leaned in a little what has happened to my countrymen my countrywomen my fathers sons mothers and daughters has slain me the agony of their slaughter has mortally wounded my heart her arms spread wider as her voice rose in wrath only vengeance can restore me only victory can return my life to me she gazed into all the wide eyes staring back i am the mother confessor of the midlands i am your mothers your sisters your daughters yet unborn i call upon you to die with me and live again only by avenging me kahlan swept a hand out those of you who join with me in this are dead with me our lives can be returned only through vengeance as long as one of our enemy lives we are dead we have no life to lose in this battle for our lives are already lost here today now only when every one of the destroyers of ebinissia is slain may we live once again until then we have no life she looked out at the solemn faces of the men gathered before her watching waiting for her next words on a warm breeze the bloody wolf fur rustled against her cheek kahlan pulled free her knife and held it up in her fist for all to see she laid the weapon over her heart an oath then to the good people of ebinissia who are now with the spirits and to the good people of the midlands almost all the men followed her example holding their knives over their hearts seven did not but grumbling curses rose to join with mosle seventysix vengeance without mercy before our lives are returned to usshe pledged the sober voice of every man before her repeated the oath joining with every other in unflinching unity vengeance without mercy before our lives are returned to us the roar of their words drifted away on the morning air kahlan watched william mosle cast a glance over his shoulder at her before following his men away back up the pass she returned her attention to those before her you are all sworn in oath then tonight we begin the killing of the men of the order let it be without quarter we take no prisoners no cheer went up this time the men listened in grim attention we must no longer travel as you have been with wagons to carry your needs and supplies we must take only what we can carry we need to be able to travel the woods the small passes so we can outmaneuver the men we hunt i intend to sweep in at them from all directions and at will like wolves at hunt and like wolves who hunt with coordination we will control and direct them as wolves control and direct their prey you are men of this land you know the woods and mountains around us you have hunted them since you were children we will use your knowledge the enemy is in strange territory and keeps to the wide passes with their wagons and great numbers we will no longer be impeded as they we will move through the country around them as do the wolves you must divide up what you have in the wagons and place what you can carry in your packs leave the heavy armor it takes too much effort to carry and we are not going to fight that way take only light armor you can wear at a forced march take what food you can you are to take no liquor or ale when you have avenged the people of ebinissia you may drink all you want until then you will not i want everyone alert at all times we do not ever relax until our enemy is dead to a man some of the food thats left is to be packed into a few of the smaller wagons without any arms or armor we will need volunteers to give it to the enemy the men mumbled in surprise and confusion the road divides ahead when they are past the fork and on their way to cellion the wagons with the food and all the ale are to take the other road and then the smaller routes to get ahead of them you will lie in wait with these wagons until their advance guard nears and then cross their path so they can see you when their forward column spots you and gives chase you are to abandon the wagons and escape let them have the food and drink the imperial order is nearly out of ale and tonight they will celebrate their luck i expect they will get drunk i want them to be drunk when we attack them the men cheered with that news know this were as a wolf pack trying to bring down a bull though we are not strong enough to do it with one dispatching strike we will harry him to exhaustion drag him to the ground and kill him this will not be a single battle but a constant nipping at his hide taking small chunks of him at a time wounding weakening and bleeding him all the while until finally we have the advantage and can kill the beast tonight under cover of darkness we will slip into their camp and make a quick strike this is to be a disciplined action not random killing we will have a list of objectives our aim is to weaken the bull i have already partially blinded him by eliminating the wizard the sentries and lookouts will be taken first we will dress as many men as we can in their clothes those men will go into their camp and locate our targets our first need is to slow their ability to counterattack i dont want us run down by cavalry we need to bring ruin to their horses theres no need to waste time killing them breaking their legs is sufficient we need to destroy their food were an army small enough to be able to get food by hunting foraging and buying from surrounding farms and villages but one that size requires much if we destroy their food they will be weakened we need to kill their arrow makers and fletchers bowyers and blacksmiths all the craftsmen who can make and repair bows arrows and other weapons they will have sacks of goose wings for fletching arrows they must be stolen or burned every arrow not made is one that cant kill us bow staves need to be destroyed wreck their bugles if you find them and the buglers this will help take away their voice and coordination their lances pikes and argons will be stacked upright together five seconds and a few swings with an axe or sword will destroy a great many lances and pikes heavy axes or hammers will at least bend the argons and render them useless every lance or spear broken is one that cant kill you burn their tents to expose them to the cold burn their wagons so they will lose supplies of most importance are their officers i would rather kill one officer tonight than a thousand men if we can kill their officers it will make them dull and slow and it will be easier to take this bull to the ground if any of you can think of anything else that will weaken them bring the ideas to me or captain ryan or the other officers the object tonight is not primarily to kill soldiers there are too many our object is to disable them make them weak slow to make them less sure of themselves most of all our object is to put fear into their minds these men arent used to being afraid when men are afraid they make mistakes those mistakes allow us to kill them i intend to terrify them later i will tell you how you have a few hours to get everything ready and then we start moving i want the sentries at double distance beyond them i want lookouts and i want scouts to keep in contact with the order i want to know where they are at all times i want constant reports i dont want to be surprised by anything i want to know of anything that you see or encounter no matter how innocent it seems if a rabbit jumps too high i want to know about it just as we intend to trick them i dont want them tricking us take nothing for granted may the good spirits be with you now get started the men all began moving the air coming to life with the sound of feet and talking one of the two lieutenants stood near unbuttoning his coat giving orders to some men around him lieutenant sloan he looked up as the men he had instructed went to their tasks see to the sentries and lookouts at once i want any of your men who know how to make white paint or whitewash to assemble the supplies they need we will need large tubs of some sort i want rocks heated to warm the insides of tents he didnt question her strange instructions yes mother confessor see that the small wagons with the ale and food are prepared but hold them until i give the order to let them go he put his fist to his heart without comment and marched off to see to it kahlans legs felt as if they would give out at any second she was so tired from having had no sleep and from riding the better part of the night to say nothing of the work she had done and the heartpounding fright that she could hardly focus her eyes anymore her shoulder hurt where the lance had been couched when it was shattered the muscles in her left leg jittered with the effort of keeping her standing she was also mentally exhausted anxiety over not only the enormity of her decision to take it upon herself to call all the midlands into war but also over her impassioned plea for these men to lay down their lives on her word eroded her strength further despite the unusual warmth of the day she shivered inside her fur mantle captain ryan stepped over to her chandalen prindin and tossidin were standing by the rear of the wagon watching captain ryan gave her a sly smile i like it he jumped down and held his hand out for her she ignored the hand and jumped down as he had done and by luck more than anything stayed on her feet she could not accept his offer of help not now not with what she was about to do and now captain i must give you an order you are not going to like she looked to his blue eyes i want you to send men after mosle and those who went with him send enough to be sure to accomplish the deed deed they must be killed send a force with instructions that they are to pretend to join with mosles men so they dont scatter when your men approach send your cavalry behind but out of sight in case theyre able to take to the woods when they are surrounded kill them there are seventysix count the bodies to make sure they are all dead i will be very displeased if even one escapes his eyes were wide but mother confessor i take no pleasure in this captain you have your orders she turned to the three mud people prindin go with the men he picks make sure those who departed are killed to a man prindin gave her a grim nod he understood the unpleasant necessity of what she was doing captain ryan tensed in near panic mother confessor i know those men theyve been with us a long time you said they were free to go we cant she laid a hand on his arm he suddenly recognized the threat that represented i am doing what i must to save your lives you have given your word to follow orders she leaned a little closer do not add yourself to those seventysix he at last gave a nod and she removed her hand his eyes told it all hate radiated from him i didnt know the killing was to start with our own men he whispered it does not it starts with the enemy captain ryan pointed angrily up the pass theyre going in the opposite direction of the order and did you think they would go to the enemy in plain sight of you they intend to circle around she turned and started off toward a tent that had been left up for her captain ryan trailed by chandalen prindin and tossidin followed her unwilling to concede if you were so concerned why did you let them go why didnt you let the men kill them when they would have because i had to give all those who would renounce us and abandon their fellows the chance to do so what makes you think all the traitors departed there could be spies or assassins among us yes there could be but i have no evidence of that at the moment if i find there are i will have to deal with them then kahlan came to a stop before the tent if you think i may be making a mistake about those men i assure you i am not but even if i were it is a price that must be paid if we let them go and even one of them betrays us we could all be killed in a trap tonight if we die there will be none to stop the order for a long time how many thousands would die then captain if those men are innocent ill have made a terrible mistake and seventysix innocent men will die if im right i will be saving the lives of untold thousands of innocent people you have your orders carry them out captain ryan shook with rage i hope you dont expect me to ever forgive you for this no i dont i expect only that you follow my orders i dont care if you hate me captain i care only that you live to do so he gritted his teeth in mute frustration kahlan gripped the tent flap captain im so tired i can hardly stand i need to get a couple of hours sleep i want a guard posted around this tent while i rest he glared at her and how can you be sure one of them might not be an enemy they could kill you in your sleep thats a possibility but if that happens one of these three men would avenge my murder captain ryan flinched and glanced at the three mud people in his anger he had forgotten they were there chandalen lifted an eyebrow to him i will first put sticks in his eyes to hold them open to be sure he sees what i do lieutenant hobson rushed up holding a bowl out in his hands mother confessor i brought you some stew i thought you would like something to eat something hot kahlan forced herself to smile at him thank you lieutenant but im so tired im afraid i wouldnt be able to keep it down could you keep it warm until after ive rested of course mother confessor captain ryans glare slid to his grinning lieutenant i have a job for you hobson two hours kahlan said and then wake me you should all have enough to keep you busy in the meantime she pulled the flap aside and went into the tent nearly collapsing onto the cot she drew a blanket over her legs and lifted the fur mantle over her head shutting out the light in her small private darkness she shook she would have given her life right then to have richard hold her for just five minutes chapter she was kissing richard holding him tightly in her arms her mind filled with no thought but peace and joy when she started at the sound of shouting richard was gone her heavy arms were empty she sat up pushing the blanket away frantic for an instant not knowing where she was and then she remembered she felt as if she might vomit she wished she could have a hot bath she couldnt remember her last bath she rubbed her eyes as captain ryan stuck his head inside the tent how long kahlan mumbled how long have i slept she threw the blanket aside a couple hours just about there is someone out here for you directly outside her tent waited a group of men an ashenfaced lieutenant hobson among them in their midst stood mosle bound and gagged and held at each arm by soldiers his eyes darted about in panic he tried to shout through the gag but couldnt make himself understood kahlan glowered over at captain ryan he stood with one thumb hooked in his belt i thought mother confessor that you would want to execute this man yourself since he seems to have personally offended you so he held his knife out toward her handle first kahlan ignored the knife and turned instead to the men holding mosle release him and stand away she felt as if she were still in a sleep still in a dream but she wasnt there was no option as they stepped back she reached out and snatched mosle by his arm he froze in fright for an instant and then tried to back away but he had no time to escape she was touching him now he was hers her sleepiness vanished in a sucking rush as her power ignited she gave no thought to what she was about to do there was no choice she was committed she gave herself over to it the sounds of the camp the jangle of tack the grating of wooden boxes being skidded across wagon beds the splintering of other boxes being pried open the squeak of wheels the whinnies of horses the sound of thousands of feet shuffling men talking the clop of hooves the sound of steel being sharpened the popping of wood in fires and the sound of her own heart beating all faded away to silence in the silence of her mind the power was all she could feel mosles muscles tighten under her hand but he had no chance he was hers in the silence in the quiet in the peace of her mind as she had done countless times before she released her power her magic into the man before her there was a violent jolt to the air as it slammed into him thunder without sound the snow around her and mosle billowed away in a ring rising and tumbling until it dissipated and settled again mosle no more who he had been dropped to his knees in the wet snow before her his brow wrinkled with panic that because of the gag he would not be able to ask her to command him he sucked air through his nose trying to breathe with the terror that he might displease her the camp around her had fallen into stunned silence with her the heart of all attention kahlan pulled the gag from his mouth tears of relief flooded from his eyes mistress he whispered hoarsely please mistress command me please tell me what i can do to serve you in trepidation hundreds of stunned faces around her watched kahlan gazed down at the man on his knees before her she wore her confessors face it would please me william if you would tell me the truth of what you planned to do after you left this camp he beamed with joy more tears running down his cheeks and would have clutched at her legs in gratitude had his arms not been bound behind his back oh yes mistress please let me tell you tell me then it all came babbling out in a rush i was going to the camp of those other men the imperial order you called them and i was going to ask to join them i was going to take all my men with me so they could join too i was going to tell them of the presence of the galean recruits and of your plans so they would be pleased with us and would let us join with them i thought they had a better chance than you and i didnt want to die so i was going to join with them i thought they would be pleased if i brought them men to add to their ranks i thought they would be pleased with us if we could help them crush you he burst suddenly in sobs oh please mistress im so sorry i thought to do you harm i wanted them to kill you oh please mistress im so sorry i intended you harm please mistress tell me how i can gain your forgiveness i will do anything please command me and it will be done please mistress what do you wish of me i wish for you to die she whispered in the icy silence right now william mosle crumpled forward against her boots and thrashed in racking convulsions after a few long agonizing seconds he was still his last breath rattling from his lungs kahlans gaze slid over a wideeyed captain ryan to prindin standing behind a still ashen lieutenant hobson chandalen was glaring at him too she spoke in his tongue prindin i told you to make sure they were all killed why did you not do as i said he shrugged selfconsciously they were of a mind to do this captain ryan told them to kill the others but to bring this one to you i did not know this when we left or i would have told you they had two hundred men on foot and another one hundred on horses as i told you they were of a mind to do this and i did not think i would be able to prevent it except by killing him myself and then i realized they might kill me for doing it and then i would not be able to be near you to protect you besides that i knew you were right and i thought it would do them good to learn a lesson did any escape no i was a little surprised at how well they did the job they are good men they did a hard thing a thing they wept to do but they did it well none escaped them kahlan let out a long breath i understand prindin you were right to do as you did she cast a sideways glance at chandalen chandalen will be satisfied too it was an order prindin gave her a tight smile of relief her glare slid to captain ryan satisfied he stood stiff pale and wideeyed yes mother confessor she swept a glance over the gathered men is everyone satisfied now there came from them all an uncoordinated mumbled chorus of yes mother confessor if there had been some before who were not terrified of her there were none now who were not the lot of them looked as if were a twig to snap unexpectedly they would bolt for the hills like frightened rabbits this was probably the first time most had seen magic and it wasnt wonderful beautiful magic but daunting ugly magic mother confessor captain ryan whispered his arm was still held out frozen the knife he had offered her still in his hand what are you going to do to me for disobeying your orders she looked to his bloodless face nothing this is your first day of being men in the war against the order most of you didnt believe in the importance of what i had commanded you have not fought in war before and did not understand the need i will be satisfied that you have learned something from this and leave it at that captain ryan swallowed thank you mother confessor with a shaking hand he slid his knife back in its sheath i grew up with him he lifted the hand toward the body at her feet we lived about a mile apart on the same road we used to go hunting and fishing together all the time we helped each other with chores we always went to feast day in our best coats of the same color we always im sorry bradley there is nothing to ease the pain of betrayal or loss except time as i told you war is not fair were it not for the men of the order making war perhaps you would be fishing today with your friend blame the order and avenge him too with all the rest he nodded mother confessor what would you have done if you were wrong what would you have done if mosle wasnt going to the enemy she regarded him until his gaze rose to meet hers i probably would have taken that knife you offered and killed you she turned from his hollow expression and put a hand on the shoulder of the the man next to him lieutenant hobson i know you had a difficult task prindin tells me you did it well he looked near tears but still managed to stiffen his back with pride she noticed that his beard hadnt even started to grow in earnest yet thank you mother confessor she looked around at the hundreds of men standing about watching i believe you all have work as if they had just awakened everyone began moving again slowly at first and then with accelerating urgency hobson gave a salute of his fist to his heart and turned to other business the men who had brought mosle lifted his body and carried it off others went to chandalen and the two brothers asking for instructions captain ryan stood alone with her watching as everyone went about their work her legs felt limp and slack like bowstrings left out in the rain all night for a confessor to use her power when she was rested and alert was taxing to use it when she was already tired was perilously exhausting she could hardly keep herself upright she had been dead tired from riding all night to the enemy camp and back to say nothing of the fight with them she needed more sleep than she had gotten and using her power had cost her even the benefit of the short nap and then some she had used what strength she had left to do something that should have been done without her she thought maybe it must be the cold and traveling in such difficult conditions but she seemed more tired than usual lately maybe she could ask prindin to make her some more tea could i speak with you for a moment mother confessor captain ryan asked kahlan nodded what is it captain he pushed his unbuttoned wool coat open shoving his hands in his back pockets he glanced away to watch some men filling waterskins i just want to say that im sorry i was wrong its all right bradley he was your friend its difficult to believe ill of a friend i understand no thats not it my father always told me that a man had to admit his mistakes before he could do right in this world he shuffled his feet and looked around finally bringing his blue eyes to her the mistake i made was believing that you wanted mosle killed because he wouldnt follow you i thought you were being spiteful because he didnt want to follow you i made a mistake and im sorry sorry i thought that of you you were trying to protect us even though you knew we would hate you for it well i dont hate you i hope you dont hate me im honored to follow you into this battle i hope that someday im half as wise as you and have the guts you do to use that wisdom she released a quiet sigh im hardly older than you yet you make me feel like an old woman im relieved you understand its a small pleasure in all this pain youre a fine officer and will do right by this world he smiled im glad were on good terms again a man approached and was waved forward by the captain what is it sergeant frost sergeant frost gave a salute of his fist to his heart we sent a few men out and in an abandoned barn they found some crushed chalk and other things needed to make whitewash we have some wooden tubs we can mix it in you said you wanted it in something big theyre big enough to bathe in how many of these tubs do you have kahlan asked a dozen mother confessor put the tubs near each other and pitch a tent around each use the largest tents you have even if it is the command tents make the whitewash with hot water and place the heated stones inside the tents to keep it as warm as possible inside let me know when all this is seen to keeping his obvious questions to himself the sergeant saluted and rushed off to see it done captain ryan gave her a curious frown what do you want with whitewash weve just gotten back on good terms lets not spoil it for a bit ill tell you after things are prepared are the wagons ready should be then i must see to them did you send the sentries and lookouts first thing as she walked through the camp to the wagons men came to her constantly the wagon wheels mother confessor as we destroy things we should stave in the wheels and their battle standards shouldnt we burn them so they cant rally their men around them and couldnt we set fire to their baggage so if the weather turns colder theyll freeze and if we were to throw manure in their barrels of drinking water they would have to waste time melting snow and a hundred other ideas from the absurd to the worthwhile she listened to each with attention giving her honest opinion and in a few cases her orders to see it done lieutenant hobson came at a trot holding out a tin bowl that was the last thing she needed mother confessor i kept some stew hot for you beaming he handed her the bowl as she walked she tried to act grateful he walked along next to her watching grinning she forced herself to take a spoonful and to tell him how wonderful it tasted it was all she could do to keep that one spoonful down after using her power a confessor needed time to recover for some it was days for her it took a couple of hours rest if she could get it was the best thing for a confessor after using her power the little rest she had gotten was now wasted she could get no more now and probably would get none this night either the last thing a confessor needed while recovering her power was food it diverted her energy to the food instead of returning her strength she had to think of a way out of eating the bowl of stew or it would end up on the ground to the embarrassment of all thankfully she reached the wagons before she had to take another mouthful she asked lieutenant hobson to get chandalen and the two brothers and bring them to her after he left she set the bowl down on the splinter bar of the dray with the casks of ale and climbed up she motioned captain ryan up on the wagon as she counted get some men unload the top rows so we can get at them all right the casks on the bottom row and withdraw the plugs as he motioned for men to help with the task she asked did chandalen have you all make a troga a troga was a simple stout piece of cord or a wire with a wooden handle on each end and long enough so that when it was given a twist it made a loop that was the right size to drop over a mans head it was applied from behind and then the handles yanked apart if it was made of wire placed correctly at the neck joints and the man wielding it had arms big enough his troga could decapitate a person before the victim had a chance to make a sound even if it wasnt wire or his arms were not that strong the victim still made no sound before he died captain ryan reached behind his back under his coat and retrieved a wire troga holding it up for her to see he gave us a little demonstration he was gentle but im still glad i wasnt the one he demonstrated on he says he and prindin and tossidin will use these to take the sentries and lookouts i dont think he believes we can sneak up on them like he can but many of us have spent a lot of time hunting and were more clever captain ryan leapt with a yelp chandalen had poked him in the ribs having come up unseen behind him the captain comforted his ribs and scowled at a smiling chandalen prindin and his brother climbed up to help unload the barrels you wish something mother confessor chandalen asked kahlan held her hand out give me your bandu your tenstep poison his brow wrinkled into a scowl but he reached into the pouch at his waist and pulled out the bone box leaning over to hand it to her the brothers fished out their boxes too and handed them to her how much will i be able to poison with it how many casks can i make poison chandalen stepped around captain ryan balancing atop the sides of the round barrels you are going to put it in this drink kahlan nodded but then we wont have any more we must have it with us we may need it ill leave a bit for emergencies every one we can kill in this way is one less to fight but they might discover its poison captain ryan said then we wont even have them drunk they have dogs kahlan said thats why i want to send them food too they will throw the dogs some of the meat to make sure its good im hoping they will be put at ease after testing the food on the dogs and anxious enough for the ale that the idea of it being poisoned wont come into their heads chandalen counted the barrels silently and then straightened there are thirtysix twelve for each of our bandu he scratched his head of black hair while he pondered it will not kill them unless they drink much but it will make them sick how sick what will it do it will make them weak they will be sick in their stomachs their heads will spin inside maybe some will die in a hand of days from the poison sickness kahlan nodded it will be a great help but this is hardly enough for all their men captain ryan said only some will drink this some will go to the unit who plundered it and the rest will be divided among the men of rank first with whats left going to the soldiers the men of rank are the ones im after all the top rows were unloaded leaving only the bottom row which the men stood up so the plugs could be removed why are six of these barrels smaller theyre rum the captain said rum the drink of nobility kahlan smiled the commanders will take the rum first she straightened from peering into one of the open casks chandalen will they be able to taste it will the taste give them warning if i put more in some he dipped a finger in a cask of rum and sucked it clean no this is bitter enough bitter things hide the taste of bandu kahlan used her knife point to divide the poison from chandalens box into sixths she swished each sixth off her knife point into the round opening in one of the smaller casks those with the rum chandalen watched what she was doing that much in the smaller barrels will probably kill them by morning the next day for sure but now you have none for the other six kahlan handed chandalen back his bone box with a little of the bandu left in the comers and climbed down from the dray six of the casks of ale will have no poison so that we can be sure the rum will kill those who drink it she put a knife point laden with poison from tossidins box into each of the next twelve mix all the barrels up i dont want the rum on the bottom the commanders might not see it and take the ale instead kahlan went to the last twelve and opened prindins box she looked up you dont have very much what have you done with yours prindin looked as though he wished she hadnt asked that question he gestured vaguely when we left i was not thinking so good you were in a hurry and so i forgot to see that my bandu box was full chandalen put his fists on his hips and glared down from atop the wagon prindin how many times have i said that you would forget to take your feet could you walk away without them it doesnt matter kahlan said prindin looked relieved to have her interrupt chandalens questioning this will make them sick that is all that matters as she was putting it in the barrels she heard men in the distance hailing her when she had swirled the poison into the last barrel she looked up to see two huge draft horses trotting toward her she frowned at seeing men riding them bareback and calling out to her the two powerful draft horses looked shaggy in their thick duncolored winter coats with heavy white feathering on their legs they wore their harnesses and neck collars but not their breeching several bends of chain were looped over the inside hame of each collar the men about all stared at the odd sight when the horses came to a halt before her the riders un hooked the loops of chain and dropped them to the ground she realized then that the horses were connected by that chain attached to the hame hooks on their collars she had never seen such a thing the two riders slid to the ground mother confessor their grins made their salutes look a little silly the both of them were gangly with shortcropped brown hair neither looked as if he could be fifteen their wool coats were unbuttoned in the warming day and fit them like gunnysacks on lapdogs they both looked about to burst with excitement they halted before getting too close but even their fear of her couldnt wither their breathless excitement what are your names im brin jackson and this is peter chapman mother confessor we had an idea and we wanted to show you we think itll do the job were sure it will itll work some clever it sure will kahlan looked from one beaming face to the other what will do what job brin almost leapt with joy at being asked he hefted the chain lying in the snow between the big horses this he lugged a wad of chain to her and held it out this will do it mother confessor we thought of it ourselves peter and me he dumped the heavy chain on the ground show her peter move em apart peters head bobbed as he grinned he sidestepped his horse until the heavy chain lifted off the snow the sag of chain swung to and fro between the hame hooks on the collars kahlan and all the men with her frowned trying to understand what the peculiar rig was for brin pointed at the chain you said we were going to leave the wagons and we surely didnt want to leave daisy and pip behind thems our horses daisy and pip were drivers we wanted to help and make a good use of daisy and pip so we took some of the biggest trace chains and asked morvan hes the blacksmith we asked morvan to weld a couple of em together for us he nodded expectantly as if that should explain it kahlan dipped her head toward him a little and now that he has brin held his hands open in excitement you said we needed to take out their horses he couldnt help giggling thats what this is for you said were going to attack at night their horses will be tethered to picket lines we gallop daisy and pip down the picket line one on each side and the chainll break their legs out from under em well take out the whole line in one sweep kahlan leaned back and folded her arms she looked to peter he nodded keen on the idea too brin having horses chained together like that at a gallop and dragging a chain that will be catching things heavy things sounds to me very dangerous he wilted only a little but it could take out their horses we can do it we can get them for you they have close to two thousand horses peter wilted more brin scrunched up his face as he looked at the ground for the first time he scratched his shoulder two thousand he finally whispered in disappointment kahlan glanced to captain ryan he shrugged as if to say he didnt know if it would work or not the other men standing about rubbed their chins and shuffled their feet as they pondered the rig it will never do kahlan said at last brins shoulders slumped more there are too many of them for you you will need more horses set up like this brin and peters faces came up their eyes widening since you two know how to do it i want you to get all the draft horses and their drivers together this will be the best use of their skill use all the equipment off the wagons or breeching you need well not be taking them anyway have the chains made up at once and then i want you all to practice the rest of the day i want you to set up things to drag the chains through heavy thing so the horses will be used to what youre going to do you need to practice so each team of men and horses can work together peter came forward and stood next to a beaming brin we will mother confessor youll see we can do it you can count on us she gave them each a sobering look what you want to do is dangerous but if you can do it it will be a great benefit to us it could save many of our lives their cavalry is deadly take your gear and your practice seriously men will be trying to kill you when you do it for real they put their fists to their hearts this time holding their chins up well see to it mother confessor you can count on the drivers we wont let you down well get their horses after receiving her nod they turned to their horses heads together whispering in excitement they went to their task kahlan watched a lone rider in the distance galloping through the camp he stopped to ask a group of men something they pointed in her direction theyve only been with us a couple months captain ryan said theyre just boys kahlan raised an eyebrow to him they are men fighting for the midlands when i first saw you i thought of you in much the same way you see them now i think you look a little older to me he sighed i guess youre right if they really can do the job it will be a brilliant achievement the galloping rider approached and leapt from his horse before it came fully to a stop he gave a perfunctory salute mother confessor he gulped some air im cynric with the sentries what is it cynric you said you wanted to know about everything so i thought i better report we were just setting up the sentries about an hour out between here and the army of the order near a road that crosses jara pass and a coach came up the crossroad from the direction of kelton we knew you didnt want anything unusual going on so we stopped the coach i thought i better find out what you wanted us to do whos in the coach an old couple wealthy merchants of some sort or so they claim something about orchards what did you tell them you didnt tell them about us did you you didnt tell them that we have an army out here did you he shook his head vehemently no mother confessor we told them that there were outlaws in the neighborhood and that we were a small patrol out looking for them we told them they werent allowed to pass until i checked with my commander i said they had to wait until i returned kahlan nodded thats quick thinking cynric the drivers name is ahern he wanted to argue with us and thought to give his team reins until we showed him some steel then the old man came flying out of the coach accusing us of trying to rob him he started to swing his cane around at us like he thought that would drive us off or something anyway we drew arrows on him and he decided he would get back in the coach what is his name cynric shifted his weight to the other foot and scratched his eyebrow robin or ruben or something like that feisty old fellow ruben i think ruben rybnik i think thats it kahlan sighed as she shook her head they dont sound like spies but if the order catches them and they know anything they will tell it all before the dharans are through with them she looked up what are they doing out here the old man says his wife is sick and theyre taking her to healers in nicobarese she didnt look well to me her eyes looked to be all rolled back in her head well since theyre on the road going northwest going across jara pass that shouldnt take them anywhere near the order she pulled some of her long hair back off her face but before i dare let them go i best go speak with them before she could take three steps sergeant frost came running up behind mother confessor the tubs of whitewash are ready the tents are heated kahlan let out a noisy breath she looked from sergeant frost to sentry cynric to other men waiting patiently to talk with her or ask instructions she let out another breath look cynric i dont have the hour to ride out there and another to ride back im sorry but i just dont have the time he nodded yes mother confessor i understand what do you wish done she steeled herself to the orders kill them mother confessor kill them we cant be sure of the truth of who they are and this is too important to worry about strangers running around loose we cant take the risk make it quick so they dont suffer she turned away toward sergeant frost but mother confessor she looked over her shoulder cynric gathered up a length of reins the driver ahern he has a royal pass kahlan turned back and frowned a what a royal pass medallion its a medallion that was given to him by queen cyrilla herself it says he was a hero to the people of ebimssia in the siege and in honor of his service he is to be given unhindered pass anywhere in galea the queen herself gave this pass cynric nodded ill do what you command mother confessor but with this medallion the queen has promised him her protection kahlan rubbed her forehead with her fingertips she was so tired she could hardly focus her mind to think since he has a pass given by the queen we must honor it she pointed a finger to the sentry but you tell him that he must be clear of the area immediately repeat what you told him about there being outlaws in the neighborhood tell him that youre hunting these outlaws and that if you catch ahern and his coach around here again youre ordered to assume they are in with the outlaws and youre to execute them on the spot the road to nicobarese goes northeast tell them to keep to it and not to stop before theyre a good long distance from here cynric clapped a fist to his heart as she turned to take captain ryans arm and lead him toward the tents with the whitewash behind she heard the sentry gallop off toward the coach he had found the other men took the hint that they werent to come and went about other business she loosened the thong holding her mantle closed the temperature had climbed above freezing and the clouds had lowered nearly to the ground the air felt wringing wet fog will move in by this afternoon he observed this whole valley pass will be thick with it tonight he glanced to her questioning frown ive lived in these mountains my whole life when it takes a thaw like this in winter the fog settles into the passes for at least a couple of days kahlan surveyed the mountain sides ascending into the gray clouds that will serve us well especially for what i have in mind it will be an aid to us in bringing terror to the enemy so are you ready to tell me what were to paint kahlan let out a tired sigh weve devised a number of plans to strike targets that must be destroyed tonight will be our best chance of accomplishing those things because they will be surprised we will not have a chance of surprise like this again after tonight they will be expecting our next attacks i understand the men too know the importance of this they will do well we must also not lose sight of our intent our intent is to kill these men tonight we will have the chance to do that as perhaps at no other time we must take that opportunity how many swordsmen do we have he was silent a moment as he tallied the numbers in his head nearly two thousand are swordsmen not quite another eight hundred archers and the rest divided up among pikemen lancers and cavalry among others including the rest of what an army needs from drivers to fletchers to blacksmiths kahlan nodded to herself i want you to select about a thousand swordsmen pick the strongest the fiercest the most eager for the fight and what are we going to do with these men the men dressed in the uniforms of the sentries we kill will make an exploration of the enemy camp and come back and give us the locations of our objectives we have enough men to do the tasks we have assigned for those objectives the swordsmen are for beginning our prime objective killing the enemy they will first see to the enemy commanders just in case they werent poisoned and then after that they will kill as many men as they can in the shortest possible time they came to the dozen tents set up close together in a half circle kahlan checked inside them all to be sure they were equipped as she had ordered finished checking she stood outside the largest and faced captain ryan so are you going to tell me now what it is were to paint kahlan nodded those thousand swordsmen he stared dumfounded were going to paint the men why its simple dharans fear spirits they fear the spirits of the foes they kill thats why they drag the bodies of their fallen comrades away from a battle site like ebinissia tonight their fears are going to come to haunt them they are going to be attacked by the thing they fear most spirits but they will recognize us as soldiers simply with white clothes not as spirits kahlan looked at captain ryan from under her eyebrows they will not be wearing clothes they will have nothing but their swords painted white just as are they they will remove their clothes just before the attack his mouth dropped open what i want you to get the swordsmen together now and assemble them here theyre to go into the tents remove their clothes and dip themselves in the whitewash after dunking themselves they will stand near the hot rocks until dry it wont take long then they can put their clothes back on until the attack captain ryan stood in shock but its winter theyll freeze without clothes we have a break in the bitter cold besides the cold will remind them to rush in and rush back out i dont want them to stay in that camp very long the enemy will recover from their shock in short order and set upon any invader i want our men to attack kill terrified dharans and escape as i said dharans fear spirits when they see what they will at first think is their worst fear they will be stunned their first thought will be to run not to fight men die as easily from a sword through the back as through the front some will freeze in place not knowing what to do even those who recognize the invaders as men painted white and not as spirits will be confused for a moment those few seconds of confusion as we come upon each new group are the seconds we need to run them through in battle the difference between killing and being killed is often a single moment of indecision the swordsmen are not to engage in fights if challenged theyre to run on to others there are more than enough to kill its a mistake to waste time engaging in battle if it can be avoided i simply want enemy soldiers killed after the commanders are dead it doesnt matter which ones i dont want our men fighting unless forced to that only risks their lives needlessly rush in kill as many men as possible and rush out those are to be the orders captain ryan frowned as he considered i never thought i would hear myself say it but i think it sounds like it might be an outlandishly successful tactic the men arent going to like it at first but theyll follow orders ill explain it to them and then i know theyll feel a little better about it ive never heard of such a thing and im sure the enemy hasnt either he at last smiled a sly smile its sure to surprise them no doubt about that kahlan was relieved he had come around to that much of it good im pleased to have the enthusiasm of a captain in the galean army in the midlands army now i want you to have my horses saddle and tack brought here and dipped in the whitewash and please post some guards outside this tent while im inside his eyes widened your saddle youre not mother confessor you cant be serious i would not ask my men to do something i myself would not do they need to have a commander to rally around in their first battle i intend to lead them captain ryan took a step back he was aghast he regained the step but mother confesser youre a woman and not in any way an ugly woman seemingly involuntarily he took a quick glance the length of her in fact you are mother confessor forgive me he fell silent they are soldiers with a mission make your point captain his face filled with blood these are young men mother confessor they are well you cant expect they are young men his jaw moved as he tried to find words they wont be able to help themselves mother confessor please youll be embarrassed beyond all tolerance he winced hoping he wouldnt have to explain further she gave him a small smile to try to ease his horror captain have you ever heard the legend of the shahari he shook his head when the tribes and lands now called dhara were being forged together the method of conquest and joining were much the same as it is with the imperial order join with them or be conquered the shahari people refused to join into dhara and they refused to be conquered they fought so fiercely that they came to be greatly feared by the dharan troops who outnumbered them many times over the shahari loved nothing more than fighting they were so fearless and aroused about going into war that they went into battle naked and well aroused kahlan looked up to see captain ryan staring mouth agape she went on the dharans all know the legend of the shahari they all to this day fear the shahari she cleared her throat if the men go into battle and that happens it will only bring greater fear to the men of the order i dont think though that the men need fear being embarrassed they will have more pressing matters on their minds like not being killed and if it does happen well then they should know it pleases me because it will only strike greater fear into the hearts of our enemy captain ryan finally looked to the ground and pushed snow with his boot forgive me mother confessor but i still dont like it it puts you at danger for nothing of much gain thats not true there are two more important reasons i must do this first when i left the orders camp last night i was being chased by about fifty men the dhafans have no doubt that those fifty men will catch me and kill me the captain stiffened you mean there are fifty men roaming around looking for you no theyre all dead to a man but the men back at camp dont know that when they see me all white like a spirit they will think i was killed as i should have been and that its my spirit in their midst it will only frighten them further all fifty he peered up at her and whats the second reason kahlan stared at him for a moment her voice came softly when those men of the order see me whether they think me a spirit or they think me a naked woman on a horse before them they will stare while they are staring they cannot kill our men but we can kill them it will divert their attention from the men to me he gazed silently at her as she went on i would be willing to suffer any embarrassment she said if it will save the life of even one of our men i must do this to help them and to keep them alive he looked to the ground as he put his hands in his pockets i never knew the mother confessor was a person who cared this much for her people he whispered i never knew before that she cared at all what happened to any of us he looked up at last is there anything at all i can say to talk you out of doing this kahlan smiled theres only one man in the world who could keep me from doing this and you are not him she laughed quietly in fact if he knew what i was about to do im sure he would forbid it his curiosity overcame his caution one man is he your mate she shook her head he is the one you will choose as your mate kahlan sighed pleasantly no he is the one im to wed at least i hope to wed him he asked me to marry him she smiled at the confused look on his face his name is richard he is the seeker captain ryan stiffened and his breath cut off if im asking what i shouldnt just say so but i thought all confessors used their power i thought your magic would i didnt think confessors could marry they cant but richard is special he has the gift and my power cannot harm him captain ryan smiled at last im glad im happy for you mother confessor kahlan lifted an eyebrow but if you ever meet him dont you dare tell him about this pretending to be a spirit business he has rather fusty views about such things if you told him you let me run around naked with a thousand of your men he would probably take your head off kahlan laughed at the alarmed look on the captains face captain i need a sword a sword now youre going to fight too kahlan leaned toward him captain if im sitting there naked and a dharan wishes to despoil my honor how am i to defend myself unless i have a sword oh well i see your point he thought a moment an idea brightened his face and he withdrew his own sword from its scabbard he held the weapon out in both hands it was an old sword with a blade pattern wielded in the old fashion and acid etched in the fuller to display the wavy folds of steel this blade was given to me by prince harold when i became an officer he said it was his fathers that it was one that belonged to king wyborn himself he said king wyborn held it once in battle he shrugged selfconsciously of course a king has many swords and holds many of them in battle at least once so they will be said to have been wielded by a king in defense of his kingdom so its not really valuable or anything he looked up expectantly but i would be honored if you took it as yours it seems only right that well since youre king wyborns daughter i guess that you should wield his sword in battle maybe it has magic or something and will help protect your life kahlan carefully lifted the sword from his hands thank you bradley this means a lot to me you are wrong it is valuable i will carry it with honor but i will not keep it when im finished and leave for aydindril in a couple of days then i will return it and you will have a sword wielded not only by a king but by the mother confessor too he grinned with the idea of that now would you please post a guard outside this tent and then see to the swordsmen he smiled a little smile and brought his fist to his heart of course mother confessor as kahlan went inside the warm tent he was already returning with three men he had a scowl on his face as serious as any scowl she had ever seen on any officers face and while the mother confessor is in her bath you will keep your back to the tent and not let anyone near is that clear yes captain the three wideeyed soldiers said together inside in the warmth kahlan leaned the sword against the tub slipped off the fur mantle and then her clothes she was so tired she felt sick her stomach felt as if it were rising and falling in waves her head spun so that she had to fight nausea that swelled in bouts she dragged her hand through the whitewash it was hot like a wonderful bath but this was no bath she lifted her legs over the edge one at a time and eased herself down into the silkysmooth white water her breasts felt buoyant in the milky pool for a few minutes she draped her arms over the sides of the tub closed her eyes and pretended it was a hot bath she wished so much that it could be a bath but it wasnt it was something she did to keep some men alive and to kill others she would wear white as the mother confessor always did but it would not be her dress as always before kahlan lifted her fathers sword and held the hilt between her breasts with the length of the blade running down her body against her belly and between her legs she crossed her ankles and kept her legs apart so as not to slice her thighs on the weapon she held her nose closed with her other hand squeezed her eyes shut tight took a deep breath and then submerged herself chapter richard and sister verna continued on through a dark and humid dank and stifling tunnel of green ascending the gently sloping road toward the humming haunting sound of distant flutes branches holding not only their own leaves but vines of every sort spiraling around and over them and pale moss hanging in wispy curtains filled the gaps between trunks to the sides and nearly closed off the light from above short walls to each side looking to have been built in an attempt to hold back the tangled growth were instead being snared by it and slowly enfolded into the creeping leafy mat of life they sought to retain from joints in the stone block vines sprouted surrounding and smothering whole sections of wall bulging it in other places pushing the occasional stone out to hang at a drunken angle unable to fall to the ground because of the net of tendrils the walls looked as if they were prey being swallowed by a ponderous predator only one part of the walls was untouched by the forest life the human skulls atop the walls to each side they were spaced at intervals of no more than three feet each sitting on its own square of lichensplotched stone each clean of growth looking like so many finials with eye sockets and toothy grins richard had lost count of the number of skulls his curiosity his dread failed to overcome his stubborn silence he and the sister had not spoken since their last argument he had not even slept in camp with her preferring instead to spend his watch and the rest of the night hunting and sleeping with gratch sister vernas angry silence was at last no match for his he had no intention this time of being the one to make amends they both contented themselves with looking at anything but each other opening into sunlight the road widened splitting in the distance around a striated pyramid richard frowned trying to see what made it look the way it did a dotted pale tan with darker bands at evenly spaced intervals up its sides he judged its height at three times his eye level from where he sat atop bonnie as they approached he realized the mound was constructed entirely of bones human bones the dotted tan parts were skulls and the bands were leg and arm bones placed endout in layers he guessed there must be tens of thousands of skulls in the orderly heap he stared as they rode past sister verna didnt seem to take notice beyond the bone pile the wide road led into a plaza of a dark and hazy city in the middle of the thick forest the flat hilltop had been cleared of every tree as had the terraced fields they had passed not an hour before the fields looked to be in preparation for planting the ground was freshly turned and there were stick people to scare away the birds when the seed was planted it was winter yet here in this place people planted richard thought it a wonder rather than feeling open this vast city cleared of every bit of green that surrounded it seemed even more closed and dark than the tunneled road buildings were square with flat roofs and faced with dingy plaster the color of bark near the roofs and at each floor level the ends of support logs stuck from the plastered walls windows were small with never more than one in a wall the buildings varied in height but most were attached into irregular blocks the tallest must have had four floors none had the slightest variation in style other than their height haze and woodsmoke obscured the sky and the buildings in the distance the plaza seemed simply an open place around a well in the center and was the only open area of any size it quickly terminated in narrow dark streets with smooth walls rising up to each side creating manmade chasms overhead many of the blocky buildings bridged the streets making them dark tunnels and where there were none of the bridging buildings overhead wash hung on lines between opposing windows some streets were cobblestone but most were mud running with fetid water people in drab loosefitting clothes filled the narrow streets walked barefoot through the mud stood with their arms folded watching or sat in groups in doorways women carrying clay water jugs on their heads balanced with the aid of a single hand moved tight against the walls to make room for the three horses they made their way to and from the well in indifferent silence as richard and sister verna passed a few older men sat in wide doorways or leaned against walls the men wore brimless straightsided round dark flattopped hats with strange markings in light colors that looked to have been painted on with fingers many of the men smoked thinstemmed pipes conversation fell silent as richard and sister verna passed and all watched the two strangers and three horses moving by some idly tugged on the long dangling earrings they wore in their left ears sister verna led the way through the narrow streets taking them deeper into the maze of drab buildings when they at last reached a wider cobblestone street she halted turned to him and spoke in quiet warning these people are the majendie their land is a vast crescentshaped swath of forests we must travel the length of their land all the way to the point of the horn of their land they worship spirits those skulls we saw back there were sacrifices to their spirits though they hold foolish beliefs which are reprehensible we do not have the power to change them we need to pass through their land you will do as they ask or our skulls will end up with all the others on that pile richard refused to give her the satisfaction of an answer or an argument he sat with his hands folded over the pommel of his saddle and without emotion watched her until she finally turned away and started out once more after passing under a low bridge building they entered a slightly dished open square perhaps a thousand men milled about or clustered in small groups like the other men he had seen these all wore the one long dangling earring though on the right side instead of the left they also all wore short swords and black sashes unlike the other men none of these wore hats on their shaved heads off in the center a raised platform held a circle of men sitting crosslegged facing inward around a thick pole here was the source of the eerie melody a circle of women in black sat in a ring facing outward around the men standing with her back against the pole a big woman in a billowing black outfit slid the back of her hand up the pole and took hold of a knot in the end of a rope hanging from a bell as she watched richard and the sister ride into the square she rang the bell once the sister brought them to an abrupt halt as the piercing peal drifted across the square hushing the men and urging the flute players into faster strains that is a warning sister verna said a warning to the spirits of their enemies the bell is also a call to the warriors present those are these men here in the square the spirits have been warned and the warriors called if she rings that bell again we die sister verna glanced to his even expression this is a sacrifice ritual to appease spirits she watched men come and take hold of the reins of their horses the circle of women in black stood and began to dance and twirl to the haunting music when sister verna glanced at him again richard with deliberate care checked that his sword was loose in its scabbard she sighed and then dismounted when she cleared her throat in annoyance he finally dismounted too sister verna drew her light cloak tight around herself as she spoke to him while watching the women in black dance and spin around the pole and the woman in the center the majendie live in a crescent around a land of swampy forest in which live their enemy the people who live in the heart of that forbidding land are a wild savage lot and will not allow any of us through their land much less guide us even if we could avoid them we would become lost within an hour and never find our way out the only way for us to reach the palace of the prophets which lies beyond these savages is to go around them along the crescent of land belonging to the majendie our destination lies between the cusps of the crescent belonging to the majendie and beyond the savages in the center she glanced over to make sure he was at least listening before she went on the majendie are at constant war with the savages who live in that swampy forest in order to be permitted through majendie land we must prove we are allied with them and their spirits and not their enemy those skulls we saw are the skulls of this enemy who were sacrificed to the majendie spirits in order for us to be permitted to pass we must help them in this sacrifice the majendie believe that men with the gift like all men carry the seed of life and soul endowed by the spirits more they believe that one with the gift has a special direct link with the spirits a sacrifice made with the aid of a young man with the gift confers the sanctifying grace of their spirits upon all their people they believe it breathes life divine life on their people the majendie require this participation when we bring young boys through for the first time believing it links their spirits to those of the majendie this ceremony also insures that the people with whom they are at war will hate wizards because they help the majendie and will never cooperate with them this the majendie believe denies their enemy a divine channel to the spirit world the men in the square all drew their short swords laying the swords on the ground with their points toward the woman in the center they knelt with shiny heads bowed the woman who rang the bell the one in the center is the leader of these people the queen mother she is the one who is bound to the female spirits she represents the spirits of fertility in this world she is the embodiment of the receptacle of the divine seed from the spirit world the dancing women in black formed into a line and started off the platform in the direction of richard and the sister the queen mother is sending her representatives to take you to the sacrificial offering sister verna glanced up at him then fussed with the corner of her cloak we are fortunate this means they have one to be sacrificed if we came here and they didnt we would have to wait until one of their enemy was captured sometimes that can take weeks even months richard said nothing she turned her back to the approaching women in black and faced him you will be taken to a place where the prisoner is held there you will be offered the chance to give your blessing not giving your blessing means you wish to precede the prisoner in sacrifice if you dont give your blessing it will only insure that you die too you give your blessing by kissing the sacred knife they will offer you you dont have to kill the person with your own hand you have only to kiss the knife to give your blessing to give the spirits blessings and they will do the killing but you must watch them do it so the spirits will see the sacrifice through your eyes she glanced over her shoulder at the approaching women in black the beliefs of these people are obscene she sighed in resignation and turned to face him again richard folded his arms and glared at her i know you dont like this richard but it has kept peace for three thousand years between us and the majendie though it sounds a paradox it saves lives more lives than it costs the savages who are their enemy make war not only on them but also on us the palace and the civilized people of the old world are sporadically subjected to their raids and fierce attacks small wonder richard thought but he said nothing sister verna stepped aside to stand at his shoulder as the women in black formed into a dark knot before the two of them all were older perhaps the age of grandmothers they were all portly and their black outfits covered their hair and everything else except their wrinkled hands and faces with gnarled fingers one drew the coarse black fabric tight at her chin she bowed her head to sister verna welcome wisewoman our sentries have told us of your approach for nearly a day now we are pleased to have you among us for it is the time of the planting sacrifice though we had not expected your presence it will be a great homage to the spirits to have the blessing in the sacrifice the old woman who only came up to the height of his breastbone looked richard up and down then she spoke again to sister verna this is a magic man he is not a boy we have never before brought one so old to the palace of the wisewomen sister verna said but he is a magic man the same as the others the old woman in black looked into richards eyes as he watched her without expression he is too old to give the blessing sister verna tensed he is still a magic man the woman nodded to the sister but he is too old to have others perform the sacrifice for him he must do it himself he must give our sacrifice to the spirits by his own hand she gestured for a woman behind to come forward lead him to where the offering waits with a bob of her head the woman came forward and indicated he was to follow sister verna tugged on his shirtsleeve richard could feel the heat of magic radiating from her fingers up his arms terminating in an uncomfortable tingling sensation at his neck under the radahan richard she whispered dont you dare swing the axe this time you know not what you will bring to ruin richard met her eyes before turning away without a word the round old woman led him off down a muddy street past old men sitting in doorways watching and then turned them down a narrow alley at the end she stooped through a low doorway richard had to bend nearly in half to follow inside carpets of intricate designs but dull colors covered the floor there was no furniture except several low leathercovered chests holding oil lamps four men with shaved heads squatted rather than sat on the rugs two to each side of a passageway hung with a heavy tapestry instead of a door short spears with sharp leafshaped iron heads rested across their knees the unexpectedly high ceiling held a cloud of pipe smoke the men stood and bowed to the old woman she bobbed her head to them and as she did so drew richard forward this is the magic man since he is the age of a man the queen mother directs that the spirits take the sacrifice through his hands they all nodded and gave grim agreement that it was a wise decision and prayed she would tell the queen mother that it would be done as directed the woman in black bid them fair fortune in the task she closed the rough spruce door behind herself after stooping through the low opening when she was gone the men broke into grins they all slapped richard on the back as if taking him into their confidence the back of one mans shaved neck wrinkled in rows of furrows as he turned to glance at the tapestrycovered passageway he put an arm around richards shoulder giving it a squeeze with powerful fingers you are fortunate indeed lad youll like what we have for you his sly smile revealed a missing bottom tooth come with us youll like this lad we can promise you you will he gave a hardy chuckle today youll be a man if youre not one yet the other three laughed with him the three pushed the tapestry aside taking one of the lamps with them the last man patted richards back ushering him through they all chuckled with anticipation the next room was much the same as the first minus the pipe smoke they led on through a sequence of rooms each bare of decoration except for a few carpets scattered about the men finally squatted beside a last covered passageway planted the butts of their spears and with a hand on them for support leaned toward him they all shared the same cunning smiles careful now lad dont be too anxious keep your head about yourself and youll have yourself a time with this savage they chuckled again with the private joke as they pushed the hanging aside and went through inside the small square room had a bare dirt floor the ceiling was at least three stories high a window near the top of one wall cast the small room in dim light the place smelled of the chamber pot off to the side crouched to the far left was a naked woman she tried to push herself farther into the corner when she saw the men arms around her knees she pulled them tight to herself she was covered with dirty marks and smears cuts and bruises her mass of long tangled black hair frizzed out framing her filthy face her dark eyes narrowed with loathing as she watched the four men by their leering smiles she had cause to know them around her neck was a thick iron collar connected by heavy chain to a massive pin in the wall the men spread out around the room squatted and leaned their backs against the walls their fists held their spears upright between their knees richard imitated them squatting and leaning against the wall to the womans right i wish to speak with the spirits richard said the four men blinked at him i must ask them how they wish it done there is only one way to do it the man with the missing tooth said you must cut off her head now that the iron collar is around her neck its the only way to get her out her head must be separated from her body even so it must be done in the manner the spirits wish i must talk with them i must know exactly how to do this to please them they all considered this the man with the missing tooth pushed his cheek out with his tongue as he pondered finally he brightened the queen mother and her women drink juka to speak with the spirits i could bring you some juka and then you too could speak with the spirits then bring me this juka so i may speak with the spirits and do as they command i would not want to make a mistake and ruin your planting sacrifice the men agreed that this was a wise request considering that richard was to make the sacrifice himself instead of simply blessing it one of the men hurried off the other three waited in silence again leering at the woman she moved her feet closer together to cover herself as she squatted in the corner and glowered back one man pulled a thinstemmed pipe and a long splinter from a pocket he lit the splinter in the flame of the lamp and used it to light his pipe he puffed as he watched the woman eyeing her in an intimate way her chin held defiantly up the woman glared back the smoke drifted up into the dim air as his steady puffing quickened richard crouched leaning against the wall with his arms folded across his lap so as to partially hide his right hand draped nonchalantly near the hilt of his sword the fourth man finally came back carrying a round clay pot in both hands the pot had a small opening in the top and white symbols painted around the sides the queen mother and her women agreed and sent this juka so you may call the spirits when you drink this the spirits will visit you he set the pot in front of richard and then pulling a knife from his belt held the green malachite handle out to him it was carved with figures in obscene poses this is the sacred knife to be used in the sacrifice when richard took the knife and slid the stout blade behind his belt the man joined his fellows squatting against the walls the man closest to the woman on the other side seemed pleased that the queen mother had sent the juka he gave richard a knowing wink then he lifted his spearpoint to the womans face the magic man has come to offer you to the spirits he smiled encouragement past her to richard but first he would like to give you the spirits gift of his seed she didnt move his smile transformed into a sneer as he thumped the butt of his spear to the dirt do not insult the spirits you will take their offering his voice lowered to a growl now her eyes never leaving him she uncoiled herself and obediently lay down on the dirt on her back she opened her legs and cast richard a defiant glance she obviously knew the consequence of denying these men what they wished the man sprang forward and stabbed his spear into her thigh muscle she screamed out and flinched back you know better than that you will not insult us we are not stupid he feigned another jab do it properly richards fingers curled around the hilt of his sword but otherwise he did not move the woman made no effort to tend the bleeding gash on her leg but instead obediently turned over onto her elbows and knees sticking her bottom up in the air the men chuckled to richard you would not like to lie with this one facetoface the man with the missing tooth said she bites the others nodded their certain knowledge of that mount her this way and hold her by her hair she will not be able to bite you this way and you can have all you wish the men waited neither richard nor the woman moved can you fools not see the woman said he does not wish to mount me like a dog in front of you her face lying against the dirt she gave richard a mocking smile he is shy he does not wish you to see how little his magic stick is every eye was on him richards knuckles were white around the hilt he strained to put an emotionless face over the rage of the magic searing through him from the sword he struggled to maintain reason letting the magic loose in here would accomplish nothing one of the men gave a playful elbow to another and laughed perhaps she is right he is a young one maybe he is not used to others watching his pleasure the seams around his control were strained near to bursting richard concentrated on keeping his free hand steady and making it move gracefully he lifted the clay pot with the juka showing it to them he labored mightily to keep his voice even the spirits wish to speak to me of important matters the smiles all withered they knew him as a magic man but not a young one as they were used to seeing they didnt have any idea of his power but were obviously worried about it worried about his smoldering too quiet smoothness we must leave him to his duty one of the men said we should leave him to be with the spirits and to take his pleasure from the savage if he wishes before he gives the spirits this offering he bowed his shiny head to richard we will leave you to your peace we will wait in the room where you saw us first solemnfaced the four hurried off after they were gone and she could be sure they were a good distance away the woman spat at him she arched her back like a cat in heat sticking her behind higher in the air you may mount me now like the dog you are come magic man prove you can mount a woman when she is held for you by a chain you can do no worse to me than the other dogs she spat at him again you are all dogs richard extended his leg and shoved a foot against her hip tipping her over im not like those men she rolled onto her back she threw her arms and legs open and gave him a contemptuous glare so you wish to have me like this to prove you are better than they richard gritted his teeth stop it im not here for that she sat up she lifted her chin but her eyes filled with sudden terror so you will sacrifice me now richard realized his hand was still gripping the hilt he had forgotten to maintain a calm expression he took his hand away letting the magic recede and his rage cool as she watched he poured the juka on the dirt floor im going to get you out of this my name is richard whats yours her eyes narrowed why do you wish to know well if im going to take you out of here i need to know what to call you i cant call you woman she surveyed him silently for a moment i am du chaillu do i call you du or chaillu or du chaillu puzzlement wrinkled her brow du chaillu that is my name richard gave her a smile of reassurance all right then du chaillu who are your people what are they called we are baka ban mana and what does that mean baka ban mana her chin came up again those without masters richard smiled to himself i think you are worthy of your people you dont look to be a woman to be mastered chin still held up she studied his eyes you say these words but you intend to mount me as the others richard shook his head no i told you i wouldnt do that im going to try to get you out of here and back to your people none of my people captured by the majendie ever returns richard leaned toward her then you shall be the first richard drew his sword du chaillu scooted back against the wall drawing her knees up to her chest hiding her face he realized that she had misinterpreted his action and expected the worst its all right du chaillu im not going to hurt you i simply need to get that collar off you she shrank from him then thinking better of her shameful retreat she lifted her head and spat at him yes by taking off my head you do not speak the truth you wish to kill me now and just want me to meekly offer you my neck with his sleeve richard wiped the spittle off the side of his forehead he reached out and put a comforting hand to her shoulder no im not going to hurt you i simply need to use this sword to get the collar off how else can i get you out of here you will be safe youll see let me get it off you swords cannot cut iron richard lifted an eyebrow magic can she squeezed her eyes shut and held her breath as he gently put an arm around her shoulder and rolled her facedown in his lap he laid the swords point to the side of her neck he had seen the sword of truth cut through iron before and he knew the swords magic could do the job she lay dead still as he slid the sword under the heavy iron band and then she lunged at him in a blink she had a fierce grip on his left arm her teeth clamped around his forearm pinching the nerves richard froze he knew that if he were to try to yank his arm back her teeth would probably tear the muscle from the bone he still had his right hand on the sword the rage of the magic pounded through him he used the anger to help slim block the pain and remain still with the sword under the collar as it was it would be a simple matter to give it a twist and a push it would cut her throat if not decapitate her and he would be free of her teeth the pain from her locking bite was agonizing du chaillu he managed through gritted teeth let go im not going to hurt you if it were my intention to hurt you i could cut you right now with the sword to make you let go after a long moment silent of everything but his laboredbreathing she relaxed the pressure of her teeth but didnt release his arm from her grip she tilted her head a bit why her eyes peered up at him why do you wish to help me richard stared down into her dark eyes he took a chance and removed his hand from the sword he brought the hand up and touched his fingers to the cold metal collar around his neck i too am a prisoner i too know what it is to be held by a collar i dont like collars though i cant free myself in this way i can try to free you her ferocious grip on his arm relaxed she cocked her head to the side as she frowned up at him but you are a magic man thats why i was taken prisoner the woman im with is taking me to a place called the palace of the prophets she says the magic will kill me if i dont go to this place you are with one of the witches from the big stone witch house she is not a witch but one with magic too she put this collar on me to make me go with her du chaillus eyes flicked over the collar around his neck if you let me go the majendie will not allow you to go through their land to the big stone house richard gave her a little smile i was hoping that if i helped you get back to your people you would permit us to pass through your land and maybe that you would guide us so that we might reach the palace a sly smile spread on her lips we could kill the witch richard shook his head i dont kill people unless im forced to it would not help anyway i must go to the palace to get my collar off if i dont go there i will die du chaillu looked away from his gaze richard waited while she glanced around her prison i do not know if you speak the truth or if you mean to cut my throat she gently rubbed his arm where she had bitten him but if you kill me i was to be killed anyway and had no chance and at least i will not be mounted any more by those dogs if you tell the truth then i will be free but we must still escape we are still in the land of the majendie richard winked i have a plan at least we can try she frowned at him you could do this thing to me and they would be happy and you could go to the palace you would be safe are you not afraid they will kill you richard nodded but i ammore afraid to live the rest of my life seeing in my mind your pretty eyes and wishing i had helped you she gave him a sidelong glance maybe you are a magic man but you are not a smart man a smart man would want to be safe i am the seeker what is this the seeker its a long story but i guess it means i do my best to see the truth prevail to see right done this sword has magic and it helps me in my quest its called the sword of truth she let out a long breath and finally laid her head back in his lap try then or kill me i was dead anyway richard gave her filthy bare back a pat of reassurance hold still he reached under her neck and wrapped his fingers around the collar holding it tight with his other hand the hand on the hilt the hand through which the magic was coursing into him he gave a mighty heave with a loud crack the iron shattered hot shards of metal ricocheted off the walls one large piece spun like a top in the dirt finally wobbling and falling over silence settled over them he held his breath hoping none of the metal fragments had cut her throat du chaillu sat up her eyes wide she felt her neck finding no injury she broke into a wide grin it is off you got the collar off and my head is still attached richard feigned a touch of indignation i told you i would now we must get away from here come on he led her back through the rooms the way he had come in when he reached the next to last room from where the men waited he held a finger to his lips and told her to be quiet and wait for him to come back for her she folded her arms under her bare breasts why i will go with you you said you would not leave me here richard let out an exasperated breath im going to get you some clothes we cant leave with you with a gesture he indicated her bare condition she unfolded her arms and looked down at herself why what is wrong with me i am not a bad shape to look upon many men have told me what is it with you people he whispered heatedly i have seen more naked people since i left my homeland last autumn than in the whole of my life and not a one of you seems the least little bit she grinned your face is red richard growled through gritted teeth wait here smirking she folded her arms again i will wait in the outer room the four men jumped to their feet when richard came through the carpetcovered opening he didnt give them any time to ask questions where are the womans clothes confused they glanced at one another her clothes why do you want richard took an aggressive stride toward the man who are you to question the spirits do as they say get me her clothes all four flinched back they stared at him briefly and then went to the low chests they set the lamps aside and opened the lids rummaging through the chests tossing clothes aside here i found them one of them said he held up a garment that looked to be finely woven flax differentcolored strips hung in rows from the light brown fabric this is hers he held up a buckskin belt and this too richard snatched them from the mans fist you will wait here he grabbed up a scrap of cloth the men had thrown on the floor as they had searched for the dress he went back through the opening before there was time for any questions du chaillu waited her arms still folded when she saw what he held in his hands she gasped she clutched the dress to her breast tears filled her dark eyes my prayer dress she threw her arms around his neck and raising up on her tiptoes started kissing him all over his face richard mashed her mass of black hair flat against the sides of her head as he pushed her away all right all right put it on hurry grinning at him she pulled the dress over her head poking her arms through the long sleeves up the outside of each arm and across the shoulders was a row of little strips of differentcolored cloth each was knotted on through a small hole beneath a corded band the dress came to just below her knees as she tied the belt at her waist richard noticed the blood still running down to her foot from where the men had stabbed her in the thigh he dropped to one knee before her and motioned with his hands lift it up lift up your dress du chaillu looked down at him she lifted an eyebrow i have just covered myself and now you wish me to uncover richard pursed his lips he waved the strip of cloth at her you are bleeding i need to put this around the wound giggling she raised her skirt and held her leg out rotating it from side to side displaying it in a teasing manner richard quickly wrapped the cloth around her thigh over the gash and jerked the knot tight she yelped with pain he thought it served her right but apologized anyway taking her by the hand he pulled her though the remaining rooms as he passed through the last he growled at the four men to stay where they were still holding du chaillus hand tight he led her back down the alleyway and streets to the open square he saw the heads of the three horses sticking up above the sea of shiny bald heads he plowed his way through the throng toward the horses chapter although his sword sat in its scabbard he was already drawing its magic rage surged into him he summoned it ever onward letting his barriers fall before its advance he was entering a silent world all his own a world of grim committal to what he was bringer of death sister verna paled when she saw him pulling du chaillu after becoming even paler when she saw his demeanor without a word to her richard snatched his bow off the side of his saddle he grunted with the effort of swiftly stretching the bowstring to the bow he yanked two steelbladed arrows from the quiver hanging from bonnies saddle his chest heaved with wrath the crowd had all turned toward him puzzled faces bobbed up as men behind jumped to get a view the women in black all looked up in his direction the queen mother watched sister vernas face was by now bright red richard what do you think richard shoved her back be quiet bow and arrows in hand he leapt up onto his saddle the mumbling fell silent richard directed himself to the queen mother i have spoken with the spirits the back of the queen mothers hand started sliding up the pole toward the bells rope that was all the sign he needed she had been offered a chance the irrevocable commitment had been made he loosed the magic within himself in one swift motion richard nocked an arrow he drew string to cheek he called the target the arrow was away the air hissed with the sound of the arrows flight the crowd gasped before the arrow reached the target while the air still sizzled with its sound richard had the second arrow nocked and on target with a twanging thunk the first arrow made a solid hit deadon where he intended it the queen mother let out a clipped cry of surprise and pain penetrating the space between the two bones in her wrist the arrow pinned her arm to the pole preventing her hand from reaching the bells rope her other hand started over toward the rope the second arrow sat rock solid in the invisible notch in the air on target waiting move toward the bell and the next arrow goes through your right eye the gaggle of women in black fell to their knees wailing the queen mother became still blood trickled down her arm inside storms of anger thundered through him outside he was stone you will hear what the spirits have commanded slowly the queen mother let her free hand drop to her side speak their words then richard still held the bowstring to his cheek and had no intention of letting it relax though the arrow was aimed at one his ire was directed at all magic burned through him at full fury the force of rage pounded through his veins in the past it had always been focused on an enemy someone specific this was different it was openended rage rage at all those present at everyone involved in human sacrifice this was nonspecific wrath that made it worse it drew more magic richard didnt know if it was the allencompassing threat that drew more magic or if it was because of all the practicing he had done with sister verna enabling him to focus but whatever the reason he was calling forth more magic from the sword than he ever had before more than he had known was there the magic seethed with frightening power the very air vibrated with it the men about stepped back the wailing women fell into a hush the queen mothers face was white against the black of her dress a thousand people stood in silent terror of one the spirits wish no more sacrifices it does not prove your devotion to them only that you can kill from now on you must show your respect of the spirits by showing respect for the lives of the baka ban mana if you do not the spirits will vent their wrath by destroying you take their threat to heart or they will bring starvation and death to the majendie he spoke to the men as they pressed forward if any of you makes a move against me or these two women the queen mother dies they all glanced to one another seeking courage you may think to kill me he told them the target not wavering in the slightest but you cannot before the queen mother dies you saw the shot i made my hand is guided by magic i do not miss the men backed away let him be the queen mother called out hear what he has to say i have told you what the spirits have said you will obey she was silent a moment we will consult the spirits ourselves you would insult them you would be admitting you do not heed their words but your own worldly wishes but we must im not here to bargain on their behalf the spirits have ordered i give the sacrificial knife to this woman so she may carry it back to her people to show them that the majendie will no longer hunt them the spirits will warn you of their anger by taking the seed you plant and only when you send representatives to the baka ban mana and tell them you agree to the wishes of the spirits will you be able to plant your crops if you do not follow the spirits wishes you will all starve to death we are leaving now i will have your word that we will be granted safe leave of your land or you will die right now we must consider i grant you until the count of three to give me your decision one two three the queen mother gasped the women in black gasped the crowd gasped what have you decided the queen mother held her free hand up imploring he hold his arrow you may go you have the word of the queen mother that you may leave our land unharmed a wise decision her hand closed into a fist one finger pointing toward them but this is a violation of our agreement with the wisewomen the accord is at an end you must leave our land at once you are banished so be it richard said but keep to your word or you will reap the grim rewards of any imprudent action he released the tension from the bow standing in his stirrups he pulled the sacred knife from his belt and held it up high for all to see this woman will take this back to her people and tell them of the words of the spirits as to their part the baka ban mana may no longer make war on the majendie you may no longer make war on them you will be two peoples at peace neither may harm the other heed the words of the spirits or bear the consequences his voice dropped to a fierce whisper yet the wrath of the magic carried the words to the farthest corners of the square and in the stillness every ear could hear them heed my orders or suffer what i will bring upon you i will lay waste to you magic lay over the square like fog in a valley ethereal yet real a palpable manifestation of his outrage that touched everyone present and all trembled at that touch richard leapt off his horse the men shrank back a few more steps sister verna was speechless with rage he had never seen her in such a state she stood as if paralyzed with her fists out before her richard leveled his glare and his wrath on her get on your horse sister were leaving her jaw looked ready to shatter under the pressure of how tightly it was clenched you are mad we will not richard thrust a finger toward her if you wish to argue with someone sister you may stay and argue with these people im sure they will oblige you im going to the palace fto get this collar off if you want to go with me then get on your horse there is no way we cannot now travel the horn of the majendie land we are banished richard lifted his thumb to du chaillu she will guide us to the palace of the prophets through the baka ban manas land du chaillu folded her arms and gave the sister a selfsatisfied smile sister verna looked from her to richard you truly are mad we cannot richard gritted his teeth with a growl the swords anger still at full fury if you wish to go with me to the palace get on your horse im leaving du chaillu watched as richard stuck the greenhandled knife behind her buckskin belt i have charged you with a responsibility you will live up to it now get up on that horse du chaillu unfolded her arms in sudden worry looking to the horse and back to him she folded her arms again and put her nose in the air i will not ride on that beast it stinks so do you richard roared now get up on that horse she flinched back eyes wide in fright at his glare she swallowed gulping air now i know what a seeker is she scrambled awkwardly up onto geraldine the sister was already atop jessup richard vaulted up onto bonnie with a last warning look at the men gathered he squeezed his horses ribs and she sprang into a gallop the other two horses took out after him the men swept back out of the way the magic hungered for blood raged for it richard wished someone would try to stop him no one did please du chaillu said it is almost dark may we please stop or at least allow me to walk this beast is hurting me she was holding on for dear life bouncing in the saddle as geraldine trotted along the little strips of colored cloth on her dress were all aflutter he could hear sister vernas horse trotting along behind but he didnt look back at her richard glanced up at the sun setting beyond the thick tangle of branches his rage was finally withering with the light for a time it had seemed as if he would never be able to put it down du chaillu pointed past him with her chin to his right afraid to lift a hand there is a small pond there through the reeds and a grassy place before it are you sure we are in baka ban mana land she nodded for the last few hours this is our land i know this place all right we will stop for the night he held her horse for her as she slid off with a groan she rubbed the flats of her hands on her bottom if you make me ride that beast again tomorrow i will bite you for the first time since they had left the majendie he was able to smile as richard went about unsaddling the horses he sent du chaillu to get water in a canvas bucket while she went off through the reeds and rushes to the pond sister verna gathered wood and used her magic to set it afire when he was finished caring for the horses he put them on long tethers so they could graze on the grass i guess introductions are in order richard said when du chaillu returned sister verna this is du chaillu du chaillu this is sister verna sister verna seemed to have cooled or at least put a mask over her anger i am pleased for you du chaillu that you did not have to die this day du chaillu glared richard knew she thought of the sisters of the light as witches i do feel sorrow however the sister added for all those who will die in your place you are not pleased for me you wish me dead you wish all the baka ban mana to die that is not true i wish no one to die but i know i could not convince you of that think what you will du chaillu took the sacrificial knife from her belt and held the handle in front of sister vernas eyes they kept me on that chain for three moons she looked to the green handle and pointed to one of the obscene couplings carved on it those dogs did this to me sister verna glanced to the knife as du chaillu tapped a finger to another scene and this and this too sister verna watched the others chest heaving in ire there is no way i could convince you du chaillu how much i abhor what they did to you and what they intended to do there are many things in this world that i abhor but can do nothing about and in some cases must tolerate in order to serve a greater good du chaillu patted her belly i have lost my moon flow those dogs have put me with child now i must go to the midwives and ask them for herbs to shed the child of a dog sister verna clasped her hands before herself please du chaillu dont do that a child is a gift from the creator please dont reject his gift gift this great creator has a wicked way of bestowing his gifts du chaillu richard said up until now the majendie have killed every baka ban mana they have captured you are the first to be freed they will kill no more think of this child as symbol of the new life between your peoples for that new life for all your children to flourish the killing must stop let the child live it has done no harm the father has done harm richard swallowed children are not necessarily evil just because the father was if the father is evil then the child will be as he that is not true the sister said richards father was an evil man who killed many people yet richard seeks to preserve life his mother knew that the guilt of crimes does not pass beyond the one who commits them she did not spare her love because richards father raped her richard was raised by good people who taught him right because of that you are alive today you can teach the child right du chaillus fury faltered as she looked to richard is this true your mother was treated as i by an evil dog richard could only manage a nod she rubbed her belly i will consider what you say before i decide you have returned my life i will weigh your words richard squeezed her shoulder whatever you decide im sure it will be for the best if she lives long enough to decide sister verna said youve made promises and threats that you cannot fulfill when the majendie plant their crops and nothing happens they will lose their fear of what you have told them today what youve done will count for nothing and they will once again make war on her people to say nothing of mine richard pulled the leather thong with the bird mans whistle off over his head i wouldnt exactly say nothing is going to happen sister something is indeed going to happen he hung the whistle around du chaillus neck this was a gift to me and now my gift to you so that you can stop the killing he held the carved bone up this is a magic whistle it calls birds more birds than youve ever seen in one place before im counting on you to fulfill my promise you are to go to their planting fields keep yourself hidden then at sunset blow on this magic whistle you will hear no sound but the birds will be called by the magic in your mind keep picturing birds think of all the birds you know as you blow on the whistle and keep blowing until they come she touched the carved bone whistle magic the birds will truly come he gave her a onesided smile oh yes theyll come there is no doubt of that the magic will call them no person will hear the sound but the birds will the majendie will not know its you who calls the birds the birds will be hungry and will devour all the seed every time the majendie plant seeds you call the birds and take it away from them she grinned the majendie will starve to death richard put his face close to hers no this is my gift to you to stop the killing not a gift to help you kill you will call the birds to steal their seed until the majendie agree to live in peace with you when they have fulfilled their part of the bargain you must fulfill your part and agree to live in peace with them he put his first finger right in front of her nose if you misuse my gift i will come back and use other magic against your people ive placed my trust in you to do right do not fail my trust du chaillu averted her eyes she gave a little sniff i will do right i will use your gift as you say she tucked the whistle into her dress thank you for helping to bring peace to my people thats my greatest hope peace peace sister verna huffed she directed a smoldering glare to richard you think its so simple you think that after three thousand years you can simply decree that the killing will stop you think all it takes is your mere presence and the ways of people will change you are a naive child though the crimes of the father do not pass on to the son you have a simplistic way of seeing things that brings harm just the same if you think sister that i would be a party to human sacrifices for any reason you are seriously mistaken he started to turn away but then turned back what harm have i brought what killing have i started she leaned toward him well for one thing if we dont help ones with the gift like you it will kill them as it would kill you how do you propose we get those boys to the palace we can no longer cross the majendies land she glanced to du chaillu she has only given you permission to pass through her land she has not said we may bring others through she straightened those boys will die because of what you have done richard thought about it a moment he was exhausted using the swords magic had wearied him as it never had before he wanted nothing more than to sleep he didnt feel like solving problems or arguing at last he looked to du chaillu when you make peace with the majendie before you let them plant once again you must add another condition you must tell them that in honor of the killing being brought to an end in honor of the peace they will let the sisters cross their land she watched his eyes a moment before she finally nodded your people will do the same he narrowed his eyes at the sister satisfied in the valley when you struck down a beast a thousand snakes sprang forth from its corpse this is no different it would be impossible she said for me to accurately recall all the lies youve told today ive reprimanded you before for lying and cautioned you not to do it again i told you not to swing the axe today and you did it anyway despite my warning i can scarcely tally all the commands youve managed to violate in this one day what youve done has not finished the killing but only begun it in this sister i am the seeker not your student as seeker i have no tolerance for human sacrifice none the deaths of others are a separate issue you cannot use it as a link to justify murder there will be no compromise in this and i dont think you want to punish me for stopping something i would wager you wish had been stopped long ago the muscles in her face relaxed as a sister of the light i have no power to change things and under obligation to save more lives i had to uphold what has been for three thousand years but i admit i hated it and in a way im glad you have taken it out of my hands but that does not negate the trouble it will cause or the deaths when you put the radahan on you told me that holding the leash to that collar would be worse than wearing it your words are proving true her lower eyelids filled with glistening moisture you have made my greatest love my calling a misery i am past wanting to punish you for your disobedience in a few days we will be at the palace and i will at last be finished with you they will have to deal with you we shall see how they handle you when you displease them i believe you will find they are not prepared to be as tolerant as i have been they will use that collar and when they do i also think they will come to regret holding your leash more than do i i think they will come to regret trying to help you as do i richard put his hands in his back pockets as he stared off at the thick forest of oak and leather leaf im sorry you feel that way sister but i guess i can understand it although i admit i have fought being your prisoner what happened today was not about you and me this was about what is right as one who would wish to teach me i hoped you would share that moral stance i hoped the sisters would not want to teach the use of the gift to one who could easily bend his convictions to the circumstance sister verna i was not trying to displease you i simply could not live with myself if i had allowed a murder to take place under my nose much less if i had participated in it i know richard but that only makes it worse because its all one and the same she unclasped her hands and peered about at the fire and their supplies finally pulling a cake of soap from a saddlebag ill make a stew and bannock she tossed the cake of soap to him du chaillu needs a bath du chaillu folded her arms in a huff while i was chained to a wall the dogs who came to mount me did not offer me water so i would smell pretty for you sister verna squatted down pulling supplies out i meant no offense du chaillu i simply thought you would want to wash the dirt of those men off you if it were me i would want nothing more than to try to wash the feel of their hands from my flesh du chaillus indignation faltered well of course i would she snatched the soap from richard you smell of that beast you ride you will wash too or i will not want to be near you and will send you off to eat by yourself richard chuckled if it will keep the peace with you ill wash too as du chaillu marched off toward the pond sister verna called quietly to him he waited next to her while she pulled a pot from a saddlebag her people have been killing any magic man they could get their hands on for the last three thousand years there is no time to give you history lessons she looked up to his eyes old habits spring to hand as easily as a knife dont turn your back on her sooner or later she is going to try to kill you her quiet tone unexpectedly raised bumps on his flesh ill try to keep myself alive sister so you can deliver me to the palace and at last be free of your onerous charge richard hurried toward the pond and caught up with du chaillu as she was walking through the reeds why did you call that your prayer dress du chaillu held her arms out letting the breeze ruffle the strips of cloth on her dress these are prayers what are prayers you mean the strips of cloth she nodded each is a prayer when the wind blows and they fly each sends a prayer to the spirits and what do you pray for every one of these prayers is the same from the heart of the person who gave me their prayer they are all prayers to have our land returned to us your land but you are in your land no this is where we live but it is not our land many ages ago our land was taken by the magic men they banished us here they reached the edge of the pond puffs of breeze drew up ripples in dark patches the bank was grassy with thick patches of rushes to each side extending out into the water the magic men took your land what land they took our land from our ancestors she pointed in the direction of the valley of the lost the land on the other side of the majendie i was going to our land with our prayers to ask the spirits if they would help our land be returned to us but the majendie caught me and i was not able to take our prayers to the spirits how will the spirits return your land to you she shrugged the old words say only that we must send one every year to our land to pray to the spirits and if we do our land will be returned she untied her belt and slipped it to the ground with unsettling grace she tossed the greenhandled knife aside sticking it in the round end of a branch on a log how she gave him a curious frown by sending us our master i thought you were the baka ban mana those without masters she shrugged because the spirits have not sent us one yet while richard was puzzling over this she reached down took hold of her dress and pulled it off over her head what do you think youre doing she frowned it is me that i must wash not my dress well not in front of me she looked down at herself you have already seen me i have not grown any different since this morning she looked up at him your face is red again over there he pointed go on the other side of the rushes you on one side and me on the other he turned his back to her but we have only one soap well you can throw it to me when youre through she came around to the front of him he tried to turn again but she followed him around grabbing at his buttons i cannot scrub my own back and it is not fair you have seen me so i should see you that is why you are turning red because you have not been fair this will make you feel better he slapped her hands away stop it du chaillu where i come from this is not proper men and women do not bathe together its just not done he turned his back to her again not even my third husband is as shy as you third you have had three husbands no i have five richard stiffened have he turned to her what do you mean have she looked at him as if he had asked if trees grew in the forest i have five husbands five husbands and my children and how many of those do you have three two girls and a boy a wistful smile came to her it is a long time since i have held them her smile turned sad my poor babies will have cried every night thinking i am dead no one ever returned from the majendie before she grinned my husbands will be anxious to draw lots to see who will be the first to try to give me another child her smile faded and her voice trailed off but i guess a majendie dog has already done that richard handed her the soap it will all turn out fine youll see go bathe ill go on the other side of the rushes he relaxed in the cool water listening to her splash waiting for her to finish with the soap a mist thickened over the pond stealing slowly silently into the surrounding trees ive never heard of a woman having more than one husband do all the baka ban mana women have more than one husband she giggled no only me why you the water stopped splashing because i wear the prayer dress she said as if it should be selfevident richard rolled his eyes well what does she came swimming through the rushes toward him before you can have the soap you must wash my back richard let out an aggravated sigh all right if i wash your back will you then go back on your side she presented her back to him if you do a proper job when she was satisfied she finally went back to get dressed while he washed she told him over the chirp of bugs and the trill of frogs that she was hungry he was pulling his pants on while she called for him to hurry so they could eat he threw his shirt over his shoulder and ran to catch up with her as she headed toward the smell of cooking she looked much better clean her hair looked like a normal persons instead of a wild animals she looked no more like a savage but somehow noble it wasnt dark yet but getting close to it the mist that had formed over the pond was drifting in around them from behind the trees were disappearing in the gathering fog as the two of them stepped into the ring of light around the fire sister verna stood richard was putting his right arm through his sleeve when he froze at the wideeyed look on sister vernas face she was staring at his chest at the thing he had never let her see before at the scar at the handprint burned there at the handprint that was a constant reminder of who fathered him sister verna was as white as a spirit her voice was so soft he had to strain to hear her where did you get that du chaillu was staring at the scar too richard pulled his shirt closed i told you before darken rahl burned me with his hand you said i was only having visions her gaze slowly rose to meet his her eyes were filled with something he had never seen in them before unbridled fear richard she whispered you must not show anyone at the palace what you have upon you except the prelate she may know what to do you must show her but no one else she stepped closer do you understand no one richard slowly buttoned his shirt why because if you do they will kill you that is the mark of the nameless one her tongue wet her lips sins of the father from the distance came the plaintive howl of wolves du chaillu shuddered and hugged herself as she stared off into the deepening fog people will die tonight du chaillu whispered richard frowned at her what are you talking about wolves when wolves howl like that in the mist they are foretelling that people are to die violently in the night in the mist chapter they materialized out of fog and mist the white fangs of death the startled prey at first immobilized by bonechilling fright jumped to flee before the white death fangs of white steel ripped into them without mercy as they bolted for their lives death squeals tore the night air with their terror hysteria sent them running heedlessly onto the waiting cold white steel fearless men tasted fear before they died pandemonium spread on a wild uproar of noise the ringing chime of steel the splintering of wood the ripping of canvas the groan of leather the pop of bones the whoosh of fire the crash of wagons the thuds of flesh and bone hitting ground and the screams of man and beast all joined into one long cacophony of terror the wave of white death drove the tumult before it the sharp smell of blood washed through the air over the sweet aroma of blazing wood the acrid tang of igniting lamp oil the smoky smack of flaming pitch and the gagging stench of burning fur and flesh what wasnt wet with the cold mist was greasyslick with hot blood the white steel fangs now were coated with blood and gore white snow became a soggy mat of red splashes the cold air was seared by gouts of flame that leapt up to turn the white fog an incandescent orange sinister dark clouds of smoke hugged the ground while the sky burned overhead arrows zipped past spears arced through the air splintered lances spun away into the mist and severed pike heads whirled off into the darkness remnants of torn tents flapped and fluttered as if battered by a furious storm swords rose and fell in waves driven by the grunts that accompanied frantic effort men ran in every direction like frenzied ants some tumbled to the ground spilling their viscera across the snow one of the wounded blinded by blood stumbled aimlessly until a white shadow swept by a spirit of death cutting him down a wagon wheel bounced past its progress quickly obscured from view by dark curtains of acrid smoke that drifted past no alarm had been raised the sentries were long dead few in camp had realized what was happening until it was upon them the camp of the imperial order had lately been a place of noise and wild celebration and for many in their drunken state it was hard to tell that anything of consequence was happening many of the men poisoned by the bandu in the ale lay sick around fires many were so weak they burned to death without trying to escape flaming tents others were in such a drunken stupor that they actually smiled at the men who drove swords through their guts even the ones who were not drunk or who were not drunk to the point of dullness didnt truly appreciate what was happening their camp was often a place of raucous noise and confusion huge bonfires roared throughout the night for warmth and as gathering places they were generally the only reference points in the disorderly layout so the fires of destruction caused little concern except in the immediate area among dharans fighting in the camps was simply part of the revelry and men screaming when they were stabbed in altercations was not noteworthy what one had was only his if he was fierce enough to keep it from others who were always ready to take it alliances among dharans were shifting sands that could last a lifetime or more commonly for as little as an hour when a new alliance became more advantageous or profitable the drinking and the poison dulled their grasp of the sheer volume of screams in battle they were disciplined but when not in battle they were ungoverned to the point of anarchy pay for dharans on expeditions was in large part a share of the plunder they had looted ebinissia despite all their talk of a new law and having that new plunder made them perhaps less than singleminded in their devotion to duty at battle or the first sound of an alarm they became a single unified fighting machine almost an entity of one mind but in camp without the overriding purpose of war they became thousands of individuals all bent on serving their own selfinterest without an alarm to warn them they paid the added noise and screaming little attention above the noise of their own business trading stories laughter drinking gambling fighting and whoring the unheralded battle a short distance away went largely unnoticed the officers would call them if needed without that call to duty their life was their own and someone elses troubles were not theirs they were unprepared when the white death materialized the sight of white spirits appearing among them was a paralyzing force many a man wailed in fear of the shahari spirits many envisioned that the separation between the world of the living and the world of the dead had evaporated or that they had somehow been suddenly cast into the underworld without the ale both poisoned and unadulterated it might not be so as it was the drink and their confidence in their numbers and strength left them vulnerable as they would never be again but not all were drunk or dull some rose up fiercely kahlan watched it all from atop her dancing warhorse in a sea of raw unbridled emotion she wore her confessors face these men were neither moral nor ethical they were animals who lived by no rule but might they had raped the women at the palace and had mercilessly butchered the people of ebinissia from the aged down to newborn babes a man lunged through the ring of steel around her grabbing at her saddle for support he gaped at her crying a prayer for mercy from the good spirits she split his skull kahlan wheeled her horse to face sergeant cullen have we captured the command tents the sergeant signaled and one of the white naked men ran off to check as they drove deeper into the camp of the order when she spotted the horses she gave the signal from behind she heard the sound of galloping hooves and the sharp rattle of chains scythes of death come to reap a crop of the living with a sound like a boy running past a picket fence with a stick in hand the chain scythes being pulled at a full charge reaped a snapping of bone that meshed into a long clacking roar the beasts screams and the dull thuds as they slammed the ground drowned out the sound of galloping hooves and breaking bone even the drunken enemy turned from the white spirits to stare at the ghastly spectacle it was the last thing they saw men stumbled from their tents to watch without understanding what it was that was occurring before their eyes others wandered aimlessly mugs in hand as if at a fair drunkenly looking from one sight to another there were so many some had to wait a bit for their turn to die some were not drunk and saw not spirits but men painted white they saw an attack and understood wellhoned blades coming for them a pocket of fierce counterattack was surrounded and broken but not without cost kahlan rallied her men and drove her wedge of white steel deeper into the heart of the enemys camp she saw two men on huge draft horses she couldnt see who they were having cut down all the horses they could find take to charging down a line of tents reaping havoc as well as helpless men the chain caught something as solid as bedrock it whipped the horses around into a brutal collision the riders went down men with swords and axes swarmed over them a man with sword to hand and sober she was alarmed to note appeared suddenly next to her leg he looked up with a fierce glare his sharp eyes made her feel suddenly nothing more than a naked woman sitting on a horse he took all of her in what the a foot of steel erupted from his breastbone driving a grunt from his lungs mother confessor the naked man behind yanked his sword free and pointed with it the command tents are over there a movement to the other side caught her attention with a backhanded swing she caught the side of a stumbling drunks neck lets go to the command tents now her men abandoned the enemy they were decimating to follow her as she jumped nick over men and fires and crumpled wagons as they followed they didnt stop to slaughter the confused panicked and drunken dharans everywhere but cut down those they could if it didnt slow their pace where necessary they engaged the sporadic resistance the large command tents were surrounded by her white galeans they held a small group of about fifteen men at swordpoint before them lay a neat row of at least thirty bodies on their backs in the snow others of her men were throwing battle standards and flags atop a large pile already smoldering and burning in the fire empty casks lay scattered in the snow when their army had come under attack the commanders had issued no orders the army of the imperial order was without benefit of direction lieutenant sloan pointed with his sword to the line of bodies these officers were already dead the poison did its work these others were still alive although not in the best of health they were all lying about in their tents we could hardly get them up they asked us for rum if you can believe it weve held them like you said kahlan surveyed the faces of the bodies in the snow she didnt see what she wanted she looked to the faces of the captured officers he wasnt there either she directed her confessors face to a keltish officer at the end of the line wheres riggs he glared at her and then spat kahlan lifted her gaze to the man holding him she drew her finger across her throat he didnt hesitate the officer went down in a heap she looked to the next officer wheres riggs his eyes darted about i dont know kahlan drew her finger across her throat as he went down she looked to the next man a dharan commander wheres riggs his eyes were wide but not at the two bleeding bodies beside him his horror was for her a spirit before him he wet his lips he was hurt by the mother confessor i mean by you before his voice trembled when you were alive where is he he winced shaking his head vigorously i dont know great spirit he was hurt his face was cut by the horse he is being tended to by the surgeons i dont know where their tents are who knows where the surgeons tents are most trembled and shuddered as they shook their heads kahlan stepped her horse down the line of officers she stopped before one she knew general karsh i am very pleased to see you again wheres riggs wouldnt tell you if i knew he grinned as he leered up at her you look better naked than i fancied why are you whoring with this lot we could do you better than these boys the man holding him twisted his arm until he cried out show respect for the mother confessor you keltish pig respect for a whore holding a sword never kahlan leaned toward him these boys have you under their blades every one is a better man than you i would say you wanted war karsh you have your wish you have war now a real war not a slaughter of women and children but a war led by me the mother confessor a woman war without quarter she sat up straight in her saddle letting his eyes linger on her breasts i have a message karsh a message for the keeper you will be with him presently tell him i said to make plenty of room im sending all his disciples home her gaze swept down the line of men holding the officers she drew her finger across her throat in a quick gesture the response was just as quick as the bodies tumbled forward she cried out her hand darting to her neck a stinging pain jolted her it was in the exact same place it was the pain of darken rahls lips on her neck the pain she had felt when he had come to them in the spirit house when he had burned richard with his hand when he had kissed her neck and silently promised her unimaginable horrors men rushed forward mother confessor what is it she took her hand away blood coated her white fingers she couldnt say how she knew but she knew without doubt that the blood was drawn by the perfect snow white teeth of darken rahl mother confessor theres blood on your neck its nothing im all right i must have just been nicked by an arrow thats all she gathered her wits and courage put the head of every officer on a pole for all their men to see to let them know they are without leaders and hurry by the time the last dripping head was hoisted up dharans were pouring in from all sides most were drunk laughing as if it were nothing more than a drunken brawl but inefficient and clumsy as they were their numbers were alarming they were like a swarm of bees for every one knocked down ten replaced him her men fought fiercely but they were no match for the overwhelming numbers sweeping in men she had talked to reassured inspired yelled at and smiled to were falling with cries of pain and terror they had been here too long ahead a pitched battle erupted the galeans were being driven back if they were driven back they had no chance of escape they couldnt go back the way they had come back to men who would have had time to have been sobered by the carnage around them to gather their senses and their spirit without surprise they were nothing but a bunch of naked boys and one woman if they tried a second time what had worked once they would all die they had to cleave their way through the order to the other side of the valley dharans hacked in at the white forms her ankle was grasped by a powerful hand she hewed it off and shook her foot to shed the disembodied hand they were in danger of being swallowed into the belly of this beast disregarding the death cries of her men disregarding her promise not to leave the protective ring of the fiercest galean swordsmen disregarding her promise not to deliberately put herself into peril kahlan charged nick into the thick of the battle and beyond into the enemy her sword stabbed to each side into any enemy close enough teeth gritted she swung at flesh and bone her wrist tingled from the jarring impacts and her arm was so weary she feared she would not be able to lift the sword much longer frightened that she would be taken down her men poured ahead toward her with renewed resolve they drove the dark wave back rolling over it as she urged her horse forward into the sea of dark leather uniforms she stood in the stirrups holding her sword high for ebinissia for her dead for her spirit it had the desired effect men of the order who were confused by the white enemy but were nonetheless determined to crush them whatever they were stopped and stared openly at a white naked woman atop a horse suddenly in their midst their faith that the attack was from men and not spirits faltered they gaped in open astonishment she swept her gaze around at all the eyes peering up at her she swung the white sword in a circle over her head as a breeze ruffled her white hair back off her shoulders in the name of their spirits i have come to avenge them leatherclad men fell to their knees dropping their swords pressing prayerful hands together they held those hands up to her they wailed for protection they called for her mercy they cried for forgiveness had they been sober she wondered would the illusion be so convincing as it was the effect was apocalyptic we grant no quarter as all faces stared up toward her as eyes shed tears of trepidation weapons set upon them from behind the sudden violent merciless wave of hard steel terrified them convinced them that the spirits would have them all they broke and ran dropping weapons screaming in fear of the underworld they had done what they had come to do time was now against them they needed to escape they charged onward a deadly swift river of white that poured over and around the tents and fires and wagons and men surprising ever more of the lethargic enemy killing as many as they could while rolling ahead white death moved into the mist once again kahlan glanced behind and saw the pairs of draft horses their riders holding the chains up between them she waved them into the stream of white urging them to move faster they started unhooking one end of the chains from the hame hooks and looping the chain over the horn on the other horse to give each horse freedom now that they needed to make a quick escape in the distance in the fog to the right she saw a line of picketed horses she saw brin and peter come together snap the end of the chain over the other hook again and urge daisy and pip into gallops she thought to scream at them to order them to keep with the others that they couldnt hope to get them all that they had done enough and must leave now that it was too late but she knew they wouldnt hear her brin dropped the loops of chain they spread the horses to pull the steel taut as they peeled away toward the picket line of horses the hooves of the big horses thundered across the ground she took a last look at brin and peter knowing it would be the last time she ever looked upon them in this world and then turned her attention ahead she pointed with her sword there are the rest of the supply wagons the men knew what to do as she charged the column past the wagons were doused with lamp oil wheels were staved in and torches thrown the wagons erupted in flame more torches set fire to tents the men brought awake by the noise and fire found blades sweeping at them the fires faded into an orange glow in the mist behind as they plunged onward into the fog suddenly they broke free of the camp and were in open snow now that they were away from the camp and its fires the darkness pressed around them the men in front faltered looking about as they jogged scouts forward she yelled where are the scouts two men charged through the ranks to the fore pointing out the direction of the pass they sought she looked for the others turning from side to side none came she galloped nick to the van after the two scouts where are the others they were ordered to be in the lead the round wet eyes that looked up at her answered her question without words all right she said you two know the way get us out of here fifty men had scouted the pass they wanted fifty to be sure there would be a good number left to show the way two were left with a silent growl she cursed the spirits shamefaced she called the curse back they had at least left her those two without them they would be left to wander in the fog freezing and vincible to the men of the order chasing them she pulled nick to a halt beside the stream of naked men she swooped her arm frantically move move move run curse you run theyll be on top of us the men on the draft horses brin and peter not among them came abreast of her drivers watch for the scout ahead hell show you the stakes to follow they nodded that they remembered men in dharan uniforms with white cloth swatches sewn into their epaulets to show that they were in fact the galean men who had infiltrated the enemy camp in the uniforms of the sentries ran past dont forget to pull up the stakes before you get up on the horses they were to double or triple up on the draft horses and ride to one of the other small camps established around the enemy earlier in the day they had made trails all over the valley so that without the sticks stuck in the snow to mark the proper trail none would know the way to those camps the trail through the snow from all the men on foot would be easy for the enemy to follow but they had plans to take care of that in the distance back toward the order she saw the rear guard engaged in a pitched battle lieutenant sloan was supposed to keep that from happening and keep the rear moving cursing anew she galloped her horse back without pause she charged between the two forces spun and charged through again separating the two sides the leatherclad dharans fell back at the sight of the white spirit woman atop a white horse she waded in among the galeans whats the matter with you you know the orders run or you wont make it the men started moving trying to drag a body with them wheres lieutenant sloan hes supposed to be back here the men nodded to the body they were dragging the side of the head was gone and she could see the exposed brain it was lieutenant sloan the dharans charged in again she pulled the reins and nick reared the dharans fell back once more hes dead leave him run run you idiots if any of you stops again for anything ill make you fight the rest of this war naked now run this time they took off in earnest kicking up snow running for their lives again she swept past the line of drunken dharans causing them to stumble backward and fall over one another in panic she had to stall these men to give her own time to gain enough of a lead she ran nick through the dharans trampling those who got in the way the men scattered in momentary dread of the white spirit woman some calling to the spirits for protection but others came back swinging weapons if they caught nicks legs she fought back with her sword and her warhorse as they closed around her her men were fading into the fog run she bid them run she swung the sword at men who reached out the next time she glanced back she saw nothing but dark fog and mist she was losing her sense of direction as she wheeled nick around charging at the men trying to buy her own men the time they needed to escape she tried to break away but the enemy swarmed around her with more coming all the time some yelled at the others that she was just a woman and not a spirit and they werent going to let a woman get away she felt more naked than she had felt all night men threw themselves around nicks legs and although he reared and kicked them off even more took their place staggering the big horse with their weight kahlan hacked furiously at the men shearing off arms splitting skulls and stabbing bodies with a sea of men all around her she suddenly realized that her situation was untenable she knew that if they got her off her horse she was finished and her horse was being hobbled try as she might she couldnt get the men away for the first time that night she truly feared she wasnt going to make it she was going to die here in the snow in this mistshrouded valley she would never see richard again she felt an abrupt icy pain in the bite on her neck darken rahls bite she thought she heard quiet laughter in the air she slashed away at the men grabbing for her powerful fingers clutched her legs the pain of those fingers urged her into frantic stabbing nick managed to spin the mens feet flying outward but they held on tight she slashed and hacked the arms more caught hold of her horses bit taking control from her a horse was valuable plunder and they didnt want it killed as long as they thought they were in control of the situation a big soldier grabbed the horn of her saddle dragging himself up dont kill her its the mother confessor dont kill her she must be alive when shes beheaded she slashed the side of his neck a fountain of hot blood gushed across her thigh another yelled dont kill her bring the bitch down a cheer went up from the reaching men she swung at the grasping hands fingers raked her legs eyes all around leered up at her she slashed wildly as nick stumbled sideways trying to pull his head free but the men held his bit tight a man leapt up from behind and snatched her by the hair she let out a cry as he yanked her backward off the saddle hands grappled her as she tumbled to the ground everyone went down in a pile under her big hands seized her by her legs her waist her ankles and her breasts fingers wrapped around the blade trying to wrench it from her she twisted the hilt severing the fingers she swung and stabbed ferociously bodies pressed her to the cold ground pressed the wind from her lungs she bit the fingers covering her mouth a huge fist struck her across the jaw they finally seized her flailing arms there were too many dear richard i love you chapter kahlan struggled to draw a breath but with the weight of men on her she couldnt tears stung her eyes more men piled on a beefy elbow in her middle pressed into her feeling as if it would squash her in two drunken breath bathed her face her vision dwindled to a small spot everything around the center was going black and the center was shrinking she swallowed a mouthful of blood her own she heard what sounded like the distant rumble of thunder at first she could only feel the vibration in her back against the ground but then the sound swelled growing louder sharper the screams of men reached her ears some of the men over her looked up their weight lifted a bit and she sucked air into her lungs it was the sweetest breath she had ever drawn as the giant of a man atop her the one who had struck her face turned to the sound of thunder turned his fierce eye from her she saw that his other had a scar across it and down his cheek that empty eye was sewn shut somehow her left hand squirmed free she seized his throat she heard a metallic rattle the thunder she suddenly realized was horses hooves erupting out of the fog brin and peter atop daisy and pip galloped at a full charge down the line of dharans mowing them down with the chain they raced toward her like a landslide felling trees the men stared in frozen shock kahlans fingers clutched around the oneeyed mans throat and then she released her power the magic slammed into him thunder without sound rattled all the chain mail the staggering jolt made the men flinch back they all cried out with the pain of being so close as the magic was loosed a ring of snow lifted sweeping outward in a circle nick was standing over her and he jumped with the pain too his hind leg came down on a mans head right next to her ear bone crunched under the weight hot blood and gore splattered the side of her face the one eye of the man above her gaped at her mistress he whispered please command me protect me she screamed he sat up abruptly his massive muscles bulging he held the hair of a man in each fist he tossed them back as if they were mere children her sword arm was free she swung at a man to the other side the blade ruining his face the oneeyed man roared as he tossed men aside the draft horses rushed onward at a full charge she was free of the hands she leaped to her feet the chain was almost upon them help me up on my horse the oneeyed man grabbed her ankle in his big fist and with one arm boosted her up into the saddle somehow she still had the sword in her hand she leaned forward and swung it at the man holding the bit holding his prize the swords tip sliced open the side of his face and half the length of his arm he staggered back with a shriek she snatched up the reins the oneeyed man bellowed as he lopped off heads and ripped open chests with his huge war axe go mistress escape orsk will protect you im going run orsk dont let them get you the dharans abandoned her and her horse to turn to the new threats orsk and the chain she thumped nicks ribs with her heels urging him into a gallop just as brin and peter caught up with her she stuffed her bare feet into the stirrups as the three of them raced away she spotted the trail that hundreds of feet had left in the snow and followed it across the valley into the mist leaving the men of the army of the order to collect their wits it took them mere seconds they charged after her there were more than enough still alive thousands peter unhooked the chain that must have broken hundreds of bones and necks the end of the chain bounced behind brins bony fingers drew in the dragging slack and coiled it over the hame as she galloped into the night she thought she could hear the sound of soft laughter fading behind she shivered with the memory of the kiss darken rahl had left on her neck she felt suddenly very naked again though the mist was icy cold feeling like sparkling flecks all over her she was sweating blood ran from her swollen lip i never thought i would see you two again she yelled over the sound of hooves brin and peter in their toobig coats grinned in the darkness we told you we could do the job brin said she smiled for the first time that night you two are a marvel she just caught sight of the hindquarters of the other draft horses disappearing into the fog she pointed there are your men good luck with a wave they turned away from her she galloped on alone and a short distance later caught up with the men on foot she first saw only one he had a horrific gash on his leg and had fallen far behind she knew she should leave him she knew she should the dharans were right behind as she rode up to him he turned his head up as he struggled through the snow he knew she had to leave him those were the orders her orders keep up or be left behind no exceptions as she rode by she leaned over extending her arm down they clasped wrists and she yanked him up behind her hold on soldier he held his arms out trying to balance as the horse ran afraid to touch her but where around my waist put your arms around my waist he still held his arms out as he bounced but havent you ever put your arms around a woman before yes but she had clothes on he whined do it or youll fall off and im not coming back for you reluctantly carefully he put his arms around her waist stiffly trying to keep them away from anything important or unfamiliarly exotic kahlan gave the back of his hands a pat of reassurance when you brag about this dont make it more than it is he let out a small worried groan that made her smile as they rode on she could feel his warm blood running down the back of her leg dripping from her toes in the stirrup she could hear the shouts of the enemy chasing behind he was losing a lot of blood in exhaustion he laid his head against the back of her shoulder if they didnt tie his wound closed he would bleed to death in short order she was naked and had nothing to use as a bandage even if they had the time to stop hold the wound closed with a hand she said clamp it closed as tight as you can and hold fast to me with your other arm i dont want you falling off he took one arm from her waist and held the gash closed as she rode right on the heels of the men at the end of the line they were cold and fatigued the men of the order were not far behind as she looked back they came into sight she was shocked by the numbers they hooted and hollered run run or we will be caught a wall of rock with scraggly trees growing from cracks and clefts loomed up before them the men ran up the narrow pass as if their lives depended on it and they did as they began the climb up the rift she rang the flat of her sword three times on the rock giving the signal a man ahead turned as he ran were not there yet its too soon well be caught along with the enemy then you better run faster if we wait too long they will get through too she rapped the rock wall three more times the ringing sound carrying into the dark damp air she hoped it would work there of course had been no way to perform a test the men ahead scrambled up the trail nicks hooves slipped in places on the snowcovered rock at first she could only feel it a rumbling deep in her chest too low to hear but too powerful not to be felt she looked up along the mistslicked rock that disappeared above into the dark and fog she couldnt see it yet but she could feel it she hoped the man was wrong that it wouldnt be too soon when she heard the battle cries of the men coming from behind she knew they had no choice and then she could hear it a booming roar as if the ground itself were moving she could hear tree trunks snapping the thundering growl reverberated off the surrounding mountain walls the ground vibrated run cant you run any faster do you want to be buried alive run she knew they were going as fast as they could but they were on foot and from atop her horse it seemed painfully slow deadly slow overhead the rumbling roar grew louder as uncountable tons of snow crashed down toward them she was thrilled that the men on top had been successful in starting an avalanche on command but she was also terrified that she had given the command too soon a lump of wet snow slapped her face another smacked her shoulder little clods rattled through the trees above them and bounced out over the edge a cloud of fluffy snow misted her face the roar was deafening a flow of thundering white sluiced over the ledge above they drove through it like running through a waterfall behind her a tree trunk bounced on the trail spinning out over the precipice they just cleared the leading edge of the bulk of snow the men of the imperial order behind were not so lucky the plunging snow charged with timber and boulders cascaded down with evergathering power they were swept away in the tumbling white death the fury of sound muffled the screams of men it carried away rolling them into the pounding slide burying them alive kahlan sagged with relief they could not be followed now the pass was entombed the panting men slowed but they couldnt slow too much or they would freeze their pace kept them warm their feet she knew despite being wrapped in white cloth for a little protection were not warm they had given her their best effort they had given the midlands their best effort many had given their lives kahlan was so exhausted from lack of sleep as well as the fatigue of battle along with the emotional drain of fright and the effort required to use her power that she could hardly stay upright soon she told herself she could rest soon she patted the hand on her stomach we made it soldier were safe now yes mother confessor he whispered groggily mother confessor im sorry for what i only killed seventeen im sorry i promised myself id get twenty i only got seventeen he mumbled i know heroes of battle decorated men who have not bested half that number in combat you have made me proud you have made the midlands proud feel only pride soldier he mumbled something she couldnt understand she patted his hand again youll be to help soon hold on youll be fine he didnt answer she looked behind down the trail and saw only white and heard only silence in the distant dark mountains a wolf yipped a short time later on a high plateau they reached the camp the men ahead in the line were already wrapped in blankets as they shivered around fires warming their feet some were pulling on their clothes under the blankets more men threw blankets around the men coming in ahead of her and tended the wounded some of the wounded were groaning in pain feeling it for the first time now that the heady furor of combat and escape had evaporated she began to feel a throbbing in her lip in the flickering light of small fires she could see prindin and tossidin some distance away running around searching the new arrivals when they saw her on the horse they both sighed with relief giving her twin smiles captain ryan dressed in a dharan uniform and with a bandage around his left hand ran over other men took the reins and yet others extended their hands to take the man behind her as she held him by an elbow lowering the limp form down prindin ran to meet her her mantle in hand he stood holding it open for her waiting for her to dismount so he could put it around her shoulders he grinned at her without moving from the saddle she slowly extended her hand i have had enough eyes on my flesh to last me the rest of my life throw it up here prindin shrugged selfconsciously and tossed the mantle up to her tossidin swatted the back of his brothers head silence fell over the gathered men they all looked away in embarrassment as she put the mantle around her shoulders and tied it she slid down finding her legs barely up to the task of holding her she used the sword still in her hand as a cane she had to pause a moment until everything stopped spinning she glanced to the man lying in the snow at her feet why isnt someone helping this man dont just stand there help him no one moved i said help him captain ryan stepped closer to her he kept his eyes on the ground im sorry mother confessor hes dead her hand tightened into a fist hes not dead i was just talking to him no one moved she beat her free fist against his chest hes not dead hes not everyone looked away no one said anything she finally glanced at the men around the small fires at all the hanging heads her hand fell to her side he killed seventeen of them she said to captain ryan he killed seventeen of them she said louder to the rest of them captain ryan nodded he did well we are all proud of him she watched the faces as they all finally came up forgive me all of you please forgive me you have all done a good job the fury had gone out of her you have all made me proud you are heroes in my eyes and in the eyes of the midlands the men brightened a bit some went back to eating while others started passing around tin bowls and spooned beans from pots on the fires some tore off chunks of flat camp bread to dunk in the beans wheres chandalen she asked as she pushed her feet into the boots tossidin handed her he went with the archers i imagine that hes probably shooting arrows into dharans right now captain ryan leaned toward her as the brothers moved away and lowered his voice im glad these three are on our side you should have seen them taking out the sentries prindin especially is like death itself with that troga of his it was eerie the way they were first here and then over there and you never even saw them move i never heard a thing they just appeared with the sentries uniforms you should see them do that out in the opengrassland in broad daylight kahlan looked him up and down she managed a small smile quite handsome you wear it well he pulled at his shoulder i dont know how they wear this heavy mail all the time he fingered a slash in the leather but i was glad to have it on how did everything go how many men did you lose we got nearly everything we went after in these uniforms we didnt have to do much fighting hardly anyone noticed us except the ones we killed we only lost a few men he glanced back over his shoulder looks like you caught the worst of it i took a rough count as you came in we lost close to four hundred of the thousand swordsmen who went in she stared past him at the men around the fires we came close to losing them all she brought her attention back to the captain but they did themselves proud the drivers too he cradled his bandaged hand from the ones i talked to i dont think many took less than ten of the enemy and many took a lot more we took quite a chunk out of the orders hide kahlan swallowed they took quite a chunk out of ours did the men do like i told them he asked did they keep trouble away from you they kept the enemy so far from me i couldnt tell you what they looked like im afraid i wasnt able to add much honor to your sword though it was a comfort to have along i pray you will at least be honored that i carried it in battle he frowned leaning to the side trying to get a better look at her face in the firelight your lip looks cut he glanced at her warhorse as the men were taking the tack off that horse is covered in blood youre covered in blood too arent you it was an accusation not a question kahlan stared off at a fire some drunk threw something at me it cut my lip that wounded soldier i was bringing in bled to death on my horse and on me her eyes drifted among the young faces around fires i wish i could have done half as well they they were magnificent he grunted suspiciously im just relieved to see you is everything else in order the archers the cavalry we must make the best use of our opportunity while theyre drunk and sick with the poison we must make the most of this weather too we cant let up for a moment one lightning strike after another no engagement glancing attacks always from a different place they all know their jobs and are waiting their turn the archers should be finished soon then the cavalry then the pikemen were ready for their sentries when they send them out our men will sleep in turns but from now on the imperial order will get no sleep good these men need rest in the morning it will be their turn again she lifted a finger to the captain remember the most important thing she quoted her father the weapon that most readily conquers reason is terror and violence dont forget that its the tool they use and now we must turn it on them prindin came back into the firelight mother confessor my brother and i made you a shelter while we waited for your return we have your clothes there and hot water so you may wash yourself if you wish she tried not to show how eager she was to wash off the reek of war thank you prindin he held his arm out showing her the way to the small clearing the brothers had built a roomy shelter of balsam boughs covered over with snow she crawled through the low opening to find candles inside the snowy ground was covered with a mat of boughs too giving the shelter the pleasant aroma of balsam a steaming bucket of water had just been set next to hot rocks placed in the center she warmed her fingers over the rocks the brothers had made her a warm and snug home for the night she could have wept at their thoughtfulness her pack was there and her clothes folded in a neat pile kahlan took off her necklace the one adie had given her the one with the round bone it was the only thing she had worn into battle she clutched it to her cheek a moment before she washed it it reminded her of the one her mother had given her she dunked her whole head in the bucket washed her hair and then methodically washed the rest of herself it was only a sponge bath but it still felt wonderful to wash off the blood and the feel of the hands she had to force herself to think of other things as she washed to keep from being sick she thought of richard thought of his boyish smile that never failed to make her grin thought of his gray eyes that could look right into her when she finished washing she lay down drying her hair on the rocks she desperately needed sleep she still hadnt recovered her confessors power since using it on the oneeyed man orsk she could feel the emptiness in the pit of her stomach a hollow where the power belonged it would be a while longer until it was restored she wouldnt be able to shake the sick dizzy exhaustion though until she had sleep she longed to lie down in her bedroll and sleep it had been so long and she was so sleepy but she couldnt not yet she put the necklace back over her head and then laboriously pulled on her clothes from her pack she recovered an unguent and spread it on her cut lip when she replaced it she saw the bone knife chandalen had given her and tied it around her arm again she was so tired she could hardly force herself up but she had something to do before she slept she had to be with her men she wouldnt let them think she didnt hold their interest highest in her heart they had offered their lives the least she could do was show her appreciation on behalf of the midlands clean her long hair full and shiny once more and dressed at last in layers of warm clothes and her mantle she wound her way among the campfires she listened with serious attention to the babbling stories of some and the quiet brief words of others she spoke with all who had questions gave smiles of reassurance and let them all know how proud she was of what they had done she knelt by the wounded checking to see if they were warm enough and laid a hand to their cheeks giving comfort and wishing them good health and quick healing she too felt relief when they were calmed by her touch at a fire surrounded by ten silent soldiers one young man was trembling but she didnt think it was from the cold how are you doing are you all right are you getting warm her presence surprised and brightened him yes mother confessor a racking shiver rattled his teeth i never thought it would be like that he composed himself and indicated the others these are my friends six didnt come back she held her mantle closed with one hand and brushed the hair back off his forehead with the other im sorry i too grieve for them i just wanted you men to know that you made me proud you were as brave as any soldiers ive ever seen he chuckled nervously wed all be dead if it wasnt for you we were being driven back hacked to pieces and then you charged right into the enemy all by yourself they all turned their attention to you and then while they were confused we counterattacked what you did saved us he shook his head i wish i had killed half as many men tonight as i saw you kill they all nodded their earnest agreement he brushed trembling fingers across his face thank you mother confessor if it werent for what you did we would all be dead too he gave her a twitch of a smile if i had the choice id choose to follow you into battle over prince harold himself pretty good with a sword is she she started at the voice the soldier turned to see captain ryan standing behind her i think she could teach us swordsmen a thing or two you wouldnt believe what she kahlan patted his shoulder have you had something to eat he pointed to the pot of beans on the fire would you share some with us mother confessor she almost lost control of her queasy stomach you men eat you need the strength thank you for the offer but i must first see to the others captain ryan followed her away i had thought you might have some trouble handling a sword the men who unsaddled your horse told me they found dismembered hands and fingers caught in the girth strap and a few other places kahlan smiled at men she passed they lifted a hand or bowed their heads in greeting have you forgotten who my father was he taught me the use of a sword mother confessor that doesnt mean lieutenant sloan was killed he fell silent a moment i know they told me he put a hand under her arm when she stumbled you dont look so good some of those men who were poisoned looked better than you its just that i havent slept for so long she didnt tell him that she had also used her power again im dead tired back outside her shelter tossidin offered her a bowl of beans her fingers covered her mouth as her eyes winced closed she thought she might faint at the sight and smell of food tossidin seemed to understand and took it away prindin put a hand under her other arm mother confessor you must eat but you need rest even more she nodded her agreement i made you some tea i thought it might be a comfort he pointed with his chin to the shelter it is inside yes tea might help settle my stomach she gave the captains arm a squeeze wake me in the morning when its time for the next attack ill go with the men if youre rested enough only if she cut him off with a look yes mother confessor ill wake you myself inside the cozy shelter she sipped the hot tea and shook her head was spinning she could only take a few swallows before she fell into the bedroll she would be better she told herself when she was rested she could feel her power coming to life at last swelling with its familiar force within her chest she curled up under her fur mantle thinking of the thousand things that needed to be tended to she worried about the men who were at that moment attacking and the ones who would go next she fretted for them all they were so young she worried about what she had started war but she hadnt started it she had only refused to abandon the lives of innocent people to a sure death shed had no choice as the mother confessor she had a responsibility to the people of the midlands if the imperial order wasnt stopped untold thousands would die at their hands and those who lived would live as slaves to the order she thought about the young women at the palace in ebinissia their faces floated and spun through her minds eye she was too weary to weep for them when they were avenged there would be time enough to weep she seethed with a lust for vengeance she resolved that she would hound the army of the imperial order to their graves in the morning she would once more lead her men against the enemy she would see it through she would see those girls and all the others avenged if the imperial order wasnt stopped not only would innocent people be slaughtered but all magic good and bad all the creatures of magic would perish richard had magic her mind drifted to richard and then she did weep weep in the hope that he would not hate her for what she had done she prayed that he would be able to understand and forgive her she had done the best for him to save him to save the living her tears slowed finally sobbing to a stop her thoughts of richard swept the jumbled tangled flashing images from her head her mind focused for the first time in days it seemed on things other than fighting and killing focused on who she was who richard was focused on important matters floating in the fog at the back of her awareness thinking about richard brought back to her the things that were important but which she seemed to have forgotten there were things other than the order that were important very important it seemed as if this war had distracted her from higher imperatives from those important matters she thought about darken rahl darken rahl had marked richard the sisters of the light had taken him she was supposed to be going to aydindril to help richard to get zedd to help richard richard had to stop the keeper kahlan frowned in the darkness under her mantle the veil to the underworld was still torn she shouldnt be running around swinging a sword at dharan troops she remembered darken rahls laughter she touched her neck and felt the swollen broken skin it had been real he had laughed at how foolish she was kahlan sat up what was she doing she had to help stop the keeper shota had said the veil was torn so had darken rahl and denna kahlan had seen a screeling a creature straight from the underworld she had spoken with denna denna had taken richards place with the keeper so that he could live to repair the tear in the veil kahlan was supposed to be going to zedd she shouldnt be running around playing at soldier but if the imperial order wasnt stopped but if the veil was torn she had to get to aydindril she had to get to zedd these men could fight a war without her that was their job she was the mother confessor she shouldnt be running around foolishly risking her life when the midlands the world of the living was in danger that was what darken rahl was laughing at her foolishness she picked up the cup of tea prindin had made for her and held it in her hands letting it warm her fingers she was the leader of the midlands and had to act like a leader and tend to the most important things above all else to the things that she and only she could do she downed the rest of the tea making a face at the bitter taste kahlan lay down again holding the teacup on her stomach the faces of the dead women again floated before her eyes the weapon that most readily conquers reason is terror and violence that was what the enemy had done to her the horror of what they had done had conquered her reason that very day she and her men could have been lost if the scouts had all been killed without those guides they would have been lost and vincible to the enemy that was what she was a guide she was a guide to the midlands she belonged in aydindril guiding the council pulling everyone together against the threat without that guidance they would be ignorant and lost in the fog of what was happening she was also richards guide for the help he needed it was up to her to get zedds help without that guidance richard and all the living were lost she sat up staring into the candle flame no wonder darken rahl had been laughing at her she had been letting the enemy conquer her reason she had almost been diverted from her duties and given the keeper time to work his plans she knew now what she had to do she had done enough to get these men started had shown them their responsibility and how to carry it out now they had the knowledge they needed to conquer the enemy what she had done was right but now they had their jobs and she had hers this army knew what to do now she had to get to aydindril having decided it felt as if a great weight had been lifted from her but at the same time she felt infused with purpose richard even though he wasnt with her had helped her find the truth in all the confusion and helped her to see her true duty she looked in the teacup but she had drunk the tea and the cup was empty her head felt fuzzy her eyes wouldnt stay open she was so tired she could no longer sit up as she flopped back down she wondered what richard was doing where he was probably with the sisters learning how to control the gift she prayed to the good spirits that they would help him realize how much she loved him her arm suddenly too heavy to hold up fell to the side and the cup rolled away sleep was as dreamless as death chapter she plunged into a void a wasteland of brutal blackness bereft of all sense of time or awareness of place she was lost to the world the dark deprivation was beyond understanding or comfort drifting in the depths of that void she felt something that there was something to feel sparked hope in her hope of escape from this forsaken nowhere with that tingling of sense she snatched desperately at substance as if clutching a rock in a vast dark river trying to fight back from the suffocating darkness brought sensation to her body she floated back her head throbbing with a dull ache and numbly she tried to understand what it was that was happening to her someone called to her mother confessor they called no that wasnt her name it came to her kahlan that was her name hands shook her someone was calling to her and shaking her she returned from a great distance kahlans eyes opened and the world spun captain ryan was gripping her shoulders shaking her calling to her she drew a deep breath of cold air into her lungs she twisted her arms away from him but then had to put her hands back on the ground for support concern creased his features mother confessor are you all right i i she looked about tossidin was there too she sat up the rest of the way and put her cold fingers to her forehead my head what time is it it will be light soon with a look of concern he glanced back over his shoulder at tossidin we came to wake you as you told me to the swordsmen are ready to go kahlan pushed her mantle off ill be ready in a moment and we can she remembered her decision to get to aydindril she had to get to zedd she had to get help for richard if it was true that the veil was torn mother confessor you dont look well youve been through a lot you hadnt slept in days and youve only just gotten a few hours of sleep i think you need more yes she did though she could feel that her power was back she definitely did not feel recovered she put a hand on his arm captain i must leave for aydindril i must he gave her a little smile you rest youre not rested enough to travel stay here and rest when we get back youll be rested and you can leave she nodded still clutching his sleeve for support yes and then i must leave i thought about it last night i must get to aydindril ill rest until you get back but then i must leave she looked about only tossidin was there with the captain wheres chandalen and prindin my brother went to check on their sentries to make sure that they didnt place any tossidin said so that our attack will be without warning chandalen is attacking with the pikemen captain ryan said im to meet him with the swordsmen for the next attack kahlan comforted her sore lip tossidin tell chandalen that when your attack is finished we must leave you three be careful you must get me to aydindril she could hardly keep her eyes open she could hardly bring forth the energy to speak she knew she wasnt able to travel yet ill rest until you return captain ryan sighed with relief that she wasnt going with them that she would be safe here ill leave some men to stand guard while you rest she gestured with her hand this camp is well hidden im safe up here he leaned forward insistently ten or twelve men are not going to make any difference to us and i would be better able to put my mind to our task if im not worrying about you all alone back here she didnt have the energy to argue all right she flopped back down with a troubled frown tossidin pulled the mantle up over her she was sinking back into the blackness as the two of them crawled out the opening she tried to keep herself from going into that unfeeling place but she was helplessly swept away the crushing weight of the void closed in around her she tried to escape its grasp tried to come back up but the darkness was too thick like being encased in mud she was trapped still being sucked deeper she felt a surge of panic she tried to think but could not form thoughts into coherent concepts she had the sense that something was wrong but could not bring her mind to bear on the solution this time instead of surrendering she focused all her strength on thoughts of richard on her need to help him and the darkness then was not a total void she had an inkling of time sensing its incremental passing she felt as if she were sleeping her whole lifetime away as she tenaciously kept richard in her thoughts her concern for him and her anxiety over the strangeness of the depthless sleep let her slowly methodically claw her way back yet it seemed to take hours with a desperate gasp she came awake her head swirled with a throbbing ache her whole body tingled with sharp little pricks of pain she laboriously pushed herself up to sit staring about her dark shelter the candle was burned almost all the way down quiet hummed in her ears she thought maybe she needed cold air to wake up her arms and legs felt thick and heavy as she crawled through the opening of the shelter outside it was dusk she looked up at the first stars winking through the trees her breath fogged before her face as she stood on wobbly legs kahlan took a step and promptly tripped over something falling on her face in the snow her cheek still against the ground she opened her eyes inches away glassy eyes were staring at her the side of a young mans face was lying against the snow close to hers it was his leg she had tripped over it felt as if her bones wanted to leap out of her skin and run his throat was gaping open his neck nearly sliced in two letting his head bend back from his body at an impossible angle she could see the opening of his severed windpipe clotted blood covered snow a bloom of bile rose up into her throat she swallowed forcing it back down slowly lifting her head she saw the dark forms of other bodies they were all galean every sword still rested in its scabbard they had died without the chance to fight back kahlans legs tensed wanting to run but she strained to be still in the dull fog of the halfsleep she couldnt throw off she struggled to think her mind seemed to be mired in a dreamlike stupor unable to concentrate someone had killed these men and could still be around she somehow had to force herself to think she touched her fingers to the dead soldiers hand it was still warm this must have just happened maybe that was what had wakened her she peered up among the trees men moved in the shadows they had seen her and were moving into the clearing around her they laughed and hooted as they came forward and she saw who they were close to a dozen dharans and a couple of keltans men of the imperial order with a gasp kahlan sprang to her feet one man the one closest had a puffy red wound down the left side of his face from his temple to his jaw where nicks hoof had caught him ragged stitches held the black and red flesh closed he gave a sneering smile with the good side of his mouth it was general riggs well well i have found you at last confessor kahlan flinched with the rest of the men when a dark form screaming a battle cry crashed through the underbrush as the men turned kahlan bolted the other way before she turned she had seen the fading light glint off a huge war axe the crescentshaped blade struck down two men in one swing it was orsk he must have been searching for her too so he could protect her one touched by a confessor never gave up her legs felt thick and tingled as if she had slept on them but she ran as hard as she could yelling and screaming erupted behind her steel rang against steel orsk roared as he tore into the men after her spruce branches slapped her face as she staggered through the trees dead limbs and brush snagged her pants and shirt dizzy she stumbled through the drifts snow splashed against her face as she crashed through drooping boughs she couldnt make her legs run fast enough the man on her heels grunted as he dove for her his arms snared her legs and she went down hard she spit snow out as she kicked and struggled to get away the man clawed his way up her legs grabbing hold of her belt and throwing himself on top of her the red face with the angry wound down one side hovered right over hers in triumph he grinned wickedly back through the trees she could hear the sounds of furious battle she and riggs were alone as she struggled to squirm away one fist grabbed her hair and held her head to the ground his other fist punched her in the side knocking the wind from her lungs he hit her again nausea swept through her in a hot wave as she fought to get her breath ive got you now confessor youll not get away again you may as well resign yourself to it he was alone what was he thinking she slapped a hand to his chest it seemed a puzzle to her that alone man would think he could take a confessor you have no one riggs she managed to say under the weight of him youve lost you are mine i dont think so he sneered he said you cant use your power now he lifted her head and thumped it against the ground her vision blurred she tried to concentrate on what she needed to do he lifted her head again to bang it against the ground though she was bewildered by what he had said she had to do it now before he knocked her unconscious before it was too late now when time was hers in the silence of her mind as he lifted her head she let her confessors power sweep through her she released her restraint there was thunder with no sound the impact of power of magic made riggs flinch tree branches all around shook with a jolt snow dropped down splattering on his back and her face his eyes went wide his jaw slack mistress command me with the last of her strength she managed to ask who told you my power couldnt harm you mistress it was the bloody point of an arrow exploded from the prominence on the fore of his throat the broad steel point stopped a scant inch from her chin his eyes teared as his mouth moved and blood frothed but no words came forth as his breath rattled from his lungs he began slumping onto her a fist gripped the shoulder of his uniform and pulled riggs away at first she thought it would be orsk but it wasnt mother confessor a worried prindin peered down at her are you hurt did he hurt you he hastily rolled the general off her and offered his hand to help her up as his eyes glided down the length of her lying on the snow she stared up at him but didnt take his hand using her power had left her exhausted and limp as never before his customary grin spread on his face as he shouldered his bow i can see you are not hurt you look very fine you didnt need to kill him i had already used my power on him he was mine he was just about to tell me who it was that said i could not harm her whole body tingled with apprehension at the way his eyes took her in his familiar grin ran a cold shiver up her arms and the back of her neck making the fine hairs stand stiffly out orsk crashed through the trees mistress are you safe she could hear others coming in the woods behind him she heard chandalens voice prindin swiftly nocked an arrow orsk lifted his axe with one big fist prindin no dont hurt him prindin drew his bow orsk run the big man spun without question and darted back into the brush an arrow followed him in she heard the arrow strike something solid she could hear orsk stumble through the barren undergrowth breaking branches and saplings the snapping of twigs died out and then she heard him hit the ground she tried to stand but feebly fell back it felt as if she had no bones and her muscles were melting her strength was gone the blackness was trying to suck her back in prindin turned his grin back to her as he shouldered his bow once more kahlan strained to bring forth the strength to speak it came in a breathy whisper prindin why did you do that he shrugged so we can be alone his smile widened before they chop off your head prindin prindin had told riggs her power wouldnt hurt him so she would expend it on him and would have nothing left her legs trembled with the effort of trying to lift herself she fell back again as he watched a voice came through the trees it was a breathless chandalen calling to her in another direction she heard tossidin calling she tried to scream to them only a weak hoarse complaint came from her throat darkness pressed into her maybe she was still asleep she thought she could hardly speak hardly move just like a nightmare she wished it were but she knew it was no dream prindin turned to the insistent calls kahlan dug her heels into the snow and with a mighty effort managed to scoot herself back her hand fell on a stout maple limb lying on the ground prindin rushed to her she focused all her fear her dread her pain and horror at what was happening into action it took everything she had prindin reached for her kahlan came up swinging the stout limb prindin ducked and snatched her wouldbe club wrenching it from her grip he spun her to him and curled his arm around her head over her mouth as she tried to warn chandalen though he wasnt big she knew prindin to be incredibly strong but in her present state even a child could have had his way with her chandalen ran up behind them a knife in hand kahlan bit into prindins arm she cried out as prindin spun with impossible speed and strength catching chandalen across the side of the head with the branch the sound of the hollow thunk was sickening the blow knocked chandalen into the boughs of a fir tree as she twisted from prindins grip she saw blood on the snow around chandalen tossidin breathing hard burst through the trees what is happening prindin he saw them and stopped in his tracks he looked to chandalen and then to prindin prindin peered back over his shoulder at his brother speaking in his own tongue chandalen tried to kill us i came here just as he tried to kill the mother confessor help me she is hurt kahlan collapsed to her knees crying out no tossidin no tossidin ran toward them what is this trouble chandalen told me of what is wrong with you brother what have you done help me the mother confessor has been hurt tossidin gripped his brothers shoulder and spun him around prindin what have you prindin slammed a knife into his brothers chest tossidins eyes went wide in surprise his mouth opened but no words came with a wheeze his legs buckled and he crumpled to the ground kahlan cried out he had been stabbed through the heart chandalen sat up with a groggy groan he put his hands to his bleeding scalp keeping an eye to the wounded man prindin pulled a bone box from his waist pouch he had a full box of bandu he hadnt given her all his poison helpless to stop him kahlan saw prindin wipe a generous gob of poison onto the arrows point dazed chandalen held his head in his hands as he tried to gather his wits prindin drew the bowstring to his cheek she knew he was aiming for chandalens throat just as prindin released the arrow she managed to throw herself against his legs making the arrow go astray from its target it still hit chandalen in the shoulder the back of his fist across her face sent her sprawling powered by sheer terror kahlan started scrambling away on her hands and knees the snow was freezing her fingers the knees of her pants were soaked and icy wet she concentrated on the cold to try to revive herself she glanced over her shoulder as she clambered away prindin drew another arrow from his quiver and wiped it in the poison as he watched her struggle as he had watched chandalen a cry came from her throat as she staggered to her feet and ran a nightmare it had to be a nightmare the arrow felt like a club hitting the back of her left leg she screamed and fell to her face her leg flamed in hot pain a tingling prickling sensation spread through the muscle the pain seared through the bone into her hip prindin was suddenly over her he knelt down and gripped the arrow sticking from the back of her leg he put his other hand against her bottom to hold her and yanked the arrow free kahlan could feel the tingle of the poison going up her leg dont worry mother confessor i did not use much poison on your arrow like on chandalens just enough to make sure you will give me no trouble he will be dead in another minute you will live long enough to have your head chopped off his hand stroked her bottom if they do not wait too long prindin leaned over her it is too cold out here we will go back he took hold of her wrist and started dragging her across the snow in her mind kahlan fought him she struggled she shrieked she hit but she couldnt make her body obey she was as limp as a rag doll being dragged over the snow she could feel the poison spreading to her ribs tears streamed down her cheeks orsk tossidin chandalen her how could prindin do such a thing she sobbed as her face slid over the snow how could he his own brother he had stabbed his own brother as if it meant nothing who could do such a thing how could anyone do such a thing how could anyone but a baneling she gasped with the realization she had never fully believed in banelings before wizards had told her they were real but she never believed the wizards knew for sure she had always thought it might be superstitious nonsense that sent people hunting things in the dark things from the underworld things bidden from the keepers own dark whispers but now she knew she was in the grips of a baneling dear spirits how could no one know he had helped her so many times he had befriended her so he could be close to her and keep track of her for the keeper he was a baneling darken rahl had laughed at her because she was so stupid she knew now without a doubt the veil was torn darken rahl had promised her such things he had come to tear the veil the rest of the way and she had foolishly thought she was in control of what she was doing but all the time darken rahl and the keeper had watched her through prindins eyes but why wait until now why let her fight in this war let all these people die before he snatched her kahlan knew why the keeper was of the world of the dead bringing death to the world of the living was what he wanted he resented the living that was why he wanted the veil torn so he could bring death to the world of the living he coveted this worlds breath of life he enjoyed watching people die he did not wish to stop it too soon stop the suffering the fear the pain it felt as if her arm might tear from its socket as prindin tugged her through the brush and over a log half covered over with snow the tingling of the poison had spread across her chest her left leg had gone numb at least she thought she couldnt feel how much the arrow wound hurt the round iron point had hit the bone and prindin had not been gentle about pulling it out at least it was numb now when they reached the shelter she could see bodies all about not only the galean men but the men of the imperial order that orsk had killed soon when prindin was finished with her he would turn her over to the army of the order and she would be beheaded it would be over and there was nothing she could do to stop it she couldnt even fight back she would never see richard again dear spirits he would never know how much she loved him prindin dragged her through the opening to the shelter and heaved her onto the mat of boughs as he lit two more candles from the one that was almost burned down she struggled to breathe to remain conscious i wish to be able to see you he explained with a lecherous smile you are very fine to look upon i wish to see all of you she had always liked his smile she didnt like it now prindin took off his fur mantle and tossed it aside his smile vanished his eyes were wild he didnt speak in her tongue anymore but only his own take off your clothes i wish to look upon you first to be aroused by the sight of you even if he had held a knife to her throat she wouldnt have been able to obey she couldnt move her arms prindin she managed to whisper the men will be back soon they will catch you here they will be busy they are having a fight like they never expected his smile returned they will not be back soon if at all the smile changed in an instant to a twisted expression of hot rage i said take off your clothes prindin you are my friend please dont do this he crawled on top of her yanking at her belt then i will do it for you tears over her helplessness over the loss of a friend to this madness to the keeper ran down her cheeks prindin why he sat up as if surprised by the question the great spirit said i may have you before he takes your spirit to the underworld he said i am to have a reward for the work i have done the great spirit is pleased with me for delivering you to him the bite on her neck stung with prickling pain she shivered with sorrow for tossidin and chandalen she shivered at her own desolate hopeless situation the tingling from the poison had spread across her shoulders she could feel the slight twinge of its first touch moving up her throat he squeezed her under him as he kissed the place on her neck where darken rahls lips had been where the bite was the pain the visions sent a silent shriek through her prindin please after you have me let me go she hoped that hearing her words in his tongue would mean more to him please he lifted his head away looking into her eyes it would do no good for me to leave you you have been poisoned by the tea and by the arrow you will die soon anyway you must be beheaded before you die of the poison it will be better you will not suffer the poisons end that is my mercy to you prindin grinned as he started to bend over her again kissing her neck tears ran down her cheeks i hate you she wept you and your great spirit he sprang up standing as best he could in the small shelter with his fists at his sides as he glared down at her you are to be mine i have been promised i will have you your power cannot harm me i saw to that it is used up for now you are to be mine if you will not give yourself to me i will take you you brought your hateful magic to my people your hateful ways you are evil and i will take you to conquer your wickedness the great spirit has said it shall be so prindin pulled his buckskin shirt off over his head off his wiry frame he leapt full onto her landing with a grunt his face was right above hers they stared at each other in surprise he had no idea what had happened she knew what had happened but had no idea how she could feel his warm blood flowing over her fist his pupils expanded he coughed splattering little droplets of blood across her face with a long slow gurgle he went limp as his last breath left his lungs tears ran down kahlans face she didnt have the strength to push him off her she could hardly breathe under his weight and so she lay still feeling his blood drain over her hand between her breasts and soak into her shirt the tingling of the poison had risen up her neck chapter in the tingling blackness her lip hurt something was jabbing against the cut making it throb something was in her mouth she thought it felt like a finger poking into her mouth swallow kahlan frowned in the darkness in her sleep swallow do you hear me swallow making a sour face she did as commanded the finger pushed more of the dry things into her mouth swallow again she swallowed hoping the voice would leave her alone now it did she sank back down into the tingling void she drifted in the nowhere place unaware she had no concept of time no idea how long she floated with a gasp her eyes opened she blinked around at her shelter the candles were burned halfway down her fur mantle was covering her chandalen leaned over peering down at her a broad smile spread on his lips he let out a long sigh of relief you are back he said you are safe now chandalen she tried to make sense of what she was seeing am i in the underworld or are you are not dead he laughed quietly chandalen is hard to kill she worked her tongue trying to wet her dry mouth she was awake really awake for the first time in as long as she could remember it seemed she had forgotten what it was like to be awake how vibrant it felt still she did not move afraid the blackness would return but prindin shot you with a tenstep arrow i saw it he turned a bit looking away in chagrin she could see that his black hair was matted with dried blood he flipped his hand as if uneasy that he had to explain remember i told you that our ancestors took quassin doe before they went into battle so that if they were shot with a tenstep arrow the poison would not kill them she nodded he tenderly tested his wounded scalp well in honor of my ancestors my warrior ancestors i ate some of the quassin doe leaves before i went to fight the quassin doe you gave to me back at that city his eyebrows lifted as if further justification was needed it was to honor my ancestors kahlan smiled warmly to him as she put a hand to his arm you have done your ancestors proud he helped her sit up in the dim light she saw that prindin lay next to her on his back the bone knife the bone knife made from chandalens grandfathers bones the one she had worn at her arm jutted from prindins chest the black feathers fanned out around the hilt end draped like a shroud over the fatal wound somehow she had managed to put that knife between them when prindin had leaped on her somehow she remembered her numb helpless plight she remembered the tingling feeling of the poison and that she couldnt move she remembered her terror she remembered prindins leap onto her but she didnt remember pulling the knife her voice trembled im so sorry chandalen her fingers covered her mouth im so sorry that i killed your friend chandalen glared at the body he was not my friend my friends do not try to kill me he put a comforting hand to her shoulder he was sent by the great dark spirit of the dead his heart was taken by evil kahlan clutched his sleeve chandalen that great dark spirit of the dead is trying to escape from behind the veil he wants to pull us all behind the veil into the world of the dead his brown eyes studied hers i believe you we must get you to aydindril so you may help stop him she sagged with relief thank you chandalen thank you for understanding and for saving me with the quassin doe kahlan clutched his arm the men prindin set a trap for them what time is it he made a comforting hushing sound when captain ryan came to tossidin and me before the attack i asked where you were i knew you would want to be with them he told me that you were sick that you could not wake it sounded to me like bandu captain ryan said you would not eat and would have only tea prindin made for you i knew then what was happening i knew you had been poisoned and the only thing you had was tea tossidin and i were greatly worried for you we checked to see if the enemy had changed position we saw that they were waiting for the attack where we had planned it at first i made the men change the attack and come from a different place than expected as soon as i gave the new orders we rushed back here i knew prindin had betrayed us but tossidin thought there must be some other explanation he trusted his brother and did not want to think evil of him he paid for his trust his mistake with his life kahlan looked away in the uneasy quiet she frowned back at him what of the arrow what of the wound on your head we must see to your wounds chandalen pulled the neck of his buckskin shirt to the side revealing a bandage over his left shoulder the men returned in the night they stitched my head it is not as bad as it looks they also took out the arrow he winced as he pulled the shirt back up on his shoulder i taught prindin well he used a bladed arrow bladed arrows do more harm coming out than going in one of the men the one who cuts and sews the wounded cut out the arrow and stitched me together the arrow hit the bone so it did not go in too far my arm is stiff and i will not be able to use it for a time kahlan felt her leg there was a bandage under her pants did he stitch my leg too no it did not need sewing just to be wrapped i did that prindin used a round point on you that is not like i taught him i dont know why he would do that kahlan could feel the presence of the body next to her he wanted to be able to get it out of me after he shot me with poison she said quietly he wanted it out of his way he was going to rape me before he gave me to the enemy chandalen watched the body not wanting to look at her and said he was glad that had not happened she touched his left hand and im glad it was your shoulder and not your throat he frowned i taught prindin how to shoot he would never miss my throat from that distance why did he not shoot my throat she shrugged feigning ignorance he grunted suspiciously chandalen why is his body still in here why didnt you drag him out he moved his wounded arm a bit with his other making it more comfortable because grandfathers spirit knife is still in him he regarded her with a serious expression you have used the aid of grandfathers bones his spirit to protect yourself to take another life grandfathers spirit is bonded to you now no other may touch his bone knife now it is yours and only you may touch it you must remove it kahlan momentarily contemplated whether or not she could just leave the knife where it was and bury it with the body she thought maybe the bone knife should be put to rest too but she discarded the thought to the mud people this was powerful spirit magic she would insult chandalen if she rejected the knife she thought too that maybe she would be insulting the spirit of chandalens grandfather if she didnt take back the knife she wasnt entirely sure that it wasnt the spirit in the bone knife that had killed prindin to save her she didnt know how the knife had gotten into her hand kahlan reached out and wrapped her fingers around the round end protruding from prindins chest it made a sucking sound as she pulled it from the body she wiped it clean on the balsam boughs covering the floor kahlan brought the round end to her lips and kissed it lightly thank you spirit grandfather for saving my life somehow it seemed the right thing to do chandalen smiled as she slid the bone knife into the band on her arm you are a good mud person you knew what to do without me telling you grandfathers spirit will watch over you always chandalen we must get to aydindril the veil to the underworld is torn weve done what we must to help these men i must do my job now when we first found these men i did not want to stay with them i wanted to be away from their fight so that you would be safe he stared off at nothing somehow i forgot that thought and all i wanted to do was fight and kill the enemy i know she whispered that happened to me too i forgot all about what i was supposed to be doing its almost as if we too listened to the great dark spirit the veil is torn maybe thats why we were distracted you think that this veil is torn and because of that we forgot what we were to do and wanted only to kill chandalen i dont know the answers to these things i must get to aydindril the wizard will know what to do richard needs help we have taken enough time here we must not waste any more we must talk to the men and then be on our way are they out there he nodded then lets get going she started to rise but he put his good hand to her arm and stopped her they have been waiting outside your shelter all night i would not let them come inside he took his hand back as he seemed to search for the right words i feared greatly that you would die this night i didnt know if i had given you the quassin doe in time prindin had been giving you poison without our knowing it for a long time you almost went to the spirit world if you had died i would never be able to return to my people again but that is not why i am glad you live i am glad because you are a good mud person you are a protector to our people the same as chandalen we each fight in our own way he lifted an eyebrow lately you have been fighting too much like chandalen fights you are good at it but you should leave that to me and fight in the way you are meant to fight kahlan smiled youre right thank you for sitting with me all night it was good to have you near im sorry you were hurt he shrugged someday when i find a woman for myself i will have scars to show her so she may see how brave chandalen is kahlan laughed im sure she will be impressed with your bravery when you were shot with an arrow chandalen gave her a crooked look it does not prove i was brave because i was shot with an arrow anyone can be shot he lifted his chin i am brave because i did not cry out when the the arrow was cut from me someday kahlan thought some fortunate woman would have her hands full with this one im glad the good spirits watched over you and you are with me he narrowed his eyes as he peered at her i do not know what happened but i think prindin missed my throat because you were watching over me too she only grinned when she looked to the body her grin withered she stroked the fur of her mantle poor tossidin he loved his brother ill miss him chandalen glanced to the body i have known them since they were young boys they both followed me around begging me to teach them begging to be one of my men he hung his head in silence finally he returned his attention to her the men are worried greatly about you they are waiting kahlan followed as he crawled out on his knees and one hand she dragged the sword with her outside in the light there was a sudden rustle of sound as men rose to their feet captain ryan rushed forward but a big man with one arm in a sling thrust his good arm across the captains chest stopping him cold he held a monstrous war axe in his fist orsk you are alive too his eyes were red from weeping kahlan remembered the way her father had wept when her mother his mistress was ill mistress tears sprang anew to his eyes you are well what do you wish orsk these men are all my friends none of them will hurt me you do not need to keep them away im safe it would please me if you just sat quietly for now instantly he flopped to the ground kahlan gave a questioning frown to chandalen chandalen shrugged i saw him fight to protect you and prindin wanted to kill him so i gave him quassin doe the men dug the arrow from his back i am not sure how badly he is hurt he has no interest in his wound only in you i was only able to keep him out of the shelter by telling him you needed to be left alone or you might not recover but he would not leave this spot as long as you were inside kahlan sighed as she gazed at the grisly face staring silently up at her she could hardly stand to look at the jagged white scar and the one eye that was sewn shut she returned her attention to an impatient captain ryan and the hundreds of faces behind him how goes the war the war dash the war are you all right you had us scared to death he cast a hot glance at chandalen and then at orsk sitting in the snow these two wouldnt even let me have a peek at you to see how you were thats their job kahlan said she gave them a warm smile thank you all for your concern chandalen has saved me well what happened this place was a mess the dozen men i left here were slaughtered by a troga prindin and tossidin are dead and there were dead men of the order we feared they killed you kahlan realized chandalen had told them nothing one of the dead men off in that direction is general riggs of the imperial order orsk here she pointed down to the oneeyed man killed most of the men of the order they came here to get me prindin killed our guards and his brother and he tried to kill me whispers and gasps spread among the men captain ryans eyes looked like they would pop from his head prindin not prindin dear spirits why she waited until silence settled over the men she spoke in a quiet tone prindin was a baneling stunned silence was all she heard for a moment and then the worried whispers of baneling spread back through the ranks you men are doing a fine job but now you must fight on without me i must get to aydindril disappointed murmurs filled the air i would not leave you if i did not know you were up to the task you have all proven your worth and your heart in battle you are men the equal of any the men stood a little taller they listened intently to her as if hearing their general i am proud of each and every one of you you are heroes of the midlands this army of the imperial order threat though it is is representative of a larger threat to the midlands to the world of the living that the keeper would send a baneling to stop me is proof of that i believe the imperial order is aligned with the keeper i must now turn my attention to this threat i know you will fight on as you have sworn and show the enemy no quarter i know the days of the order are numbered kahlan realized that her neck didnt hurt she touched her fingers to the bite it was gone suddenly she felt that perhaps she had escaped the keepers grasp in more ways than one with a serious demeanor she regarded the young faces that intently watched her though you will fight on without quarter you must not let yourselves become what you are fighting the enemy fights to kill and to enslave you fight for life and freedom keep that always uppermost in your hearts do not let yourselves become what you hate i know how easy it is to do it almost happened to me kahlan put a fist into the air i promise to never forget a one of you promise me that when this is finished both the threat from the imperial order and the threat from the keeper that you will one day all come to aydindril so the midlands may honor your sacrifice the men all lifted a fist in pledge a cheer went up captain ryan please tell the men at the other camps my words i wish i could speak to them all myself but i must leave at once he assured her it would be done kahlan lifted the sword in both hands holding it out king wyborn wielded this sword in battle to protect his land the mother confessor has wielded it in defense of the midlands i now place it in capable hands captain ryans fingers carefully lifted the sword from hers he held it as if holding the crown of galea itself a beaming grin lit his face i will carry it with pride mother confessor thank you for everything you have taught us when you first found us we were boys thank you for making us into men you have taught us not only to fight better but more importantly what it means to be soldiers and to be protectors of the midlands he took the hilt in his fist and held the sword skyward as he turned to his men three cheers for the mother confessor as she listened to the three wild cheers kahlan realized that in all her life she had never heard anyone cheer the mother confessor before she had to strain to keep her surprise from showing she lifted a kiss on her fingers and thanked them all captain ryan i wish to take nick and i will need two other horses also chandalen lurched forward now why do you need horses she lifted an eyebrow to him chandalen i have an arrow wound in my leg i can hardly stand much less walk i need to ride if im to get to aydindril i hope you do not think me weak because of it his brow knotted up well no of course you cannot be expected to walk his eyes turned angry again but why do you want two other horses if i ride you must too chandalen does not need to ride i am strong she leaned close and spoke in his tongue chandalen i know the mud people do not ride horses i would not expect you would know how i will teach you you will do fine when you return to your people you will have a new skill that none of them have they will be impressed the women will see that you are brave he grunted suspiciously as he scowled then why do we need the third horse were taking orsk what kahlan shrugged you cant draw a bow until your arm recovers how will you protect me orsk can wield an axe with his one good arm and you can throw a spear with yours he rolled his eyes i am not going to be able to talk you out of this am i no she said with a small smile now we better get our things and be on our way kahlan surveyed the men one last time her men she gave them a salute of her fist to her heart they all silently returned the salute she had lost much with these men she had gained much take care each and every one of you chapter so when are we going to meet your people the ones who will guide sister verna and me to the palace du chaillu glanced back over her shoulder pulling her mass of black hair out of the way to peer at him she was leading her horse richard had grown tired of her complaints and when she finally refused to ride any longer he decided not to make an issue of it and let her walk richard had decided to walk for a while himself sister verna rode behind them watching du chaillu like an owl from atop her horse soon her cool distant expression disturbed him very soon her attitude had slowly changed since they had left the majendie land as they went deeper into hers she was no longer chatty and open but had grown haughty and distant sister verna rarely took her eyes from du chaillu and du chaillu in turn didnt miss a move the sister made they were like two cats with their fur standing on end silent and still but ready to spring it wouldnt have surprised him if soon he saw their teeth bared richard had the feeling the two of them were constantly testing each other but in ways he couldnt see by the sisters attitude he didnt think she was pleased about what she was discovering richard could tell from experience when the sister was touching her han he recognized the shroud of it in her eyes she was touching it now in the gathering darkness du chaillu turned abruptly from the wide forest trail leading them on a narrow path through the thick tangled growth dark water holding dense thickets of reeds and broadleafed plants with pink and yellow trumpetshaped flowers lurked to the sides richards eyes scanned the shadows among the trees du chaillu came to a halt at the edge of a sandy open area she lifted the reins of her horse to richard the others will join us in this place wait here magic man the term she used to address him lifted his hackles he took the reins richard my name is richard im the one who saved your neck remember du chaillu looked at him thoughtfully please dont ever think i do not appreciate what you have done for me for my people your kindness will be always in my heart her eyes seemed to go out of focus and her voice softened with regret but you are still a magic man her back straightened wait here she turned and disappeared into the forest around the clearing richard stood watching her vanish as sister verna dismounted she took the reins to all three horses she is going to try to kill you now she said as if telling him that she thought it would rain tomorrow richard glared at her i saved her life sister verna started leading the horses to the trees you are a magic man to these people they kill magic men richard didnt want to believe her but he did then use your han to prevent it sister to preserve life as you told du chaillu she should do with her new child sister verna stroked her horses chin she has use of her han too thats why the sisters have always avoided these people some of them can use their han but in a way we dont understand ive tried little things on her to test her the spells i send at her disappear like pebbles dropped down a well and they do not go unnoticed du chaillu knows what i try to do and somehow is able to annul it i told you before these people are dangerous i have fought every step of the way to prevent this i warned you not to swing the axe you saw my efforts as misguided richard gritted his teeth his left hand gripped the hilt of the sword he could feel the bumps of the word truth woven into the wire and through it the heat of its rage i have no intention of killing anyone good keep the anger of the sword out you are going to need it if youre to survive they are surrounding us as we speak that much my han can tell me richard felt as if things were suddenly spinning out of his control he didnt want to hurt anyone he hadnt saved du chaillu just to have to fight her people then i suggest you call on your han sister verna i am the seeker not an assassin im not going to kill your enemies for you she took a few strides toward him her voice was tight and controlled i told you my han is not going to be able to help i would end the threat if i could but i cant du chaillu has power against magic im begging you richard defend yourself his eyes narrowed perhaps you just dont want to help youre angry that i spoiled the arrangement the sisters had with the majendie you plan on watching like you always do just to see what ill do she slowly shook her head in frustration do you really think richard that i would spend half my life in my duty to find you and carry you safely to the palace of the prophets only to watch you killed when were on the doorstep of my home do you actually believe that i wouldnt stop this if i could is your opinion of me that low his impulse was to argue with her but instead he considered her words what she said made sense richard gave an apologetic shake of his head then quickly glanced into the shadows how many are there perhaps thirty thirty in frustration he folded his arms how am i to defend against thirty by myself she looked out into the darkness a moment then cast her hands forward a wind rose carrying a veil of sand and dirt outward into the blackness that will slow them for a short time but not stop them she turned her brown eyes on him once more richard i have used my han to seek an answer the only thing my han tells me is that you must use the prophecy to survive youve named yourself the bringer of death as the prophecy foretells the prophecy is about you you must use the prophecy if you are to defeat that many the prophecy says the holder of the sword is able to call the dead forth call the past into the present somehow thats what you must do in order to survive call forth the dead call the past into the present richard unfolded his arms were about to be overrun by thirty people you say are going to try to kill me and you give me riddles sister i told you before that i dont know what it means if you want to help then tell me something i can use she turned away walking back toward the horses i have sometimes prophecies are meant to give aid to the one named by sending help across time providing a key that may open a door to enlightenment i believe this prophecy is such this prophecy is about you you must find its use i dont know its meaning she stopped and turned to look back over her shoulder you forget i tried to keep us out of the hands of these people you said that in this matter you were not my student but the seeker as the seeker you must use this prophecy you are the one who got us into this only you can get us out richard stared after her as she gentled the nervous animals he had thought about this prophecy before wondering ever since she had told it to him what it could mean sometimes he had felt as if he was on the verge of insight but the feeling always slipped away from him before coming to fruition he had used the sword many times and knew its capabilities he also knew his own limitations against one the sword was virtually invincible but he was flesh and blood he was no expert swordsman in the past he had always depended on the swords magic to make the difference but he was only one man and they were many the sword could only be in one place at one time are they good fighters he asked the baka ban mana are without peer they have special fighters blade masters who train from sunup to sundown every day and then they train by the light of the moon fighting is almost a religion to them when i was young i saw a baka ban mana blade master who had gotten into the garrison in tanimura kill nearly fifty wellarmed soldiers before he was taken down they fight like they are invincible spirits some people believe they are thats just great he said under his breath richard she said without looking to him i know we dont get along we could look at the same thing and each see something different were from different worlds both of us are headstrong and neither of us likes the other very much but i want you to know that im not trying to be obstinate about this you spoke the truth in that this is about you as the seeker not as my student in a way i dont understand its also bundled up with prophecy you are riding a ripple in events i am but a bystander in this if you die however i die too she at last lifted her eyes to his i dont know how to help you richard there are people closing around us to watch what will happen and i know that if i try to interfere i will be killed by them this is about prophecy you and the baka ban mana i play no part in it other than to die if you do i dont know what the prophecy means and i realize you dont either but keep it in mind and maybe its use will come as you need it try to use your han if you can richard stood with his hands on his hips all right sister ill try im just sorry im no good at riddles and if im killed well thank you for trying to help me he looked up at the sky at the thin veil of clouds that dimmed the moon the darkness helped hide those who came there was no reason it couldnt be used to his advantage too richard was a woods guide at home in the darkness of the woods he had spent countless hours at games like this with other guides this was his element too not just theirs he didnt have to do it their way crouching he moved off away from the sister and their horses and became one with the moon shadows he found the first of them looking the wrong way still and silent he watched the dark form wrapped in loose clothes squatted on one knee watching the sister clutched tightly in one fist was a short spear its butt planted in the sand two more spears lay on the ground richard concentrated on controlling his breathing to keep from making a sound as he glided closer moving stopping moving again he approached ever closer his hand reached out inches from the spear he froze as the head turned the figure sprang up but richard was close enough he snatched the spear away as the man whirled richard spun the spear and whacked him across the side of the head he went down before he had a chance to raise an alarm one down richard thought as he straightened and without having to kill him at least he hoped he hadnt killed him slipping out of the darkness a figure appeared to the side another and then another richard turned about and saw more appearing before he could move away he was surrounded the forms were wrapped in barkcolored loose clothes so they would blend in with the surrounding country cloth wound around their heads hid all but their dark eyes which shined with grim determination there was nowhere to run richard sidestepped into the clearing as the circle of forms moved with him more were closing in all about richard turned watching them as they formed two rings around him maybe he could still do this without killing who speaks for you the inner ring of robed figures dropped their round shields and cast their extra spears to the ground points toward richard each clasped their remaining spear in two hands like a staff their eyes never left him the outer ring of warriors cast their shields and all their spears to the ground and put their hands to their sword hilts but didnt draw them a soft rhythmic chant began and the two circles slowly began moving in opposite directions richard walked backward in a tight circle trying to keep watch on all of them who speaks for you the slow chant continued in time with their sideways steps a figure wrapped from head to foot like the others rose up on a rock beyond the outer circle i am du chaillu i speak for the baka ban mana richard could hardly believe this was happening rdu chaillu i saved your life why would you want to murder us the baka ban mana are not here to murder you we are here to execute you for stealing our sacred lands du chaillu ive never even seen your land before i had nothing to do with whatever happened magic men took our lands from us they laid down our laws you are a magic man you bear the sins of those magic men before you you even bear their mark to prove it you must do as all before who we could catch you must face the circle you must die du chaillu i told you the killing must stop it is easy to proclaim the killing must end when you are the one about to die how dare you say that to me i risked my life to stop the killing i risked my life for you she spoke softly i know richard for that i will always honor you i would have borne your sons had you asked it of me i would lay my life down for you for what you have done you will live on as a hero to my people i will tie a prayer to my dress that the spirits take you tenderly to their hearts but you are a magic man the old law says that we must practice every day and be better with a blade than any other people born we have been told that we must kill every magic man we can catch or the spirit of the dark will take the world of life into the dark you cant go on killing magic men or anyone else it must stop the killing cannot end because of what you have done it can only end when the spirits dance with us what does that mean it means we must kill you or what has been spoken will be brought to pass the dark spirit will escape his prison richard pointed with the spear du chaillu i dont want to kill any of you but i will defend myself please stop now before anyone else is hurt dont make me kill any of you please had you tried to run we would have put spears in your back but since you choose to stand you have earned the right to face us you will die anyway as have all before whom we have caught if you do not fight us it will be made quick and you will not suffer you have my word she turned her hand in the air and the chanting started again the outer ring of men drew their swords long blackhandled weapons each with a ring at the pommel holding a cord that looped around the swordsmans neck to keep the sword from being lost in battle each blade was curved widening toward the clipped point the men spun the swords passing them from right hand to left and back again the blades never stopped spinning the two rings began moving in opposite directions again the inner circle of men began twirling the spears like staffs richard had known guides who carried staffs no one ever bothered a guide with a staff these people were better than any guide he had ever seen the shafts of wood were a blur in the moonlight the steel points a circle of dull reflection richard broke the spear shaft over his knee and drew his sword the sound of steel rang above the sound of the whistling spears and blades dont do this du chaillu stop it now before anyone else is hurt do not fight us witch man and we will grant you a quick death i owe you at least that richards chest heaved the muscles in his jaw flexed as he gritted his teeth the chanting increased in speed and the circles of men moved faster richard glared at du chaillu as she stood on the rock i disavow responsibility for what is to happen du chaillu it is you who presses this what happens is your responsibility you bring it she spoke softly her voice filled with regret we are many you are but one i am sorry richard only a fool would have confidence in those odds du chaillu they are not what they seem you cannot all come at me at once you can only attack one or two or at most three at a time the odds are not what they seem to your eyes richard wondered dimly where his own words had come from he could see her nod in the moonlight you understand the dance of death witch man im not a witch man du chaillu i am richard the seeker of truth im not going with this sister to learn to be a witch man by choice im a prisoner you know that but i will defend myself du chaillu watched him in the moonlight the spirits know i am sorry for you seeker richard but you must die dont be sorry for me du chaillu be sorry for those of you who are going to die this night for no good reason you have not seen the baka ban mana fight we will not be touched only you will taste steel dismiss your concern we are safe you will have no killing to regret richard loosed the swords magic the rage the two circles moved and chanted faster spun their weapons faster the storm of the swords anger thundered through the seeker even in the grip of the rage the wanton need to kill he knew it wasnt going to be enough they were too many and he had never seen anyone handle weapons the way these people did heedlessly he pulled more of the magic to him pulled until the mercilessness of the hate pounded in his head and nearly made him sick he drew it into the depths of his soul richard stood still in the center of the moving circles he touched the gleaming blade to his forehead the steel was cold against his hot skin against his sweat blade be true this day he called the magic onward before he even realized what he was doing he pulled off his shirt and threw it aside to be free of any hindrance to his movement why would he think to do that it seemed the right thing to do but he had no idea where the thought came from he drew the blade up straight before him his muscles flexed and tightened glistening with sweat he found the center of himself that place of quiet of focus he sought his han within the whitehot center of his rage use what you have a voice within him said use what is there let it loose in the quiet of his mind richard remembered the time he had stood on zedds wizards rock to use its magic to hide the cloud that darken rahl had sent to track him the rock had been used by many wizards before zedd as richard had stood on it calling the magic onward letting it flow through him he had felt the essence of those who had come before he remembered the way it had felt to feel the things they had felt to know the things they had known it had given him insight into those who had once used the magic suddenly he knew what the prophecy meant he wondered how it was possible to have used the sword before without seeing it without seeing what the magic held just like the wizards rock others had used the sword of truths magic and in the bargain the magic retained a memory of their talents at fighting of every move in which it had ever been used the talent of untold hundreds who had wielded this blade men and women alike was there for the taking the skill of both the good and the wicked was bound into the magic in his stillness he saw the first come from the left be a feather not a rock float on the wind of the storm richard unleashed the magic and spun with the attack letting it sweep past him he didnt strike but let himself float with the press of the charge he let the swords magic guide him the attacker tumbled to the ground when he didnt make the expected contact instantly another came twirling his spear richard spun around again and as the attacker passed he used the sword to splinter the shaft in two a spearpoint thrusted toward him without stopping he glided past it and brought the sword up cutting the shaft in half another charge came from behind he met it with a foot to the chest throwing the man back richard gave himself over to the magic from the sword and to the peace within himself things he didnt even understand he was doing without thought he controlled the rage to keep from killing he used the flat of the blade to strike the back of a head here used his feet to trip an advance there the faster they came the faster he reacted the magic feeding off their energy fluidly he slipped among the attackers splintering spears when he could trying to disarm the baka ban mana without killing them du chaillu stop this before i have to hurt them yelling at her was a mistake it distracted him it allowed a spear through his flowing defense he had a choice as the rage instantly exploded at the threat he could kill the attacker or do only what was necessary to stop him his sword spun its tip whistling through the air and lopped off the hand that thrust the spear blood and fragments of bone filled the air the scream was a womans some of the baka ban mana were women he realized it didnt matter they would kill him if he didnt defend himself losing a hand was better than losing your head first blood brought the rage the need to kill boiling up within him hot and thirsty for more he fought the attackers and fought the things within himself that wanted to press the attack to those around him he didnt want to press the attack he only wanted them to stop but if they didnt stop when he broke their spears they picked up others and threw themselves at him again he slipped among them like a phantom conserving his energy as he let them wear themselves out the outer ring who had continued to circle while the inner one had attacked stopped and then swords awhirl began advancing those with the spears the ones who were still standing stepped back through the outer ring as it came forward swords spun in the air instead of waiting for them to come to him richard went to them they flinched in surprise as the sword of truth shattered two of the flashing blades du chaillu please i dont want to kill any of you the ones with the swords were faster than the ones with the spears too fast talking and trying to disarm them without killing was a dangerous distraction richard felt a hot pain flash through the flesh over his ribs he hadnt even seen the blade coming but he had moved by instinct and received a shallow slash instead of a killing cut his own blood being drawn summoned the swords magic to his defense the rage the skill of those who had held it before him their essence seared through him and he couldnt hold it back there was no choice anymore it overwhelmed his restraint he had given them every chance he was beyond retrieval now bringer of death the swordsmen rushed in a deadly wave he loosed the magic with a vengeance the sta ling was over the barriers down he danced with death now the night erupted in a warm mist of blood he heard himself screaming and he felt himself moving he saw men and women falling as disembodied heads tumbled across the ground the lust for it raged through him no blade touched him again he countered every strike as if he had seen it a thousand times before as if he had always known what to do every attack brought a sure and swift death to the attacker bone fragments and blood exploded through the night air gore sluiced across the ground the horror of it all melted together into one long killing image bringer of death he only realized he had his knife in his left hand and his sword in his right when two came from opposite sides at once he hooked his arm around the neck of the one on the left and slit his throat while at the same time running the one on the right through with the sword both collapsed to the ground as richard stood panting quiet echoed around him there was no movement except for one on her knees holding herself up with one hand her other hand was missing she rose to her feet pulling a knife from her belt through his glower richard watched the determination in her eyes she ran for him with a scream richard stood deathlike in a cold cocoon of magic the rage pounded as he watched her come she raised the knife richards sword whipped up and impaled her through the heart the dead weight of her pulled the sword down as she slid off it to the ground her last breath gurgling out as her fingers grasped the blade sliding down its wet red length as she slipped into the hands of death bringer of death richard lifted his smoldering glare to the woman standing on the rock du chaillu stepped down unwrapped her head letting the long cloth hang down and went to one knee in a bow richard his rage burning hotly strode to her he lifted du chaillus chin with the swords point her dark eyes stared up into his the caharin has come who is the caharin du chaillu looked unflinchingly into his eyes the one who dances with the spirits dances with the spirits richard repeated in a flat tone he understood he had danced with the spirits of those who held the sword before him he had called the dead forth danced with their spirits he almost laughed i will never forgive you du chaillu for making me kill those people i saved your life because i abhor killing and you have brought the blood of thirty to my hands i am sorry caharin that you must bear this burden but only through the blood of thirty baka ban mana could the killing stop only in this way can we serve the spirits how is killing serving the spirits when the magic men stole our land they banished us to this place they placed upon us the duty of teaching the caharin to dance with the spirits only the caharin can stop the dark spirit from taking the world of the living the caharin is given to the world as a new born babe who must be taught part of this duty is placed upon us to teach him to dance with the spirits you have learned something this night have you not richard gave a grim nod i am the keeper of the laws of our people it was our calling to teach you this if we were to ignore what the old words tell us we must do then the caharin would not learn what is within himself and he would be defenseless against the forces of death in the end death would have everyone the majendie sacrifice us to remind us always of our duty to the spirits and to remind us to practice with the blades the witch women to the other side aid the majendie so that we will be surrounded with no way of escape and nowhere to go so that we will always be under threat and unable to ever forget our duty it is proclaimed that the caharin will announce his arrival by dancing with the spirits and spilling the blood of thirty baka ban mana a feat none but the chosen one could accomplish except with the aid of the spirits it is said that when this happens then we are his to rule we are no longer a free people but bound to his wishes to your wishes caharin the old words say that if every year the one who wears the prayer dress goes to our land to give our prayers to the spirits then one year they will send the caharin and if we carry out our duty then he will return our land to us richard stood as if in a dream glaring down at the woman you have taken something precious from me this night du chaillu she came to her feet straightening before him do not speak to me of sacrifice caharin my five husbands whom i loved whom my children loved who have not seen me since i was captured were among the thirty you have just killed richard sank to his knees he felt like he might be sick du chaillu forgive me for what i have done this night she gently put a hand to his bowed head it has been my honor to be the spirit woman of our people when the caharin has come to be the one to wear the prayer dress and bring him to his people you must do your duty now and return our land as the old words tell us richard lifted his head and do the old words say how i am to accomplish this task she slowly shook her head only that we are to help you and that you will we are yours to command in the dark richard felt a tear run down his cheek then i command that the killing stop you will do as i have already ordered you will use the bird whistle to bring peace with the majendie while you are doing that you will do as you promised and have someone guide us to the palace of the prophets without looking up du chaillu snapped her fingers richard realized for the first time that people in the shadows surrounded the bloody clearing all were on their knees bowed toward him at the snap of her fingers several sprang forward guide them to the big stone house richard stood before her looking into her dark eyes du chaillu im so sorry i killed your husbands i begged you to stop it but im so sorry her eyes bore the timeless look he had seen in the eyes of others sister verna shota the witch woman and kahlan he knew now that it was the gift he was seeing a ghost of a smile came to her lips he didnt know how she could smile at a time like this they fought as hard as any baka ban mana have ever fought they had the honor of teaching the caharin they have given their lives for their people they brought honor to themselves and will live on as legends she reached out and placed her hand on his bare chest on the handprint there you are my husband now richards eyes widened what she gave a curious frown i wear the prayer dress i am the spirit woman of our people you are the caharin it is the old law you are my husband richard shook his head no im not i already have he was going to say he already had a love but the words caught in his throat kahlan had sent him away he had nothing she shrugged it could be worse for you the last one who wore the prayer dress was old and wrinkled she had no teeth i hope that i bring at least some pleasure to your eyes and maybe someday a song to your heart but i belong to the caharin it is not for you or me to decide yes it is he looked about and then snatched up his shirt as he put it on he saw sister verna at the edge of the clearing watching him like a bug in a box he turned to du chaillu you have a job to do you will do it the killing is ended the sister and i must get to the palace so i can get this collar off du chaillu leaned over and kissed his cheek until i see you again richard seeker caharin husband chapter richard and sister verna sat on their horses anchoring long thin shadows as they looked down from the grassy prominence trees meandered along the low places among some of the hills and blanketed others in dusky green the vast city below lay awash in a strawcolored haze that muted the colors into a mellow monotone the distant tiled and shingled roofs shimmered in the rays of the setting sun like points of light on a pond richard had never seen so many buildings laid out in such an orderly array off to the edges they were smaller but toward the core they seemed to grow both in size and in grandeur the faraway sounds of tens of thousands of people and horses and wagons drifted all the way up to them on the hill carried on the light salty breeze a river meandered through the collection of countless buildings dividing the city with the part on the far side twice as large at the edge of the city docks lined the banks along the mouth of the majestic river boats of all sizes were not only moored there but dotted the river their white sails filled with air some of the boats he could just make out had three masts richard had never imagined that such large boats might exist despite being there against his will richard found himself fascinated by the city by all the people and all the sights it must hold he had never seen such a place he imagined a person could probably walk around for days and days and not begin to see it all beyond shimmering with golden sparkles and reflections lay the sea stretching to a knifesedge line at the horizon dominating the city near the center rising up on an island of its own stood a vast palace its imposing crenellated west wall bathed in the suns golden rays baileys and ramparts and towers and sections and roofs all of grand design joined together into a complex structure that held labyrinthine courtyards with trees or grass or ponds the palace seemed to be stretching its stone arms jealously trying to enclose the whole of the island atop which it sat seen from this distance with the threadthin streets radiating out from the the island at the core of the city and strandlike bridges spanning the river all around the palace reminded richard of nothing as much as a fat spider sitting in the center of its web the palace of the prophets sister verna said prison richard said without looking to her she ignored the comment the city is tanimura and through it the river kern the palace itself sits on halsband island halsband his hackles rose is that some kind of sardonic joke what do you mean does halsband have significance richard raised an eyebrow a halsband is a collar used to launch a hunting hawk on an attack she shrugged dismissively you read too much into things do i we shall see she let out a small sigh as she lifted her hips starting her horse down the hill and changed the subject its been many years since i was home but it looks as it always has the two baka ban mana men who had guided them through the swampy trackless forest for the last two days had left them that morning once sister verna was at last in familiar territory although he never lost his sense of direction richard could easily see how people could become disoriented there but he was at home in such places of vast desolation and was more likely to become lost in a building than in dense woods the two men had spoken little over those two days though they were swordsmen as fierce as those richard had fought they were in awe of him richard had to shout before they would stop all the bowing no amount of shouting though could make them stop calling him caharin one night before he went to stand his usual watch sister verna had told him in a quiet tone that she was sorry that he had had to kill those thirty people a little surprised by her sincerity and the seeming lack of meaning other than that stated and haunted by the memory he had thanked her for understanding richard scanned the fertile hills and valleys why isnt this land farmed with all those people they must need to plant food sister verna lifted a hand holding the reins and indicated the land on the other side of the city farms cover the land on that side of the river on this side its not safe for man nor beast tilting her head back she indicated the land behind the baka ban mana are always a threat so they dont farm here because theyre afraid of the baka ban mana she cast a glance to her left do you see that dark forest she watched him as he took in the fringe of the dense tangle in the next valley huge old gnarled trees were packed close together covered with vines and moss and harboring gloomy shadows this edge runs for miles more toward the city its the hagen woods stay far away from it all who let the sun set on them in the hagen woods die many who set foot there die before they have a chance to wait for the sun to go down its a place of vile magic as they rode he kept glancing toward the hagen woods he felt a longing for that gloomy place as if it complemented his dark mood as if he belonged in there he found it hard to draw his eyes away up close the streets of tanimura were not the orderly place they appeared from a distance the fringes of the city were a confusion of squalor men pushing or pulling carts laden with loads of rice sacks or carpets or firewood or hides or even garbage wove around and past each other sometimes clogging the way lining the road were hawkers of every sort selling everything from fruits and vegetables and strips of meat cooked on little sticks over tiny smoky fires in impromptu stone hearths to herbs and fortunes to boots and beads at least the cooking gave spotty relief from the reeking stench of tanneries huddled groups of men in worn dirty clothes shouted with excitement or burst into laughter around games of cards and dice side streets and narrow alleyways were clogged with people and lined with ramshackle huts of tarp and tin naked children ran and played among the flimsy shelters splashing in muddy puddles and chasing each other in games of catchthefox women squatted around buckets washing clothes and chatting among themselves sister verna muttered to herself that she didnt remember the squalor and the unhoused multitudes richard thought that despite their condition they looked happier than they had a right to despite having lived outofdoors and being a little dirty and rumpled sister verna compared to these people looked like royalty anyone coming close bowed in reverence to the sister and she prayed for the creators blessing on them in return the timeworn buildings some faced with faded crumbling plaster some with agedarkened wood were just as packed as the streets colorful wash hung from the rusty iron railings of nearly every tiny balcony a few held pots of flowers or herbs laughter and the hum of conversation came from taverns and inns a butcher shop displayed flycovered carcasses on the street out front other shops sold dried fish or grain or oils the farther he and the sister went the cleaner the city became the road widened even the side streets were wider and none had huts leaning against the buildings the shops had bigger windows with painted shutters and betterlooking wares many displaying colorful locally woven carpets by the time the wide road became lined with trees the buildings were grand the inns looked elegant with doormen standing in red uniforms before them on the stone bridge over the kern men were lighting lamps hung on poles to show the way in the gathering darkness in the river below the bridge fishermen in small boats with lanterns rowed through the dark water soldiers in ornate uniforms with goldtrimmed white shirts and red tunics and carrying polearms patrolled each side of the river as the horses hooves clopped along the cobblestone sister verna finally spoke its a great day at the palace when a new one with the gift arrives she cast him a brief sideways glance its a rare and joyous event they will be happy to see you richard please remember that to them this is an event of note in their calling though you feel differently their hearts will be warmed by the sight of you they will want you to feel welcome richard thought otherwise make your point i just did they will be delighted what you are saying in other words is you would like me not to horrify them right off i didnt say that she glanced with a small frown at the soldiers guarding the bridge she finally looked back to him i am simply asking you to realize that these women live for this very thing richard stared ahead as he rode past more guards in dress uniforms a wise person a person i love told me once that we all can only be who we are no more and no less his gaze swept the top of the wall ahead noting the soldiers there and what arms they carried im the bringer of death and i have nothing to live for thats not true richard she said in a quiet tone youre a young man and you have much to live for you have a long life ahead of you and though you may have named yourself the bringer of death i have seen you do nothing but strive to stop the killing sometimes you will not listen and make matters worse but its through ignorance not malice since you abhor lies sister im sure you wouldnt want me to pretend to feel other than i do she sighed as they went through a huge gate in the thick outer bailey wall the horses hooves echoing inside the long arched opening beyond the road meandered among low spreading trees windows in the buildings rising up all around were aglow with soft yellow light many of the buildings were connected by covered colonnades or enclosed halls with arched openings covered over with latticework benches dotted the far side of the courtyard against a wall with a frieze carved with figures on horses through archways with whitepainted gates they came to the stables horses browsed in a field beyond boys dressed in neat livery with black vests over tan shirts came to hold the horses as he and the sister dismounted richard gave bonnies neck a scratch and then started taking down his belongings sister verna brushed out the wrinkles in her divided riding skirt and straightened her light cloak she fussed at her curly hair no need for that richard someone will bring your things no one touches my things but me he said she sighed and shook her head and then told the boy to have her things brought in he bowed to her and then hooked a lead line on jessup he gave a sharp snap on the line jessup balked the boy brought a whip around on the jessups rump move you dumb beast jessup bellowed as he tried to yank his head away the next thing richard knew the boy was flying across the walkway he slammed up against a flimsy wooden wall and landed on his seat as a glowering sister verna loomed over him dont you dare whip that horse whats the matter with you how would you like it if i did that to you in shock the boy shook his head if i ever hear of you whipping a horse again you will be without a job after i whip your skinny bottom the wideeyed lad gave a quick nod and apology sister verna glared a moment longer and then turned whistling for her horse when jessup trotted up she scratched him under his chin comforting and calming him she led him inside to a stall and saw that he had water and hay richard made sure she didnt see his smile as they walked across the courtyard she said just remember richard there isnt a sister here or even a novice who while at the same time as she was yawning couldnt throw you across a room like that with her han inside a woodpaneled hall with long yellow and blue carpets running under ornate side tables three women waited they became all atwitter at the sight of sister verna sister verna was a head shorter than he and none of these three women were as tall as she they smoothed their full pastel skirts and tugged at the white bodices sister verna one cried out as the three rushed up oh dear sister verna its so good to see you at last a tear or two ran down their rosy faces their smiles looked about to burst their cheeks each looked a good deal younger than sister verna she surveyed the big wet eyes sister verna tenderly stroked the sniffling face before her sister phoebe she touched anothers hand and sister amelia and sister janet its so good to see you again it has been a long time indeed the three giggled with excitement at last composing themselves sister phoebes round face looked about past richard where is he why havent you brought him in with you sister verna lifted her hand toward richard this is he richard these are friends of mine sisters phoebe amelia and janet the smiles transformed into astonished looks they blinked as they took in his size and age they stared in open amazement before finally sputtering over each others words about how glad they were to meet him they tore their eyes from him at last and returned their attention to sister verna better than half the palace is waiting to greet you both sister phoebe said everyone has been so excited since we received word that you would arrive today sister amelia smoothed back her fine light brown hair flipping back the ends that barely brushed her shoulders no other has been brought in since you left for richard all those years and no other everyone is so eager to meet him i guess they are in for a big surprise she said as she blushed glancing sideways at him some of the younger sisters especially a pleasant surprise i would say my but he is big richard remembered a time when he was little when he had been imprisoned in his house by a pouring rain his mother had some women friends visiting to help in the making of a quilt and to pass the time in conversation as they sat and sewed while he played on the floor they discussed him as if he werent there talking about how he was growing and his mother had told how much he ate and how good he was at reading in similar discomfort now richard shifted his pack up higher on his shoulder sister phoebe turned to him and just beamed she reached out and touched his arm listen to us go on we shouldnt talk about you like you werent here welcome richard welcome to the palace of the prophets richard silently watched the three sisters blinking up at him sister amelia giggled and said to sister verna he doesnt talk much does he he talks enough sister verna said under her breath she added thank the creator he is quiet for now well sister phoebe said in a bright voice shall we go sister verna frowned at her sister phoebe who are the troops i saw the ones in the strange uniforms sister phoebes brow wrinkled in thought a moment then her eyebrows lifted oh those troops she dismissed it with a wave the government was overthrown a few years back i guess it must have been while you were away the old world has a new government again we have an emperor now instead of all those kings she looked to sister janet what is it they call themselves her brow creased in thought sister janets eyes turned toward the ceiling oh yes she said in a demure voice the imperial order and you are quite right sister phoebe they have an emperor she nodded yes the imperial order led by an emperor sister phoebe shook her head in wonder such foolishness governments come and governments go but the palace of the prophets always remains the creators hand shelters us shall we go greet the others following behind the three they passed through warmly decorated passageways and halls as far as richard was concerned he was in hostile territory threat always caused the magic of the sword of truth to try to seep into him to protect him he let in a trickle keeping the anger on a slow burn sister verna glanced sideways occasionally as if measuring the growth of his glower at last they went through a pair of thick walnut doors that opened into a vast chamber they had to pass under a low ceiling and between white columns with gold capitals before entering under a huge vaulted dome painted with immense scenes of people in robes surrounding a glowing figure two levels of balconies with ornate stone railings ringed the circular room stainedglass windows lit the top balcony from behind the floor of the room was made up of small light and dark wood squares laid out in a zigzag pattern the hum of well over a hundred voices echoed around the chamber women stood in bunches around the floor and more lined the balconies scattered among the women on the second level were some men and boys the women all sisters of the light he presumed were dressed in finery there seemed to be no pattern their dresses were of every color with designs ranging from conservative to revealing the boys and men were dressed in everything from plain robes to coats as elaborate as richard imagined any lord or prince would wear the buzz of talking died out as everyone began turning to the new arrivals as the room fell to silence applause started swelling into a roar sister phoebe took a few steps toward the center of the room raising her hand calling for silence the applause died out in spurts sisters sister phoebe said her voice trembling with excitement please welcome sister verna home the applause roared again and after a few moments the hand brought it to silence once more and may i present our newest student our newest child of the creator our newest charge she turned holding her hand out wiggling her fingers indicating she wanted richard to step forward he took three strides to her sister verna going with him sister phoebe leaned close and whispered richard do you have any more to your name richard hesitated a moment cypher she turned back to the crowd please welcome richard cypher to the palace of the prophets the clapping started again richard glowered as every face watched him women near pressed closer to get a better look at him there were women of all ages and descriptions in the crowd ranging from some who looked old enough to be kindly grandmothers to some hardly old enough to be called women with those of every age in between they ranged from plump to skinny with hair as different as their dress with every color from blonde to black their eyes too were of every color he noticed one woman who stood near him she had a warm smile on her reedthin lips and strange pale blue eyes with violet flecks through them she was looking at him as if he were an old dear friend whom she loved and hadnt seen in years she was applauding enthusiastically and elbowing a haughty woman next to her to join in the clapping until the other finally did richard stood with his arms at his sides as he studied the layout of the room noting exits passageways and placement of guards as the applause died out a young woman in a dress the same shade of blue as kahlans wedding dress worked her way through the crowd the blue dress had a round neck decorated with white lace that ran down to the narrow waist and matched that on the cuffs she approached coming to a halt right in front of him perhaps five years younger than he and a head shorter she had full soft brown hair that reached to her shoulders and big brown eyes she gaped at him with each slow breath her bosom swelled at the lace her hand floated up her delicate fingers brushed his cheek and stroked down his beard she seemed transfixed as she stared up at him stroking his beard the creator has indeed heard my prayers she whispered to herself she seemed to suddenly remember where she was and snatched her hand back her face flushed red im im she stammered she regained her composure her face recovering its smooth complexion she clasped her hands before herself and turned as if nothing had happened to address sister verna i am pasha maes novice third rank i am next in line to be named i have been placed in charge of richard sister verna gave her a small tight smile i think i remember you pasha im pleased to see you have studied hard and done well richard is passed out of my hands now and into yours may the creator gently hold you both in his hands pasha smiled proudly and then turned to richard she cast a glance down the length of him she looked up batted her eyelashes at him and gave him a warm smile im pleased to meet you young man my name is pasha you are assigned to me im to help teach you help with whatever else you may need in your studies im a guide of sorts any problems or questions you have are to be brought to me and i will do my best to help you you look like a bright boy im sure we are going to get along just fine her smile faltered under the heat of his glower she smiled again and continued well first of all richard we dont allow boys to carry weapons here at the palace of the prophets she held her hands out palms up ill take your sword the trickle of rage from the magic had turned to a torrent you are welcome to my sword when i am no longer breathing pashas gaze flicked to sister verna the sister gave a slow slight shake of her head in stern warning pashas gaze returned to richard and her frown transformed to a smile well well talk about it later her brow bunched together but you need to learn some manners young man richards voice came in a tone that took some of the color from pashas face which one of these women is the prelate pasha gave a bubble of a laugh the prelate is not here she is much too busy to take me to her you do not see the prelate when you wish she sees you when she has reason to see you i can hardly believe sister verna has not taught you that we do not allow our boys richard put the back of his hand against her shoulder and swept her aside as he took another stride into the room redirecting his glare to the hundreds of eyes watching him i have something to say the vast room fell to a hush from two different places in his mind the same thought had come forward at the same time he recognized each origin one was the adventures of bonnie day the book his father had given him and the other was the swords magic the knowledge of the sword the spirits he had danced with the memory and message were the same when you are outnumbered and the situation is hopeless you have no option you must attack he knew what the collar was for his situation was hopeless he had no options he let the quiet ring in the chamber until it was uncomfortable his fingers tapped his radahan as long as you keep this collar on me you are my captors and i am your prisoner murmurs hummed in the air richard let them trail off before he went on since i have committed no aggression against you that makes us enemies we are at war sister verna has made a pledge to me that i will be taught to control the gift and when i have learned what is required i will be set free for now as long as you keep that pledge we have a truce but there are conditions richard lifted the red leather rod at his neck the agiel in his hand beyond the rage of the magic the agiel was only a dim tingle of pain i have been collared before the person who put that collar on me brought me pain to punish me to teach me to subdue me that is the sole purpose of a collar you collar a beast you collar your enemies i made her much the same offer i am making you i begged her to release me she would not i was forced to kill her not one of you could ever hope to be good enough to lick her boots she did as she did because she was tortured and broken made mad enough to use a collar to hurt people she did it against her nature you he looked to all the eyes you do it because you think it is your right you enslave in the name of your creator i dont know your creator the only one beyond this world i know who would do as you do is the keeper the crowd gasped as far as im concerned you may as well be the keepers disciples if you do as she and use this collar to bring me pain the truce will be ended you may think you hold the leash to this collar but i promise you if the truce ends you will find that what you hold is a bolt of lightning deadstill silence rang in the room richard rolled up his left sleeve he drew the sword of truth the distinctive sound of steel filled the silence the baka ban mana are my people they have agreed to live in peace with all people from now on anyone who harms one of them will answer to me if you do not accept this do not let the baka ban mana live in peace our truce will be ended he pointed back with the sword sister verna captured me i have fought her every step of this journey she has done everything short of killing me and draping my body over a horse to get me here though she too is my captor and enemy i owe her certain debts if anyone lays a finger to her because of me i will kill that person and the truce will be ended from the corner of his eye richard could see sister vernas eyes close her hand covered her white face the crowd gasped as richard drew his sword across the inside of his arm he turned it wiping both sides in the blood until it dripped from the tip his knuckles white around the hilt he thrust the blade into the air i give you a blood oath harm the baka ban mana harm sister verna or harm me and the truce will be ended and i promise you we will have war if we have war i will lay waste to the palace of the prophets from the far balcony where richard couldnt see its source a mocking voice drifted out over the crowd all by yourself doubt me at your peril i am a prisoner i have nothing to live for i am the flesh of prophecy i am the bringer of death no answer came in the silence he slammed his sword home into its scabbard richard held his arms out as he gave a gracious bow he came up smiling now that we all understand each other understand the truce you ladies may go back to your celebration of my capture he turned his back on the stunned crowd sister vernas head was lowered her hand covering her face pashas lips were pressed so tightly together they were turning blue a stout sternfaced woman crossed in front of him stopping before sister verna the woman held her nose in the air until sister verna lifted her head and straightened her back sister verna it is obvious you have neither the talent nor skill to be a sister of the light your failure is quite beyond the pale as of this moment you are broken to novice first rank you will serve as a novice until such time as and if the creator wills you earn the title of sister of the light sister verna lifted her chin yes sister maren novices do not speak to a sister unless asked to i did not ask you to speak she held out a hand surrender your dacra sister verna flicked her hand the silver knife appearing from her sleeve she twirled it presented the handle to the other woman and then stood silent her eyes straight ahead at dawn tomorrow you will report to the kitchens you will scrub pots until you are judged worthy to attempt something more demanding of your intelligence do you understand yes sister maren i understand and if you even look like you are going to give me any back talk it will be the stables instead of the kitchens cleaning stalls and hauling manure in that case sister maren i will report directly to the stables instead of the kitchens and save your ears what it is i would say to you sister marens face reddened very well novice the stables it is sister maren paused before richard giving him a tight smile i trust that does not break your truce she lifted her chin and stormed off the room was silent richard looked to sister verna but the sister stared straight ahead pasha her face set in a scowl suddenly put herself between them verna is no longer your concern your arm is bleeding since you are my charge i will tend to it she took a calming breath as she twined her fingers together before her waist there is a big banquet to welcome you beginning in the dining room maybe you will feel better about all of us after the banquet everyone is looking forward to it everyone wants a chance to personally welcome you she shook a finger at him and you will be on your best behavior young man having put the sword away he had put most of the anger away most but not all im not hungry show me to my dungeon child her fists tightened on her blue skirts with a dark look she considered him a moment very well have it your way you can just go to bed without your supper like a spoiled child she turned on her heel follow me chapter sister verna put her hand to the brass lever the room was shielded she took a controlled breath and then knocked a muffled voice behind the heavy door answered come the shield dissolved she opened the right side of the double doors and stepped in two women sat each at her own desk to each side of the door beyond both were writing in ledgers neither looked up yes the one to the left said as she continued writing what is it i have come to return the journey book sister ulicia sister ulicia wet her ringer and flipped a page yes just put it on the desk shouldnt you be at the banquet in honor of your return i would think you would want to get reacquainted with old friends sister verna clasped her hands i have more important matters to attend than banquets i wish to give the journey book to the prelate personally and i wish to speak with her sister ulicia they both looked up well sister ulicia said the prelate does not wish to speak with you sister verna she is a busy woman she cant be bothered with unimportant matters unimportant it is not unimportant do not raise your voice in this office sister verna the other warned she dipped her pen in an ink bottle and bent back over her writing sister verna took a step forward the air between the desks before the door beyond shimmered suddenly with a powerful shield that hissed and crackled in warning the prelate is busy sister ulicia said if she deems your return of consequence she will send for you she pulled a candle closer and bent back to her book just put the journey book on my desk i will see that its returned to her sister verna controlled her voice as she gritted her teeth i have been broken down to novice they both glanced up broken to novice because i followed the orders of that woman despite my pleas and appeals she forbade me to do my job my duty and because of that i am to be punished punished for doing as the prelate ordered me to do i will at least hear the reasons sister ulicia leaned back in her chair and then turned to the other woman sister finella please send a report to the headmistress of the novices inform her that novice verna sauventreen came to the prelates office without authorization or invitation and further she carried on in a tirade unbecoming of a novice hoping one day to be a sister of the light sister finella shifted herself in annoyance as she glared up at sister verna my my novice verna your first day in your pursuit of higher calling and already youve earned a letter of reprimand she clicked her tongue i do so hope you learn to behave yourself if you ever hope to be a sister of the light that will be all novice sister ulicia said you are dismissed sister verna turned on her heel she heard the snap of fingers she looked back over her shoulder to see sister ulicia tapping the corner of her desk the journey book and i dont believe that is the way a novice departs when she is dismissed by a sister is it novice sister verna pried the small black book from behind her belt and gently set it on the corner of the desk no sister it is not she curtsied thank you sisters for your time sister verna sighed to herself as she closed the door against her back she stood for a moment considering eyes to the floor before her she made her way back through the palace down halls both opened and closed both stone and paneled across floors carpeted and tiled rounding a corner she came suddenly upon someone she looked up into a face she had been hoping not to see he smiled in a familiar manner verna how good to see you his young squarejawed face looked unchanged his wavy brown hair was worn a little longer over his ears than before and his shoulders were broader than she remembered she had to restrain herself from touching his cheek from falling into his arms she bowed her head jedidiah she gazed up into his brown eyes you look fit you look the same as you have always looked you wear the time well you look i guess the word you are searching for is old i look old ah verna a few wrinkles he glanced down her body a few pounds do not diminish a beauty such as yours i see your tongue is still in good form around women she glanced to his plain tan robes and i can see youve been a good student as always and have managed to advance yourself im proud of you jedidiah he shrugged off the compliment and pressed his fingers together tell me about the new one you brought in her eyes narrowed youve not seen me in twentyodd years since i rose from your bed to go on my journey and that is your question for me not how have i fared not how do i feel about you after all this time not has your heart found another well i guess the shock of seeing how ive aged has made those questions fly right from your head the sly smile stayed on his lips verna youre not a silly girl surely you must realize that in the passing of so much time neither of us could be expected to of course i know that i had no delusions of us i had simply hoped to return and be treated with a little tact and sensitivity he shrugged again im sorry verna i always thought of you as a woman who appreciated candor one who had no use for word sports his eyes went out of focus i guess ive learned so much about life since back then when i was so young she removed her glare from his handsome face and started away good night jedidiah what of my question his voice had an unpleasant edge to in he softened it whats the new one like she halted but didnt turn you were there i saw you what you saw of richard is what he is i also saw what happened to you im gaining a little influence among some of the sisters maybe i can do something to help you with your situation he gestured vaguely with a hand if youre open with me and satisfy my curiosity maybe i can help you out of your unfortunate predicament she started out again good night jedidiah ill be seeing you around the palace verna think on it she couldnt believe how ignorant she had been all those years ago she remembered jedidiah as caring and sincere maybe her memory was addled maybe she was just thinking of herself and hadnt given him the chance to be kinder she must look a mess she should have cleaned herself up put on a nice dress at least fixed her unruly hair before she saw jedidiah but she had not had the chance maybe if she had touched his cheek he would have remembered the spark of something maybe remembered the tears he shed the day she left and the promises he had made promises she knew the moment they left his lips would be broken before their echo faded so long ago she came to the hall that led to the novices apartments she stood looking down at the doors she was tired sunup to sundown in the stables was going to be exhausting she turned the other way instead she had one other thing to do before she slept pasha came to a stop before a doorway with a casing of stone carved to look like vines nestled in the center of the stone vines was a large roundtopped fumed oak door pasha lifted an eyebrow to him your dungeon theres no bolt on the outside of the door how will you lock me in she seemed surprised by the question we dont lock our boys in youre free to come and go as you please richard frowned you mean im free to roam this building no youre free to go wherever you wish you may go most anywhere in the palace or into the city if you wish most of the boys spend a great deal of their time in the city her face reddened a little at the last of what she said and she looked away from his face what about the country around the city she shrugged and then pulled the shoulder of her blue dress back up a little of course i dont know why you would want to go into the countryside none of the other boys do but theres nothing stopping you from going outside either the palace or the city a worried wrinkle came to her brow but you must stay clear of the hagen woods it is extremely dangerous were you warned about the hagen woods were you shown where it is while you journeyed to the palace richard nodded how far may i go into the countryside the radahan will prevent you from going too far afield we must be able to find you but the limit is a good number of miles in a radius around the palace of the prophets how many miles farther than you would want to go i expect almost all the way to the land of the savages you mean the baka ban mana she nodded nearly that far i would expect unguarded she put her hands on her hips you are assigned to me i will accompany you most everywhere you go for now after our boys are more experienced they go off on their own when they wish whenever i want i can simply wander around well you live here at the palace of course and you must be around for your lessons i will give you lessons and so will a number of the sisters we will teach you to touch your han and then once you are able to do that we will begin to teach you how to control it why different sisters why not just one or you because sometimes the han of certain people works better together also the sisters have more experience than me have more knowledge there may be one or several of us who are better able to help you and so different sisters give you lessons until we discover with whom you work best will sister verna be one of those pasha gave him a look from under her eyebrows verna is no longer a sister she is no longer entitled to the appellation she is a novice now and should be addressed simply as verna novices other than the one assigned to you that is me are not allowed to give lessons novices of the first rank like verna are not allowed to have anything to do with our boys the duty of a novice is to learn not to teach richard didnt think he could ever think of sister verna as simply verna it sounded too strange to him when will she be a sister again she must serve as a novice and advance as any other novice i started scrubbing pots in the kitchens when i was little it has taken me this long to be given this chance one day if verna works as hard as i have then she too will have the chance to be a sister of the light until then verna is a novice richard fumed at the thought of sister verna being demoted on his account by the time she was again a sister she would be an old woman he changed the subject and why are we allowed to roam around because you are not a danger to the people someday when you learn to control your han then you begin to have limits placed on where you may go the people in the city are afraid of boys who can wield the power unfortunate incidents have happened in the past and so once a boy becomes skilled at handling his han he is then restricted from the city as the boys advance as wizards they are placed under more restrictions until near the end and their release when they are confined to certain areas of the palace but for now youre free to go almost anywhere you wish i will know where you are all the time by your radahan you mean any sister can find me by this cursed thing no only the one who gave it to you because she held it and recognizes its power and since im in charge of you i must be able to know where you are at all times so i will need to allow my han to recognize your radahans unique feel she pushed the door open and went into the dark room with a sweep of her arm lamps set all around the room sprang to flame you must teach me that trick he muttered its not a trick its simply my han and thats the simplest of many things i will teach you the ceiling of the huge room was painted around its molding with differentcolored lines in intricate patterns the walls were paneled in cherry of a warm color tall windows hung with rich deep blue moire drapes looked out on the night there was a fireplace with a white column to each side most of the wood floor was covered with thick carpets comfortablelooking chairs and couches were placed about the room and arranged in front of the fireplace richard thought that his whole house would fit twice into the room he slipped the pack off his back and leaned it against the wall next to the fireplace he stood the quiver of arrows and the unstrung bow beside it he went to the right to a set of double doors made up of small panes of glass and covered over with sheer creamcolored curtains beyond the doors was an expansive balcony overlooking the city stone urns filled with flowers were set about the slate floor of the balcony he put his fingers to the marble railing as he looked to his right past the sparkling lights of the city to the hills from where he had come the sunsets are beautiful from this balcony pasha said richard wasnt interested in sunsets he studied the courtyard below the gates the roads the patrolling soldiers and the bridges to the city and the hills beyond he tried to fix a map of it all into his head he went back inside and marched to the other end of the room to the doorway there beyond was a bedroom almost as large as the first room it held the largest bed he had ever seen covered with a deep purple quilt another pair of glassed doors led to another balcony but this one looked south out over the sea its a beautiful view pasha said a romantic view she saw that he was looking to the sections of the palace below she pointed across that courtyard are some of the womens quarters where most of the sisters rooms are she shook the finger at him you will stay away from them young man she turned away unless a sister invites you to her room she added under her breath what do i call you he asked sister pasha she giggled no im a novice though i hope to become a sister if i prove myself with you until then i am simply pasha richard turned to her directing a glare to her eyes my name is richard do you have trouble remembering it look here you are assigned to me and if that is too difficult for you to remember you have no chance of ever becoming a sister because if you insist on trying to demean me by calling me by other than my name i will see to it that you quickly fail in your test he leaned over her as he glowered down at her wide eyes do you understand pasha she swallowed you will not raise your voice to me young she lifted her chin a little you will not raise your voice to me richard thats better thank you he hoped she would leave it at that he was in no mood to be kind if she was not he turned away this balcony held less of a view of the things he was interested in and so he went back into the bedroom she followed on his heels look here richard you will learn some manners or else i will that was the end of his indulgence he spun to her she lurched to a halt almost colliding with him youve never been in charge of anyone before have you she didnt move i would say that this is the first time you have been given responsibility and you are terrified you will muck it up since you are inexperienced you think acting like a tyrant will fool people into thinking you know what you are doing well i her voice trailed off as he leaned down putting his face close to hers you should not be frightened of letting me see that you are inexperienced at commanding people pasha what you should be frightened of is that i will kill you her eyes narrowed with indignation dont you dare threaten me this is a game to you a way for you to fulfill some arcane rules by prancing around pulling your little puppy around by his collar and training him to lick your hand so you may gain a new rank he gritted his teeth as he lowered his voice it is not a game to me pasha its a matter of life and death i am a prisoner held in a collar as a beast or a slave i have only as much control of my life as you people allow i know i am to be tortured by you as a way of breaking my will you are wrong pasha if you think that im making a threat im not i am making a promise im not what you think of me richard she said in a small voice i want to be your friend you are not my friend you are my captor he held a finger up in front of her face dont you ever turn your back on me because i will kill you just as i killed the last person who held me prisoner in a collar she blinked up at him richard i dont know what happened to you before but were not like that i want to be a sister of the light to help people see the creators goodness richard was dangerously close to letting the magic slip from his control he struggled to maintain his grip he had other things to do i am not interested in your theology just remember what i told you she smiled i will i apologize for making you angry by calling you other than by your name please forgive me ive never done this before i was only doing as i thought i should following the rules as i was trained forget the rules just be yourself and you will have less trouble in life if that would help you believe that im only trying to help you then thats what i shall do she pointed here sit on the edge of the bed why though she didnt move he felt a gentle push he fell back to sit on the edge of the bed dont she stepped between his legs close to him hush let me do my job i told you before i must let my han come to know your radahan so i will know where you are at all times she put her hands to each side of his neck over the collar she closed her eyes her breasts were right in front of his face moving with each breath he felt a soft tingling sensation that sank all the way to his toes and then came back up through him it was slightly uncomfortable but not unpleasant and in fact the longer it went on the better it felt when she took her hands away the absence of the sensation was agony for a moment the world seemed to hum and spin he shook his head what did you do i simply let my han come to know your radahan she looked a little dazed she swallowed as a tear ran down her cheek and something of your han your essence she turned away richard stood does that mean that you will always know where i am now by my collar she nodded weakly as she strode slowly across the room her voice regained its control what are your preferences for food your special requirements i dont eat meat she stopped in her tracks thats one ive never heard before and i guess i dont like cheese anymore either she considered a moment and then walked on i will tell the cooks your special requirements a plan was forming in his head and she wasnt part of it he needed to get rid of her pasha went to a tall pickledpine wardrobe it was filled with fine clothes there were trousers of a smooth weave at least a dozen shirts mostly white some with ruffles and coats of every color these are yours she said if everyone was surprised i was grown why are they a size of a grown man she inspected the various items feeling the fabric taking some out and holding them up for a better look someone must have known verna must have told them sister verna she put a black coat back im sorry richard but it is just verna now she pulled out a white shirt do you like this no i would look foolish wearing fancy things like that she smiled coquettishly i think you would look very handsome in it but if it doesnt please you there are coins on the table over there ill show you some shops in the city and you may purchase whatever you like better richard glanced to the marbletopped table there was a silver bowl of silver coins and next to it a gold bowl heaped full with gold coins if he worked his whole life as a guide he would never earn even half that much gold its not mine of course it is youre a guest of the palace and the palace provides whatever our guests require if you use that up it will be replaced she pulled out a red coat with gold brocade on the shoulders and cuffs her eyes brightened richard this would look simply grand on you even if you cover a collar with precious gems its still a collar this has nothing to do with your radahan what youre wearing is disgusting you look like some savage from the woods she held the red coat open here try this on he snatched the coat from her hands and threw it on the bed gripping her by the arm he marched her to the door in the front room richard stop it what are you doing he pulled the door open im tired its been a long day good night pasha richard im only trying to help you look better you look uncivilized in that outfit you look like some huge beast he went calm as he took in her blue dress blue the color of kahlans wedding dress that color does not become you he said does not become you at all she stood in the hall staring at him with big brown eyes he kicked the door shut he waited a few minutes and then checked the hall there was no sign of her he went to his pack beside the fireplace and started taking things out he wouldnt need everything no need carrying all his extra clothes as he was stretching the string to the bow there was a soft rap at the door he crept across the carpets listening maybe she would go away if he didnt answer it he didnt need her hanging around telling him what to wear he had important things to do the soft knock came again maybe it wasnt pasha richard pulled his knife he yanked the door open sister verna i just saw pasha running down the hall in tears im surprised at you richard she lifted an eyebrow to him i didnt think it would take you that long ive been hiding around a corner afraid i would be caught while i waited a shawl capped her curly hair and spread down over her shoulders did you have to make her cry she is fortunate i didnt make her bleed she lifted the shawl from her head and settled it around her shoulders a small smile touched her lips may i come in he held out his arm in invitation and it is simply verna she said as she stepped through the threshold i am not a sister he slipped the knife back into its sheath im sorry but i dont think i could bring myself to call you anything else to me you are sister verna it is not proper to address me as sister she looked around the room aslie closed the door how are the accommodations they would not embarrass a king sister verna i know you wont believe me but im really sorry about what happened i didnt mean to bring my troubles down on you a broad grin spread on her face you have been a constant trouble to me richard but for once this trouble was not caused by you another brought this trouble upon me sister i know i caused you to be broken to a novice i didnt intend that but the part about you being sent to work in the stables that was your own doing things are not always as they seem richard there was a twinkle in her eye i hate scrubbing pots when i was a novice when i was young i hated that more than anything else im not happy in a kitchen and less so with my hands in scalding water i like horses much better they dont talk back or argue with me i like being around horses more so since you destroyed the bits and i became friends with jessup sister maren thought she held the reins as it were but she was doing what i wished richard smiled with one side of his mouth you are a very devious woman sister verna im proud of you but im still sorry you are put back to novice because of me she shrugged i am here to serve the creator it matters not how and this is not your doing the prelates orders are what caused me to be broken to a novice you mean the orders she wrote in the book she forbade you from using your power on me didnt she how do you know that i figured it out you were often angry enough to spit fire at me but you never used your power to stop me i dont think that would have happened unless you were under orders to watch but not to interfere after all if the radahan is used to control why else would you not use that control she shook her head to herself you are a very devious person yourself richard how long have you known since i read the book in the tower why are you here sister i wanted to see if you were all right starting tomorrow i wont get the chance again at least not for a very long time not until im raised to sister of the light again firstrank novices arent allowed to have anything to do with young wizards the penalty is quite severe your first day as a novice and already youre breaking the rules you shouldnt be here youll be up to your elbows in scalding water and dirty pots if they catch you she shrugged some things are more important than rules richard frowned at the distant look in her eyes why dont you sit i dont have time i only came to keep a promise she pulled something from a pocket and to bring you this she lifted his hand and placed something in it then closed his fingers around it when richard opened his fingers and looked his knees almost buckled it was the lock of kahlans hair he had thrown away sister verna clasped her hands together the first night the first night we were together i found that without looking up he whispered what do you mean you found it she leaned back and looked up at the ceiling after you fell asleep after you decided not to kill me i went for a walk and i found it his eyes slid closed i cant take this he managed to make himself say i have set her free kahlan made a great sacrifice to save your life i promised her that i would not let you forget that she loves you richards strength had vanished the muscles in his legs quivered his hand shook i cant take this she sent me away i have set her free sister verna spoke softly she loves you richard please as a favor to me take it i have violated the rules to bring this to you i made a promise to kahlan to make sure you know she loves you i was reminded again today what a rare thing real love is richard felt as if the whole weight of the palace had fallen down on him all right sister as a favor to you but i know she doesnt want me if you love someone you dont ask them to put a collar around their neck you dont send them away she wishes to be free i love her and so i have set her free someday richard i hope you will realize how much she has sacrificed and the truth of her love love is a precious thing and should not be forgotten i dont know what your life holds in store but someday you will find love again but i think you need a friend more than anything else right now im sincere in my offer richard will you take this collar off me she was silent a moment her voice came heavy with regret i cannot richard it would bring you to harm i have a duty to preserve your life the collar must stay on he nodded i have no friends i am in enemy territory in enemy hands thats not true but im afraid that as a novice i wont have the chance to convince you otherwise pasha looks like a nice young woman try to make friends with her richard you need a friend i cant make friends with someone i may have to kill i meant every word i said today sister i know richard she whispered i know but pasha is almost your age sometimes its easier to make friends with those your own age i think she would like to be your friend for a novice this is as important a time as it is for a young wizard the relationship between a novice and the wizard she is assigned is unique the bond that will grow is very special and will last the lifetime of each she too is frightened her whole life she has been a student a novice now for the first time she is the teacher not only the boy learns but the girl too they both are entering a new life it is a very special thing for both slave and master that is the only bond she sighed i doubt any novice has ever faced a task like the one pasha will have try to be understanding of her richard pasha is going to have her hands full with you the creator knows the prelate herself would have her hands full with you richard stared off at nothing have you ever killed anyone you loved sister well no richard lifted the agiel in his fist denna held me by my magic as do the sisters she kept a collar around my neck as do the sisters they had tortured her until she was mad enough to do the same to me i understood how she could do it because i would have done anything she said to keep from being hurt anymore he was hardly aware of the pain from the agiel ripping through him i understood her and i loved her a tear ran down his face that was the only way i was able to escape she controlled the rage of the sword because i was able to love her i was able to turn the blade of the sword of truth white dear creator sister verna whispered her eyes wide you have turned the swords blade white richard closed his eyes and nodded i had to take the love of her into my heart only then could i turn the blade white only then could i run it through her while she looked lovingly into my eyes only because i loved her could i kill her and escape as long as i live i will never be able to forgive myself sister verna embraced him protectively dear creator she whispered what have you done to your child richard pushed her away go sister before you get into trouble he wiped his eyes im being foolish she gripped his shoulders why didnt you tell me this before he wiped his sleeve across his nose its not something im proud of and you are the enemy sister he looked to her wet eyes ive told you the truth i told the other sisters the truth today i will kill anyone i must sister im capable of killing anyone im the bringer of death im a monster thats why kahlan wanted me sent away she brushed his hair back from his face she loves you richard she was trying to save your life someday you will see that she sighed im sorry i must go will you be all right his smile was empty i dont think so sister i think there is going to be war i think im going to end up killing sisters i hope you arent one of them she wiped her fingers across his cheek we never know what the creator has in store for us if this creator of yours has any power i think youll be restored to sister a lot sooner than you think sister i must go good luck to you richard have faith as soon as she was gone he threw his cloak around his shoulders and put on his pack he had to act now while they were still afraid of him while they were still unsure he checked that the sword was clear in its scabbard he hooked the quiver on his pack and shouldered his bow as he moved out onto the balcony with a running knot richard attached the rope to the stone railing he put his knife between his teeth and then slipped over the edge into the darkness into his element chapter night didnt seem to diminish the number of people on the streets of tanimura the little fires cooking meat on sticks still burned and the hawkers still conducted a brisk business men called to him to come throw dice with them once they saw his collar people tried to entice him into buying everything from food to shell necklaces for his lady he told them that he had no coins they laughed saying that the palace would pay for anything he wanted richard hunched his shoulders and kept walking women dressed in flimsy revealing clothes pressed against him giggling and smiling as they ran their hands over him trying to get fingers into his pockets they made him offers he could hardly believe pushing didnt get them away his glare did richard was relieved to leave the city behind to leave the lights of torches lamps candles and fires behind to leave behind the smells and the noise he breathed easier when he was into the moonlit country he glanced over his shoulder at the twinkling lights while he climbed the hills he was constantly aware of the collar around his neck and wondered what would happen if he went too far though from what pasha had told him that was many more miles than he intended to go still he worried she might be wrong and that the slack in his chain might suddenly snap tight finally he reached a satisfactory spot he surveyed the grassy prominence overlooking the city in the distance a little way off to the side in the swale he could see the dark shapes of old trees looming up in the moonlight shadows black as death lurked in the gaps richard stared at the menacing gloom for a time transfixed by a faint lingering desire to go into the waiting folds of its night something in him hungered to go in there and call forth the magic something in him lusted to bring forth the rage to let it vent its wrath vent his wrath it felt as if his frustration at being held against his will his anger at being a helpless prisoner his fear at not knowing what was going to happen to him and his heartache for kahlan all needed to be let out like pounding a fist against a wall when you were angry somehow those woods promised him that release richard finally turned from the hagen woods and set about collecting firewood with his knife he whittled a pile of shavings into a bare spot he had scooped out with his boot striking steel and flint he started the shavings to smoldering and once they had taken with a good flame he piled on some wood once the fire was going nicely he set out a pot poured in water and started cooking rice and beans while he waited for it to cook he finished a small piece of bannock he still had left he sat his arms curled around his knees and watched the dark woods the hagen woods he watched the city shimmering in the distance the sky overhead was a sparkling canopy of stars he watched the sky too waiting to see a familiar shape blacken a patch of stars after a time he heard a soft thud behind him he laughed when the furry arms grabbed him and tumbled him onto the ground gratch gurgled with his throaty laugh his arms and legs and wings trying to enwrap his opponent richard tickled his ribs and gratch roared with a deep growling laughter the tussle ended with gratch finally on top hugging richard with arms and wings richard embraced the little gar tightly grrratch luuug raaaach aaarg richard squeezed him tighter i love you too gratch gratch put his wrinkly nose to richards his glowing green eyes looked down and he let out in a throaty giggle richard wrinkled his nose gratch your breath smells he sat up holding the gar in his lap did you catch some food on your own gratch nodded enthusiastically richard hugged him again im so proud of you and you did it without blood flies what did you get gratch cocked his head to the side his furry ears turned forward did you get a turtle richard asked gratch giggled and shook his head did you get a deer gratch sagged with a regretful growl did you get a rabbit gratch bounced and shook his head enjoying the game i give up what did you have to eat gratch covered his eyes with his claws peeking out between them a raccoon you got a raccoon gratch nodded with a toothy grin then threw his head back and roared as he pounded his chest richard patted the beasts back good for you very good gratch gave a gurgling giggle and then tried to push richard back for more wrestling richard was relieved that the gar was finally able to start catching his own food he made gratch sit still and settle down while he checked the rice and beans he held the pot out you want some of my dinner with me gratch leaned close and carefully smelled the pot he knew it was hot he had gotten a burn before and was careful now when richard cooked things he wrinkled his nose at the rice and beans he made a croaking sound and rolled his shoulders richard knew that meant he wasnt enthusiastic but if nothing better was forthcoming he would have some richard poured him some in his own bowl blow on it its hot gratch held the tin bowl to his face and pursed his leathery lips he blew air and spit between his fangs as he tried to cool his snack richard ate with a spoon as he watched the gar trying to lick the rice and beans from the bowl finally gratch rolled onto his back and holding the bowl with his claws and feet poured its contents in his mouth in three swallows it was gone gratch sat up and flapped his wings he scooted close with a plaintive babble he held out his bowl to richard richard showed him the empty pot all gone gratchs ears wilted he put a hooked claw to richards bowl and gave it a little tug richard pulled his bowl away and turned his back mine its my dinner gratch resigned himself to waiting patiently while richard finished eating when richard pulled his knees up and wrapped his arms around them as he watched the city gratch squatted and tried to imitate the pose richard pulled the lock of hair from his pocket he twirled it in the moonlight staring while he watched it turning gratch thrust out a claw richard elbowed it away no he said in a low voice you can touch but only if youre gentle gratch reached out tentatively slowly carefully touching a claw to the lock of hair his glowing green eyes looked up studying he stroked the claw down richards hair gratch touched richards cheek touched a tear rolling down richard sniffed and swallowed he put the lock of hair back in his pocket gratch put a gangly arm around richards shoulder and laid his head against him richard put his arm around gratch and they watched the night for a time finally deciding he had better get some sleep richard found a spot of thick grass on which to spread a blanket he lay down with gratch curled up close and the two of them fell asleep together richard woke when the moon was nearly down he sat up and stretched gratch made fists and imitated richard adding wings to the yawning stretch richard rubbed his eyes it would be dawn in an hour or two it was time he stood gratch coming up beside him i want you to listen to me gratch i have some important things to tell you are you listening gratch nodded his wrinkly face set in a serious cast richard pointed to the city you see that place with all the fire all the light im going to live there for a while richard tapped his chest and then pointed to the city im going to be down there but i dont want you to visit me there you must stay away its a dangerous place for you you stay away gratch watched richards face ill come up here to visit you all right gratch thought a moment and then nodded you stay away from the city and you see the river down there you know what a river is ive shown you water you stay on this side of the water this side understand richard didnt want the gar hunting the livestock on the farms on the other side of the river that would surely get him in trouble gratch looked from richards face to the city and then back he made a sound from deep in his throat to express his understanding and gratch if you see any people richard tapped his chest and pointed to the city people like me dont you eat them he put a finger in front of gratchs face people are not food dont eat any people understand gratch growled in disappointment and then nodded richard put an arm around the gars shoulders and turned him toward the hagen woods now listen this is important you see that place down there those woods a low menacing growl rose from the gars throat his lips drew back from his fangs the glow in his green eyes intensified you stay out of there i dont want you going into that place i mean it gratch you stay away gratch watched the woods the growl still in his throat richard gripped a fistful of fur and gave him a shake you stay away from there understand gratch glanced over and finally nodded i have to go in there but you cant follow its dangerous in there for you stay out with a plaintive pule gratch put an arm around richard and pulled him back a step ill be safe i have the sword remember the sword i showed you my sword it will protect me but you cant come with me richard hoped he was right about the sword sister verna had told him that the hagen woods were a place of vile magic but he had no choice it was the only plan he could think of richard gave the gar a tight hug you be a good boy go hunt yourself some more food ill be coming up here to see you and well wrestle all right gratch grinned at the mention of wrestling he pulled hopefully on richards arm not now gratch i have something i must do but ill come back on another night and wrestle with you gratchs ears wilted again his long arms wrapped around richard in a goodbye hug richard collected his things and with a final wave headed down into the swale gratch watched as the dark woods swallowed him up richard walked for close to an hour he needed to be deep enough into the hagen woods to make sure his plan would work limbs draped with moss and vines looked like arms reaching out to snatch him sounds drifted through the trees guttural clicking and long low whistles off in stagnant stretches of water things splashed at his approach warm and breathing hard with the effort of the walk he came to a small clearing high enough to be dry and open enough to afford him the view of a small patch of stars there was no rock or log in the clearing so he flattened a thick clump of grass and sat down beside his pack crossing his legs he closed his eyes and drew a deep breath richard thought about home and the hartland woods he longed to be back in his woods he thought about the friends he missed so much chase and zedd all the time he had grown up with the old man richard had never known zedd was his grandfather but he had known he was his friend and that they loved each other he guessed that was what mattered what difference would it have made anyway richard could not have loved him more and zedd could not have been more of a friend it had been so long since he had seen zedd although he had seen him at the peoples palace in dhara he hadnt really had much time to talk with him to catch up on things he shouldnt have left so soon he wished he could talk to zedd now to seek his help and understanding richard had no idea if kahlan would go to zedd why should she she was rid of richard and that was what she wanted he wished with all his heart it werent so he missed her smile her green eyes the soft sound of her voice her intelligence and wit her touch she made the world alive for him he would have given his life at that moment just to hold her for five minutes but she knew what he was and had sent him away and he had set her free it was for the best he wasnt good enough for her before he realized what he was doing he was seeking the peace within himself seeking his han as sister verna had taught him he had practiced almost every day when he had been with her and although he never felt his han whatever it was it had always felt pleasant to seek it it was relaxing and brought peace it felt good to do that now he let his mind find that place of peace and let his worries drift away in his mind as he always did he pictured the sword of truth floating in space before his minds eye he saw every detail of it felt every detail of it in his peace in his meditation without opening his eyes richard drew his sword he wasnt quite sure why except it felt the right thing to do the unique ring of steel hung in the night air announcing the blades arrival to the hagen woods he laid the sword across his knees the magic danced with him in the place of peace if anything came he would be ready now he had to wait it would be quite a while he was sure but she would come when she realized where he was she would come as he sat still and quiet the night returned to its normal activity around him while he concentrated on the picture of the sword richard was vaguely aware of the chirps and clicks of bugs the low steady croaks of frogs and the rustling of mice and voles among the dry debris of the forest floor the air occasionally whirred with a bat once he heard a squeak as an owl caught its dinner and then while in the dreamlike haze as he sat and pictured the sword the night became still in his mind he saw the dark shape behind him in one fluid movement richard was up and spinning the sword tip whistling through the air the flowing shape pitched back and lunged again when the sword was past richard felt a thrill that he had missed that it would not be ended so soon that he could dance with the spirits that he could let the rage free it moved like a cape in the wind dark as death and just as quick around the clearing they darted the sword glinting in the waning light of the moon the blade slicing the air the dark shapes bladelike claws flashing past richard immersed himself in the swords magic in its wrath in his own he freed his anger and frustration to join with the swords own fury reveling in the dance with death across the clearing they spun like leaves in a gale one avoiding the blade the other the claws lunging and ducking they used the trees for cover and attack richard let the spirits of the sword dance with him he immersed himself in the magics mastery he let himself do as the spirits counseled and he watched almost in a detached state as they spun him this way and that had him skim across the ground dodge right then left leap and thrust he hungered to learn the dance teach me knowledge like memory flowed forth forged by his will into the completing link he became not the user of the sword the magic the spirits but their master the blade the magic the spirits and the man were one the dark shape lunged now with a solid thwack the blade halved the shape a spray of blood hit the trees close by a death howl shivered the air and then all was still richard stood panting almost sorry it was over almost he had danced with the spirits of the dead with the magic and in so doing had found the release he sought release not only of some of his feelings of helpless frustration but release too of darker needs deep within himself that he didnt understand the sun had been up for nearly two hours when he heard her coming she was blundering through the brush huffing indignantly at branches that snagged her clothes he could hear twigs snap as she staggered up the rise tugging her skirt free from a thorn she stumbled into the clearing before him richard was sitting crosslegged with his eyes closed and the sword resting across his knees she came to a panting halt before him richard good morning pasha he opened his eyes beautiful day isnt it she held her long brown skirt up a little in her hands her white blouse was damp with sweat her hair had burrs in it pasha blew a strand of hair from her face you have to get out of here at once richard this is the hagen woods i know sister verna told me interesting place i rather like it she blinked at him richard this place is dangerous what are you doing here richard smiled to her waiting for you she peered around at trees and dark shadows something smells awful in here she muttered pasha squatted down in front of him smiling a little smile as a person might to a child or to someone she thought was insane richard youve had your fun your nice walk in the country now give me your hand and lets get out of here im not leaving until verna is restored to sister again pasha shot to her feet what richard took his sword in hand and rose in front of her im not leaving here until verna is restored to the rank of sister the same as she was before the palace must choose whats more important to them my life or keeping sister verna a novice pashas mouth fell open but the only one who can remove vernas sanction is sister maren i know he touched his finger to her nose thats why youre going to go and tell sister maren she must come here in person and give me her solemn pledge that verna is once again a sister and agree to my terms you cant be serious sister maren will not do that im not leaving this spot unless she does richard well go back and see if sister maren will discuss this but you cant stay here its not worth dying for he regarded her with a cool expression it is to me her tongue wet her lips richard you dont know what youre doing this is a dangerous place im responsible for you i cannot allow you to stay here if you wont come away with me then i will have to use the collar and make you come with me and i know you dont want that richards grip tightened on the swords hilt sister verna is being punished in retaliation against me i have made a vow to myself to restore verna to sister i cant allow the sanction to stand ill do whatever i must die here if i have to if you use the collar to hurt me or drag me off ill fight you with everything i have i dont know who will win but if that happens i am sure of one thing one of us will die if its you then the war will have started if i die then your test to become a sister will end on the first day sister verna will still be a novice but that is where she stands now at least i will have done my best you would be willing to die for this yes its that important to me i will not allow sister verna to be punished because of what i have done it was unjust her brow wrinkled but sister maren is the headmistress of the novices im a novice i cant go to her and tell her she must reverse the order shell skin me alive i am the cause of the trouble you are simply the messenger if she punishes you i would not stand for it any more than i will stand for what was done to sister verna if sister maren wishes to start a war then let it start if she wishes to keep my truce then she will have to come to me here and agree to my terms pasha stared at him richard if you are here when the sun goes down you will die then i would suggest you hurry she turned holding her arm out toward the city but i must go all the way back it took me hours to get here it will take me hours to go back and then i must find sister maren and then convince her that youre serious and even if i could get her to agree to return with me we must still get back here you should have ridden a horse but i ran here as soon as i realized where you were i wasnt thinking about a horse or anything else i knew there was trouble and just came after you he gave her an even look then you made a mistake pasha you should have thought before you acted next time maybe you will think first pasha put a hand to her chest as she gulped air richard there is hardly time then you had better hurry or your new charge will be sitting here in hagen woods when the sun goes down her eyes moistened with frustration and concern richard please you dont understand this is no game this place is dangerous he turned a little and pointed with the sword yes i know pasha peered around him to the shadows and gasped hesitantly she stepped to the thing by the trees richard didnt follow he knew what was there two halves of a creature from a nightmare its guts spilled across the ground its sinuous head like a mans half melted into a snake or lizard was a picture of wickedness itself covered in a glossy tight black skin smooth down to the base of the thick neck where it began welting up into pliable scales the lithe body was shaped much like a mans the whole of the creature seemed made for fluid speed deadly quick grace it wore hides covered with short black hair and a fulllength black hooded cape what richard had taken for claws were not claws but threebladed knives one in each webbed hand with crosswise handles held in the fist steel extensions went up each side of the wrist for support when a strike was made pasha stood dumbstruck richard finally went to stand by her looking down at the two halves of the thing whatever it was it bled the same as any other creature and it smelled like fish guts rotting in the hot sun pasha stood trembling as she stared at the thing dear creator she whispered its a mriswith she took a step back what happened to it what happened to it i killed it thats what happened to it what sort of thing is a mriswith her big brown eyes came to his what do you mean you killed it you cant kill a mriswith no one has ever killed a mriswith her face was a picture of consternation well someone has killed one now you killed it at night didnt you yes richard frowned how do you know that mriswith are rarely seen outside hagen woods but there have been reports over the last few thousand years reports given by people who somehow managed to live long enough to tell what they saw the mriswith always take on the color of what is around them in one report one rose up in the tidal flats and was the color of mud one time in the sand dunes it was the color of the sand one report noted that in the light of a golden sunset the mriswith was golden when they kill at night theyre never seen because they are black like the night we think they have the ability maybe the magic to assume the color of their surroundings since this one is black i guessed that you killed it at night richard took her arm gently pulling her away she seemed transfixed by the creature he could feel her trembling under his hand pasha what are they things that live in the hagen woods i dont know what they are ive heard it said that in the war that separated the new world from the old the wizards created armies of the mriswith some people believe the mriswith are sent by the nameless one but the hagen woods are their home and the home of other things they are why no one lives out in the country on this side of the river sometimes they come out of the woods and hunt people they never devour their kills they seem simply to kill for the sake of killing mriswith disembowel their victims some live long enough to tell what got them that is how we know as much as we know how long have the hagen woods the creatures been here as far as i know at least as long as the palace of the prophets nearly three thousand years she took a fistful of his shirt in all that time no one not once has ever killed a mriswith every victim said that they never saw it until after it slashed them open some of those victims have been sisters and wizards and not even their han warned them they said they were blind to its coming as if they were born without the gift how is it you were able to kill a mriswith richard remembered seeing it coming in his mind he took her hand from his shirt maybe i was just lucky someone was bound to get one sooner or later maybe this one was just a halfwit richard please come away with me this is not the way to have a test of wills with the palace this could get you killed im not testing anyones will im taking responsibility for my actions its my fault sister verna was demoted ive got to set it straight im taking a stand for whats right if i dont do that then i am nothing richard if the sun sets on you in the hagen woods you are wasting precious time pasha chapter it was late afternoon when he heard them coming he heard the sound of only one horse and pashas voice calling out the direction at last they broke into the clearing richard sheathed his sword bonnie he gave the horses neck a scratch how you doing girl bonnie nuzzled his chest richard pushed his fingers in the side of her mouth and felt the bit while sister maren frowned at him im glad to see you use a snaffle bit sister the stableboys said they couldnt find the spade bits she glared down at him suspiciously seems they vanished mysteriously that so richard shrugged cant say im sorry pasha was panting with the effort of having kept up with the sister on her horse her white blouse was soaked with sweat she fussed hopelessly with the matted tangled mess of her hair the sister must have made pasha walk as punishment sister maren in her plain brown dress buttoned to her neck looked cool and comfortable atop the horse so richard sister maren said as she dismounted i am here as you requested what is it you want she knew very well what he wanted but richard decided to restate it in a pleasant tone its quite simple sister verna is to be restored to sister at once and you are also to return her dacra to her she gestured dismissively and here i thought you would want something unreasonable this is simple it is done verna is returned to sister it makes no difference to me and when she asks why i dont want you to tell her about this business with me just say you reconsidered or something and decided to reinstate her if you want you can tell her you prayed for guidance from your creator and it came to you that she should remain a sister she brushed some of her fine sandy hair back from her face that would suit me are you satisfied is everything to your liking that would end it and keep our truce good now that the trifling matters are dispensed with show me this dead bear pasha has half the palace in an uproar with some babble about you killing a mriswith pasha furiously studied the ground as sister maren directed a scolding frown in her direction the foolish child never sets her slippered foot on anything that hasnt been swept scrubbed or polished the only time she sticks her head outofdoors is go see the latest bolt of lace to come to tanimura she wouldnt know a rabbit from an ox and she certainly wouldnt know a what is that smell bear guts richard said he held out his arm showing her the way pasha deferentially stepped aside sister maren straightened her dress at her hips and marched toward the trees pasha peeked up at him and when they heard sister maren gasp her head came the rest of the way up and she smiled when sister maren stepped backward to them her face white as bed sheets pasha resumed her study of the ground sister marens trembling fingers lifted pashas chin you have spoken the truth she whispered forgive me child pasha curtsied of course sister maren thank you for taking the time to witness my report sister marens haughty attitude had vanished to be replaced by sincere concern she turned to richard how did this creature die richard lifted the sword clear of its scabbard a half foot and then slid it home then what pasha said is true you killed it richard shrugged i spend quite a lot of my time outofdoors i knew it was no rabbit sister maren returned to the creature mumbling to herself i must study it this is an unprecedented opportunity pasha looked to richard and wrinkled her nose in disgust as the sister ran her finger over the lipless slit of a mouth touched the ear holes and ran her hand across the glossy black skin she tugged at the hide clothes pulling them this way and that as she inspected them she rose to her feet peering down at the entrails finally she turned to richard where is the cape pasha said it had a cape when the mriswith had lunged and he had sliced it in two the cape had been billowed open and so it was undamaged while richard had been waiting for pasha to return with the sister he had accidentally learned the astonishing thing the cape could do after that he had washed it clean of blood hung it over branches to dry and then stuffed it away in his pack he had no intention of giving that cape away its mine it is a prize of battle im keeping it she looked perplexed but the knives dont men fancy things like that as prizes of battle why would you want a cape instead of the knives richard tapped the hilt i have my sword why would i want knives that have proven inferior to my sword ive always wanted a long black cape and its a fine one so im keeping it the furrows of her scowl stole back onto her face is this another condition of your truce if need be the furrows softened she sighed i guess it doesnt matter it is the creature that is important not its cape she turned back to the reeking corpse i must study this while she bent back to the mriswith richard hooked his bow quiver of arrows and pack to the front of the saddle he put his foot in the stirrup and sprang up onto bonnie dont stay after the sun goes down sister maren she glanced over her shoulder my horse you cant have my horse richard smiled apologetically i twisted my ankle fighting the mriswith im sure you wouldnt want the palaces newest pupil limping all the way home now would you i might fall and crack my skull but richard reached down and gripped pashas arm she gasped in surprise as he yanked her up sitting her behind him on bonnie please dont let the sun set on you here sister i hear its dangerous in the hagen woods after dark pasha hid her face from the sister and he could feel her giggling softly against his back yes yes sister maren said her eyes already lost to the mriswith all right you two go on back you have done well both of you i must study this creature before the animals get to it pasha held him so tight that he could hardly breathe it was distracting to feel her firm breasts mashed against his back her fingers gripped his chest trying to get a better hold on him as if she was afraid she might fall at any moment when they were clear of the woods and into the open hills he slowed bonnie to a walk and pried pashas hands off she clamped them right back richard i might fall he pulled her hands loose again youre not going to fall just hold on easy and let your hips move with the horse use your balance you dont need to cling for dear life she gripped his sides well ill try the sky was turning golden as they descended the rounded hills toward the city richard swayed with bonnies steps as she went over rocks and across shallow ravines and thought about the mriswith and his hunger to fight it the craving to go back into the hagen woods still burned in the back of his mind your ankle isnt really twisted is it pasha asked after a long ride in silence no you lied to a sister richard you must learn that lying is wrong the creator hates lies so sister verna has told me he decided he didnt want to ride anymore with her holding on to him so he dismounted and lead bonnie by the reins pasha scooted forward into the saddle then why did you do it if you know its wrong because i wanted to make sister maren walk back she made you walk all the way out there again as punishment for something that was not your fault pasha slid off bonnie and came up to walk beside him she raked her fingers through her hair trying to arrange it to her satisfaction that was very nice of you she put a hand on his arm i think were going to become good friends richard pretended to turn and look around as he walked so that her arm fell away can you get this collar off me the radahan well no only a full sister is able to remove a radahan i dont know how then we are not going to be friends i have no use for you you have gone to great risk for sister verna she must be your friend a person only does such things for friends you went out of your way to see that i had a horse to ride back you must hope we can become friends richard watched the country ahead as he walked sister verna is not my friend i did as i did only because what was done to her was my fault and was unjust that is the only reason when i decide to get this collar off only those who help me will be my friends sister verna has made it clear that she will not help me get the collar off she intends that it remain on me when the time comes if she stands in my way i will kill her the same as i will kill any other sister who tries to stop me the same as i will kill you if you stand in my way richard she scoffed youre a mere student you shouldnt brag about your powers so its unbecoming to a young man you should not even joke about such things she took his arm again i dont believe you would ever hurt a woman then you believe wrong most young men have trouble adjusting at first but you will come to trust in me we will become friends im sure of it richard yanked his arm away and spun to her this is no game pasha if you get in my way when i decide the time has come i will cut your pretty little throat she peered up at him with a coy smile do you really think i have a pretty neck its a figure of speech he growled he moved on tugging bonnie ahead pasha hastened her step to keep up she walked in silence for a time busying herself with pulling little knots and burrs from her hair richard was in no mood to be pleasant killing the mriswith had brought him a strange feeling of fulfillment but it was fading now and his frustration with his situation was returning and it brought with it the anger pashas face brightened she put on a pleasant smile i dont know anything about you richard why dont you tell me about yourself what do you want to know well what did you do before you came to the palace did you have some kind of skill a profession you worked at richard scuffed his boots through the dirt i was a woods guide where where i grew up in hartland in westland pasha pulled the white blouse away from her chest trying to dry it im afraid i dont know where that is i dont know about the new world someday when im a sister maybe ill be called upon to go there and help a boy richard didnt say anything so she went on so you were a woods guide that must have been scary being out in the woods all the time werent you afraid of the animals id be afraid of the animals why if a rabbit jumped out of a bush you could just burn it to ashes with your han she giggled id still be frightened i like the city better she pulled some hair back from her face and looked at him as they walked she had a funny way of wrinkling her nose did you have a well you know a girl a love or anything richard was taken by surprise at the question his mouth opened but no words came out he snapped it closed he was not about to discuss kahlan with her i have a wife pasha missed a step she hurried to catch back up a wife she considered a moment her voice now had an edge to it what is her name richard kept his eyes straight ahead as he walked her name is du chaillu pasha twisted a strand of hair around her finger is she pretty what does she look like yes she is pretty she has thick black hair a little longer than yours she has attractive breasts and the rest of her is shapely too from the corner of his eye he could see pashas face glowing red she picked at the end of the strand of hair her voice came quiet and cold despite her trying to layer indifference over it how long have you known her a few days her hand fell away from her hair what do you mean a few days how could you only know her a few days when sister verna and i went to the majendie land a few days ago they had her chained up they were going to sacrifice her to their spirits and they wanted me to do the killing sister verna said i was to do as the majendie wished so we could pass through their land instead i disobeyed sister verna and shot an arrow at their queen mother pinning her arm to a pole i told them that if they didnt let du chaillu go and make peace with the baka ban mana i would put the next arrow through the queen mothers head they wisely agreed she is one of the savages she is baka ban mana a wisewoman she is not a savage and she wed you because you were her hero because you rescued her no sister verna and i had to go through her land to come here when we were there i killed her five husbands pasha snatched him by the arm they are blade masters you managed to kill five of them richard started walking again no i killed thirty of them pasha gasped her five husbands were among the thirty du chaillu is their spirit woman and said i was now the leader of her people she said that since she was the spirit woman and i their leader their caharin i was now her husband pashas smile crept back then you arent really her husband she was just telling you some of her savage some of her baka ban mana spirit babble richard didnt say anything pashas smile evaporated her scowl returned then how do you know what her breasts and the rest of her looks like she looked the other way and gave a sniff i suppose she rewarded you for your valor i know because when they sent me in to kill her she had a collar around her neck and she was chained to a wall she was held naked in that collar so that men could rape her whenever they wanted pasha swallowed and looked away again she is with child now by one of those men i guess that because the people to be sacrificed are held in a collar the sisters never gave a thought to putting a stop to it i dont guess the sisters care much what happens to someone in a collar the sisters care pasha said in a small voice richard didnt argue he walked on in silence pasha looked cold as she folded her arms beneath her breasts the sky was turning a deep purple but it was not getting cold it was still warm after a time pashas step regained a bit of its bounce she glanced over the smile back so what about you you have the gift did your father have the gift too is that where it was passed down from richards mood sank like a rock in a well yes my father had the gift she looked up hopefully is he still living no he was killed a short time ago pasha smoothed the front of her skirt oh im sorry richard richards hand tightened on the reins im not im the one who killed him she froze you killed your father your own father richards glare locked on to her he had me captured and put in a collar to be tortured i killed the beautiful young woman who held the leash to that collar and then i killed him she had no trouble mistaking the threat in his voice his words or his eyes her lower lip began to quiver and then pasha burst into tears turned and ran holding her skirts up in her fists she went around an outcropping of rock and ran off over the edge of the hill richard let out a long sigh as he tied the reins to a slab of granite he patted bonnies neck be a good girl wait here for me he found pasha sitting on a rock with her arms wrapped around her knees as she cried richard came around to face her but she turned her face away her shoulders shook as she gasped in racking sobs go away she put her forehead against her knees as she wailed or did you come to slice me to bits pasha all you care about is killing people thats not true i want nothing more than to end the killing oh sure she cried thats why you speak of nothing else thats only because ive been praying for this day nearly my whole life all i ever wanted was to be a sister of the light the sisters help people i wanted to be one of them she succumbed to her tears im never going to be a sister now sure you will not according to you from what you keep telling us you intend to kill us all from the first moment all you have done is threaten us pasha you dont understand her tearstained face came up dont i we had a big banquet to make you feel welcome bigger even than the harvest banquet i had to go without you and tell everyone you were ill they all stared at me the other novices get boys who want to learn my friends have come to me before complaining that their young charge brought them a frog or a bug in his pocket you bring me a mriswith sister maren said we did well today she hardly ever says that its not something she does unless she really means it you were cruel to sister maren she has been headmistress of the novices ever since i came here she is strict but thats because she cares about us she watches out for us pasha gasped back a sob when i was little the first day i came to the palace i was scared i had never been away from home sister maren drew a little picture for me she told me it was a picture of the creator she put it on my pillow and told me he would watch over me in the night so i would be safe pasha tried to stifle the tears but couldnt ive always kept that picture i wanted to give it to my boy on his first night so he wouldnt be afraid i had it with me yesterday when i saw you saw that you were grown i knew i couldnt give it to you i didnt want to embarrass you and when i saw you i thought well pasha hes not a young boy like all the other novices get but the creator has given me the handsomest man i ever saw i was so glad i had on my prettiest dress the one i had been saving for that day she gasped for air and then you tell me im ugly richards eyes slid closed pasha im sorry no youre not she cried youre nothing but a big brute we had everything prepared for you we gave you one of the nicest rooms in the palace you didnt care we provided you with money for whatever you might need or want and you act as if we insulted you we had fine new clothes for you and you turn your nose up at them she wiped her tears but more replaced them td be the first to admit that there are some sisters who think too much of themselves but most are so kind they wouldnt even step on a bug and you hold up a bloody sword in front of them and vow to kill them she held up fists full of her skirt and covered her face as she convulsed in sobs richard put a hand on her shoulder but she pushed it away richard didnt know what to do with his hands pasha im sorry i know it must seem like no youre not youre not sorry at all you want the radahan off but thats what my job is to teach you to use your gift so you can get the collar off but you wont let me without the collar you would have died two sisters have given their lives for you they will never come home to their friends those friends wept in secret and put on a smile to welcome you in return for trying to help you trying to save your life you threaten to kill us all richard put a gentle hand to her head pasha im never going to be a sister instead of getting a boy who wants to learn i get a madman with a sword ill forever be the object of laughter at the palace young girls will be told to behave themselves or theyll end up like pasha maes and be put out like she was my dreams have come to ruin it hurt him to see her sobbing in such pain and sorrow richard took her up in his arms she fought him at first trying to push him away but when he pulled her against him and put her head to his shoulder she went limp and cried all the harder richard held her tight and rubbed her back as she trembled and cried he rocked her gently in his arms i only wanted to help you richard she sobbed i only wanted to teach you he hushed her i know i know it will be all right she shook her head against his shoulder no it wont yes it will youll see finally her hands came up clutching his shirt as she cried richard didnt try to stop her tears he simply held her trying to give her comfort do you really think that you could teach me to use the gift and that then the sisters would take the collar off she sniffled thats my job thats what ive been training for i wanted so much to show you the beauty of the creator of his gift to you thats all i wanted her arms circled him she clung to him as if trying to soak up succor he stroked her hair richard when i touched you yesterday when i touched your radahan and felt something of your han i felt some of your feelings i know you hurt inside it made me hurt just to feel a little of it her hand came up to the side of his neck as if to comfort him i dont know of many things that can cause that much hurt richard im not asking to take her place richards eyes closed as his head sank down on her shoulder he swallowed back the pain she ran her fingers through his hair and held his head to her after a time he found his voice maybe it wouldnt hurt me to occasionally wear one of those outfits she pushed away a little looking up through her tears maybe just to the dining room with the sisters he shrugged that would be a good use of them i guess you pick one you would like me to wear i dont know anything about fancy clothes he managed a small smile im just a woods guide her face brightened you would look handsome in the red coat richard winced the red one does it have to be the red one she ran her finger down the agiel hanging from his neck no it doesnt have to be that one i just thought it would look good on your broad shoulders richard sighed i will feel foolish in any it might as well be the red you will not look foolish you will look handsome pasha grinned youll see all the women will be batting their lashes at you she lifted the agiel richard what is this just sort of a goodluck charm you ready to go back i think you need to get started teaching me the sooner you start the sooner i get this collar off then well both be happy you will be a sister and i will be free he put his arm around her shoulders and she put hers around his waist as they walked back for bonnie chapter on the bridge to halsband island in a pool of light under a lamp a crowd of boys and young men mobbed them many were dressed in fine clothes some wore robes and each had a radahan around his neck they all excitedly asked questions at the same time wanting to know if it was true that richard had killed a mriswith and what it looked like they wanted to tell richard their names and clamored for him to draw his sword and show them how he had vanquished the legendary monster pasha spoke to the most persistent boy at her hip yes kipp its true that richard killed a mriswith sister maren is studying it now and if she deems it appropriate she will tell you of its nature but i can tell you true that it is a fearsomelooking beast now off with you all its nearly dinnertime despite their disappointment that no more information was forthcoming they were excited by what they had heard they ran off in a bunch to tell others after leaving bonnie at the stables richard walked with pasha down halls and through vast chambers trying to memorize the layout she pointed out the boys dining halls and the dining hall where the sisters and some of the older young men ate she also took him past the kitchens where the aromas of cooking wafted through the surrounding corridors pasha pointed through a latticecovered archway to a graceful stone wall running under the spreading branches of trees the wall was veiled in places by vines large white flowers dotted the green thats the prelates offices and quarters pasha said will she be at dinner tonight pasha giggled softly no of course not the prelate doesnt have time to have dinner with us richard turned out of the hall and down a walkway toward a gate in the wall richard what are you doing where are you going i want to meet the prelate you cant simply go visit her why she hurried along beside him well shes a busy woman she cant be bothered they wont let you see her the guards wont even let us through the gate he shrugged it wont hurt to ask will it then afterwards you can pick an outfit for me and well go to have dinner with the sisters all right the offer to let her pick his outfit gave her pause pasha stuttered that she supposed it wouldnt hurt just to ask and struggled to keep up as he marched toward the guard the guard stepped before the iron gate spread his feet and hooked his thumbs on his weapons belt as richard strode right up to him richard put a hand to the mans shoulder im so sorry forgive me please i didnt get you in any trouble did i i hope not she hasnt come out to yell at you yet i hope the man frowned in confusion as richard leaned closer look whats your name swordsman andellmere kevin andellmere look kevin she said she would send the guard at the west gate to get me if i was even one minute late she probably forgot to send you out it isnt your fault i promise i wont mention your name i hope youre not angry with me richard put his back to pasha and leaned even closer to the guard you understand he rolled his eyes meaningfully toward pasha and then gave the man a wink kevin glanced to pasha as she fussed with her tangled mat of hair eh you understand im sure look kevin say youll let me buy you an ale will you i better get in there before i get you in trouble but before i go promise me youll let me buy you an ale to make it up to you well i suppose i could let you buy me an ale richard clapped kevin on the shoulder theres a good man pasha was right on richards heels as he stormed past the guard and through the gate he turned and gave kevin a wave and a smile pasha leaned close how did you do that no one gets through the prelates guards richard held the door into the building open for her i just gave him too much to think about and a worry he feared might be true when an answer came to her knock they stepped into a dimly lit room with two desks and two sisters pasha curtsied sisters i am novice pasha maes and this is our new student richard cypher he was wondering if he might meet the prelate both sisters glowered at her the one on the right spoke the prelate is busy dismissed novice a little pale pasha curtsied again thank you for your time sisters richard gave a little bow yes thank you sisters please give the prelate my kindest regards i told you she wouldnt see us pasha said on the way out richard hiked his pack up higher on his shoulder well we gave it our best try thanks for indulging me he had known that pasha had been right that the prelate wouldnt see them but he had seen what he had come to see he had only been interested in knowing the layout of the building and grounds for future reference richard hadnt changed his mind about his captivity but he had decided to try a different approach for a while he would bide his time and see what they could teach him nothing would please him more than to be released from the collar without having to hurt anyone in the building that housed his room gillaume hall named after a prophet richard had learned a young man came hesitantly out of the shadows on the lower level before the wide marble stairs his head of curly blond hair was cut short at the sides his hands were stuck into the opposite sleeves of his violet robes silver brocade circled the cuffs and neck he looked smaller than he was because of the way he hunched over his head bowed to pasha while his blue eyes searched for a safe place to settle blessings on you pasha he said softly you look lovely tonight i pray you are well pasha squinted in thought warren isnt it his head bobbed surprised that she knew his name im fine warren thank you for asking this is richard cypher warren smiled shyly at richard yes i saw you before the sisters yesterday i suppose you too want to know about the mriswith pasha said with a sigh mriswith richard killed a mriswith isnt that what you wanted to ask about really a mriswith no he turned back to richard i wanted to ask if you would care to come down to the vaults sometime and look at the prophecies with me richard didnt want to embarrass the young man but he had no interest in prophecies im honored by the offer warren but im afraid that im not much good with riddles warren diverted his eyes to the floor of course i understand not many of the others are much interested in the books either i just thought that maybe well i just thought that since you mentioned that particular prophecy yesterday that maybe you would want to talk about it its a unique piece of work but i understand im sorry to have bothered you richard frowned what prophecy the one you mentioned at the end about you being well warren swallowed the bringer of death its just that i dont think ive ever met anyone from the prophecies before he blinked in awe since you are in the prophecies i thought well i thought maybe his voice trailed off he looked down at the floor as he started to turn away but i understand im sorry to have richard gently caught hold of warrens arm and turned him back like i said im not very good with riddles but maybe you could teach me something about them so i wouldnt be so ignorant i do like to learn warrens face brightened his whole body seemed to swell when he straightened he was almost as tall as richard id like that i would really like to talk to you about that prophecy its a real conundrum to this day the argument over it has never been settled maybe with your help a broadshouldered man in plain robes and wearing a radahan slipped up silently took a fistful of warrens robe at the shoulder and moved him aside his eyes were locked on pasha the whole time he gave her a smooth smile good evening pasha it will be dinnertime soon ive decided to take you his eyes glided down the length of her and then back up if you can get yourself cleaned up and do something with your hair you look a mess you better get to it he started to turn away pasha put her arm through richards im afraid i have other plans jedidiah jedidiah gave richard a cursory glance what this country boy the two of you going to go chop wood or maybe skin rabbits youre the one richard said i remember your voice youre the one who called down from the balcony yesterday asking all by yourself jedidiahs condescending smile looked to come easily to him an appropriate question dont you think pasha lifted her chin richard killed a mriswith jedidiahs eyebrows went up in mock wonder well how brave of the country boy youve never killed a mriswith warren spoke up jedidiah slowly turned a withering glare on warren warren shrank away what are you doing above ground mole he turned back to pasha and did you see him kill it i would wager he was alone when he claimed to have killed it he probably found a mriswith that had died of old age stabbed it with his sword and then bragged to you to try to impress you he redirected a smirk to richard isnt that about the way it happened country boy richard grinned youve caught me cold you have it right as i thought he twitched a small smile to pasha come to me later child and ill show you some real magic a mans magic jedidiah strode away imperiously and disappeared around a corner pasha put her fists to her hips why did you say that why did you let him think that i did it for you richard said i thought you wanted me to stop causing trouble and act a gentleman she folded her arms in a huff well i do richard turned to warren still shrunk back against the marble newel post if he does anything to you warren i want you to come tell me its me thats the thorn in his pants if he takes it out on you you come tell me warren brightened really thank you richard but i dont think he would bother with me and ill be seeing you down in the vaults when you have the time he cast a shy smile at pasha good night pasha so nice to see you again you look lovely tonight good night she smiled good night warren she watched him scurry off down the hall what a strange young man i almost couldnt remember his real name everyone calls him the mole he almost never comes up from the vaults under the palace she glanced sideways to richard well youve made a friend tonight who can be of no help to you and an enemy who can harm you you stay away from jedidiah hes an experienced wizard close to being released until you learn to defend yourself with your han he can hurt you he can kill you i thought we were one big happy family there is a pecking order among wizards wizards with the strongest power vie for dominance it sometimes gets very dangerous jedidiah is the pride of the palace and does not take well to the idea that another may challenge his supremacy im hardly a challenge to the power of a wizard pasha lifted an eyebrow jedidiah never killed a mriswith and everyone knows that feeling decidedly uncomfortable in the red coat pasha had selected richard tried to enjoy the lentil porridge they had prepared especially for him pasha wore a stunning dark green dress that did more to reveal her figure than cover it richard thought it revealed more of her breasts than was prudent the young men there as guests of sisters or their novices did little eating and a lot of watching none missed a move pasha made many of the young men in collars came by and introduced themselves to richard saying they wanted to get to know him better they promised to show him the city and some of its more interesting sights pashas face reddened at the last richard asked if they knew where the guards went for ale and they promised to take him there whenever he wished sisters of every age shape and size came to greet him they all acted as if the events of the night before had never taken place when richard asked pasha why she said all the sisters understood the difficulty a young man had in making the adjustment of coming to the palace she said they were accustomed to such outbursts of emotion and didnt take them to heart richard kept to himself the thought that this time they should some of the sisters smiled and said they hoped they would be given the opportunity to work with him and a few scowled and promised they would be seeing him and promised not to be tolerant of anything less than his best efforts richard smiled and said he would give them nothing less than his best he wondered to himself what he was committing to near the end of the meal two attractive young women one in a satiny pink dress the other in yellow rushed in stopping at various tables speaking in whispers to other young women they at last came to the corner where richard and pasha sat one bent close to pasha have you heard pasha stared with a blank look jedidiah fell down a flight of stairs her eyes sparkled with the telling of the gossip she leaned closer with the titillation of what she had to tell next broke his leg pasha gasped no when we just saw him a while ago the woman giggled and nodded yes its true it just happened not but a few minutes ago the healers are with him now no need for concern hell be back to good by morning how did it happen the woman shrugged just clumsy tripped on the carpet and tumbled down she lowered her voice he was so furious he flamed the carpet to ash wizards fire pasha whispered incredulously in the palace such a high crime no no not wizards fire of course not silly girl even jedidiah is not that brazen just simple fire but it was one of the oldest carpets in the palace the sisters are not pleased at his display of temper they ordered the bone and the pain not be mended until morning as punishment their gossip finally expended the two young womens eyes and smiles settled on richard pasha introduced them as two friends of hers celia and dulcy two novices with charges of their own richard was polite complimenting them on their pretty dresses and the way their hair was curled their smiles widened taking his arm when they finally left pasha thanked him for what ive never been permitted to eat with the sisters or with the novices who have a young man to train this is the first time ive ever been to dinner just like i was a sister you were pleasant and considerate of everyone i was so proud to have you with me and you look very handsome in those clothes in that dress i would imagine you could easily get someone better bred than me as a dinner companion richard pulled open the fancy shirt collar ive never worn a shirt this ruffled or white nor a coat this red i think i look foolish a selfsatisfied smile spread on pashas face i can promise you that celia and dulcy do not think you look foolish im surprised you couldnt see them glowing green i thought maybe they might decide to sit right down on your lap richard thought that if celia and dulcy liked the red coat so much they could have it but he kept the thought to himself why doesnt an important wizard like jedidiah wear fancy clothes only beginning wizards wear clothes like this and are permitted to go into the city at certain milestones in a wizards advancement they change to a particular form of dress the further a wizard progress the more modest his dress thats why jedidiah wears simple tan robes because he has nearly reached the end of his training whats the purpose of such an odd rule to teach humility those with the nicest clothes the most freedom and unlimited money are those with the least power no one respects them for these things its meant to teach the young men that mastery comes from within not from external trappings then wearing these things is a demotion for me i was already wearing humble clothes you are not yet entitled to wear humble robes you may wear your own clothes occasionally if you wish if they were simple robes though it would not be allowed the people in the city know a wizards abilities and power by his dress no wizard who wears simple robes is permitted to go into the city she smiled someday when you have advanced enough you will be permitted to wear the robes of a wizard i dont like robes i like the clothes i was wearing when you have your collar off and leave the palace you may wear what you wish of course most come to respect the robes of their profession and wear them the rest of their lives richard changed the subject i want to go see warren tell me how to get down there now tonight richard its been a long day and i must give you your first lesson yet tonight just tell me how to get down there will warren be down there this late i dont know that he is ever seen anywhere else i think he must sleep on the books i was surprised to see him up in the palace today that in itself will be gossip for weeks i dont want him to think i forgot him just tell me how to get down there well she sighed if you insist on going we will go together im supposed to escort you wherever you go in the palace of the prophets for now anyway chapter in the core of the palace of the prophets they began their descent down into the vaults the stairways on the upper levels were elegant lower down the stairs became utilitarian stone with their leading edges worn round and smooth the maidservants he had seen on the upper levels were nowhere to be seen paneled walls gave way to stone in some places he had to duck under huge beams lamps were no longer stationed on the walls but instead widely spaced torches lit the way sounds of palace life were left far behind to be replaced by dead silence some of the hallways were wet with leaking water whats in these vaults richard asked the books of prophecy books of history and records of the palace are also kept there why are they way down here for protection prophecies are dangerous to the untrained mind all novices study books of prophecy but only certain sisters are permitted to read them all and work with them young wizards who show that their gift gives them an aptitude for prophecy are taught by these sisters there are a few young men who work and study in the vaults but warren is to the vaults what jedidiah is to other forms of magic every wizard has a specialty we will work with you to discover what your innate ability is until we can learn this it will be hard to take your training very far sister verna told me something about that so what do you think my talent is usually we can tell by the personality of the boy some like to work with their hands and end up making things of magic some like to help the sick or injured and become healers things like that we can usually tell so what about me she glanced briefly in his direction none of us has ever seen anyone like you before we have no idea yet pashas face brightened but we will a huge round stone door as thick as richard was tall stood open in the gloom beyond it were rooms carved from the bedrock that the palace sat atop lamps did little to brighten the place there were a number of long timeworn tables with books and papers scattered about on them and shelves in rows that extended into the distance to each side two women sat at the tables taking notes as they read by the light of candles set close one of them peered up and addressed pasha what are you doing down here child pasha curtsied we came to see warren sister warren why just then warren came scurrying out of the darkness its all right sister becky i asked them to come well the next time please let someone know in advance yes sister i will warren burrowed between the two of them and took their arms leading them into the shelves when he realized he was touching pasha he jerked his hand away and turned red you look dazzling pasha why thank you mole she flushed red herself she put a hand to his shoulder im sorry warren i didnt mean anything by that i meant to call you warren he smiled its all right pasha i know people call me the mole they think it a pejorative but i take it as a compliment you see a mole can find its way in the dark where others are blind that is much like what i do i find the way where others see nothing pasha sighed in relief im glad warren mole did you hear that jedidiah fell down a flight of stairs and broke his leg really he searched her eyes maybe the creator was trying to teach him that when you hold your nose so high in the air you cant see where you are going i dont think jedidiah paid any heed to the creators lessons pasha said i heard tell that he was so angry he burned a prized carpet to ash warren still held her eyes you are the one who should be angry not jedidiah he said cruel things to you no one should say cruel things to you he is usually kind to me but i admit i did look a mess some of these books look a mess to people but it is whats inside that matters not the dust on their covers pasha blushed why thank you mole i think warren looked to richard i didnt know if you would really come most people say they will but they never do im so pleased you did come this way pasha im afraid you must wait here what she leaned forward and richard thought that maybe her breasts might spill out if she didnt straighten up im going too warrens eyes widened but i must take him into one of the back rooms you are a novice novices are not allowed she smiled warmly as she did straighten up mole if a novice is not allowed how could a new student be allowed warrens eyes narrowed he is in the prophecies if the prophets saw fit to write about him they could hardly intend he not see it warren seemed considerably more confident down here in his element than he had been up in the palace he stood his ground with confidence pasha rubbed his shoulder he glanced down at the hand warren youre the mole you show others the way im the one in charge of richard i show him the way i would be neglecting my duty if i allowed him to go somewhere without me this soon im sure you can make an exception for me cant you warren its to help richard to help understand the prophecy and how he is to serve the creator isnt that whats important warren finally took his eyes from her and told them to wait he went off to the two sisters and spoke with them in hushed tones he finally came back wearing a smile sister becky said it would be permitted i told her you understand a bit of high dharan in case she asks say you do whats high dharan warren you want me to lie to a sister im sure she will not ask warren turned his face away i told the lie for you pasha so you would not have to she leaned closer to him warren if youre caught telling lies about such things you know what they will do he gave her a small haunted smile i know what will they do richard asked suddenly suspicious warren waved impatiently never mind you two come along they had to hurry after him as he scurried off into the darkness they went past rows of shelves placed tight together coming at last to a solid wall of rock warren put his hand to a metal plate and part of the wall moved away revealing another chamber beyond inside the small room sat a table and maybe a dozen rows of shelves four lamps made it seem bright inside by comparison inside warren touched another plate and the section of wall slid closed entombing them in stone and silence he pulled out a chair for pasha and had richard sit to her right finally he pulled a leatherbound book from the shelves and carefully placed it before richard please dont touch it warren said its very old and fragile of late it has been getting more use than usual let me turn the pages whos been using it richard asked the prelate a smile twitched across warrens lips whenever she is to come down here her two big guards come first and make everyone leave they clear the vaults so the prelate can have the place to herself and people wont know what she reads her big guards pasha asked you mean the two sisters in her outer office yes warren said sister ulicia and sister finella we saw them today richard said they didnt look that big to me warren lowered his voice meaningfully if you ever cross them you will think otherwise they will seem very big indeed richard took pause at warrens expression if the place is cleared out how do you know she has been reading this book i know he turned to the book on the table i know she has been doing most of her reading in this room of late i live with these books when someone touches them i can tell you see this smudge in the dust its not mine its the prelates warren carefully lifted open the cover and with both hands giving support turned the yellowed pages richard didnt recognize any of the words or some of the letters for that matter on one of the pages that warren flipped richard thought he recognized something a drawing it sparked a deep memory warren flipped over more pages finally stopping he leaned over richards shoulder pointing this is the prophecy you spoke of warren moved around to the right side of the table this is the original in the prophets own hand few have ever seen it do you understand high dharan no it just looks like scribbling to me richard glanced over the meaningless writing you said there was argument over its meaning warrens eyes had an intense gleam there is you see this is a very old prophecy perhaps as old as the palace maybe older this is the original prophecy its in high dharan as is everything in this room very few people understand high dharan richard nodded so people have only read the translations and there is reason to believe that those translations may not be accurate you understand warren whispered his movements became more lively yes yes you see the problem most dont most think one thing in one language must mean a certain thing in another in order to complete the translation they settle on an interpretation that fits their view of the meaning but in so doing they create a conspectus that may or may not be the meaning of the prophecy but that doesnt take into account possible different meanings richard said so when they translate it they give it only one version they cant translate its ambiguity warren thrust himself forward in excitement yes you have it thats what they cant understand and so they argue over the various translations as if there is a right way and a wrong way to do it but this is high dharan warrens words trailed off richard was staring at the page the images there were drawing him in it was almost as if they were murmuring to him he had never seen such words before but somehow they resonated with something deep within him his hand slowly reached out drawn to one of the words his finger came to rest on it this one richard whispered as if from a trance the strokes of the letters seemed to lift from the page as if alive and coil around his finger the dark lines caressing fondling with intimate familiarity before his eyes too floated the image of the sword of truth warrens white face came up from the book drauka he whispered thats the word that is the center of the controversy fuer grissa ost drauka the bnnger of death pasha leaned over so whats the controversy you mean those words can be translated differently warren made a vague gesture with his hand well yes and no thats the literal translation of the words its their meaning that is in dispute richard pulled his hand back he banished the image of the sword death it has different meanings warren practically laid on the table as he leaned over yes you understand death is plain as pie pasha said warren straightened and rubbed his hands together no pasha not in high dharan the weapon the sisters carry the dacra its name comes from this word drauka means death as in dead like if i were to say the mriswith richard killed is dead drauka dead but it has other meanings too drauka also is a word that represents the souls of the dead pasha leaned forward with a frown are you saying that drauka in that sense can make it mean the bringer of souls no richard said he whispered the second meaning of the word spirits the bringer of spirits yes warren said in a quiet voice that is the second interpretation how many of these different meanings to drauka are there pasha asked three richard thought three warren said richard knew the third the underworld he whispered as he stared at the word drauka on the page the place of the dead thats the third meaning of drauka pale as a spirit warren leaned toward him but you wont understand dharan richard slowly shook his mead his eyes fixed on the page warrens tongue darted out to wet his lips please tell me you dont have dharan blood my father was darken rahl richard said softly he was the wizard who ruled dhara and before him my grandfather panis dear creator warren whispered pasha put a hand to richards arm as she leaned toward them both underworld how could it mean underworld because warren said the underworld is the world of the dead her brow knit tighter but how could it mean the bringer of the underworld how can you bring the underworld richard stared blankly ahead you tear the veil the silence echoed around the stone room pasha looked from one face to the other she finally broke the silence but i was taught that for a foreign word in a prophecy that had different shades of meaning you had only to interpret it in context it should be a simple matter of seeing how it is used to decipher its meaning warren lifted an eyebrow thats what the argument is about you see in this prophecy it speaks of things that could pertain to each of the three possible meanings of the word drauka depending on which meaning was intended it changes the meaning of the prophecy that is why it cannot be interpreted with surety its like a dog chasing his tail the more you try the more you just end up going round and round this is why im so anxious to know the intended meaning of the word drauka if i could know that then i might be able to decipher the rest of the prophecy accurately for the first time i would be the first in three thousand years to understand it richard pushed his chair away from the table well as i said im not very good with riddles he forced himself to smile but i promise to think on it warren brightened would you i would be so appreciative if you would be able to help me richard squeezed warrens shoulder you have my word pasha rose well i guess we better get to richards lesson its getting late thank you both for coming i rarely have visitors pasha leading the three of them went toward the door as she passed through the doorway richard slapped his hand to the metal plate on the wall the door grated closed pasha beat her fists to the stone as the slit had become too small for her to come back through she shouted for them to open the door as the stone sealed closed her words were cut off leaving richard and warren in silence warren stared at the metal plate how did you do that you are just a beginning wizard you should not be able to effect a shield with your han for a very long time yet richard didnt have an answer for the question and so he ignored it tell me what you meant about knowing what the sisters would do to you if they caught you telling that kind of lie warrens hand went to his collar well they would hurt me you mean they would use the collars magic to give you pain warren nodded as he took a knot of his robes in his fists do they do that often give us pain with the collar warren twisted the knot of robe no not often but to be a wizard you must pass a test of pain they come from time to time and give you pain with the radahan to see if you have learned enough to pass the test of pain and how do you pass the test well i can only imagine that when you can endure the pain without begging them to stop you pass they never tell me what must be done to pass his face had gone ashen ive never been able to keep from begging them to stop once you learn to endure what they give they give more i thought it might be something like that thanks for telling me richard stroked his beard warren i need your help warren lifted the sleeve of his robes and wiped it at his wet eyes what help can i give you said there are prophecies about me i want you to study everything about me you can find and about the towers of perdition the valley of the lost i also need to know everything i can about the veil richard pointed at the book on the table there was a drawing a few pages before you stopped on the prophecy it was a teardrop shape do you know what it is warren went to the book and turned the pages back this yes thats it he remembered seeing it around rachels neck in his vision of her and chase in the valley of the lost an image of zedd came into richards mind his heart thumped faster that looks like the thing i saw what is it warren gave him a puzzled look the stone of tears what do you mean you saw it what is the stone of tears well im not sure id have to study about it but i think it might have something to do with the veil if drauka could be interpreted to have something to do with the underworld what do you mean you saw it richard ignored the question for a second time warren i also need to know about the stone of tears and everything you can find about the people who used to live in the valley of the lost the baka ban mana their name means those without masters and about one they call the caharin warren stared dumbly at him this is all a lot of work will you help me warren warren looked down picking at his robes on a condition i never get out of this place not that i dont like working with the prophecies you understand but people think that i have no interest in anything else id like to see the country around the palace the woods the hills he twisted his fingers together im afraid of big places the sky is so big thats the other reason i stay down here because it feels safe to me but im sick of living like a mole i would like to try going outside and seeing it would you well show me the countryside you look to me like someone familiar with the outofdoors i think i would feel safe if you went with me richard smiled warmly youve come to the right person warren i was a woods guide before all this started i dont know all the country around the palace yet but i surely intend to id really enjoy guiding you around it would be just like old times warrens expression brightened thank you richard i look forward to seeing open places i need some adventure in my life ill start right away on the things you want but the sisters give me work so i must search when i can find the time and im afraid that i must be honest it will take a long time there are thousands of volumes here it will take months just to get a good start warren this may be the most important thing you ever studied you may be able to save time if you start by reading everything the prelate has been reading a sly smile came to warrens lips i thought you said you werent good with riddles that is what i was thinking his smile turned to a concerned frown why do you want to know these things richard studied the others blue eyes for a long moment i am fuer grissa ost drauka warren i know what it means warren clutched his fingers to the sleeve of richards red coat you know you know which is the correct translation his fingers trembled would you tell me if you promise not to tell anyone else for now warren nodded eagerly no one has been able to figure out which one of the three is the true translation because in trying to justify one they invalidate the whole warren frowned richard leaned toward him they are all true warren what he whispered how can that be i have killed people with this sword i am the bringer of death in that sense that is the first meaning of drauka in order to prevail against otherwise impossible odds such as defeating the mriswith i use the swords magic to bring forth the spirits of those who have used it before me i have called the dead forth called the past into the present in that way i am the bringer of spirits that is the second meaning of drauka as for the third meaning bringing forth the underworld i have reason to believe that i may have somehow torn the veil that is the third meaning of drauka warren gasped its very important that you find out the information i asked you about i dont think i have a lot of time warren nodded ill try but i think you put too much faith in me richard lifted an eyebrow i have faith in a man able to break jedidiahs leg i did nothing to jedidiah jedidiah is a powerful wizard i would never dare to oppose one of his powers oh come on warren there are ashes of the burned carpet on the shoulder of your robe warren brushed frantically at his shoulder there is no ash there i see no ash richard waited for warrens eyes to come up then why are you brushing at your robes well i i was i just richard put a reassuring hand on warrens back its all right warren im a believer in justice i think jedidiah got what he deserved i wont tell anyone and you must not tell anyone about any of this i must warn you richard you did a very dangerous thing yesterday when you told all the sisters that you were the bringer of death that is a wellknown and hotly debated prophecy there are sisters who believe it means you are one who kills they will try to comfort you there are others who think it means you will bring forth the dead call the spirits they will want to study you he leaned a little closer there are others who think it means you will tear the veil and bring the nameless one to swallow us all they might try to kill you i know warren then why would you let them know you are the one in the prophecy because i am fuer grissa ost drauka when the time comes i will kill any of them i must in order to get this collar off i had to give them fair warning first give them the chance to live warren touched his fingers to his lower lip but you wouldnt hurt pasha not pasha i hope to hurt no one warren maybe with the information you help me with i wont have to hurt anyone i hate being fuer grissa ost drauka but that is who i am warrens eyes teared please you wouldnt hurt pasha warren i like her i think she is a lovely person inside like you said i only kill to protect my life or the lives of innocent people i dont believe pasha would ever give me cause but you must understand that if i am right and the veil is torn then more is at stake than any one persons life mine yours or pashas warren nodded i have read the prophecies i understand i will search for the things you need richard tried to reassure him with a warm smile it will be all right warren im the seeker ill do my best i dont want to harm anyone seeker what is the seeker richard slapped his hand to the metal plate ill tell you about it later warren glanced down at the plate as the door slid opened how are you able to do that pasha was standing calmly waiting her face making a good effort at not showing her anger and just what was that all about richard stepped through the doorway boy talk pasha stopped him with a hand to his arm what do you mean boy talk richard looked into her warm brown eyes i was twisting warrens arm making him tell me about the test of pain you failed to mention it so i had to ask him about it or were you planning on waiting until you came to do it before you told me pasha rubbed her bare arms as if to warm them i do not do that richard im only a novice full sisters must do it why didnt you tell me about it tears welled up in her eyes i dont like to see people hurt i didnt want to frighten you about what may not come for a long time sometimes the waiting can be worse than the actual experience i didnt want you to have to wait in fear oh richard let out a long breath well i guess thats a good reason i apologize pasha for what i was thinking of you she forced a smile shall we go start your lessons above ground again they passed down halls and through several buildings until they finally reached gillaume hall where his room was the fabric of pashas dress made a swishing sound as they climbed the wide marble stairway the walls and columns were a matching tan variegated marble it was a beautiful place with elegant rooms but it was not as impressive as the peoples palace in dhara before he had seen that magnificent edifice he would have been astonished by the opulence of this place now he simply noted its layout in reference to everything else upstairs as they went down another wide carpeted hall he saw several other young men wearing radahan at last they reached his room richard caught her wrist as she reached for the door handle she looked up in puzzlement theres someone inside he said chapter it is my job to watch over you pasha said she used her han breaking his hold on her wrist and throwing him aside as if with an invisible hand and then charged through the door richard rolled finishing on his feet drew his sword and flew in after her only the small flames from the hearth gave light to the otherwise dark room they both stumbled to a halt in the near darkness a voice came from a chair beside the fire expecting a mriswith richard sister verna richard slid his sword back into its scabbard what are you doing here she rose to her feet and swept her hand in the direction of a lamp bringing the wick to flame i didnt know if you heard her face was unreadable im once again a sister of the light really richard said thats great news sister verna clasped her hands in a relaxed manner since im a sister again i wanted to come and speak privately to you for a moment she glanced to pasha about same unfinished business richard and i have pasha looked from the sister to richard well i guess this dress is well not the most comfortable thing to give lessons in why dont i go change she curtsied to sister verna good night sister im so happy for you you should be a sister and richard thank you for being such a gentleman tonight i will return after i change richard stood facing the door once he had closed it behind pasha gentleman sister verna said im delighted to hear it richard i would also like to thank you for my being returned to sister sister maren told me what happened richard laughed as he turned to her youve been around me too long sister but you need more practice at telling lies youre not yet totally convincing she couldnt keep a small smile from coming to her lips well sister maren told me that she had prayed for guidance and decided i would serve the creator best if i were a sister in view of my experience she lifted an eyebrow poor sister maren lying seems to have become infectious since you arrived here he shrugged sister maren did what was right i think your creator would be pleased with the outcome i heard that you killed a mriswith news spreads through the palace like a blaze through dry grass richard walked to the hearth he leaned on the dark granite mantle and stared into the flames well i had no choice sister verna stroked a hand tenderly down his hair are you all right richard how are you doing im fine richard pulled the baldric over his head and set it and the sword aside he tossed the red coat on a chair id be better if i didnt have to wear these silly clothes but i guess its a small price to pay for peace for now what did you want talk to me about sister i dont know what you did how you got me returned to sister but thank you richard does this mean you would like for us to be friends only if you will take this collar off me she looked away from his eyes someday sister you will have to make your choice i hope when the time comes you choose to be on my side after all weve been through i would hate to have to kill you but you know what i am capable of you knew what my answer would be surely you came here for more than that i have told you before how you are using your han without knowing what you are doing remember yes but i dont think im using my han she lifted an eyebrow richard you killed a mriswith as far as i know that has not been done in the last three thousand years you had to use your han to do that no sister i used the magic of the sword to kill it richard i have observed you and learned a little about both you and your sword the reason no one has ever been able to kill a mriswith is because they never knew it was coming even the han of sisters and wizards could not sense its approach your sword may have killed the mriswith but your han let you know it was coming you are calling on your gift but without control richard was tired he didnt feel like arguing so he didnt he flopped into a plush chair he remembered the way he had seen the mriswith in his mind had seen it coming i dont understand what im doing sister the mriswith came and i protected myself she sat in a chair opposite look at it this way richard you killed a beast as deadly as anything walking the land yet that little girl with the big brown eyes and about as much power compared to you as a sparrow compared to a hawk just used her han to throw you down the hall i hope you will study hard so you may learn to control your han you need to get it under control she looked at him intently why did you go into the hagen woods after i told you that they are dangerous the real reason not the justification but the deepdowninside reason please tell me the truth richard richard stretched back looking up at the ceiling he finally conceded with a nod it was like something drew me in it was a need a hunger it was like i needed to pound my fist against a wall and that was the way to do it he thought she might launch into a lecture but she didnt her tone was sympathetic richard ive been talking to a few friends of mine none of us knows everything about the magic of the palace and especially the hagen woods but there is reason to believe that the hagen woods were placed there specifically for certain wizards richard studied her quiet expression the creases in her face the sincerity in her eyes are you saying sister that if i need to pound my fist against the wall maybe i should do so she gave a slight lift to her eyebrows the creator gave us hunger so we would eat because eating is necessary what would be the purpose of a hunger like mine she shook her head i dont know for a second time in as many days the prelate has declined to grant me an audience but im going to try to find some answers in the meantime just please dont let the sun set on you in the hagen woods is this what you came to tell me sister she looked away and paused rubbing her forehead with two fingers she looked uncertain he had never seen her like this richard there are things going on that i dont understand and they are connected to you events are not happening as they should she saw his curious look i cant talk about them just yet she cleared her throat richard i dont want you to trust every one of the sisters richard lifted an eyebrow sister i trust none of you that brought a shortlived smile to her face for now that would be best that was what i wanted to tell you im going to find the answers butfor now well lets just say that i know you will do as you must to stay safe after sister verna left richard thought about what she had said and about the things warren had told him mostly he thought about the stone of tears it puzzled him that the magic in the valley of the lost would present him with a vision of something he had never seen before and put it around rachels neck the other visions seemed to have been anchored in his longings and fears maybe because he missed seeing his friend chase he saw the vision of rachel too she would be with chase but why would the vision put around her neck something he had never seen before which turned out to look like a drawing in a book maybe they werent the same thing he told himself they couldnt be but an uneasy feeling inside said otherwise as much as he missed chase and rachel it was the stone around rachels neck that had captured his attention it was as if rachel were bringing it to him for zedd and zedd had been there with him urging him to take the stone pashas knock at the door brought him out of his brooding she was wearing a plain brownish gray dress with small pink cloth buttons up the front all the way up to her neck though it didnt show the expanse of flesh the green dress had it was tailored so that it revealed nearly every detail of her shape the fact that it covered everything only made what it covered all that much more intriguing the color somehow brought out the softness of her brown hair pasha sat crosslegged on the floor on the blue and yellow carpet in front of the fireplace she draped her dress carefully over her knees and then looked up here sit like me in front of me richard sat on the floor and folded his legs she motioned him to come closer until their knees touched she took his hands and held them lightly as they rested across both their knees sister verna didnt do this when i practiced that was because the radahan had to be within the circle of influence of the magic of the palace before we could practice in this way until now when you have practiced touching your han it has been alone most of the time from now on i or a sister will use our han to assist you she smiled it will help you progress faster richard all right what do you want me to do she told you how to try to reach your han how to concentrate on finding that place within yourself richard nodded that is what i want you to do while you search for that place i will use my han through the radahan to try to guide you richard squirmed a little getting more comfortable pasha took back a hand and fanned her face this dress seems so warm after wearing the other she unbuttoned the top five buttons of her dress and then took his hand up again richard glanced at the fire to check the logs so he would know how long it had been when he opened his eyes again he could never seem to judge the time while he searched for his han it always seemed like mere minutes but it was usually at least an hour richard closed his eyes he brought forth the image of the sword of truth on a plain background as the quiet settled over him as he sought the peace within his breathing slowed he took a long breath and then let himself sink into the calm center he was aware of pashas hands holding his of her knees touching his and of her even breathing coming into harmony with his it felt good to have her holding his hands he didnt feel isolated the way he had always felt before he didnt know if she really was using the magic of his collar to go with him but he felt himself spiraling deeper than he had before he drifted in the timeless place without thinking without effort or worry whatever his han was he didnt see or feel anything he hadnt seen or felt before other than feeling more relaxed than before and the comforting feeling of having pasha with him it was no different he was dimly aware of his body starting to feel cramped and of the warmth from the fire the cold steel of the sword seemed to be a core of ice in the heat at last he opened his eyes pasha opened her eyes with him richard glanced to the fire the logs had been reduced to glowing coals two hours he judged a trickle of sweat ran down pashas neck my but its warm tonight she unbuttoned buttons a lot of buttons more of her was showing than had shown in the green dress richard made himself look back up into her soft eyes pasha gave him a small selfassured smile i didnt feel anything richard said i didnt sense my han although i dont know what it is im supposed to sense i didnt either and i should have strange she sighed to herself with a puzzled expression her face brightened but it takes practice did you feel my han was it any help no he admitted i didnt feel anything she made a little quirk with her mouth as she frowned you didnt feel anything of me he shook his head well close your eyes and try again it was late and richard didnt want to practice anymore it was tiring but he decided to do as she wished he closed his eyes he concentrated on trying to bring back the sword suddenly he felt pashas full lips against his his eyes opened as she pressed against him her eyes were closed her brow wrinkled she grasped his face with her hands richard gripped her shoulders and pushed her away she opened her eyes and licked her lips she smiled coyly did you feel that i felt it she hooked an arm around his neck apparently not enough richard gently put a hand against her as she tried to lean in he didnt want to embarrass her so he tried to keep his voice pleasant pasha dont she rubbed her free hand around on his stomach its late no one will be around if it will make you feel more comfortable ill shield the door you shouldnt worry im not worried i just dont want to she looked a bit hurt you do not think i am pretty enough richard didnt want to offend her and he didnt want to make her angry but he didnt want to encourage her either its not that pasha youre very attractive its just that she unbuttoned another little button richard reached out and took ahold of her hand to stop her he realized the situation was becoming hazardous she was his teacher if he angered or humiliated her things could become dangerously complicated he had things to do and couldnt afford to turn her antagonistic she pulled her dress up her legs and put his hand against her thigh you like this better she asked in a breathy voice richard froze at the firm sensual feel of her flesh he remembered what sister verna had said that he would soon find another pair of pretty legs these were certainly that and pasha was leaving precious little to the imagination he pulled his hand away pasha you dont understand i think youre a beautiful young woman her eyes fixed on his face as she ran her fingers down his beard i think youre the most handsome man ive ever seen no you dont i love your beard dont ever cut it off i think a wizard should have a beard richard remembered the time zedd had used additive magic to grow a beard and teach him a lesson and then had shaved it off explaining he couldnt make it vanish with magic because that would take subtractive magic and wizards didnt have subtractive magic subtractive magic was of the underworld he caught her wrist and pulled her hand away from his face to richard his beard was a symbol of his captivity it meant he was a prisoner prisoners dont shave that was what he had told sister verna but he didnt think now was the time to explain that to pasha she kissed his neck somehow he was unable to stop her her lips were so soft and he could hear her insistent breath close to his ear it felt as if the kiss went all the way through him down to his toes something like the feeling he had had when she had put her hands to his radahan the tingling numbed his brain inside he groaned his resistance was being dissolved by her kisses when he had been held in a collar by denna he had had no choice not even death could rescue him from whatever denna wanted but he still felt shame for what he had done he was in a collar again and pasha was using some sort of magic on him but he knew that this time he had a choice in the matter he forced himself to hunch his head and get her lips from him he gently pushed her back pasha please she straightened a little whats her name this girl you love richard didnt want to tell her kahlans name it was his life it was private these people were his captors not his friends thats not important thats not the issue what does she have that i dont is she prettier than me you are a girl richard thought and she is a woman but he couldnt say that you are a pretty candle he thought and kahlan is the sunrise but he couldnt say that either if he spurned pasha he would have war on his hands he had to get out of this without making her feel resentful or rejected pasha i am honored im flattered i really am but you have only known me a day weve really just met richard the creator gives us urges and pleasure from acting on them so we will come to know his beauty through his creation there is nothing wrong with this it is a beautiful thing he also gave us a mind to decide what is right and what is wrong her chin lifted just a little right and wrong if she loved you she would be with you she wouldnt have let you go thats what is wrong she thinks you arent good enough for her she must wish to be free of you if she cared she would have kept you with her shes gone im here and i care i would fight to keep you did she fight richards mouth opened but no words came through the hurt he felt as if his will to go on had drained right out of him leaving nothing but a hollow dead shell pasha reached out and touched his cheek youll see that i care richard i care more than she does youll see its right if a person cares as i do her brow creased in worry unless you think im unattractive is that it youve seen many women and you think that in comparison im ugly richard cupped a hand to the side of her face pasha you are ravishing its not that he swallowed the dryness trying to make his words sound sincere pasha could you just give me some time its simply too soon can you understand could you really care for a man who would forget his feelings so easily could you just give me some time she wrapped her arms around him and laid her head against his chest i knew yesterday when you held me so tenderly that it was another sign that the creator had sent you to me i knew then that i would never want another since ill be yours forever i can wait we have almost nothing but time we have all the time you could possibly want youll see that im the one for you you just tell me when you are ready and ill be yours richard sighed as he closed the door behind her he leaned his back against the door thinking he didnt like deceiving pasha letting her think that with time he could come to feel differently about her but he had had to do something how shallow could pashas understanding of people be for her to think that one could win love by invoking lust he took out the lock of kahlans hair spinning it in his fingers as he watched it the things pasha had said about kahlan not fighting for him made him angry pasha could never know the struggles he and kahlan had been through the hardships they had had to overcome the anguish they had suffered together the battles they had fought together pasha probably couldnt conceive of a woman of kahlans intelligence strength and courage kahlan had indeed fought for him she had more than once selflessly risked her life for him what could pasha know of the terrors kahlan had bravely faced and conquered pasha wasnt woman enough to serve kahlan tea he stuffed the lock of hair back into his pocket he forced his thoughts of kahlan from his mind he couldnt endure the pain he had other things to do going into the bedroom he positioned the ashframed standing mirror and then retrieved his pack from the corner richard pulled out the black mriswith cape he threw it around his shoulders and stood inspecting his image in the mirror it looked like a normal cape he thought it quite handsome actually the cut and length was right the mriswith had been about his size the heavy fabric was inky black almost as black as a night stone that adie had given him to help him across the pass almost as black as the boxes of orden almost as black as eternal death but the pleasing cut of the cape was not what intrigued him richard moved back against the lightbrownish wall he pulled the hood up cowling it around his face and drew the cape closed as he watched his image in the mirror he concentrated on the wall he was standing against in the span of a breath his image vanished the cape had become the color of the wall he stood against to such a degree that only if he stared focusing on the edges of the cape could he distinguish himself standing against the wall if he moved it was only slightly easier to pick out his shape against the wall though his face was exposed somehow the magic of the cape or possibly the capes magic along with his own served to mask it too to enfold it somehow into the concealing color this explained why the mriswith appeared to be different colors richard moved objects behind himself to discover what effect they had he stood in front of the wall and partly in front of a chair with his red coat draped over it the cape produced a blotch of red that did a good job of mimicking the color and shape behind though it wasnt as flawless as when he stood before a plain wall it would still be easy to miss him if he stood still movement would distort the complicated images as the cape changed to accommodate new conditions though it still fooled the eye into missing him but if he stood still he virtually vanished in front of anything the effect at times could be dizzying to watch when he stopped concentrating the cape would return to black this he thought as he looked at himself in the mirror standing in a simple black cape was going to be useful chapter as the weeks passed richard was constantly busy he remembered that kahlan and zedd had told him that there were no wizards with the gift left in the midlands small wonder they seemed to all be at the palace of the prophets there were well over a hundred boys and young men at the palace from what richard could discover a goodly number of the older ones at least were from the midlands with some even from dhara killing a mriswith had earned richard celebrity status among the younger boys two of them kipp and hersh were the most persistent they followed him around begging to hear stories of his adventures at times they exhibited the maturity almost wisdom of old men at other times they like all boys seemed interested in nothing more than mischief the object of this mischief was usually a sister the boys never seemed to tire of thinking up new tricks to pull on them most of the pranks appeared to involve either water mud or reptiles the sisters only occasionally erupted in anger when caught up in the boys antics and even then they quickly forgave them as far as richard could tell the boys never earned more than a stern lecture in the beginning the young boys thought to number richard among their targets richard had things to do and had no time or patience for it when the boys learned that richard was neither shy nor slow with discipline they quickly moved on to other targets with their buckets of water the fact that richard set limits made kipp and hersh like him all the more they seemed starved for older male companionship richard rewarded them with adventure stories or sometimes when he was going from one place to another and their presence wouldnt impede his progress he taught them about the woods tracking and animals they coveted staying in richards gbod graces so when he wanted or needed to be alone and signaled with a finger or a nod they vanished richard let them be around often when he was with pasha since he couldnt do more important tasks then anyway frustrated because she couldnt seem to find time alone with him pasha was somewhat mollified when richard got her excluded from the boys list of targets she appreciated not having her fine dresses drenched or having to worry about discovering a snake in her shawl richard occasionally asked kipp and hersh to preform little errands just to test them he had plans for their talents the other young men in collars wanted to show richard the city two perry and isaac who lived in gillaume hall with him took him into the city and showed him the tavern where many of the guards drank and he soon after bought swordsman kevin andellmere the ale he had promised him richard discovered that most of the young men spent their nights away from the palace staying in various fine inns around the city it didnt take richard long to figure out why they were provided money the same as he and they were practiced at spending it they bought themselves fancy clothes dressing like princes and on their overnight stays they picked the finest accommodations there was no shortage of women wanting to share those accommodations astonishingly beautiful women when perry and isaac took him to the city they were always quickly surrounded by attractive women richard had never seen women this brazen every evening the two men would each select a woman sometimes several and buy them presents maybe a dress or a bauble and then depart for their rooms the two told him that if he didnt want to bother with spending time buying gifts he could simply go to any of the houses of prostitution but they assured him that those women were not as young or nearly as pretty as the ones who approached them on the streets they admitted though that they went to prostitutes sometimes when they didnt feel like wasting time being sociable for no more than a simple coupling when he was spotted with a collar richard drew women the same as perry and isaac did richard was beginning to see in a new light what sister verna meant about him soon finding another pair of pretty legs the other two men thought richard was mad to turn down all the offers sometimes richard wondered if they might not be right richard asked perry and isaac if they werent afraid of a womans father cracking their skulls they laughed and said that fathers sometimes brought their daughters to them richard threw his arms up and asked if they werent concerned about getting some woman they didnt even know pregnant they explained that if a woman got herself pregnant the palace would provide for her and the child even her whole family when richard had asked pasha what was behind such a bizarre convention she folded her arms across her breasts and presented her back to him while she explained that men had uncontrollable urges and those urges would be a distraction to learning to use their han so the sisters encouraged the men to satisfy their needs that was why she didnt go to the city with him at night she was restricted from interfering with his needs she had turned back to him and begged him to come to her with his needs saying she would see to it that he had no desire to go to other women or if he did go to the city to at least allow her to be one of the women he slept with she told him that she could satisfy him better than any other woman and offered to prove it richard was dumbfounded by such talk to say nothing of the behavior he told pasha that he only went to the city to see the sights having grown up in the woods he had never roamed around in a city before he told her that where he came from it wasnt right to treat women in such a way he promised that if he was ever overcome with need he would come to her first she was so happy to hear this that she didnt mind when he reminded her that he wasnt ready yet she had no idea that there were times when he felt so lonely that he was sorely tempted to give in to her she was unquestionably alluring and it was sometimes difficult for him to make himself keep her at arms length richard had pasha show him everything she could of the palace he had her show him some of the city and take him on a tour of the docks to see the big boats she said they were called ships because they went to sea richard had never seen anything that large afloat she told him that they brought trade from cities of the old world farther down the coast pasha went with him to the sea and they sat for hours watching the waves or explored the tide pools richard was astounded to learn that the sea went up and down with tides all by itself she assured him that it was not the magic of the palace but did such a thing everywhere richard was spellbound by the ocean pasha was content to simply sit with him but richard couldnt afford to sit and watch the ocean too often he had things to do pasha wasnt permitted to go with him to the city in the evening in case he chose to be with a woman he had to constantly reassure her that that was not why he went out at night since it was the truth that he wasnt sleeping with any of the women he had no difficulty being sincere and convincing her he did not tell her the truth however about what he really was doing richard decided that as long as the palace wanted to provide him with money he was going to allow them to finance their own undoing he spent the palaces money wherever it would help him he became a regular at the taverns and inns the palace guards frequented whenever he was around they never paid for a drink richard made an effort to learn all their names at night he would write down the name of any new guard he had met and everything he could discover about him or any of the other guards he paid the most attention to those who guarded the prelates compound and any other place he discovered he was forbidden access he stopped by their posts whenever he was at the palace and inquired idly about their lives their girlfriends their wives their parents their children their food their problems richard bought kevin special expensive chocolates that his girlfriend favored but which kevin could ill afford on his wages the chocolates earned kevin favors from his girlfriend kevin always brightened at richards approach even when he looked tired from the favors richard loaned money to any guard who asked knowing it would never be repaid when a few made excuses as to why they didnt have the money to pay back richard would not hear their reasons telling them that he understood and that he would feel bad if they were to worry about it two of the toughest who guarded a restricted area on the west side of the palace would let him buy their ale but wouldnt warm to him richard took it as a challenge he finally struck on the idea of hiring them the services of four prostitutes two each just to get their attention they wanted to know why richard told them how the palace provided him with money and he didnt see why only he should enjoy it he told them that since they had to stand up all day guarding the palace he thought it only fair for the palace to pay to put a lady under them when they lay down the offer was too much for them to resist they were soon giving him surreptitious winks when he passed once they became amenable to his offers he saw to it that they had reason to give him the winks on a more frequent basis as richard knew they would the two guards began bragging about their romps when some of the other men found out that richard had been willing to provide those two with the services of ladies they pointed out to richard that it wasnt fair to the others that they should be excluded richard conceded that he saw the logic of their argument he soon discovered that he didnt have the time to handle individual requests so he struck on an idea he found a mistress of a brothel open to an inventive business arrangement he put the establishment on retainer open only to his friends he calculated that in this manner he was actually saving the palace money over a piecemeal arrangement he wanted the men to remember to whom they owed their gratitude so required they give the mistress the code phrase a friend of richard cypher before they would be granted admittance there were no other restrictions richard gave the mistress a healthy raise in the retainer when she complained to him that business was steadier than she had anticipated richard soothed his conscience about the morals of what he was doing by reminding himself that he couldnt change what people chose to do and it might save him from having to kill the guards when the time came in that light it made sense one day when pasha was with him and a man gave him a wink she asked why he told her it was because he was with the most attractive woman at the palace she smiled for an hour richard accustomed the guards to seeing him in the black cape of the mriswith he kept pasha happy when he was with her by frequently wearing the red coat she liked best sometimes he wore the others the black the dark blue the brown or the green pasha most liked taking him to the city but she went for hikes in the surrounding countryside to try to be a part of his interests richard learned that the guards were soldiers in the imperial order on special detachment to the palace the imperial order ruled all of the old world but seemed to have a nonintervention policy with the palace of the prophets they never interfered with any sister or any man wearing a radahan the guards were stationed at the palace to handle all the people who came to halsband island every day people poured over the bridges to come to the palace sisters saw petitioners of every want some requested charity some intervention in disputes and some wished to be guided in the creators wisdom others came to worship in the courtyards scattered throughout the island they viewed the place where sisters of the light lived as hallowed richard learned that the city of tanimura vast though it was was merely an outpost of the old world at the fringe of the empire apparently the emperor of the imperial order had an arrangement with the palace to provide guards but not law richard suspected that the guards were the emperors eyes in an area of his empire where he was denied dominion richard wondered what the emperor received in return for this arrangement richard also learned that in at least one of the restricted areas the sisters had a special guest who never came out but he was unable to discover any more richard began testing the guards loyalty to him with simple innocuous requests he told kevin that he wanted a special rose for pasha that grew only in the prelates compound richard made a point of parading pasha wearing the yellow rose past kevin kevin smiled with pride at other restricted areas richard used the flower excuse or said that he wanted to get a view of the sea from atop a particular wall he made sure to remain in sight at all times to reassure the guards and dull their sense of caution it wasnt long before he had all the guards accustomed to his forays after a time he was coming and going almost as he pleased he was their friend a trusted and valuable friend since he was collecting so many rare flowers from the restricted areas he used them to an advantage he presented them to the sisters who practiced with him they were puzzled as to why he would give them flowers from restricted areas he explained that he considered the sisters who trained him to be special and he therefore didnt want them to have just any flowers but those that were special and artfully obtained besides making them blush this explanation also disarmed an otherwise inevitable suspicion if he frequented restricted areas though as near as richard could tell there were close to two hundred sisters only six worked with him sisters tovi and cecilia were older and as kind as doting grandmothers tovi always brought cookies or some other treat to their sessions cecilia insisted on combing his hair back off his forehead with her fingers and planting a kiss there before she left both blushed furiously when he gave them rare flowers richard had difficulty thinking of either as potential enemies the first time sister merissa showed up at his door richard almost swallowed his tongue her dark hair and the way she filled her red dress made him stumble over his words like a fool sister nicci who never wore any color but black had the same effect on him when sister nicci locked her blue eyes on his he had trouble remembering how to breathe sisters merissa and nicci were older than pasha his age or maybe at most a couple of years older they carried themselves with confidence and slow grace though merissa was dark and nicci blonde they seemed to be cut from the same rare cloth the power of their han radiated from each making them almost seem to glow richard sometimes thought he could almost hear the air crackle around them neither walked both glided like swans serene and cool yet he was sure either could smelt iron ore with their placid glances neither ever grinned they bestowed small subdued smiles and only while looking him in the eye richard could feel his heart thumping faster when they did once he offered sister nicci one of his rare flowers from a restricted area his explanation of where it had come from and the story of why he was giving it to her flew right out of his head she took the white rose gingerly between a finger and thumb as if it might soil her hand and while her gaze held his she gave him one of her subdued smiles and said in an indifferent tone why thank you richard what pasha had told him about boys bringing sisters frogs came to his mind he never gave either sister nicci or merissa a flower again anything less than priceless jewels seemed an insult neither ever offered to sit on the floor for their sessions in fact the very idea of sisters merissa ar nicci sitting on the floor seemed ludicrous to him the older sisters tovi and cecilia sat on the floor the same as pasha and it seemed perfectly natural sisters merissa and nicci sat in chairs and held his hands across a small table it somehow seemed an erotic experience it made him sweat they both spoke with a quiet economy of words that added an air of nobility to their bearing while neither ever made a clear offer they managed to somehow leave no doubt in richards mind that they were available to spend the night with him richard could never pin down anything specific in what they said to confirm the impression but he had no doubt their oblique words left him room to feign missing their intent and neither ever deigned to clarify what she had said he prayed that they would never make the offer any more explicit because if they did he knew he would have to bite his tongue in half to keep from saying yes both brought to mind what pasha had told him about men having uncontrollable urges he had never been around anyone who could make him stammer and fumble and in general make himself appear a fool as those two did sisters merissa and nicci were the embodiment of pure unadulterated lust when pasha found out that sisters merissa and nicci were two of his teachers she gave a small shrug and said that they were very talented sisters and she was sure they would help him reach his han but her cheeks broke out in red blotches when perry and isaac found out about sisters merissa and nicci they both nearly succumbed to apoplexy they said they would give up all the women in the city forever just to have one night with either they said that if richard was ever offered the opportunity he had to take it and tell them every detail richard assured them that women the likes of those two would never be interested in a woods guide like him he dared not say out loud that the offer had been made the fifth sister armina was older a mature woman who was pleasant enough but all business when he had no more luck finding his han with her than any of the others she told him that it would come with time and not to feel disappointed but perhaps he should try to put more effort into it over time she warmed to him and smiled more she was surprised and flattered by the special flowers she blushed at her own blushes richard liked her straightforward personality the last sister liliana was richards favorite her easy smile was disarming her plain bony looks somehow alluring because of her open friendly nature she treated richard like a confidant richard felt relaxed with her sometimes spending more time than he could afford talking with her late into the night simply because he enjoyed her company though he had no friends among his captors she came closer than any when richard gave her the special flower she hooked some of her brown hair behind an ear and leaned in her eyes were wide with mischief wanting to know how he had gotten past the guards she giggled when he told the story he invented of sneaking behind their backs she stuck each rose proudly through a buttonhole and wore it until it wilted or he gave her another when she touched him in a friendly way it somehow seemed the natural thing to do he found himself laying a hand on her arm in the same manner when he told her funny stories about when he had been a guide they roared with laughter together holding their ribs and getting tears sister liliana told him how she had grown up on a farm and loved the country several times richard invited her on a picnic out in the hills she was comfortable and happy in the countryside she didnt care if she got her dress dirty richard couldnt imagine either sister merissa or nicci setting a foot to dirt but sister liliana would flop right down on the ground with him she never made an offer to sleep with him that in itself put him at ease she never displayed any pretense she seemed to genuinely enjoy her time with him when he opened his eyes after a session with her and admitted he felt no han she would squeeze his hands and tell him that it was all right and that she would try harder the next time to help him richard found himself telling her things he told none of the others when he confided how much he wanted the radahan off she put a hand to his arm as she gave him a wink and told him that she would see to it that he had his wish that when the time came she would do it herself she said she could understand his feelings and for him to have faith she promised that if one day he was at the end of his tolerance and he truly could stand it no longer she would help him she would remove the collar but she wanted him to know that she had faith in him and wanted him to put in his best effort to learn to control his han before she even considered it she said that other young men tried to forget their collar by bedding every woman willing she told him that she could understand urges but she hoped that if he chose to sleep with a woman it would be because he liked her and not because he was trying to forget the collar she told him not to go to the prostitutes because they were dirty and he would catch something richard told her that he was in love with someone and didnt want to be unfaithful to her she grinned and clapped him on the back and said she was proud of him richard didnt tell her that kahlan had sent him away but he wanted to he knew that someday if he could stand it no longer he could tell liliana and she would listen and understand because he was so comfortable around her he felt that if anyone could help him find his han it would be her he hoped it would be her richard had had only a brother and didnt know what it would be like to have a sister but he imagined that if he did have one she would be like liliana the name sister liliana had a different meaning to him than was intended she seemed his soulmate still he couldnt let himself open up completely to her the sisters were his captors not his friends they were the enemy for now but he knew that when the time came liliana would side with him richards lessons with the six sisters took up at most two hours a day a waste of two hours as far as he was concerned he was no closer to touching his han than he had been the first time sister verna had him try when richard could manage to be alone he explored the land around the palace and found the limits of his invisible chain when he reached the farthest distance the collar would allow him to go it felt like trying to walk through a tenfootthick wall of mud layered over solid rock it was frustrating to be able to see beyond without obstruction yet not be able to continue walking it happened as near as he could tell about the same distance from the palace in any direction it was a good number of miles but once he found the limit his world began to feel very small indeed the day he found his boundary the limits of his prison he went to the hagen woods and killed a mriswith his only true solace was gratch richard spent most nights with the gar he wrestled with his furry friend ate with him and slept with him richard hunted food for gratch but the gar was learning to hunt on his own richard was relieved to learn that he didnt have the time to be with him every night hungry or not gratch was always distraught when richard missed a night richard was worried that pasha would know where he went all the time by his collar but quite by accident he discovered something else his mriswith cape did it masked from pasha his whereabouts when he wore the cape she couldnt find him by his radahan by his han she was puzzled by his blanking out from her sense of where he was but didnt seem too concerned offering that perhaps it had an explanation that she would come to figure out one day she seemed to think it was a deficiency on her part richard never offered her the solution he realized that this was the reason none with the gift ever knew a mriswith was coming richard wondered why he had been able to see the beast in his mind maybe it was as sister verna said that he was using his han but sisters and wizards knew how to use their han and couldnt detect the mriswith richard had an easier time when he could go where he pleased and know pasha would not know where he was it saved thinking up explanations he worried that if she ever discovered the reason she would destroy his cape so he hid a second for that contingency gratch seemed to be bigger every time richard saw him by the end of richards first month at the palace the gar was a head taller than richard and significantly stronger when they wrestled gratch learned to be careful not to hurt him richard also spent some of his time with warren getting him used to going outside at first he took warren out into the courtyards at night warren told him that the size of the sky and landscape frightened him so richard reasoned that night would show him less of the landscape at least to start warren said that the sisters had had him down in the vaults for so long that he thought he just became used to being closed in but he was tired of it richard felt sorry for him and wanted to help him he really liked warren he was about as smart as anyone richard had ever met there didnt seem to be anything that warren didnt know at least a little about warren was nervous about being away from the safety of the palace but was reassured by richards presence and the way richard never ridiculed his fears richard was always considerate never taking warren farther than he felt comfortable richard told him that it was just like after you were injured and had been laid up for a while it took time to stretch the old muscles after a few weeks of their nighttime forays richard started taking warren out in the daylight first just up onto the walls to look at the vastness of the sky and ocean warren was always close to a stairway that led back into the palace so he was reassured by having an escape route close by if he felt he had to go back inside a few times he did and richard always went with him and talked about other things to take his mind away from the uncomfortable feeling richard had warren bring a book outside with him so he could be distracted by reading letting warren forget about the size of the sky helped on a bright sunny day after warren had become comfortable outofdoors richard decided to try taking him out into the hills warren was a bit giddy at first but as they sat on a rock high in the hills overlooking the countryside and the city warren said that he felt as if he had mastered his fear he said that he still felt uncomfortable but he felt the fear was under control he grinned at the vast landscape spread out below enjoying the sight that for so long his fears denied him richard told him that he was happy that he was the one to have been able to guide him out of his mole hole warren laughed warren said he needed adventure in his life and this felt like the beginning as far as warrens search for information was going he had been able to find out precious little he had so far found only a few references in old books that talked about the valley of the lost and the baka ban mana but what he found was intriguing the information made reference to the power the wizards had given the baka ban mana in return for taking their land so that they could someday have their land restored it said that when the completing link was joined with this power invested in their spirit woman the towers would fall richard thought about du chaillu saying that he was the caharin and that they were now husband and wife that was a linking of sorts he wondered if over the intervening time the meaning of this joining could have been taken to mean marriage instead of its original intent as they sat watching the vast landscape warren said the prelate has been reading prophecies and histories that talk about the pebble in the pond richards ears perked up he remembered kahlan singing him a song about screelings that mentioned the pebble in the pond warren hadnt studied those prophecies before and hadnt been able to piece together their importance as of yet do you know what the wizards second rule is richard asked second rule wizards have rules whats the first richard looked over do you remember that night jedidiah broke his leg and i told you that you had carpet ash on you and you tried to brush it off i was using the wizards first rule warren frowned you think on it warren and let me know what you figure out in the meantime its important that you speed up the search for the information i asked you about well it will be a little easier now that sister becky is sick every morning and wont be looking over my shoulder shes pregnant he said in answer to richards questioning frown do many of the sisters have children sure warren said what with all the young wizards around who can no longer go to the city the sisters help out with their needs so they can study richard gave warren a suspicious look is sister beckys child yours warren blushed furiously no he kept his eyes to the city im waiting for the one i love pasha richard said warren nodded richard looked down at the palace of the prophets and the city that surrounded it needs warren do all the children of men with the gift inherit it oh no its said that many thousands of years ago before the old and new world were separated many had the gift but over time those in power methodically killed off young ones with the gift so they would have no one to threaten their rule they also withheld the required teaching it used to be that fathers taught their sons but as fewer were born with the gift and it skipped more and more generations those who knew the way jealously guarded their knowledge thats the reason the palace of the prophets was created to help those with the gift who had no teacher as time went on the gift was bred out of the race of man the way you breed a trait out of an animal this gave the wizards who held power less and less opposition all the time now that the trait is so bred out one born with the gift is exceedingly rare maybe only one child in a thousand fathered by a wizard is born with the gift were a dying breed richard looked to the city again then to the palace his eyes locked on the palace richard slowly rose to his feet theyre not seeing to our needs he whispered theyre using us as breeding stock warren stood his brow wrinkled what theyre using the palace the young men at the palace to breed wizards warrens brow furrowed deeper why richards jaw muscles flexed i dont know but i intend to find out good warren said with a grin i need an adventure richard gave him a cold look do you know what adventure is warren warren nodded the smile still on his face an exciting experience adventure is being scared to death and not knowing if you will live or die or if the ones you love will live or die adventure is being in trouble you dont know how to get out of warren fumbled with the braiding on his sleeve i never thought about it like that well you think on it richard said because im about to start an adventure what are you going to do the less you know the less adventure youll have to worry about you just find out the things i need to know if the veil is torn were all going to have a neverending adventure well warren said with a twinkle in his eye i found out at least one thing of help then the stone of tears warren nodded with a grin i found out there is no way you could have seen it its locked behind the veil in a way its part of the veil are you sure are you sure i couldnt have seen it positive the stone of tears is the seal that keeps the nameless one locked in his prison of the dead in the underworld he can rule the souls of the dead there with him but he cannot come to this world the stone of tears seals him there good richard said with a relieved sigh thats great warren good work he gently gripped warrens robe and pulled him closer youre sure theres no way the stone of tears could be in this world warren confidently shook his head none its impossible the only way for the stone of tears to be in this world would be for it to come through the gateway richard felt his flesh beginning to tingle gateway whats the gateway well the gateway is what the name implies a passage in this case a passage between the world of the living and the world of the dead its magic of both worlds a passage constructed of magic the gateway can only be opened with both additive and subtractive magic the nameless one has only subtractive since he is in the underworld so he cant open the gateway the same way someone in this world could not open it because we have only additive magic bumps were rising on richards arms but someone in this world someone with both forms of magic could open the gateway well sure warren stammered if they had the gateway but it has been lost for over three thousand years its gone he gave richard a selfassured smile were safe richard wasnt smiling he grabbed warrens robes in both hands and yanked his face close warren tell me the gateway isnt called the magic of orden tell me the gateway isnt the three boxes of orden warrens eyes slowly expanded to the size of gold pieces where did you hear that name for it he whispered in a disquieted tone im the only one in the palace besides the prelate and two other sisters who are permitted to read the books that call the gateway by its ancient name richard gritted his teeth what happens if one of the boxes is opened they cant be opened warren insisted they cant i told you it takes both kinds of magic additive and subtractive to open a box richard shook him what happens his eyes still wide warren swallowed then the gateway between the worlds is opened the veil is breached the seal is off the nameless one and the stone of tears would be in this world warren nodded as richard tightened his grip on the robes and if the box were to be closed that would close the gateway seal the breach no well yes but it can only be closed by one with the gift it takes the touch of magic to close the gateway but if one with the gift closes the box the gateway then it ruptures the balance because he has only additive magic and the nameless one escapes the underworld more correctly this world would be swallowed into the world of the dead then how can the box be closed to keep the worlds separated the same way the gateway is opened with both additive and subtractive magic and what about the stone of tears i dont know i would have to study then you better study fast please warren whined you dont mean that you know where the boxes are you havent found them have you found them the last time i saw the boxes one was opened about to suck my bastard father into the underworld warren fainted chapter under the impotent rays of the lateday sun an old woman was spreading wood ash on the ice covering the vast expanse of stairs kahlan walked past relieved that the old woman didnt look up to see that the person in the heavy clothes white fur mantle and carrying a pack and bow was the mother confessor returned to aydindril she was in no mood for starting a celebration tonight she was exhausted already before coming home to the palace she had climbed up to the wizards keep on the mountainside but the keep was stone cold and dark as death the shields were in place though a confessor could enter but no one was inside zedd was not there the keep sat now as the last time she had seen it so many months ago when she had left to find the missing great wizard she had found him and helped stop the threat from darken rahl but now she needed the great wizard again since leaving the galean army nearly a month before she had been struggling to reach aydindril and zedd storms had raged for days at a time passes had been rendered impassable by the weather and snow forcing them to backtrack and find alternate routes it had been a frustrating and tiring journey but the despair at reaching her goal and not finding zedd was withering kahlan had made her way through the side streets avoiding kings row the palaces on kings row housed dignitaries staffs and guards of the lands that were represented in aydindril the kings and queens and rulers of those lands stayed in their palaces when they came to address the council the palaces were a matter of pride for each land and each was magnificent although none could begin to compare to the confessors palace kahlan had avoided kings row because she would be recognized there and she didnt want to be recognized right now she wanted only to find zedd and failing that speak to the council so she headed toward the service area to the side near the kitchens chandalen was out in the forest he didnt want to come into aydindril the size of the city and the multitudes of people made him uneasy though he denied it and claimed only to be more comfortable sleeping outside kahlan couldnt blame him after being alone in the mountains for so long she too was uneasy going into the city even though she had grown up in this place and knew its streets and majestic buildings as well as chandalen knew the plains around the mud people village the people everywhere made her feel closed in as never before chandalen wanted to go home to his people now that she was delivered safely to aydindril she could understand his desire to be off but asked him to rest the night and say goodbye to her in the morning she had told orsk to spend the night with chandalen his presence was wearing his one eye following her everywhere his jumping to help her with everything his constantly standing ready to do her bidding at the slightest indication it was like having a dog continually at heel she needed a night away from that chandalen seemed to understand she didnt know what she was going to do about orsk a stifling blast of warm air hit her as she went in through the kitchen entrance at the sound of the door a thin woman in a sparkling white apron spun to her what are you doing in here get out you beggar as the woman lifted her wooden spoon in a threatening manner kahlan pushed back the hood of her mantle the woman gasped kahlan smiled mistress sanderholt im so pleased to see you again mother confessor the woman fell to her knees clasping her hands together oh mother confessor forgive me i didnt recognize you oh good spirits be praised is it really you kahlan pulled the wiry woman to her feet ive missed you so mistress sanderholt kahlan held out her arms give me a hug mistress sanderholt fell into kahlans arms oh child its so good to see you she pushed away tears running down her face we didnt know what had become of you we were so worried i thought i might never see you again it has been a long and difficult time i cant tell you how good it is to see your face again mistress sanderholt started pulling kahlan toward a side table come you need a bowl of soup i have some on now if these featherbrains who do what scarcely passes for cooking havent ruined it with too much pepper the welter of cooks and help caught the words and kept their heads down applying their attention to their tasks the sounds of whisks and spoons on bowls stepped up men picked up sacks and hurried away brushes worked at pots with greater zeal butter hissed in hot pans and bread in ovens and meat on spits suddenly needed checking i dont have time right now mistress sanderholt but i have things i must tell you important things i know i have things to tell you too but right now i must see the council its urgent ive been traveling a long time and im exhausted but i must see the council before i rest we will talk tomorrow mistress sanderholt couldnt resist another hug of course child rest well we will talk tomorrow kahlan took the shortest route through the immense hall used for important ceremonies and celebrations fires in the large magnificent fireplaces set around the room between fluted columns sent shadows of herself spiraling around her as she crossed the green slate floor the room was empty now allowing her footsteps to echo overhead from the intricate lierne vaulting with the wavelike sweeping ribs her father used to set thousands of walnuts and acorns representing troops all over the floor of this room to teach her battle tactics she turned down the hall at the far end toward the corridor to the council chambers in the confessors private gallery groups of four glossy black marble columns to each side supported a progression of polychrome vaults at the end before the council chambers was a round twostoryhigh pantheon dedicated to the memory of heroines the founding mother confessors their portraits in frescoes between the seven massive pillars ranging to the skylight were twice life size kahlan always felt like a pretender to the post in the presence of the seven stern faces that overlooked the room she felt they were saying and who are you kahlan amnell to think you could be the mother confessor knowing the histories of those heroines only made her feel all the more inadequate grabbing both brass levers she threw the tall mahogany doors open and marched into the council chambers a huge dome capped the enormous room at the far end the main vault was decorated with an ornate fresco celebrating the glory of magda searus the first mother confessor her fingers were touching the back of the hand of her wizard merritt who had laid down his life to protect her together now for all time in the colorful fresco the two oversaw the mother confessors who followed and sat in the first chair and their wizards between the colossal gold capitals of the columns thrusting up around the room were sinuous polished mahogany railings at the edge of balconies that overlooked the elegant chamber the arched openings set at intervals around the room and leading up to the balconies were decorated with sculpted stuccos of heroic scenes beyond were windows looking out over the courtyards round windows around the lower edge of the dome also let light into the glistening chamber at the far end was the semicircular dais where the councilors sat behind an elaborate curved desk the opulent first chair in the center was the tallest a clump of men were gathered around the first chair by the numbers kahlan judged about half the council to be present as she strode across long swaths of sunlight on the patterned marble floor the heads began to follow her progress someone was sitting in the first chair although not enforced in recent times it was a capital offense for a councilor to take the first chair as it was considered tantamount to a declaration of revolution the conversation hushed as she approached it was high prince fyren of kelton sitting in the chair his feet were up on the desk and he didnt take them down as he watched her draw near his eyes were on her but he was listening to a man with smootheddown dark hair and beard streaked with a touch of gray leaning over whispering to him the mans hands were in the opposite sleeves of his plain robes strange she thought for an advisor to be dressed so like a wizard prince fyren lifted his eyebrows in delight mother confessor with deliberate care he took his polished boots down and came to his feet he put his hands to the desk and leaned over looking down so good to see you before kahlan had always had a wizard now she had none no protection she could not afford to appear timid or vulnerable she glared up at prince fyren if i ever again catch you in the chair of the mother confessor i will kill you he straightened with a smirk you would use your power on a councilor i will slit your throat with my knife if i have to the man in the plain robes watched her with unmoving dark eyes the other councilors blanched prince fyren pulled his dark blue coat open and rested a hand on his hip mother confessor i meant no offense you have been gone for a long time we all thought you were dead there has been no confessor in the palace for what he looked to a few of the other men four five six months hand still on his hip he held his other out and gave a bow i meant no offense mother confessor your chair is returned to you of course kahlan eyed the remaining men it is late the council will meet in full session first thing in the morning every councilor will be present the midlands is at war prince fyren lifted an eyebrow war on whose authority we have not discussed such a grave matter kahlan swept her gaze over the councilors letting it finally settle on prince fyren on my authority as the mother confessor whispering broke out among the men prince fyren never let his eyes leave hers when she glowered at the men who were whispering it sputtered out i want every councilor here first thing in the morning you are adjourned for now gentlemen kahlan turned on her heel and marched from the room she didnt recognize any of the guards she saw throughout the palace but then she wouldnt zedd had told her before how most of the home guard had been killed in the fall of aydindril to dhara she missed the old faces the center of the confessors palace in aydindril was dominated by a monumental eightbranched staircase lit from four stories overhead by natural light that came through the glass roof the vast square was surrounded at midlevel by arcaded corridors their arched openings separated by polished columns of wildly variegated gold and green marble standing on square plinth blocks each decorated with a medallion of a past ruler of one of the lands of the midlands the hundreds upon hundreds of glistening vaseshaped balusters had been turned from a mellow yellow stone that seemed to glow from within the square newels made of a dusky brown granite were nearly as tall as she and each was capped with a goldleafed lamp florid carvings in stone covered expansive panels under the complex bands of dentil moldings that ran in mitered bands over the tops of the capitals the center landing held statues of eight mother confessors kahlan had seen modest palaces that would fit within the space the staircase occupied the monumental staircase and the room that held it had taken forty years to build the expense borne entirely by kelton in partial recompense for their opposition to the joining of the lands into the midlands and the war it spawned it was also decreed that no leader of kelton could ever be honored with a medallion at the base of the columns the staircase was dedicated to the people of the midlands and was to honor them not those who built it as penalty kelton was now a powerful land of the midlands in good standing and kahlan thought it foolish to rebuke a people for something their ancestors had done centuries ago as she reached the central landing and turned up the second flight toward her room she saw a phalanx of servants waiting at the top of the stairs they all bowed as one when her eyes fell on them she thought it must look absurd nearly thirty sparkling combed and buffed people in clean crisp uniforms all bowing to a filthy woman in wolf hides carrying a bow and heavy pack well this could only mean one thing word of her arrival had swept through the whole of the palace already there wasnt likely to be a gardener in the farthest greenhouse that didnt by now know the mother confessor was home rise my children kahlan said when she reached the top of the stairs they moved back to make way for her and then it started would the mother confessor like a bath would the mother confessor like a massage would the mother confessor like her hair washed and brushed would the mother confessor like her nails buffed would the mother confessor care to take any petitioners would the mother confessor like to see any advisors would the mother confessor like any letters written would the mother confessor like wish want need or require a whole list of things kahlan addressed the mistress of the maidservants bernadette i would like a bath nothing else just a bath two women rushed off to see to the bath mistress bernadettes eyes made an involuntary flick down at kahlans attire would the mother confessor like to have any of her clothes mended or cleaned kahlan thought about the blue dress in her pack i guess i have a few things that need cleaning she thought about all the rest of her clothes most soaked with blood from one battle or another i guess i have a lot of things that need to be washed yes mother confessor and would you like me to lay out your white dress for tonight tonight mistress bernadette reddened runners have already been sent to kings row mother confessor everyone will want to welcome the mother confessor home kahlan groaned she was dead tired she didnt want to greet people just to tell women how fine their hair looked all pinned and decorated or men how fine the cut of their coat was or to listen patiently to supplications that invariably involved the distribution of funds and always sought to prove that the appellant was in no way seeking advantage but only relief from the inequitable situation in which he was mired mistress bernadette gave her a corrective look as she had done when kahlan was little as if to say look here young lady you have obligations and i expect no trouble about it what she said though was everyone has been fraught with concern over the safe return of the mother confessor it would do their hearts good to see you safe and well kahlan doubted that what mistress bernadette really meant was that it would do kahlan good to remind people that the mother confessor was still alive and in charge kahlan sighed of course bernadette thank you for reminding me people have kept me in their hearts and been worried mistress bernadette smiled as she bowed her head yes mother confessor as the rest of the servants rushed off kahlan leaned toward mistress bernadette i remember when you would have added a swat on my behind for having to remind me of things mistress bernadettes smile returned i think you are too smart now for that mother confessor she rubbed an invisible spot from the back of her hand mother confessor did you bring any of the other confessors home with you will any of the others be returning soon kahlans features slid into her confessors face as her mother had taught her im sorry bernadette i thought you knew they are all dead i am the last living confessor mistress bernadettes eyes filled with tears as she whispered a prayer may the good spirits be with them always why should they commence now kahlan said tersely they didnt bother to be with dennee the day the quad caught her the fireplaces in her rooms were all blazing as she had known they would be and would have been every day she had been away month after month the fires in the mother confessors rooms would never be allowed to go out in the winter in case she returned there was a silver tray on a table with a fresh loaf of bread a pot of tea and a steaming bowl of spice soup mistress sanderholt knew spice soup was her favorite spice soup reminded kahlan of richard now she remembered making it for him and he for her after dropping her pack and bow to the floor kahlan crossed the plush carpets and went into the next room she stood idly rubbing her fingers on one of the great polished posts at the foot of her bed staring remembering that she was supposed to be here with richard the day they arrived in aydindril they were to already have been wed she had promised him this big bed kahlan remembered the joy in her heart the day they talked about being wed and coming to aydindril as husband and wife she felt a tear roll down her cheek she gasped a deep breath against the hot pain that burned through her chest and wiped the tear away with her fingertips kahlan went to the glassed doors opening them out onto the expansive balcony she put her trembling fingers to the broad icy railing and stood in the cold air looking up the mountainside to the wizards keep its dark stone walls standing out in the last golden rays of the sunset where are you zedd she whispered i need you he came awake with a gasp as he slid and thumped his head he sat up blinking an old woman with straight black and white jawlength hair was sitting opposite him cowering in a corner the two of them were inside a coach it rolled abruptly sliding him across to the other side the woman was staring in his direction he blinked in surprise at her her eyes were completely white who are you he asked who be you she asked right back i asked first i she drew her cloak around her fine green dress i dont know who i be who be you he held a finger skyward im im he let out a thin sigh im afraid i dont know who i am either dont i look like anyone you recognize she pulled her cloak a little tighter i do not know i be blind i cannot see what you look like blind oh well im sorry he rubbed his head where he had hit it on the side of the coach looking down he saw that he was wearing fine clothes a maroon robe with black sleeves that had three rows of silver brocade around them well he thought at least i must be wealthy he picked a black cane off the floor giving its fine silverwork a look he turned and thumped it against the roof in the direction of where the driver must be sitting up top the old woman jumped with a fright what be that noise oh sorry i was trying to get the drivers attention the driver must have heard the coach slid to a stop and then rocked as someone climbed down when the door drew open and he saw the size of the man in a longcoat sticking his windburned face in he clutched his cane and slid back who are you he asked brandishing the cane me im just a big fool the big man growled his deeply creased face softened into a little smile names ahern well ahern what are you doing with us have you kidnapped us are we being held for ransom ahern chuckled more like the other way around id say what do you mean how long have we been asleep and who are we ahern looked to the sky dear spirits how do i get myself into

who be i the woman asked you are elda rybnik her name is rybnik too ruben asked are we related ahern hesitated yes and no you two are husband and wife sort of ruben leaned toward the big man i think

said ahern cleared his throat all right now you two listen to me you both were sick you had me take you to see three women he leaned closer to ruben and scowled three sorceresses sorceresses ruben yelped no wonder we dont know who we are you took us to witches and had a spell put on us ahern put a calming hand on him be quiet and listen you are a wizard ruben gawked at ahern ahern turned to elda and you are a sorceress ruben waved his arms around with a flourish no im not he snapped at last or youd be changed to a toad ahern shook his head with a grumble your power is gone well ruben asked as he straightened his back was i a talented wizard you were good enough to put those cursed fingers of yours to the side of my thick head and put it in my mind to help you you said wizards had to use people sometimes to do what must be done the burden of a wizard you called it you said helping you was something i would have done anyway that you were only calling on the goodness within me to hurry my thinking along anyway that and more gold than ive ever seen convinced me to do something i ought to know better than to get tangled in i surely dont like anything to do with wizards and magic and i be a sorceress elda asked a blind sorceress well no maam you were blind but you could use your gift to see see better than i can see with my eyes then why be i blind now both of you were sick sick with some kind of evil magic the three sorceresses agreed to help you but in order to cure you they had to well they had to give you both something that would make your magic your gift go away you made me wait outside so i dont know what they did i just know what you told me before you went back in for the last time to have it done ruben leaned in youre making this up ahern ignored him and went on the sickness you two had was feeding on your good magic i dont know the way magic works and the spirits know i dont want to know i only know what you told me the way you explained it to me when you came out and convinced me to help you you said that in order to help you the three sorceresses had to give you something to make your magic go away only in that way could you two heal the evil magic wouldnt wither and die and your wounds heal as long as it had the good magic to latch on to to feed on so now we have no magic well i dont know how it all works but as i understand it you cant really get rid of your magic what the three women did was make you forget everything about yourselves so you wouldnt know you had any magic so the evil magic wouldnt know either that it was there so thats why neither of you knows who you are or how to use magic thats why elda is blind ruben squinted why would the sorceresses agree to help us mostly because of elda they said she was a legend among the sorceresses of nicobarese something about what she did when she was younger and used to live here ruben stared at the big man it has to be true he turned to elda it has to be true no one could invent such an absurd story what do you think i think as you i think he be telling us the truth good ahern said now comes the part you arent going to like what about our magic when does it come back when do we remember who we are ahern raked his meaty fingers through his shaggy gray hair thats the part you arent going to like the three women said they doubt you two will ever get it back you may never remember you may never get your magic back the silence echoed in the coach ruben finally spoke why would we agree to such a thing ahern picked at his fingers because you had no choice you were both sick mighty sick elda more than you she would have been dead by now and you within another day or two at most you had no choice it was the only way ruben folded his hands over the silver head of his cane well if that is so then we had to if we never remember we will just learn to be ruben and elda and start our lives over ahern shook his head theres a problem about that you told me that the three women said that if the evil magic finally left you then you might be able to get your memory and your magic back you told me that it was imperative that you get it back you said that there was great trouble in the world that you had to help with you said that it was a matter of grave importance to every person alive you said you had something you must do what trouble what is it i must do you didnt tell me you said i wouldnt understand well how do we get our memories our magic back ahern glanced to each it may not come back the three women didnt know if it ever would but if it is to come back it will only come back with a shock a great emotional jolt or shock an emotional shock like what like maybe anger maybe if you are angry enough ruben frowned so what you are to slap me to make me angry no you said that you didnt know how but something like that wouldnt work you said it required a great emotional shock but you didnt know what it could be or how to bring it about you also said that if something did bring on the anger it would be violent and terrible because of the magic you said you had no choice though because you would die if you didnt do this ruben and elda sat in silence and thought while ahern watched them so where are you taking us why are we in this coach aydindril aydindril never heard of it where is it how far aydindril is the home of the confessors clear on the other side of the rangshada mountains its a long journey weeks maybe a month it will be close to winter solstice the longest night of the year before we get there seems a long way to go ruben said why did i want you to take us there you said you had to go to the wizards keep you said that it takes magic to get in but you dont have any magic now so you told me how to get you in seems you were a troublesome child and had a secret way to sneak in and out of the keep without triggering the magic ruben drew his finger and thumb down his smooth jaw and you say i told you it was urgent ahern gave a grim nod then wed best be on our way just as she had been smiling to people all evening kahlan smiled to the woman in an elaborate dark blue gown before her the woman was relating how concerned everyone had been for the mother confessor her insincerity was as transparent as the hypocrisy from everyone else kahlan had spent her whole life listening to duplicitous people try to mask their avaricious nature with words of altruism and amity it sickened her kahlan wished that just once one of these people she lived and worked with would have the honesty to admit how strongly they hated her and how it infuriated them that she wouldnt allow them to rape the midlands and its people for their own benefit she admonished herself that they were not all like that kahlan idly wondered as she half listened what this dignified wife of an ambassador would think if instead of seeing the mother confessor standing before her in a sparkling white dress wearing a choker of jewels worth half her kingdom she were to see her on a horse naked painted white and drenched in blood as she hacked with a sword at the faces of men trying to kill her kahlan decided the woman would probably faint when the woman finally paused for a breath kahlan thanked her for her concern and moved away it was getting late and she was tired she had an early appointment with the council seeing herself as she passed a mirror kahlan felt as if she had been dreaming for a very long time and had awakened the same as she was before the mother confessor in her white confessors dress at the confessors palace in aydindril but she wasnt the same as the last time she had been here she felt a hundred years older she smiled at least the bath had been wonderful she couldnt remember finding a bath so luxurious she had almost forgotten what it was like to be clean near the doorway another finely dressed lady approached a twitch of a frown touched kahlans brow the womans sandy hair seemed too short out of character with the other womens hair which brushed their shoulders but her dress certainly was in character it was a costly looking black gown letting her shoulders and the sparkling emerald necklace show the woman blocked the doorway just before kahlan stepped through she dropped a hurried curtsy her blue eyes darting about as she came up mother confessor i must speak to you its urgent im sorry but im afraid i dont remember you the womans blue eyes never looked up they were constantly checking the other people you dont know me we have a friend in common when the woman caught sight of a sourfaced older woman looking in their direction she put her back to the woman mother confessor did you come to aydindril alone or did you bring someone with you i have a friend chandalen who came with me but he is in the woods to the south for the night why that is not the name i was hoping to hear she looked up into kahlans eyes you must her words trailed off her intense blue eyes slowly opened wider she stood as if turned to stone what is it kahlan asked the woman seemed to be seeing specters you you the color had drained from her in a sickening rush the woman staggered back a step the sudden whiteness of her shoulders against the black fabric of her gown made her look like a spirit in a dress her jaw trembled as she tried without success to bring words forth her face was a mask of terror her blue eyes rolled back into her head too late kahlan reached out for her the woman crumpled into a heap on the floor people nearby gasped kahlan along with others bent to the woman men and women crowded around murmuring to each other about too much wine the sourfaced woman elbowed her way through to the front jebra i thought it was jebra kahlan looked up you know this woman and who are you the woman abruptly realized who she was speaking to she flashed a sudden smile and curtsied awkwardly i am the lady ordith condatith de dackidvich mother confessor im so pleased to meet you at last ive been wanting to talk kahlan cut her off who is this woman do you know her know her her sour expression returned she is my body servant her name is jebra bevinvier ill have the lazy wench thrashed body servant a man said i dont think so ive had dinner with lady jebra and i can assure you she is a lady lady ordith sniffed shes an imposter then you must pay her well the man said sarcastically she stays in the finest inns and pays with gold lady ordith gave the man another haughty sniff and snatched a guards arm you take this wench to my quarters im staying at the kelton palace ill get to the bottom of this kahlan came to her feet and gave the lady ordith a withering glare you will do no such thing unless you are presuming to tell the mother confessor what to do in her own palace lady ordith stammered an apology kahlan snapped her ringers to the side while holding lady ordiths gaze guards jumped forward kahlan turned take lady jebra to a guest room have a servant bring her some ginger tea cold towels for her head and anything else she wants i do not want her disturbed by anyone and that includes the lady ordith im retiring for the night and i do not wish to be disturbed by anyone either i have an early session with the council after i meet with the council i want lady jebra brought to me the guards saluted and bent to lady jebra when kahlan reached her room she was brought out of her troubled thoughts by the sight of two keltish guards from the kelton palace at the doors to her room when the guards saw her one of them coolly tapped on the door with the butt of his spear someone was in her rooms kahlan glared at the impassive guards as she stalked through the doors no one was in the outer room she stormed into the bedroom when she saw him she froze to a halt prince fyren was standing on her bed with his back to her he gave her a smirk over his shoulder while he urinated in the center of her bed when he was finished prince fyren turned while he buttoned his trousers what in the name of the spirits do you think you are doing she whispered he lifted an eyebrow to her as he strutted past just letting the mother confessor know how happy we all are to have her home his coat was open he smoothed the ruffles on the front of his white shirt as he paused at the door sleep well mother confessor kahlan yanked six times on the bell cord six breathless maidservants met her as she was charging down the hall you wanted something mother confessor kahlan gritted her teeth take my mattress and bedcovers outside to the courtyard and burn them the girl blinked mother confessor drag the mattress from my bed along with all the bedcovers out into the courtyard below my balcony and set them on fire kahlan clenched her fists what part dont you understand the six flinched back a step yes mother confessor they stood trembling their eyes wide now mother confessor if i wanted it done tomorrow i would have called you tomorrow kahlan reached the stairs over grand entrance just in time to see prince fyren joining the man in plain robes waiting there for him his dark eyes met hers for a long moment guards she screamed down toward the doors the men in uniform looked up as they came running diplomatic privilege is suspended if i see that keltish pig or any of his personal guard in this palace before the council session tomorrow morning i will personally skin you all alive after i kill him they saluted kahlan saw lady ordith in the hall leading to the entrance watching everything that had just happened lady ordith lady ordith was already staring up i believe you said you were a guest of the kelton palace get out of mine she was stammering her goodbyes as kahlan spun on her heel and headed back to her room she picked up a handful of guards on the way outside her rooms she waited until they were lined up before her doors if anyone comes into my room tonight it had better be over your corpses do you understand they all saluted to indicate that they did inside kahlan threw the white mantle around her shoulders and went out onto the balcony into the bitter cold night she stood with her back straight near the railing as she looked down on the scene in the courtyard below she wanted to run but she couldnt she was the mother confessor she had to do what all the mother confessors before her had done protect the midlands she was alone and had no one to help her in her duty tears rolled down her cheeks as she watched flames leap up from her bed the bed she had promised richard chapter the reflections of the mother confessor in her white dress rotated around the polished black columns as she marched down the gallery the mother confessors private entrance to the council chambers kahlan was an hour early she planned to be sitting in the first chair as she watched all the councilors arrive she didnt want them talking among themselves before she was present she froze to a halt as she threw the doors open the room was packed every council chair was occupied the galleries were all packed with people not only officials administrators staff and nobility but ordinary people farmers shopkeepers merchants cooks tradesmen wagon drivers and laborers men and women of every sort every eye was on her as she stood before the doors across the huge room the councilors all sat in their chairs no one made a sound someone was sitting in the first chair from this distance she couldnt see who it was but she knew kahlan touched her fingers to the bone necklace at her throat and prayed to the good spirits for protection and strength her boots echoed off the marble as she strode through patches of sunlight there was something on the floor before the dais but she couldnt tell what it was when kahlan reached the curved desk the man sitting in the first chair was not the one she expected stretched out on a litter before the dais lay the body of prince fyren his skin was pasty his arms were folded his hands laid over the bloodsoaked ruffles of his shirt his sword rested across his body prince fyrens throat had been sliced open nearly to his spinal column kahlan looked up to the solemn dark eyes watching her he came forward from the back of the first chair and folded his hands together on the desk a quick glance revealed what she hadnt noticed before a ring of guards around the room she glared up at the man with the dark hair and beard get out of my chair or i will kill you myself the room rang with the sound of swords being drawn without taking his dark eyes from her the man gestured with a flick of his hand every sword went hesitantly back into its scabbard you are done killing people mother confessor he said in a quiet voice prince fyren was your last victim kahlan frowned who are you neville ranson still his eyes did not leave her as he turned his hand up a ball of flame ignited above his palm wizard neville ranson still his eyes did not leave her as he cast the ball of flame skyward it rose obediently toward the peak of the dome where it broke with a pop into thousands of sparkles astonished gasps filled the room wizard ranson leaned back and drew open a scroll we have a great many charges mother confessor where would you like to begin without turning her head kahlans eyes took a sweep of what she could see of the room there was no chance of escape none even if the man before her were not a wizard since they will all be invented i guess it doesnt matter why dont we just dispense with the mockery and simply proceed to the execution the room remained dead silent wizard ranson did not smile his eyebrows lifted oh no mockery mother confessor but serious charges we are here to get to the truth of them unlike the confessors i refuse to put an innocent person to death before we are finished today everyone here will know the truth of your treason i want the people to know the full extent of your vile tyranny kahlan clasped her hands together as she stood with her back straight she wore her confessors face the people all leaned forward a little since it is a long list ranson said we might as well begin with the most serious charge he glanced down treason and since when is defending the people of the midlands treason wizard ranson slammed his fist to the desk as he shot to his feet defending the people of the midlands i have never in my life heard such filth from the mouth of a woman he smoothed his tan robes at his stomach and then sat back down your defense of the people was to plunge them into war you would condemn thousands to die to assuage your dread that someone other than yourself would rule and rule with the unanimous agreement of the council i might add it is hardly unanimous if the mother confessor dissents dissents for her own selfish motives and who is it that you would have rule the midlands kelton yourself the saviors of all people the imperial order a prickling sensation rose up her legs kahlan felt as if the whole of the dome overhead were collapsing down on her her head spun she thought she might be sick right there in front of everyone she forced her stomach to behave the imperial order the imperial order slaughtered ebinissia they crush all opposition to steal rule for themselves lies the imperial order is dedicated to benevolent rule they simply wish to put your murderous intents to an end benevolent they raped and butchered the people of ebinissia ranson chuckled come come mother confessor the imperial order has murdered no one he turned to a man kahlan didnt recognize councilor thurstan has your crown city been harmed by anyone the jowly man looked surprised i have just arrived two days ago from the beautiful city of ebinissia and they know nothing of their slaughter the crowd chuckled with him ranson smiled petulantly at her did you not expect mother confessor that we would have witnesses to expose your preposterous stories this is simply a fiction meant to inflame peoples fears and stir them to war ranson snapped his fingers a woman in drab worn clothes came in and stood to the side ranson gently told her not to be frightened and to tell her story the woman told of how her children had to go to bed hungry because she had no money she said she had been forced into prostitution to feed her children kahlan knew it was a lie there was no scarcity of charitable people and groups who would help anyone truly needing it for the next hour one witness after another was paraded in and each told a story of hunger and want and how the palace would not give them money to feed and clothe themselves not caring if their children starved the people in the balconies listened with rapt attention to the sad stories some weeping with the witnesses kahlan recognized a few of the people testifying she remembered mistress sanderholt offering them work in the past she had told kahlan that when they had come in they scoffed at the things they were asked to do mistress sanderholt ended up having to do many of the tasks herself wizard ranson rose to his feet after the last witness had told his tearful story and turned to each side addressing the people gathered the mother confessor has a vast treasury and she intended to use it to finance a war against the people of the midlands who would wish to be free of her rule she first takes the food from your mouths and the mouths of your children and then to keep you from thinking about the gnawing hunger in your gut invents an enemy and starts a war with your hardearned money which she has stolen for her already wealthy friends while you people go hungry she eats well while you need clothes she would buy weapons while your sons would bleed to death in battle she lounges in the lap of luxury when your family members are unjustly accused of crimes she uses her magic to make them confess to crimes they did not commit to silence their protests against her tyranny people were weeping a few cried out with anguish at the last part still more angrily demanded justice kahlan began to doubt that she would be beheaded this mob would probably tear her apart before she ever made it to the block ranson held his arms open to the people gathered as a representative of the imperial order i direct that the people get what they really need the treasury of aydindril will be put to its best use it will be turned back to the oppressed i direct that every family shall be entitled to one gold piece a month to clothe and feed your children there will be no starvation allowed under the rule of the imperial order cheering erupted in the great hall the wild applauding and huzzahs went on unabated for a good five minutes ranson sat and steepled his fingers while he listened to the celebration he never took his eyes from kahlan nor she from his kahlan knew that lifes hardships were not that simple to eradicate she knew that seeming kindness could in truth be cruel she calculated that the payments would take at most six months to empty the treasury she wondered what would happen the following month when the money was gone and people would have by then stopped working or planting to provide for themselves then there certainly would be hunger and starvation in the guise of generosity at last the noise died out ranson leaned forward there is no way of telling how many people have gone hungry or starved to death or died in war by your command mother confessor it is obvious you are guilty of treason against the people of the midlands i see no reason to draw the evidence out as we could for weeks the other councilors all voiced yeas of agreement ranson slapped his hand to the desk guilty of the first charge then treason the people cheered again kahlan stood with her back stiff wearing her confessors face ranson read off charges she could scarcely believe could be read with a straight face witnesses came forward and testified to atrocities that kahlan thought anyone with common sense would laugh at no one laughed people she had never met before confided their intimate knowledge of what confessors did in secret a lump rose in kahlans throat as she heard what people thought of her people repeated irrational fears and rumors of every sort of outrage committed by confessors and the mother confessor in particular for her whole life she had sacrificed everything as had the other confessors to protect these people and the whole time they believed these monstrosities instead kahlan thought when she heard a witness testify that in order to retain their magical power confessors had to dine regularly on human flesh that there would be laughter at the charge instead wideeyed people leaned forward and gasped she had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from bursting into tears not because she was being charged with such things but because people truly believed them of her kahlan finally stopped listening as ranson listed charges brough forth witnesses and the council found her guilty of charge after charge she thought about richard she tried to remember all the moments she had spent with him all the times he had smiled all the times he had touched her she tried to remember every kiss you think it amusing ranson railed kahlan looked up she realized she was smiling what a woman was standing to the side weeping into a kerchief kahlan blinked at her and then looked up to ranson im sorry i guess i missed her performance the crowd grumbled in anger ranson leaned back in his chair with a disgusted shake of his head guilty of practicing your confessors magic on children what are you insane children ranson held a hand out toward the woman who broke into wild wailing she has just testified that her child is missing and has told how other women nave had their children disappear too and how it is common knowledge that the children are taken so that confessors may practice their magic on them as a wizard i can verify the truth of this the crowd howled with rage kahlan blinked up at him i have a headache why dont you just chop it off for me uncomfortable mother confessor uncomfortable that the people would be given the chance to face their oppressor and hear the extent of her heinous crimes kahlan held her confessors face to keep from tears i am sorry only that i have given my whole life to the people of the midlands had i known they would be so ungrateful and believe instead such filth after what i have sacrificed for them i would have been more selfish and left them to true tyranny ranson scowled down at her you have worked your whole life for the keeper the crowd gasped again that is who you serve that is what you work for you offer the souls of your people to your master the keeper in the underworld people in the balconies wailed with terror cries of anger and calls for vengeance echoed in the dome shaking their fists the crowd on the main floor tried to push forward but the guards spread their arms and held them back ranson lifted his hands calling for calm and quiet kahlan moved her gaze over the people to each side i give you to the imperial order she called out in a loud voice i work no longer to save you you will be punished for your unthinking willingness to believe these lies punished by what your own selfish desires will bring upon you you will come to regret the torment you have willingly cast yourselves into i am joyful that i will be dead so i will not be tempted to help you i regret only that i have ever shed a tear for your suffering to the keeper with all of you kahlan glared up at a smirking wizard ranson get on with it chop off my head im sickened with this travesty of truth you and your imperial order win kill me so i may be rid of this life and go to the spirit world where i will not have to suffer to help anyone i confess to everything execute me i am guilty of it all she looked down at the body at her feet except killing this keltish pig i wish now that i had killed him but unfortunately i cant claim credit ranson lifted an eyebrow a liar to the end mother confessor you cannot even admit the truth of this murder lady ordith came in her nose in the air and testified that she had heard kahlan threaten prince fyren only the night before the council all spoke up that they too had heard her threaten to cut his throat this is your proof kahlan asked ranson gestured to the side bring in the witness you see mother confessor we know the truth one of your former friends wanted to help hide the truth of your ways and we had to use extreme measures to make her cooperate but in the end she did a shaking mistress sanderholt was led into the chamber guards stood to each side of her stooped thin frame her face was drawn her red eyes heavy with dark bags underneath her familiar vitality was gone swaying slightly she looked as if she could hardly stand without aid mistress sanderholt held her mangled hands out in fear they would touch anything all her fingernails had been pulled off with tongs bile rose in kahlans throat a sternfaced neville ranson looked down at the woman tell us what you know of this murder mistress sanderfiolt gazed unblinking up at him she bit her lower lip her eyes filled with tears it was obvious she didnt want to speak ranson slammed his fist on the desk speak or we will find you guilty of aiding the murderer mistress sanderholt kahlan said softly the womans eyes came to her mistress sanderholt i know the truth and you know the truth that is all that matters these people are going to do as they plan with or without your help i do not want you to suffer on my account please tell them what they wish to hear tears rolled down her face but kahlan straightened her back mistress sanderholt as mother confessor i command you to testify against me mistress sanderholt gave her a twitch of a smile she turned her face up to the council i saw the mother confessor sneak up behind prince fyren she cut his throat before he knew she was there she offered him no chance to defend himself ranson smiled down and nodded thank you mistress sanderholt and you were her friend but you came forward and agreed to testify because you wanted the council and the people to know the truth more tears streamed down yes though i loved her i had to tell the people the truth of her murderous ways after she was escorted out and the council had unanimously found kahlan culpable ranson stood lifting his hand for silence before addressing the people the mother confessor has been found guilty of all charges everyone hooted and hollered their satisfaction they shouted for an immediate execution the mother confessor will be executed but not this day he held his hand up angrily against the protests they quieted she has committed crimes against all the people they must be given a chance to hear of justice being done they must be given a chance to come to the beheading it will be held in a few days when everyone harmed by this criminal has had a chance to come to see her executed neville ranson stepped down and came around the dais he stood in front of her looking into her eyes he spoke quietly to her and not to the crowd you would think to use your power on me mother confessor that had been exactly what she had been thinking to use her power knowing she would die in the process but she said nothing ransons smile was cold and cruel you shall not have the chance i am going to strip you of three things first your power and its symbol second your dignity third your life kahlan threw herself at him he stood his hands clasped and watched as she was able to move only inches before she was mired in a thickness of air that held her tight she fought unsuccessfully against the staggering power that held her the wizard lifted his hands kahlan saw a flash she cried out as she felt a cold shock flood through her body it felt as if she had plunged naked into an icy river she shivered violently the sting of cold brought tears to her eyes the cold pain felt as if it could grow no worse could hurt no more but then it did it felt as if her insides ripped as if her heart were being torn from her chest she screamed in pain stunned by the shock of it she realized she was on her knees ranson was holding his hands out over her head when the pain lifted she felt tingling panic her power was gone where she had always felt it before without even being aware of it most of the time she now felt a forlorn emptiness she had so often wished to be rid of it but never realized what it would feel like to be without her magic she cried out again tears streamed down her cheeks at the forsaken vacant desolation she felt naked before the mob of people she forced herself to stop the tears she would not let these people see the mother confessor cry no she would not let these people see kahlan amnell cry ranson drew prince fyrens sword from its scabbard he stepped behind her he took up her hair in his fist and pulled it out tight as she knelt on the cold floor with the sword he sliced her hair off close right at the nape of her neck the shearing felt almost as shocking to her as having her power taken the hair richard loved so she bit back tears neville ranson held up the severed handful of her hair to wild cheering kahlan knelt numbly staring at nothing as soldiers tied her wrists behind her back ranson grasped her arm under her shoulder and hauled her to her feet the first of it then mother confessor you have been stripped of your power and its symbol as i promised you now to the rest of it kahlan was silent there was nothing to say as ranson and a cluster of grinning guards led her down through the palace she didnt pay any attention to where she was being taken she was thinking about richard hoping he would remember her love for him she lost herself in memories of him she let the world around her go she would soon let the world of life go too the good spirits had deserted her she was numb to what was happening the emptiness of being without her power left her feeling half dead already she had never known how much it meant to her how much a part of her the magic was until it was gone she wondered if this dull bleakness was the way people without the power felt all the time she couldnt imagine living without the magic she longed for death now to end this dead feeling only richard had accepted her with her power she never completely accepted it herself but richard had now it was too late she grieved more for the loss of her magic than her life she knew now what the other creatures of magic would feel when it happened to them she grieved for them ransons hand on her arm jerked her to a halt jerked her to awareness before an iron door in a dim corridor one of the guards worked at a rusty lock on the iron door kahlan recognized the door she had taken confessions down here and now to my second promise mother confessor ranson said with a sneer you will be stripped of your dignity kahlan gasped as his fist grabbed what was left of her hair and jerked her head back as she was held helpless her wrists bound painfully behind her back and her hair in his fist ranson kissed her neck right where darken rahl had kissed her neck the same horrors coursed through her mind as when darken rahl had done it she shuddered with revulsion with the horror of the visions in her mind she saw the young women in ebinissia only this time she was one of them i would rape you myself ranson whispered in her ear but i find your sense of honor disgusting the door squeaked open and without any further word ranson shoved her through the doorway into the pit chapter kahlan gasped at the feeling of falling through space but before she had a chance to fully consider what would happen when she hit the floor rough hands caught her they pushed her down to the cold stone she saw the light of the doorway above disappear when the door clanged closed in the light of a sputtering torch in a bracket she saw grinning men all about pushing in at her the rope cut into her wrists her feelings of terror and helplessness gave way to desperate action kahlan kicked a man in the groin she was on her back on the floor so she had leverage to do damage she rammed her heel into the face of another man leaning over her he fell back with a cry she kicked frantically at the others the grasping hands caught her ankles she kicked her legs but the men held tight she rolled to the side breaking the grip and skittered into a corner her freedom was only momentary they seized her flailing legs again in the back of her mind as she fought kahlan desperately tried to think a spark of thought tried to get her attention it was something about zedd but she couldnt think clearly the men fighting to get at her pushed her white dress up her legs hands pawed at her thighs big meaty fingers hooked her smallclothes stripping them down her legs and off her feet she felt rough hands and cold air on her flesh she fought the men and at the same time her own panic two men were on the floor one holding his crotch the other sprawled out blood gushing from his ruined face his nose was crushed there were ten others all trying to get at her at once they threw each other back trying to force themselves on top of her the biggest working his way in kahlan couldnt get her breath with frantic effort the spark of thought sprang forth she remembered asking zedd if he could remove her power she had wanted to be free of it so she could be with richard zedd had told her that it wasnt possible to rid a confessor of her power that she was born with the magic and it couldnt be separated from her as long as she was alive how could ranson have stripped her of her power zedd was a wizard of the first order there was no wizard with more power than a wizard of the first order why wouldnt ranson have wanted to rape her first he said she disgusted him but he said he wanted to strip her of her dignity why wouldnt he want to do it unless he was afraid afraid she would figure it out figure what out it came to her the wizards first rule people would believe anything if they wanted to believe or if they were afraid it was true she was afraid it was true that he had stripped her of her power maybe he had used magic to give her pain and mask her ability to sense her own magic to try to trick her into believing what she feared as the men groped at her she groped for her power she tried to find the calmness the place of her magic but it just wasnt there all she felt was emptiness where she always felt the swell of magic before she now felt only a numb hollow void she wanted to cry at the feel of the mens hands on her legs and between them but she couldnt allow herself to lose control her only chance try as she might she couldnt find the magic couldnt call it forth it was simply gone she desperately wanted her hands free wait she screamed the men all stopped for a moment their faces pulling back looking at her she gasped to catch her breath talk she ordered of herself while you have the chance youre doing it all wrong they laughed we think well figure it out one said kahlan struggled to control her fear and think they were going to do what they were going to do and she couldnt stop them fighting them in this way was going to accomplish nothing except to feed her panic she had only one chance and that was to use her head she had to slow them down and give herself time to think if you do it this way you will just be denying yourselves the full satisfaction of it they frowned what do you mean if youre all fighting each other and me you wont be able to really enjoy me as a woman wouldnt it be more enjoyable if i cooperated they all looked at one another one to the side spoke up she has a point the queen wasnt nearly so much good after she went numb on us queen kahlan asked what queen you men are just bragging on me youve had no queen queen cyrilla a different man said she fainted on us then went feebleminded just lay there the whole time like a dead fish but we had her anyway had a queen still kahlan fought back the scream fought to keep the meaning of what she had just learned from making her start kicking again that would only get her the same as cyrilla her only chance was to use her head she needed time to search for her magic and if she somehow did find it she needed the men separated otherwise nine men would overpower that one she had to have things organized first in case the magic worked and she needed the strongest to be the one for an instant she abandoned her idea fearing it wouldnt save her and worse fearing she wouldnt have the nerve to do it but then she bleakly realized that even if it didnt work it didnt matter they were going to rape her one way or the other her only chance was to try she had nothing to lose thats what i mean wouldnt you rather have my cooperation im going to be down here for days youll each have more than your share of time on me wouldnt you rather i helped that way you could all have what you want she thought she might vomit keep talking the biggest man said in a gruff voice kahlan stiffened her resolve ive never had a man before they all hooted at their luck she waited until their leers came back to her she fought back the urge to shriek at the looks in those eyes like i said ive never had a man i know you men are going to have me and i cant stop you if its going to be done anyway id rather enjoy it their hungry smiles widened yea well what do you think youd enjoy most little lady if you did it one at a time wouldnt that be better for you too if you werent fighting each other if you waited your turn then you could concentrate on enjoying everything a real woman has to offer a couple of the men grabbed at her legs pulling them apart they growled that they would have what they wanted their own way the biggest the one with the gruff voice hauled them back throwing one against the wall his head banged with a loud thunk let her talk she makes sense he turned his vicious eyes on her lets hear your offer kahlan tried to slow her voice down and sound like she might be intrigued by the idea she tried to sound selfconfident as she shrugged if you do it my way ill give you whatever you want ill make sure you enjoy whatever you like some of the men chuckled the big mans eyes showed his suspicion why and how do we know you mean it because ill be able to enjoy it too that way kahlan swallowed back her fear untie my hands and ill show you i mean it she leaned forward as he untied her hands another man taking the opportunity to fondle her breasts she remained still at last her hands were untied she rubbed her aching wrists and then smiled at the big man as she ran her fingers down his cheek he slapped her hand away youre running out of time you better show us you mean what you say kahlan steeled herself as she leaned back against the wall she pulled her dress up above her waist drew her knees up and spread her legs she looked to the big man touch me three of the other men reached for her she slapped their hands away i said one at a time she looked the big man in the eyes when they came up he towered over the other men whats your name tyler one at a time you first tyler touch me the stone walls echoed with the sound of heavy breathing the big man reached out and stroked her it took all her strength to keep her knees apart she forced herself to breathe she prayed he couldnt see her shaking a grin spread on his hulking face as his husky hand groped her she coyly pushed his hand away and put her knees together see isnt that better than some delicate woman who faints at the first touch and lies on the floor like a dead fish the other men agreed that it surely was tyler gave her a suspicious look you look like one of them confessors kahlan sputtered a laugh confessor she pulled out a short strand of hair the feel of how short it was almost made her cry out in anguish does this look like im a confessor no but that dress well kahlan said she wasnt wearing it so i borrowed it last i heard they dont behead people for stealing a dress what did you do to get yourself thrown in with us she held her chin up i didnt do anything im innocent the men laughed they said that they too were innocent tyler wasnt laughing with them he had a dangerous look in his eyes she knew she had to do something and quick with her heart thumping so hard she thought it might come right out of her chest she took tylers hand in both of hers and put it back up between her legs pressing her thighs to it tylers leering grin swept the caution from his face so what is it you want us to do he asked ill make myself available here and the rest of you all go over there while im with each man in turn that way ill feel safe enough to enjoy it and at ease enough to make sure you do too she looked back to the big man and licked her lips as she smiled and i have one other condition i want you first ive always wanted a really big man she shivered at the look in his eyes she told herself that she was the mother confessor she had to keep her head she licked her lips again as she wiggled herself against his hand tyler burst into laughter the others all chuckled nervously with him you lofty ladies all act better than everyone else but when it comes to it youre just a whore like all the rest his smile vanished in a way that made her heart skip a beat i wrung the neck of the last whore what acted like she was better than me and decided to change her mind that wizard told us what hed do if we were to kill you but that dont mean we wont make you regret it if you go back on your word kahlan could only manage a smile and a nod lets get to it a sweep of his arm scattered the others to the opposite side of the pit while she was desperately seeking the feel of her magic he told them they could decide among themselves who went next and then he turned to her he started unbuckling his pants kahlan wildly searched her mind for a stall she needed time to figure out how to find her power how about a kiss first i dont need no kiss he growled open your legs like before i liked that well its just that a kiss from a big handsome man gets a woman randy to please him he paused a moment then put his right arm around her shoulders and slammed her to the floor beside him you better get randy real quick before i lose my patience i promise just kiss me a bit first tyler pressed his lips to hers she gasped when his other hand suddenly went up between her legs but this time with forceful insistence instead of a gentle touch like before he thought the gasp was cooperation and pressed his lips harder to hers she wrapped her arms around his neck the smell of him almost made her sick kahlan tried to concentrate on finding the calm as she always had before when she used her power she could not find the place she desperately sought the swell of magic but found nothing failure brought tears of frustration tylers breathing was becoming emphatic he was pressing so hard that it was hurting her lips against her teeth she pretended to savor it it was almost impossible to concentrate with the terror of what his hand was doing between her legs but she dared not stop him panic rose in her throat as she forced herself to hold her legs open for him her heels pressed harder to the floor and her feet trembled in her boots kahlan reprimanded herself she was the mother confessor she had used her power countless times she tried again but nothing happened her memory of the young women in ebinissia was keeping her from being able to focus and then she thought of richard she almost wailed with longing for him if she was ever to have a chance of seeing richard again she had to use her magic she had to be strong she had to do it for him nothing happened she realized she was whimpering in frustration against tylers mouth he took it for passion his face pulled back a few inches spread your legs more so they can all see how much a fancy lady wants tyler she submissively drew her heels closer to herself and spread her knees wider the men all hooted their approval she could feel her ears burning she remembered what ranson had said about taking her dignity tyler pressed his lips back to hers tears seeped from the corners of her eyes it wasnt working she couldnt find her power if it was even there she had no choice she was going to have to follow through with what she had offered the men failure to do so now would only bring her a beating on top of it there was no escape she thought about the poor women in ebinissia that was what was going to happen to her it was hopeless in her mind she gave up she surrendered to what was going to happen something her father had told her sprang to the front of her mind if you ever give up kahlan you are lost fight with every breath with the last if you must but dont give up not ever dont hand them victory fight with what you have to the last breath she wasnt doing that she was giving up tyler sat up enough kissing youre ready she had run out of time she wondered if richard would hate her for this no he would know she had no choice he would be disappointed only if she felt shame for being a victim he had suffered unimaginable pain before denna had done what she wanted he knew what it meant to be helpless she did not blame him for what was forced on him he would not blame her he would comfort her if it didnt work with this man she told herself then maybe it would work with the next she would keep trying with each she would not give up she would keep trying to find her power with each keep your legs open tyler growled as he undid his trousers she realized she had unconsciously put her knees together she obediently spread them again as a tear rolled down the side of her face dear spirits she prayed help me no the good spirits had never helped her before they had never come to her aid before despite her efforts on their behalf despite her pleas they would not come now to the keeper with the worthless good spirits dont cry girl she told herself fight them with your last breath if need be please she said just one more kiss you had enough kissing time to do as you said time for me now kahlan pulled her heels up against herself spread her legs as wide as she could and wiggled her bottom as he leered please your kisses are the best ive ever had just one more please she watched his chest heave then ill please you like no woman ever has just one more kiss he flopped down on her between her legs his weight drove the wind from her lungs one more and then you deliver he crushed his whiskered face to hers he was out of control his lips were cutting hers against her teeth she tried to ignore the burning heat of him pressing painfully against her kahlan slapped her hands to the sides of his muscular neck her lungs burned for air this was her last chance her last breath fight with it she told herself fight for richard as she had done countless times she released her restraint although she felt no power pushing against it it was like leaping into a dark bottomless pit there was thunder but no sound the violent jolt to the air brought down a shower of stone dust the men all cried out with the pain of being so close when her power was released kahlan almost screamed with joy she could feel the magic in her middle again it was weak from having just been used but she could feel it again it was back it had never left ranson had used magic to make her believe a lie tylers jaw had gone slack as he pulled back looking down into her eyes mistress he whispered command me the other men were scrambling toward them protect me heads cracked against the walls sending splashes of blood across the stone tyler snapped a mans arm wails of pain echoed around the room there was a furious battle for a few minutes until kahlan was able to direct tyler in accomplishing what she wanted a truce she didnt want him to fight all the men if they succeeded in getting the better of him then she was finished she wanted them separated the men keeping their distance and tyler guarding her that was her best chance of surviving until she could recover her power she screamed orders to the men as well as tyler six were left standing in fighting form and enragedt one was writhing on the ground screaming in pain a shattered bone jutting from his forearm and the other four including the one she had kicked in the face were not moving kahlan told the men that she would keep tyler at bay as long as they stayed in their corner reluctantly they moved to the opposite side dragging the others with them the screams kept them convinced that they should bide their time before taking on the big man with the wild eyes she made them throw her her smallclothes under threat of sending tyler to get them kahlan sat in the corner her back against the wall tyler stood before her in a half crouch dancing on the balls of his feet his arms out and ready the men watched as they rested against the other wall kahlan knew that this uneasy truce could not go on for days sooner or later tyler would run out of energy then they would have him then they would have her the men knew that too chapter the night wore on with the men watching and tyler guarding her she caught a few moments of uneasy sleep from time to time kahlan had no idea what time it was but she judged it to be between the middle of the night and close to dawn though she was afraid and knew that they were going to come to behead her sooner or later she felt joy that her power was back and that she had beaten them with that much of it the good spirits hadnt helped her she had helped herself she felt selfsatisfaction at what she had done she had not given up and the good spirits had left her to it as they always did kahlan was furious with the good spirits though she had lived her whole life to see their ideals upheld they never once helped her well no more she was finished with the good spirits as she was finished with trying to help the ungrateful people of the midlands what had it gotten her she had learned in the council chambers what it had gotten her it had gotten her the undying hatred of her people the very people she fought for thought she harmed children people didnt like confessors and were afraid of them for a variety of reasons but she had been stunned to learn what people really believed about her from now on she was going to worry about herself her friends and richard and to the keeper with the rest of them he could have them all she was through with it all she was the mother confessor no longer she was kahlan the torch sputtered out plunging the pit into blackness thank you again good spirits she screamed at the top of her lungs her words echoed around the pit to the keeper with you the men set upon tyler in the dark kahlan didnt know what was happening she could hear grunts and screams and thuds she heard an echoing banging sound she couldnt understand what it was and then she heard a muffled voice calling out her title the familiar voice was coming from above chandalen chandalen im down here open the door mother confessor came the voice from beyond the door how do i open the door kahlan let out a shriek when a hand snatched her ankle and pulled her from her feet chandalen called out at the sound of her scream tyler grabbed the fingers around her ankle and bent them back until they snapped the man screamed in the dark chandalen you need a key use the key key what is this key chandalen she shoved a head away from her middle chandalen remember when we were in the city with the dead people remember the queens room that was locked remember i showed you a key to open the door chandalen one of the guards up there has a ring on his belt it has the key hurry kahlan recognized tylers grunt as he was slammed to the wall she could hear the bonejarring blows of his fist she could hear a metallic noise from above mother confessor it will not turn then its the wrong one try another someone crashed into her knocking her to the floor she clawed at his eyes he punched at her middle a sudden shaft of light descended into the pit tyler saw the man on her and threw him off a ladder dropped down tyler keep them away from the ladder kahlan threw herself onto the ladder and scrambled up the men piled on tyler she heard him groan and then his neck snap her foot slipped through a rung when a fist punched the back of her calf hands grabbed at her ankles kahlan kicked the face of the man right behind and then clambered up he tumbled back taking the others with him they charged back up in a rush kahlan stretched for the hand extended down chandalen clamped onto her wrist and yanked her through the doorway he stabbed the man right behind her as the man toppled back chandalen slammed the door closed panting she fell into his arms come mother confessor we must get out of this place there were dead guards everywhere all killed silently from behind by chandalens troga he held her hand as they ran through the dank dark halls and up stairs she wondered how chandalen had managed to find his way down here someone must have shown him the way around a corner they came to the sight of a bloody battle bodies were sprawled everywhere only one man was standing orsk his great battleaxe dripped with gore orsk nearly leapt out of his skin with joy when he saw her she was almost thrilled to see his scarred face i made him wait chandalen explained as he pulled her through the bloody mess i told him that i would bring you if he waited and guarded this hall chandalen frowned at her kahlan realized he was staring at her hair or what was left of it he said nothing though and she was glad for that it felt more than strange not to feel the weight of her hair it was heartbreaking she had loved her hair so had richard kahlan bent and took a war axe from one of the dead guards with her power not yet recovered she felt better with a weapon in her hands chandalen dragging kahlan along by her hand with orsk protecting the rear burst through a door directly outside the captain of the guards had a woman pressed up against the wall her arms were wrapped around his neck as she kissed him his hands were up her dress as they charged past and the startled captain looked up chandalen drove his long knife into the mans ribs come he said to the woman we have her the woman fell into line with the rest of them as they wound their way up through the palace puzzled kahlan looked back the woman in the hooded cloak was the woman who had fainted jebra bevinvier whats going on kahlan asked jebra forgive me mother confessor for fainting i had a vision of you being beheaded it was so horrifying that i fainted i knew i must help so that the vision would not come true you told me that you had a friend in the woods i went and found him they all flattened up against a wall and waited for a patrol to pass through an adjoining room when their echoing footsteps faded chandalen turned with a hot look to jebra what were you doing with that man she blinked in surprise he was the captain of the guards he was making the rounds with a whole detachment i convinced him to send the guards away for a while i did the only thing i could think of to keep fifty men from trapping you down there chandalen grumbled that maybe it made sense as they headed on kahlan told jebra that she had done a brave thing and that she understood what courage it took to do it jebra protested that she was no heroine and didnt want to be one at an intersection with a vaulted corridor mistress sanderholt was waiting letting out a cry kahlan threw her arms around the woman mistress sanderholt held her bandaged hands out not now mother confessor you must escape this way is clear as the others rushed in the direction mistress sanderholt indicated kahlan went the other way they all turned and ran after what are you doing chandalen yelled we must escape i have to get something from my room what could be more important than escaping grandfathers knife she said as she ran when they realized they were not going to be able to change her mind they all followed after as she led them up through the labyrinth of smaller and less frequently patrolled halls several times they did encounter guards orsk fiercely hacked them to pieces when they charged after her as she came around a corner at the top of a stairway a surprised guard spun to her with all her strength kahlan buried her axe in the center of his chest his sword skittered across the floor as he went down on his back as he thrashed on the floor kahlan put a foot against his heaving stomach and tried to pull the axe out bubbles of air and blood frothed forth but the axe was stuck tight in his breastbone so she scooped up his keltish sword instead chandalen lifted an eyebrow before they reached her room she had cause to use the sword and with similar deadly effect the others waited in the outer room recovering their wind while she rushed into her bedroom she froze when she saw her blue wedding dress she swept it up and held it to her breast that was what she had come for she didnt want to leave it she was never returning to this place kahlan shed a tear on the dress rolled it into a tight bundle and stuffed it in her pack all the other clothes from her pack were cleaned too and laid out for her she stuffed them in the pack after strapping the bone knife around her left arm she threw the mantle around her shoulders hurriedly she strung the bow she swept through the outer room her pack and quiver on her back and her bow on her shoulder she had everything she wanted everything that meant anything to her she paused a moment looking at her room for the last time as she idly turned the round bone on her necklace and then led the others out and down a back way headed for an outside door she lost count of how many men chandalen took out with his troga or knife when a big guard charged out of a side hall and tried to roll them down kahlan ran him through with the sword the four of them were grim death moving through the palace the alarm bells rang frantically in the tower on the landing leading to the great staircase orsk lopped off a guards head the body rolled down the stairs spilling a trail of blood as if unrolling a red carpet for them the headless man flopped to a stop against the statue of magda searus the first mother confessor they ran down the stone steps the sound echoing in the vast chamber near the bottom a sudden stab of pain took kahlans feet out from under her she tumbled down the last few steps the others shouted and rushed to her wanting to know how she was hurt she told them that she had just stumbled she hadnt stumbled kahlan pulled her bow off her shoulder and pointed with it down that hall all of you head down that hall turn right at the end ill catch up with you go were not leaving you chandalen insisted i said go kahlan stood against the blistering pain in her legs orsk get them moving now ill catch up i will be displeased with you if you fail to get them out of here orsk raised his axe and growled the other two backed toward the hall as they pleaded with her they protested that they had risked their lives to rescue her and they would not leave her now orsk get them out of here why chandalen and jebra yelled together kahlan pointed with her bow across the great chamber up in one of the distant arcades stood a shadowed figure because otherwise hell kill you we must escape he will kill you too if he lives he will hunt us down with magic and kill us all a bolt of yellow lightning arced across the broad room stone crashed down nearly covering the opening where the others stood kahlan drew one of chandalens flatbladed mankiller arrows from her quiver mother confessor chandalen screamed you cannot make that shot i could not make that shot you must run she didnt tell them that the wizard was sending slashing shards of pain through her and she couldnt run it was all she could do just to stand orsk get them out now ill catch up another bolt of lightning sent stone flying everywhere and the three of them running down the hall orsk pushing them along kahlan put a knee to the floor to steady herself as she nocked the arrow she drew the string to her cheek the blade of the arrow was horizontal in her line of sight she could hardly see ranson he was so far away and the pain was blurring her vision but she could hear him laugh as he sent violent splinters of magic ripping through her it sounded like darken rahls laugh she bit the inside of her cheek against the pain against the scream trying to fight its way out she couldnt hold back the clipped whimpers an archer mother confessor he called from the distance his laughter echoed off the stone around her your freedom was brief mother confessor i hope it was worth it to you you will spend a good long time in the pit thinking about it he was too far away she had never made a shot from this far richard had she had seen him do it please richard help me show me how like you did that day help me stone vines tore from the panel next to her and whipped around her middle squeezing the shearing pain made her shriek she brought up the bow again with her last breath if need be she told herself her arms shook she could hardly see the wizard he was too far away the vines held her tight she couldnt run even if she wanted to help me richard another brutal wave of pain seared up her legs and through her insides burning tears ran down her cheeks as she shuddered and gasped she couldnt hold the bow up lightning arced around the great staircase the sound was deafening stone chips whistled past clouds of dust rose as a column collapsed with a crash she heard richards words in her mind you have to be able to shoot no matter what is happening just you and the target thats all there is nothing else matters you have to be able to block everything else out you cant think about how afraid you are or what will happen if you miss you have to be able to make the shot under pressure she remembered how he had whispered to her whispered for her to call the target with a jolt the target came to her as if the wizard were standing right in front of her she could see the flashes of liquid light jumping from his fingertips she could see her target the bump in his throat bobbing up and down as he laughed she let her breath flow out as richard had taught her the arrow found the notch in the air as gentle as a babys breath the arrow left the bow she saw the feathers clear the bow she saw the string hit her wrist the stone vine wrapped around her throat she kept her eyes on the target she watched the feathers of the arrow as it flew the pain tearing her insides rose with his laughter the wizards laughter cut off abruptly kahlan heard the thunk of the blade hitting his throat when the stone vine suddenly dropped away she fell forward on her hands and knees tears dripping from her face as she waited for the pain to melt away it went with merciful swiftness kahlan staggered to her feet to the keeper with you too wizard neville ranson there was an earsplitting crack like a lightning strike but instead of a flash of light a ripple of total darkness swept across the room bumps rippled up her arms the lamps flickered back on kahlan knew the keeper had indeed taken wizard neville ranson she heard a grunt and turned just in time to see a guard leaping down the steps toward her kahlan ducked and came up under him as he landed she used his momentum to loft him over the railing into the well below he snatched at her as he went over but his fingers caught only her necklace it tore from her and went down with him kahlan bent over the railing seeing him smack the stone floor three flights down she saw the necklace tumble from his hand when he hit and slide across the floor curse the good spirits she growled kahlan started for the stairs to retrieve her bone necklace but skidded to a stop and looked up at the sound of boots on stone more guards were coming she hesitated for a moment looking down and then ran for the hallway instead the spirits hadnt helped her what good was a necklace going to do it wasnt worth her life kahlan caught the others as they made the outside doors they all sighed with relief to see her and to hear that the wizard wouldnt be coming after them kahlan led as they ran out into the night the four of them raced down the expanse of steps to the relentless sound of the alarm bells behind she headed south the shortest distance to the woods a breathless jebra caught her arm dragging her to a stop mother confessor i am not the mother confessor any longer i am kahlan kahlan then but you must listen to me you cannot run away kahlan turned back to the path through the courtyard im through with this place zedd needs you kahlan spun back zedd you know zedd where is he jebra gulped air zedd sent me to aydindril the day after you left dhara he said he had to go get a woman named adie and then he would come to the wizards keep he sent me here to help you and richard and have you wait zedd needs you kahlan gripped jebras shoulders i need zedd i need him very badly then you must let me help you you must not leave they will expect you to run and will search the countryside they will not expect you to remain in aydindril remain stay in aydindril she thought a moment she was known in aydindril no not exactly her long hair was known people other than councilors ambassadors staff and nobility rarely saw the mother confessor up close and when they did they mostly stared at her long hair she no longer had that hair the thought of her loss made her insides knot up she hadnt known how much her power and her long hair meant to her until they were gone it might work jebra but where would we hide zedd gave me gold no one knows of my involvement in your escape i will rent rooms and hide you all of you kahlan considered it a moment then smiled we could be your servants a lady like you would have servants jebra shrank back mother confessor i could not do that i am nothing but a servant myself zedd made me pretend to be a lady but i could not pretend that you are a true lady being a servant does not make you less than me we all can be only who we are no more no less kahlan started them all off again toward a part of aydindril with quiet secluded and exclusive inns and it is startling to learn what you can do when you have to we will do what we must but if you keep calling me mother confessor you are going to get us all killed i will do my best kahlan all i know is that we must wait until zedd returns to aydindril she tugged insistently on kahlans sleeve mother confessor where is richard it is vital her voice lowered with unease no slight intended and i pray none is taken but it is richard that is important zedd needs richard that is why i need zedd kahlan said chapter richard grabbed an arm of each boy slow down he said in a low voice i told you i have to go first kipp and hersh sighed impatiently richard checked around the corner peeking down the hall and then pushed the two boys up against the wall frogs kicked in their pockets this is serious i picked you two because i know youre the best now you do as i told you the way we planned it stay here with your backs to this wall and count to fifty you dont so much as peep around the corner until you get to fifty im depending on you to do it right they grinned were your men kipp said well get them out of there richard squatted and put a finger close to each face in turn this is serious business this isnt just some game this time you could get in real trouble are you sure you want to do this kipp put his hands in his pockets feeling the frogs you came to the right men we can do it we want to do it richard they were excited because they had never made it past the guards before this was uncharted territory for their specialty richard knew they didnt appreciate the danger involved and he hated to have to use them in this manner but it was the only thing he could think of all right then start counting richard rounded the corner and swept down the hall his mriswith cape billowing open when he reached the proper door he stood against the white marble wall opposite the double doors and drew the hood up he pulled the cape closed and concentrated on the marble behind him he stood motionless the boys burst around the corner yelling and screaming at the top of their lungs as they ran down the hall they stopped in front of the double doors looking both ways they didnt see him standing behind them and he knew they were wondering where he was hiding as they had been instructed they threw the doors open and giggling with excitement began pulling frogs from their pockets and pitching them into the room the two sisters were frozen in surprise for only an instant richard watched as both came flying around their desks one snatching up a rod the boys heaved their last frogs with a squeal and raced away in opposite directions shouting taunts of cant catch us cant catch us sisters ulicia and finella slid to a stop on the polished marble floor outside the doors they almost slid right into him and were only inches away richard held his breath the sisters saw the boys make the turns at opposite ends of the hall they threw their hands out pictures crashed to the floor as flashes of shimmering light knocked them from the walls at the end but they missed the boys growling in anger the sisters parted one dashing after each boy richard waited until they had turned the corner and then he stepped away from the wall letting his concentration relax letting the cape return to black he wondered what it would look like if someone were to see it happen to see a person seem to materialize out of the air the outer room was empty before the door between the desks the air seemed to sparkle and hum experimentally richard put his hand into it the air felt thick but it seemed to have no harmful effect he pressed himself through the sparkles and went through the door beyond the room inside not quite as large as his own outer room was dimly lit and paneled in rich dark wood in the center sat a heavy walnut table piled with papers and books and three candles down the length to each side were floortoceiling bookshelves crammed full of disheveled books and a few other odd objects an old woman one of the cleaning staff in a heavy dark gray work dress was standing on a stool dusting a top bookshelf she turned with surprise as he came to a halt she glanced to the door and then back to him how did you im sorry maam i didnt mean to startle you i just came to see the prelate is she about the woman squatted her foot searching for the floor richard gave her his hand she smiled her appreciation as she brushed a wisp of graying hair back from her face most of it was drawn into a loose knot at the back of her head once she was standing on the floor the top of her head only came up to the lower tip of his breastbone her body was on the wide side as if she had once been taller and a giant had put his hand on the top of her head and squashed her down a good foot she looked up giving him a curious frown did sisters ulicia and finella let you come in no richard said as he looked about the comfortably cluttered room they stepped out but they would have left a shield maam i must speak to the prelate across the room richard saw doors to a courtyard standing open is she about do you have an appointment she asked in a quiet gentle voice no he admitted ive been trying to get one for days those two wouldnt cooperate so i made my own appointment she put a finger to her lower lip i see but you must have an appointment those are the rules im sorry richard started for the open doors he was getting impatient but kept his voice calm as he didnt want to frighten the old maidservant look maam i must see the prelate or we are all going to have an appointment with the keeper himself her eyebrows lifted in wonder reeeeally she clicked her tongue the keeper is it my my my richard stopped suddenly he winced and let out a groan he turned on his heel youre the prelate arent you an impish grin came to her face her eyes twinkling with it yes richard i guess i am you know who i am she chuckled oh yes i know richard sighed so youre the one who runs this place she laughed louder as i hear it told you seem to be running it now been here hardly a month and you have half the palace wound around your will ive been thinking about asking for an appointment to see you richard gave her a friendly scowl i would have granted it ive been looking forward to meeting you she patted his arm from now on you may come to see me whenever you wish then why wouldnt you let me in before she folded her hands together beneath her ample rounded breasts a test my boy a test she smiled up at him i am impressed i expected it to take you another six or eight months yet the door burst open richard was jerked from his feet yanked back by his collar and smacked up against the wall he was stuck tight the wind knocked from his lungs two irate sisters stood just inside the doorway with their fists on their hips now now the prelate said stop that you two let the boy down richard thumped to the ground glaring at the two sisters i am the one who talked those two boys into doing as they did what they did is my fault if there is any revenge it had better be against me and not them if you harm them you will answer to me one of the sisters took a step toward him their punishment has already been ordered this time for once they will learn a lesson she angrily pointed a stout rod at him you are going to have your own punishment to worry about yes sister ulicia the prelate said i think punishment is in order the sister gave richard a selfsatisfied smile yours the prelate said sister ulicia gaped prelate annalina did i not give you specific instructions that richard was not to be allowed in here the two sisters straightened yes prelate annalina and here he is standing in my office sister ulicia pointed at the door but we left a shield he could not oh could not the sisters hand dropped at seeing the prelates wrinkled brow seems i see him standing here do i not sisters yes prelate annalina the two said as one and so now your idea is to reward your own failure by going back to your posts as if nothing had happened and punish their success the prelate clicked her tongue you two will take the punishment you have ordered for the two boys the sisters blanched but prelate the second whispered you cant have that done to a sister really sister finella what did you order for the boys to have their bottoms strapped publicly tomorrow morning after breakfast that sounds fair you two will take their place but prelate sister ulicia whispered in astonishment we are sisters of the light that would be humiliating learning humility never harmed anyone we are all humble before the creator for your failure you will be strapped in their place sister ulicia stiffened and if we fail to submit prelate annalina the prelate smiled then you would be telling me that you no longer deserve to be trusted and further that you no longer wish to be sisters of the light they both bowed when the door closed behind them richard lifted an eyebrow to the prelate i hope never to get on your wrong side prelate annalina she chuckled please call me ann that is what my old acquaintances call me id be honored to call you ann prelate but im not an old acquaintance you think not she smiled my what a knowledgeable boy well no matter call me ann anyway do you know why i punished them because you took responsibility for your actions they did not recognize the importance of that you are learning to be a wizard what do you mean you knew it was dangerous to cross those two did you not richard nodded yet you used those boys knowing that it was a possibility they could be hurt yes but i had to do it its that important and it was the only thing i could think of the burden of a wizard thats what it is called using people a wise wizard understands that he cannot do everything himself and that if the matter is important enough he must use other people to accomplish what must be done even if it is to cost those other people their lives its a rare ability and vital to being a good wizard perhaps to being a prelate too ann its urgent i must speak with you urgent is it well then why dont we go for a walk in my garden and we can talk about this urgent business she placed her arm in his and walked him through the open doorway outside in the moonlight was a grand expansive courtyard with trees paths flower beds wild areas and a lovely pond the beauty of the garden didnt register in richards mind he had hardly been able to eat or sleep since he had had his talk with warren if the keeper escaped he would have everyone including kahlan richard had to do something ann there is great trouble in the world i need your help i need this collar off so i may go help thats what i am here for richard to help what is the trouble the keeper the nameless one she corrected what difference does it make calling him by his name calls his attention ann its just a word its the meaning of the word that matters not an arrangement of letters do you think that when you call the keeper the nameless one instead that he would be fooled into thinking you werent speaking of him its a mistake to assume your enemies are ignorant and you are clever a hearty laugh rose from in her chest i have been waiting for a very long time for someone to figure that out she paused with him at the edge of the pond and he asked what is the pebble in the pond she gazed out over the water you are one richard you mean there are more than one a small stone floated through the air up into her hand everyone has an effect on others some people inspire others to do great things some take people into crime with them those with the gift affect those around them even more the stronger the han the stronger the effect what does that have to do with me what does that have to do with a pebble in a pond you see all the duck weed floating on the surface say thats the other people the world of life and this pebble is you she tossed the stone into the pond see what happens the ripples caused by you affect everyone else without you all those ripples would not have happened so they float up and down on the ripples but the stone sank she gave him a humorless grin dont ever forget that the answer gave him pause i think you invest too much faith in me you dont know anything about me perhaps more than you think child and what is it that concerns you about the keeper something must be done hes about to escape one of the boxes of orden has been opened the gateway is open the stone of tears is in this world i need to do something ahh she smiled as she drifted to a stop so you who was just thrown up against a wall by the han of a mere sister wants to go off and battle the keeper himself but things have happened something must be done i see you have been talking to warren a very bright young man warren he is still young though sometimes he needs direction guidance she tipped a branch closer he studies hard and loves those books i think he must know every smudge on them she was inspecting a flower on the branch as he watched her in the moonlight he decided he might have thought himself more clever than he was warren too so what about the keeper what about the stone of tears she put her arm back through his and walked him on if the gateway is open and the stone of tears is in this world richard why does the keeper not have us hmm maybe hes about to swallow us all at any moment ahh so you think that maybe he is busy with his dinner and when he is finished and wipes his chin clean he will get around to swallowing the world of the living so you want to rush off and close the gateway before he picks his napkin from his lap is this the way you think the worlds beyond ours work in the same terms as this world richard nervously raked his fingers through his hair i dont know i dont know how it all works but warren said warren does not know everything he is but a student he has a talent for the prophecies but he has much to learn do you know why we keep the prophecies down in the vaults and restrict who may read them for the very reason we are having this discussion because prophecy is dangerous to the untrained mind and sometimes even to the trained mind there is more to things than you see or the keeper would have us already are you saying were not in danger she smiled a sly smile we are always in danger richard as long as there is a world of the living there will be danger all life is mortal she patted his arm again you are an important person a person in prophecy but if you go off foolishly you can cause more harm than good the stone of tears being in this world cannot in itself allow the keeper to escape through the gateway the stone is a means to that end i hope youre right he said as they walked on she glanced up how is your mother doing richard looked off into the darkness she died when i was young in a fire im sorry richard and your father which one he muttered your stepfather george richard cleared his throat he was killed by darken rahl he darted her a sidelong glance how do you know my stepfather she gave him one of those timeless looks that he had seen from others before from adie shota sister verna du chaillu and kahlan im sorry richard i didnt know he had died george cypher was quite a man he came to a stop his flesh atingle you he whispered you are how my father got that book he left the statement vague enough that she would have to fill in the details to confirm it a little of her smile came back afraid to say it out loud the book of counted shadows that is the book you are speaking of she gestured to a stone bench sit down richard before you fall down richard slumped to the bench he looked up as she stood before him you you gave that book to my father actually i helped him get it you see richard as i told you you and i are old acquaintances of course the last time i saw you you were bawling your head off only a few months old you were she smiled distantly if your mother could see you now she was bursting with pride over you she said your were the blessing to balance the curse you see richard balance is what the world of the living is all about you are a child of balance i have much invested in you richards tongue seemed stuck to the top of his mouth why because you are a pebble in the pond her eyes seemed to go out of focus over three thousand years ago wizards had subtractive magic none since has been born with it we have been hoping but none until now has come into this life a few have had the calling but not the gift of it you have the gift for both additive and subtractive magic richard shot to his feet what are you mad sit down richard the quiet power of her voice her penetrating gaze her presence made him sink to the bench for some reason she seemed suddenly very big to him she was the same size as before but it felt as if she towered over him her voice became imposing too now you listen to me you are causing me a great deal of trouble you are like a bull that keeps knocking down fences and trampling the crops too much is at stake to have you acting without knowing what you are doing i know you think you are doing right but so does the bull your problem is lack of knowledge i intend to give you an education though you will not believe some of what i have to tell you you had better come to accept it or you will be in that collar a good long time because it cannot come off until you accept the truth i was told the sisters took the collar off the look in her eyes made him wish he had kept his mouth closed or that he could trade places with the two sisters who were to take a public strapping only when you accept yourself accept your ability your true power will it come off you put the radahan around your own neck we dont have the power to take it off until you can help us with your own power the only way you can do that is to learn and to accept who you are now first of all you must understand about the keeper and the creator and the nature of this world your problem the problem most people have the problem warren has is that you try to understand the worlds beyond in terms of this world good and evil the creator and the keeper are chaos divided into two opposing forces although each abhors the other they are interdependent and cannot exist one without the other they define each other the struggle our struggle in this world is maintaining the balance although richard kept his mouth shut he couldnt keep the frown from his face from the creator springs life the soul of life it blooms into this world without the keeper without death there can be no life without death life would be openended can you even imagine a world in which no one ever died where every child born lives forever where every plant that sprouts flourishes where every tree lives forever and every seedling sprouts and grows to a tree what would happen how could we eat if we could kill no animal or harvest no crop if it all lived forever and could not die a neverending life of gnawing ravenous hunger the world of the living would be consumed by chaos and destroy itself forever death the underworld as some call it is eternal you think of it in terms of this life in eternity time has no meaning no dimension to the keeper a second or a year has no meaning it is through those in this world who serve him that the keeper is given the dimension of time it is their urgency that drives his struggle because they understand time he needs the living if he is to succeed his promises to those who help him are seductive and they hunger for his triumph so what part do the living play in this we divide and define the chaos with order and keep it separated light and dark love and hate good and evil we are the balance we are like the duck weed floating on the surface of the pond the air above is the creator the depths below the keeper the souls of the living which have come down from the creator blossom to life in this place and when they die they descend to the world of the dead but that does not mean it is evil evil is a judgment we put on it the keeper is like the muck at the bottom of the pond spirits of the dead reside anywhere from the depths of that chaos and hate near the keeper to near the living near the light of the creator it is the hope of the living to spend eternity in the warmth of that light it is we the living who separate and define the worlds to each side of life magic is the element that gives this world the power to do that magic is the balance point the keeper would like to swallow the world of the living to triumph to do that he must eliminate magic but at the same time in order to triumph he must use magic to tip the balance richard struggled to keep his head above the murky waters of confusion and wizards have the power to influence this balance she was still leaning over him she held up a finger yes you have both sides of the magic her smile evaporated in a way that took his breath with it that makes you an extremely dangerous person richard you have both sides of the gift you have the power to mend or destroy the veil there are good people who if they knew of your power would kill you in a twinkling for fear you might destroy us all if not deliberately by accident and you are you one of those if i were i would not have helped your father get the book of counted shadows your involvement stopped the immediate threat but it also fed the gateway magic and chances greater danger in the future it was a risk i had to take because the consequences of not doing so would have been disaster but if what has happened is not fixed it will be greater disaster in the end what is the veil where is it she reached out and tapped his forehead the veil is within those of us with magic we are its custodians that is why balance means so much to those with the gift when the veil is torn the balance is tipped the further it tips the more the veil tears the creator rules his domain the keeper his the keeper needs the creator to feed him life the creator needs the keeper to allow it to be renewed the veil keeps the balance her face was grim this view would be considered blasphemy by many they see the keeper only as evil that must be destroyed but to do so would ultimately accomplish the opposite all life being swept away like a sandbar in a river flood just for the sake of argument what if i did have both kinds of magic what is my power for most wizards have a talent that leans in a particular direction some are healers some make things of magic more rare are prophets the most rare are war wizards there has not been one born in over three thousand years until you richard wiped his sweaty palms on his pant legs i dont like the sound of that war wizard has two meanings which balance each other as in all things magic the first meaning is that they can tear the veil bring destruction and death war and the second is that they have the magic needed to fight against the powers of the keeper being a war wizard does not mean you are evil richard many who fight do so to protect those who are defenseless it means you have the capacity to care enough to fight to defend the innocent lest he whos born true can fight for lifes bond and that one is marked hes the pebble in the pond richard quoted she lifted an eyebrow for one who professes to scoff at prophecy you seem to know some of the more pivotal passages if im not entirely addled i expect you have been marked richard could feel the scar on his chest as he nodded are you saying that my life is already marked out that im just meant to live it out as it has been preordained no richard life is not predetermined the prophecies mean only that you have potential you have the ability to influence events thats why it is so important for you to learn of most importance is that you learn to accept yourself if you do not do this you will harm the most vital part of yourself your free will if you act without understanding you could cast yourself into the chaos i let you live when you were born because you have the potential for doing good within you is the hope of life but until you truly accept both sides of your magic you are a danger to every living thing richard desperately wanted to change the subject he felt as if the world were crushing him what is the stone of tears she gave a little shrug in the world of the dead it exists as a force in this world it exists as an object with power representing that force the stone of tears is like a weight that holds the keeper at the infinite end of his world where his influence here is diminished to the point of balance then if its here off him he is freed from his prison if that were true we would all be dead hmm she lifted a questioning eyebrow but richard didnt say anything its one of the seals that locks the keeper beyond there are others that still hold magic helps hold him back for now the stone of tears has the power though to destroy the balance to tear the veil and free the keeper if it is used in this world by such as you in the wrong way you see the stone has the power to banish any soul to the infinite depths of the underworld but if it were used in that way through hate through selfishness it would feed power to that side and destroy the veil the veil can only be restored by one with the gift for both sides of the magic the stone must be put back where it belongs we must struggle to keep the other seals intact until the day when one such as you can restore this lock while there is still time meanwhile the keeper gains strength here his minions struggle to break the other seals there are other ways to free the keeper ann are you sure about me maybe you proved it just tonight by walking through that shield our shields are made of additive magic the only way for you to penetrate it was for your han to use subtractive maybe my han my additive magic is just stronger when you came through the valley of the lost you would have been drawn to the towers to both towers am i right i could have just come across them by accident she let out a tired sigh the towers were created by wizards who had both kinds of power in the white tower there is white sand sorcerers sand i doubt you would have taken any that doesnt prove anything and what is sorcerers sand sorcerers sand is extremely valuable nearly priceless it is only gathered by chance happenings across the tower sorcerers sand is the crystallized bones of the wizards who gave their life into the towers its a sort of distilled magic it gives power to spells drawn with it good and evil the proper spell drawn in white sorcerers sand can invoke the keeper you took instead some of the black sand did you not well yes i just wanted a little bit thats all she nodded just a little bit richard no wizard since the towers were built has been able to gather any black sorcerers sand it cannot be taken from a tower by any but those with subtractive magic guard that black sand with your life its more valuable than you can imagine why what will it do black sorcerers sand is the counter to the white they nullify each other the black even one grain of it will contaminate a spell drawn to invoke the keeper it will destroy the spell a spoonful of it is a weapon worth kingdoms still he said it could just be that the last wizards born with both kinds of magic invested the palace of the prophets with their magic the prophets of that time knew one would be born again with both sides of the magic a war wizard and so they created too the hagen woods and the mriswith one born with the subtractive would be drawn to that place drawn to do battle there the collar keeps the additive gift from killing you the hagen woods provide an outlet for the other side of your power it is something the sisters cannot provide but i used the sword of truth his voice sounded to him like a plea into a gale it was the sword the sword of truth was also created by wizards with the gift for both sides of the magic only one born the same could bring out the full range of its magic only you can use the sword to its full potential and you have not done so yet it is an aid to you but even so you do not need it to kill the mriswith your gift is enough if you do not believe me leave your sword and go into the hagen woods with just your knife you will still kill the mriswith others have used this blade they didnt even have the gift much less subtractive magic they were not truly using the swords magic the blade was made for you its an aid much as prophecy is an aid much as the mriswith are an aid sent down through time i dont think i could be one of these war wizards do you eat meat what does that have do do with anything you are a child of balance wizards must balance themselves the things they do their power war wizards rarely eat meat their abstinence is a balance for the killing they sometimes must do im sorry ann but i just cant believe i have subtractive magic thats why you are such a danger every time you encounter magic your han learns more about how to protect you to serve you but you are not aware that it is learning the radahan helps it grow though youre not aware of the process you do things without knowing the importance or the reason like when you were drawn to the black sorcerers sand and took it or when you took the round skrin bone from adie richards brow pulled together you know adie too yes she helped your father and me get through the pass so we could retrieve the book of counted shadows what round bone are you talking about richard saw the slightest twitch of alarm in her eyes adie had a round bone carved all over with beasts its an object of great power your subtractive magic would have drawn you to it richard remembered seeing the round bone on a high shelf i saw such a thing at her house but i didnt take it i wouldnt take something that didnt belong to me maybe that means i dont really have subtractive magic she straightened no you noticed it the fact that you didnt take it means only that since you did not have the radahan on yet your power had not developed enough to draw you to the skrin bone the way it drew you to the black sand richard hesitated is this some kind of problem she smiled it looked forced to him no adie would protect that bone with her life she knows how important it is you can recover it in the future what does it do it helps protect the veil when used by a war wizard like you with both powers it invokes the skrin the skrin are a force that helps keep the worlds separated you might say they are guardians of the boundary between worlds what if the wrong person got their hands on it a person wishing to help the keeper she pulled on his shirt urging him up you worry too much richard i have work to do you must leave me to it now do your best child and study learn to touch your han to get control of it you must learn if you are to be of any help to the creator richard turned back to her she was staring off ann why does the keeper want the world of the living what will it gain him what is the purpose her answer came in a soft distant voice death is the antithesis of life the keeper exists to consume the living his hatred of life has no bounds his hatred is as eternal as his prison of death chapter richard was in a world of his own as he headed for the stone bridge he had been cloistered in his room for days thinking when the sisters came to give him his lessons he put in only a halfhearted effort he now feared he just might touch his han warren was busy day and night in the vaults checking what richard had told him and looking for more information there had to be at least some truth to what the prelate had told him why else would the keeper not yet have used the gateway if he could he needed to go for a walk he felt as if his head were about to burst he just wanted to be away from the palace for a while pasha suddenly appeared at his side ive been looking for you he stared ahead as he walked why i just wanted to be with you well im going for a walk in the country she shrugged i wouldnt mind a walk may i come along richard looked over she was in her wispy maroon dress the one with the vshaped neckline the day was chilly at least she had on a usefullooking violet cloak she was wearing big gold loop earrings her belt matched her necklace with the same kind of gold medallions she looked alluring in the outfit but they werent exactly hikinginthecountry clothes are you wearing those useless slippers she held a foot out to show him her tooled leather boots i had them made special just so i could go for walks with you made special he grumbled to himself richard remembered how hurt she had been that time he had told her that the blue dress didnt become her he didnt want to hurt her feelings by sending her away she was only trying to please him maybe he thought the company of a smiling face would do him good well all right then i guess you can come along as long as you dont think im going to entertain you in conversation she grinned and took his arm id be happy just to walk with you at least having pasha on his arm kept most of the women away from him as they passed through the city the ones who did boldly approach earned a glare from pasha the ones who braved the glare earned something else a touch of her han they yelped from the invisible pinch and made themselves scarce richard understood now why the palace was breeding wizards they were trying to get one with additive and subtractive magic and now they had one they walked silently up into hills bathed in the golden light of the lateafternoon sun richard felt better out in the open rocky hills overlooking the city though it was an illusion he felt free he suddenly wished pasha werent along he hadnt come out to see gratch in days gratch was probably frantic he was at a loss as to what he was going to do next he didnt know if everything the prelate had said was true and he didnt know which he feared more that it was a lie or the truth pashas hand on his arm tightened in a way that brought him out of his brooding thoughts and made him draw to a halt she glanced about nervously he could tell by the way she was breathing through her mouth that she was frightened whats wrong he whispered her gaze searched the surrounding rocks richard there is something out here please lets go back richard drew the sword its unique ring filled the still afternoon air he felt nothing no sense of danger but pashas han obviously felt something that frightened her pasha let out a little shriek richard spun gratchs head poked up above a rock pasha backed away its all right he wont hurt you gratch gave a tentative grin showing his fangs as he stood to his full towering height kill it she screamed its a beast kill it pasha calm down he wont hurt you she backed farther away gratch stood looking from richard to pasha not knowing what to do richard realized she might use her power to hurt the gar so he put himself between the two richard move it must be killed its a beast it wont hurt you i know him pasha she turned and ran her violet cloak flying behind richard groaned as he watched her leap from the top of one rock to another making her way down the hill he scowled back at gratch whats wrong with you did you have to scare her what are you doing showing your face to people gratchs ears wilted his shoulders slumped and he began to whine when his wings started quivering richard went to him well its too late now to be sorry come on and give me a hug gratch cast his eyes to the ground itll be all right he put his arms around the big furry creature gratch finally responded he threw his arms and wings around richard gurgling his happiness in a moment he pulled richard off the rock and wrestled him to the ground richard tickled his ribs and wrestled until gratch was giggling in glee after they had settled down gratch put a claw tip in the pocket where richard kept the lock of kahlans hair he looked at richard from under hooded eyebrows as big as axe handles richard finally figured out what gratch meant no no thats not the same woman its a different person gratch frowned he didnt understand richard didnt feel like trying to explain that the lock of hair he was always looking at was not from pasha at gratchs urging richard instead wrestled with his woolly friend it was twilight when richard made it back to the palace he was going to have to find pasha and explain to her that gratch was his friend and not a dangerous beast before he had gone far sister verna found him instead did you feed that baby gar back in the wilds the one i told you to kill did you let that beast follow us richard stared at her it was helpless sister i couldnt kill something that was no harm to me weve become friends muttering she wiped a hand across her face as absurd as it sounds i suppose i can understand you needed companionship and you certainly didnt want it from me sister verna but why would you let pasha see it i didnt he just popped his head up i didnt know he was there pasha saw him before i knew she let out an exasperated sigh the people around here fear beasts they kill them pasha went screaming to the sisters that there was a beast in the hills ill explain it to them ill make them understand richard listen to me he backed away a step and stood silently while he waited for her to go on the palace believes that pets are a hindrance to learning to use your han they believe it diverts feelings away from them to the creature i think they are being foolish but that is beside the point what is the point you mean they will try to keep me from seeing him anymore she put an impatient hand on his arm no richard they think its a vile beast that could turn on you they think you are in danger the sisters are forming a search party as we speak they intend to hunt it down and kill it for your own good richard stared at her concerned expression for only a second and then he was running he charged over the bridge and back into the city people gaped as he flew past he leapt over carts that wouldnt move out of the way fast enough he knocked over a stand selling amulets people hollered at him but he ran on his heart thumped in his ears as he raced up the hills several times he stumbled over ditches or rocks but he rolled to his feet gasping for air and rushed on in the darkness he leapt from rock to rock as he crossed ravines at the crest of a roundtopped hill near where he had been with gratch earlier he yelled between panting his fists at his sides he tipped his head back and screamed gratchs name his voice echoed off the surrounding hills only silence answered when the echoes died out exhausted richard fell to his knees they would be coming soon the sisters would use their han to find the gar gratch wouldnt know what they intended even if he kept his distance their magic could reach out and kill him they could knock him from the air or set him afire graaaatch graaaatch a dark shape blackened a patch of stars the gar thumped to the ground and folded his wings he cocked his head and gave a purling gurgle richard grabbed gratchs fur in his fists gratch listen to me you have to go away you cant stay here any longer theyre coming to kill you you must leave gratch let out a questioning whine that rose in pitch his ears perked forward he tried to put his arms around richard richard pushed him away go you understand me i know you do go i want you to go away they will try to kill you go away and never come back gratchs ears wilted as he cocked his head to the other side richard pounded a fist to the gars chest he pointed north go away he threw his arms out and pointed again i want you to go away and never come back gratch tried to put his arms around richard again richard pushed them away again gratchs ears lay down against his head grrratch luuug raaaach aaarg richard wanted more than anything to hold his friend and tell him that he loved him too but he couldnt he had to make him go in order to save his life well i dont love you go away and never come back gratch looked to the hill pasha had run down he looked back at richard his green eyes were filling with tears he reached out for richard richard shoved him away gratch stood with his arms out richard remembered the first time he had held the furry beast he had been so little then he was so big now but as he had grown his friendship and his love had grown too he was richards only friend and only richard could save him if richard really loved him he had to do this go away i dont want you around anymore i dont want you to ever come back youre just a big dumb bag of fur go away if you really love me then youll do as i ask and go away richard wanted to keep yelling but the lump in his throat caught the words he backed away gratch seemed to wither in the cool night air his arms came out again with a pitiful forlorn wail he called with a plaintive keening cry richard took another step back gratch took a step toward him richard picked up a rock and heaved it at the gar it bounced off his huge chest go away richard cried he threw another rock i dont want you around anymore go away i dont ever want to see you again tears ran from the glowing green eyes over the wrinkles of his cheeks grrratch luuug raaaach aaarg if you really love me then you will do this go the gar looked again to the hill pasha had run down turned and spread his wings with a last look over his shoulder he bounded into the air and flew off into the night when he could no longer see the dark shape against the stars or hear the sweep of wings richard crumpled to the ground his only friend was gone i love you too gratch he cried in racking sobs dear spirits why have you done this to me he was all i had i hate you every last one of you he was halfway back when it hit him he froze in his tracks his mouth hanging open in the stillness of the night his shaking fingers reached to his pocket the lights of the city flickered in the near distance rooftops shimmered in the moonlight distant sounds of the city drifted out to him at the edge of the hills he pulled out the lock of kahlans hair if you really love me she had said you will do this that was what he had told gratch in a flash of understanding it all came to him the jolt of comprehension took his breath kahlan had not been sending him away she had been saving his life she had done for him what he had just done for gratch the pain of having doubted her took him to his knees it must have broken her heart how could he have doubted her the collar he had been so afraid of the collar he had been blinded to it she loved him she didnt want to be set free she wanted only to save his life she loved him he threw his arms open and turned his face up to the sky she loves me he knelt staring at the lock of hair she had given him to remind him of her love in his whole life he had never felt a sense of relief this great the world came back to life for him richards mind swirled in a confusion of conflicting emotions he felt heartsick that he had sent gratch away that gratch thought richard didnt want him around anymore but at the same time he felt overwhelming joy that kahlan loved him in the end joy won out he decided that someday gratch might come to understand as he had that it had been necessary someday he would have the collar off and he would find gratch and make it up to him and even if he didnt the gar was better off living as a gar should hunting and searching out its own kind it would come to have its own happiness as had richard although he wanted more than anything to throw his arms around kahlan hug her tight and tell her how much he loved her he couldnt he was still a prisoner of the sisters but he would study and learn and get the collar off he would get the collar off and return to kahlan he knew without a doubt that she would be waiting for him she had said she would always love him when he met the search party of sisters at the edge of tanimura he told them that they neednt bother that they would find the beast gone they didnt believe him and went on into the hills richard didnt care gratch was gone his friend was safe richard bought a gold necklace from a street hawker he didnt know if it was real gold but he didnt care it looked pretty he trotted the rest of the way to the palace pasha was pacing up and down in the hall outside his room richard richard i was so worried i know that right now youre furious with me but in time you will see that he grinned im not angry pasha in fact i brought you a present to thank you she smiled in coy surprise as he offered her the necklace for me why because of you i figured out that she loves me and always has i was just being a blind fool you helped me see that she regarded him with a frosty look but you are here now richard you will forget her in time youll see that im the one for you he smiled happily at her pasha im sorry its nothing against you youre a beautiful young woman in time youll find the one for you you can have your pick of nearly any man everyone likes you but im not the one for you maybe if i lived to be a hundred but short of that her sly smile returned then i will wait he kissed the top of her head before going through the door he didnt think he would be able to sleep while he was this excited but all the walking and running had left him exhausted his last thoughts before he drifted off were of kahlan he pictured her in his mind as if she was there with him her special smile her deep green eyes and her radiant long hair he drifted into the best sleep he had had in months in the days following richard felt as if his feet hardly touched the ground everyone was puzzled by his good mood they frowned at him at first but were eventually caught up in his cheer some of the sisters giggled when he told them they looked as beautiful as a sunny day he urged the sisters who came to practice with him to try harder to help him reach his han he had them stay longer than usual sisters tovi and cecilia bubbled with enthusiasm merissa and nicci bestowed small smiles of pleasure armina was cautiously pleased and liliana delighted he wanted his collar off and until he could do what they wanted he knew it would stay on having not seen warren in a while he finally went down to the vaults to see how his search was coming sister becky was off retching and the other sister giggled when he winked at her warren was pleasantly surprised to see him and exhilarated about some of the things he had found he could hardly wait to tell richard when the door to one of the back rooms had grated closed he started opening volumes on the table what you told me has been a great help look here warren pointed at words richard couldnt understand just like you told me this says that the stone of tears being in this world in itself does not free the keeper so what significance does it have well its as if there are a number of locks on his prison door and this turns the key in one but it does not free him there are a number of ways for it to help him a number of objects of magic to help but the stone of tears itself must be used by one from this world one with the gift for both additive and subtractive magic to free the keeper those with only the gift for additive can cause harm tear the veil more but not free him with it i think warren said with a twinkle that were safe with that black stone in this world as long as were careful its not black i never told you it was black i just described the shape and size warren touched a finger to his lower lip not black then what color is it amber warren slapped his hands to his chest with a groan of relief thank the creator he let out an uncharacteristic whoop thats the best news ive heard all year amber means it was touched by a wizards tears that repulses the keeper its like rotten festering meat would be to us his agents wont touch it richards grin widened it had to be zedd who had done it that was why he felt zedds pull from the stone this on top of his discovery about kahlan was just too much he couldnt keep the happiness to himself warren i have other good news im in love im going to be wed warren gave another whoop but then his smile wilted its not pasha is it if it is thats all right i will understand you two will make a handsome richard lightly touched warrens shoulder no its not pasha ill tell you about her some other time shes the mother confessor i didnt mean to interrupt you what about the other things well he pulled another book across the table there are precious few references to the round bone you spoke of and the skrin one of them is in a forked prophecy having to do with the winter solstice coming up in a couple of weeks its a complicated juncture of forks and crossovers weve only recently learned that the prophecy about that woman and her people is the descendent of a true fork whenever warren went off on his talk of forks and junctures richard always started getting lost about the only thing he understood was winter solstice what does the winter solstice have to do with anything warren looked up winter solstice the shortest day of the year shortest day longest night see what i mean no what does that have to do with the skrin the longest night of the year longest night most darkness you see the keeper has certain times when he can exert greater or lesser influence in this world his is the world of darkness and when we are in the period of the longest darkness the veil is at its weakest thats when he is able to do the most harm then were in danger in a few weeks at winter solstice warrens eyebrows lifted in delight yes but youve given me the information to solve an upcoming prophecy along with what we now know to be the true fork involved along with it you see with this winter solstice there is a prophecy about the danger to the world of the living the keeper has to have a number of elements in place for it to be a true fork such as an open gateway but he needs an agent in this world warren leaned forward in delight and he in turn needs the skrin if he has the skrin bone you told me of he can invoke the guardian and destroy it if the guardian is destroyed the keeper can come through the gateway warren that sounds pretty frightening to me warren lifted his hand with a dismissive wave no no many prophecies sound ominous like this one but the elements are rarely all in place so they turn out to be false forks as most do the books are clogged with false forks because warren get to the point oh yes well you see you told me that your friend has the bone that can invoke the skrin and the keeper would need an agent but he doesnt have one without the skrin bone and with the upcoming fork which we know must be passed correctly and we think it will this is just another false fork so were safe richard felt a distant tingling of apprehension but warrens bubbly confidence overwhelmed it he was caught up in warrens enthusiasm he gave the young man a clap on the back good work warren now i can concentrate on learning to use my han warren beamed thank you richard im so glad youve been able to help me ive made more progress than i ever thought i would before i met you still grinning richard shook his head in wonder warren ive never met anyone that was so smart yet so young warren laughed as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard whats so funny your joke warren said wiping tears from his eyes what joke warrens laughter slowed to a frowning chuckle about me being young it was funny richard held his polite smile warren why is that funny warrens chuckle died down to a grin because im one hundred and fiftyseven years old richards flesh prickled now youre making a joke thats a joke it is a joke warren isnt it warrens good humor evaporated he blinked richard you do know dont you they must have told you i was sure they would have told you by now richards arm swept the books aside he scooted his chair closer told me what warren dont you say something like that and then go silent on me youre my friend you tell me warren cleared his throat and then wet his lips with his tongue he leaned in a little richard im sorry i thought you knew or i would have told you myself a long time ago i would have told me what the magic the magic of the palace of the prophets it has additive and subtractive elements to it that are tied to the other worlds that makes time move differently here warren richard said hoarsely do you mean it affects all of us all those wearing the collar no everyone at the palace the sisters too this place is spelled as long as the sisters live at the palace they age the same as we do the spell makes us age more slowly makes time seem different to us what do you mean different the spell slows our aging process for every year we age those outside age between ten and fifteen years richards head was spinning warren that cant be true it cant he tried desperately to think of proof pasha pasha could only be richard ive known pasha for over a hundred years richard slid the chair back and stood he raked his fingers through his hair that doesnt make any sense it has to be some kind of why would it work like that warren took richards arm and sat him down he pulled his own chair close he spoke in a soft concerned voice as one would when breaking calamitous news to a someone it takes a long time to train a wizard outside in the rest of the world over twenty years had gone by before i was even able to touch my han but because i live here i had aged less than two years twenty years had passed here too but i aged only two if the palace did not slow our aging we would all die of old age before we could even light a lamp with our han i have never heard of it taking less than two hundred years to train a wizard commonly it takes near to three hundred and sometimes even as much as four hundred the wizards who created this place knew that and so they tied the magic here to the worlds beyond where time is meaningless i dont know how it works just that it does richards hands shook but i have to get this collar off i have to get to kahlan i cant wait that long warren help me i cant wait that long warren glanced to the floor im sorry richard i dont know how to get our collars off and i dont know how to get by the barrier that keeps us here i know how you feel though it drove me into the vaults for the last fifty years some of the others dont seem to care and say that it just gives them more time with women richard slowly rose i cant believe it warren turned his face up richard please forgive me for telling you im sorry i was the one to hurt you youve always been richard put a hand to warrens shoulder its not your fault you didnt do it you simply told me the truth his voice felt as if it were coming from the bottom of a well thank you for the truth my friend all he could think as his feet shuffled toward the door was that his dreams were all dying if he couldnt get the collar off everything would be lost sisters ulicia and finella both stood in warning as he came through the doors they backed away the same as the guards had when they saw the look on his face a sparkling shield went up before the door he went through it without slowing the door beyond burst open for him without him touching it part of the frame splintering it somehow never occurred to him to use the knob the prelate was sitting with her hands folded on the heavy walnut table her solemn eyes watched him come richard pressed up against the table towering over her i must admit richard she said in a somber tone that i have not been looking forward to this visit his straining voice broke why didnt sister verna tell me i ordered her not to and why did you not tell me because i wanted you first to learn some significant things about yourself so you would be better able to understand your importance the burden of a wizard and of a prelate too richard sank to his knees before her desk ann he whispered please help me i must have the radahan off i love kahlan i need her i need to get back to her ive been gone a long time please ann help me take the collar off she closed her eyes for a long moment when they opened they were heavy with regret i spoke the truth richard we cannot get the radahan off until you learn enough to help us that will take time please ann help me isnt there any other way slowly her eyes staying on his she shook her head no richard over time you will come to accept it they all do it is easier for the rest because they come here as boys not understanding and grasp it only over time we have never had to tell one grown like you who could understand the significance richard couldnt make himself think clearly it felt as if he were stumbling in a dark dream but well lose so much time together she will be old everyone i know will be old ann smoothed her hair back as she averted her eyes richard by the time you are trained and leave here the greatgreatgreat grandchildren of everyone you know will have died of old age and been buried in the ground for over a hundred years he blinked at her trying to comprehend the math of the generations involved but it all turned to mush in his mind he suddenly remembered what shota had warned him of a trap in time this was that trap he had been stripped of everything by these people everything he loved was gone he would never see zedd again or chase or anyone he knew he would never hold kahlan again he would never be able to tell her that he loved her that he understood the sacrifice she had made for him chapter richard looked up from where he sat on the floor to see warren in the doorway he hadnt heard the knock when he said nothing warren rushed over and squatted down beside him listen richard something you said made me think you said that you were going to wed the mother confessor richards mind came out of the daze and his eyes suddenly came up the prophecy is about her isnt it the prophecy you said would come on winter solstice i think it might be but i dont know enough about her about confessors to tell does the mother confessor wear white yes the confessors are born to find the truth she is the last one richard i think that is good news i think she is to find happiness and bring it to her people on winter solstice richard remembered the vision he had had in the tower of perdition he remembered the horror of what he had seen the words kahlan had spoken were burned into his memory he quoted it to warren of all there were but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive when the shadows threat is lifted therefore comes the greater darkness of the dead for there to be a chance at lifes bond this one in white must be offered to her people to bring their joy and good cheer yes thats it i believe that the greater darkness means both the keeper and winter solstice i think that means richard where did you read that prophecy i didnt read it it was brought to me in a vision of her warrens eyes grew big the way they tended to do when he was astonished you had a vision of prophecy yes she brought me the words and also brought a vision of what it means what does it mean richard brushed at his pant leg i cant tell you she said that i could speak the words but not of the vision im sorry warren but i dare not violate that warning without knowing the consequences but i can tell you that the results of this prophecy coming true would not be joyful for her or for me warren considered a moment yes you are right he looked over out of the corner of his eye richard there is something about prophecy i think i should tell you hardly anyone knows this but the words dont always reflect the true intent what do you mean well a few times when i have read prophecies ive had a vision the vision turns out to be true and so does the prophecy but not in the way you would think from reading it i believe that the true way prophecy is meant to be understood is through the gift through the visions do the sisters know this no i think this is what it means to be a prophet richard if you had this vision and heard the words and saw the meaning maybe that means you are a prophet according to the prelate i have a different talent if she is right then having the vision might just be part of my ability for what i truly am which is the prelate said im a war wizard his eyes widened again richard war wizards have the gift for both magics none with the gift for subtractive too has been born in in thousands of years maybe the prelate is wrong i hope she is but it would explain some things from what a friend of mine told me additive magic is using what is adding to it multiplying it altering it the doing of things subtractive magic is the counter the undoing of things all the shields are put up by the sisters they have only additive even those with the gift cannot easily go through them or break them because they also have only additive power against power but somehow im able to walk right through the shields around here without even trying subtractive magic would explain that subtractive would counter the additive of the shields undo it but you said you tried to go through the barrier that keeps us from leaving thats a shield too why cant you go through that shield then if you really have the subtractive richard lifted an eyebrow and leaned in warren who put those shields in place well the ones who placed the rest of the magic of the palace the wizards of old who you said had subtractive magic that shield is the only one placed by them its the only one i cant go through its the only one my subtractive magic if i truly have it wouldnt counter see what i mean warren sat back on his heels yes he rubbed his chin as he thought well that would make sense it might fit with some of the prophecies about you if you really are a war wizard and are the one born true and do these prophecies say i will prevail warren hesitated he glanced over at the sword of truth lying on the floor nearby if i said white blade would that mean anything to you richard let out a heavy breath at the memory i can turn the blade of my sword white through magic warren wiped his hand over his face then i think we might be in trouble there is a prophecy that says should the forces of forfeit be loosed the world will be shadowed yet by darker lust through what has been rent salvations hope then will be as slim as the white blade of the one born true through what has been rent the open gateway richard said that would make the darker lust be the keeper warren i have to do something about the prophecy the one about the one in white its important do you have any ideas warren watched him as if trying to decide something i do i dont know if it will help he put weight on his hands as he rubbed them on his thighs they have a prophet here at the palace ive never seen him i want to but they wont let me they say its too dangerous for me to talk to him until i learn more they promised that when i learn enough they will let me talk with him here in the palace where warren pulled a fold of his robes from under his knees i dont know it would have to be one of the restricted areas but i dont know which one and i dont know how we can find out richard stood i do richard knew he had gone to the right guard when swordsman kevin andellmere turned white as a spirit at the mention of the prophet he was reluctant feigning ignorance at first but when richard gently reminded him of all the favors kevin whispered the location the compound kevin had divulged was one of the most heavily guarded richard knew where all the guards were stationed because he had gathered white roses there and had been up on the wall to look out at the sea he also knew all the guards they were frequent visitors to the prostitutes he provided he didnt slow at the outer gate but simply gave a nod to the wink the guards gave him the guards at the rampart were considerably more reticent stammering and holding out a hand to halt him he shook the hand pretending that he thought that was what was meant by it they finally sighed and resumed their post as he marched away his mriswith cape billowing open at the end of the rampart was a small colonnade and at the end of that winding stairs that led down to the prophets quarters the guards at the door he wanted were the two he had had trouble winning over at first and the first to receive his gift of female company they stiffened when they saw him richard casually made for the door between them walsh bollesdun how you doing they crossed their pikes over the door richard what are you doing down here the roses grow up top look walsh i have to go see the prophet richard dont put us in this spot you know we cant let you in the sisters would skin us alive richard shrugged i wont tell them you let me in ill say i tricked you if anyone finds out which they wont just tell them i snuck by and you didnt know until i was on my way out ill back your story richard youre really have i ever done anything to cause trouble have i ever done anything but help all you men i buy you drinks i loan you money when you need it i let you have free access to the girls and it never costs you a copper have i ever asked for anything in return richard had his hand on the hilt of the sword one way or another he was going through that door walsh pushed a stone chip with his boot with a heavy sigh first one and then the other pulled their pikes up bollesdun go make your rounds im going to the privy for a sit richard took his hand from his sword and gave the man a pat on the shoulder thanks walsh i appreciate it halfway down the inner hall richard felt layers of resistance shields like the ones that were outside the prelates door but they only slowed him a bit the room inside was as spacious as his own but perhaps more elegantly appointed one wall held large tapestries and another expansive bookshelves most of the books though seemed to be scattered about the room on chairs and couches and covering the blueandyellow carpets on the floor richard could see the back of a man in the chair beside the cold hearth you must tell me how you do that the man said in a deep powerful voice i would be most interested in learning the trick do what richard asked walk through shields as if they werent there burns the flesh right off me if i try if i ever figure it out myself ill let you know my name is richard if youre not busy i would like to speak with you busy the mans shoulders shook with his hearty laugh when he stood richard was a little surprised at how big he was his long white hair had made richard think he might be old and shriveled old he was shriveled he was not he looked strong and full of vitality his smile was welcoming and threatening at the same time he wore a radahan the same as richard my name is nathan richard ive been looking forward to meeting you i didnt expect you would find your way in alone i wanted to come alone so we could talk freely and do you know that i am a prophet i didnt come here to learn to bake bread nathans smile widened but he didnt laugh his brows pulled together like a hawks his voice took on a hiss would you like me to tell you of your death richard how you are to die richard flopped down on the couch and plunked his feet up on a table he returned the hawklike glare and threatening smile in kind sure id love to hear all about it and then when youre done i will tell you how you are to die nathan lifted an eyebrow and are you a prophet enough of one to tell you how you are to die the frown turned curious really tell me then richard took a pear from a bowl on the table polished it on his pant leg and took a bite he spoke as he chewed you are going to die right here in these rooms of old age without ever seeing the outside world again the creases in nathans face deepened as his expression sagged seems you are a prophet my boy unless you help me maybe if you help me ill be able to come back here and help you get out too and what is it you want i want this collar off a sly grin spread on nathans face seems we share a common interest richard but the sisters say i will die without it the sly grin widened they demand truthfulness from others but rarely inconvenience themselves with it the sisters have their own agenda richard there is more than one path through the woods the sisters say i must learn to use my han in order to get it off they dont seem to be helping much in that it would be easier to teach a stump to sing than for a mere sister to teach you to use your han you have subtractive magic they cant help you can you help me nathan perhaps nathan sat down in his chair leaning forward intently tell me richard have you ever read the adventures of bonnie day read it its my favorite book i read it until my eyes nearly wore the words off the pages id love to meet the person who wrote it and tell him how much i liked the book a broad childlike grin stole onto nathans face you just have my boy you just have richard came forward from the back of the couch you you wrote the adventures of bonnie day nathan quoted a few passages to prove his intimate knowledge i gave the book to your father to give to you when you were old enough to read you were just born at the time you were there with the prelate she didnt tell me that i doubt the truth occurred to her you see ann doesnt have the power to get into the wizards keep in aydindril i helped george get in so he could get the book of counted shadows they have some very interesting books of prophecy there richard stared in astonishment seems we are old acquaintances then more than acquaintances richard rahl nathan gave him a meaningful look my name is nathan rahl richards mouth dropped open you are my greatgreatsomethingorother too many greats to count i am nearly a thousand years old my boy he waggled a finger in the air i have had an interest in you for a long time you are in the prophecies i wrote the adventures of bonnie day for some of those who had potential it is a book of prophecy of sorts a primer of prophecy one you would be able to understand so it would help you it did help you didnt it more than once richard said still having trouble keeping his jaw up good im pleased then we gave the book to a few special boys you are the only one still alive the rest died in inexplicable accidents richard finished the pear while he thought he definitely didnt like the part about subtractive magic so can you help me with using my power think richard the sisters have not given you pain with the collar have they no but they will fighting the last war richard what did bonnie day tell the warwick troops guarding the moors that the enemy would not come the same way as they had before that they were foolishly wasting their energy trying to fight the last war nathan lifted an eyebrow you seem to have missed the lesson just because something happened to you before that does not mean it will happen again think ahead richard not behind richard hesitated i had a vision in one of the towers a vision that sister verna used the collar to hurt me and it brought the anger forth richard nodded i called the magic and killed her nathan gave a small disappointed shake of his head the vision was your own mind trying to tell you something trying to show you that you could defend yourself if they did that that you could defeat them it was your gift and your mind working together trying to help you you were too busy fighting the last war to heed the message chagrined richard kept his mouth shut he had worried about them hurting him to the exclusion of everything else he had ignored the true meaning of what kahlan had done because he had been so afraid of the past coming to life again think of the solution not the problem that was what zedd had taught him he had been blinded to the future by the past i see what you mean nathan he admitted what did you mean about the sisters not giving me pain with the collar ann knows you are a war wizard i told her before you were born i told her near to five hundred years ago she would have given orders to the sisters giving pain to a war wizard is like kicking a badger on his rump you mean that pain is somehow the secret to my power no the result of pain anger he gestured to the sword at richards hip you use the sword in that way anger calls forth the magic actually you call the magic it brings you anger and so the magic works would you like me to show you how to touch your han richard scooted forward yes i never thought i would say that but yes i need to be able to get out of here hold up your palm good he seemed to pull an aura of authority around himself now lose yourself in my eyes richard stared into the hooded deep dark azure eyes the gaze drew him in richard felt as if he were falling up into the clear blue sky his breath came in ragged pulls not of his own will he felt nathans commanding words more than heard them call forth the anger richard call forth the rage call forth the hate and fury richard felt it just as when he drew the sword as he felt his breath being drawn for him he felt the anger being drawn now feel the heat of that rage feel the flames of it good now focus those feelings in the palm of your hand richard funneled the rage of the magic to his hand directed its flow feeling its force his teeth gritted with the power of it look in your hand richard see it there see what you are feeling richards eyes moved slowly to his hand a ball of blue and yellow fire tumbled slowly above his outstretched palm he could feel the energy flowing from himself into the fire he increased the flow of rage and the angry ball of flame grew now cast the rage the hate the anger the fire at the hearth richard threw his hand out the slowly tumbling sphere of flame stayed with his hand he looked to the hearth focusing the rage outward casting it away from himself the liquid light howled as it streaked to the hearth exploding there with a crack like lightning nathan smiled with pride that is how its done my boy i doubt the sisters could teach you that in a hundred years youre a natural no doubt about it you are a war wizard but nathan i didnt feel my han i didnt sense anything different all i felt was angry like when i use the sword for that matter like when i shut my finger in a door nathan nodded knowingly of course not you are a war wizard others have only one side of the gift they use what is around them the air heat cold fire water whatever they need war wizards arent like others they instead tap the core of power within themselves you dont direct your han you direct your feelings the sisters teach the how of how everything is done that is irrelevant to your power for you results are all that are important because you draw power from within that is why the sisters cannot teach you what do you mean thats why they cannot teach me have you ever seen a seamstress miss a pincushion the sisters want you to watch your hand the pin and the pincushion thats the way other wizards use their magic war wizards dont watch they just do their han acts instinctively was that wizards fire nathan chuckled that was to wizards fire what an annoyed moth is to an enraged bull richard tried again but the fire wouldnt come the anger wouldnt come he could draw the swords anger but it wasnt the same kind he had done with nathan from within himself it wont work why cant i do it again because i was helping you showing you with my own power what its like you are not yet able to do it on your own why nathan reached over and tapped richards head because it must come from in here you have yet to accept yourself who you are you dont believe you still fight who you are until you accept yourself until you believe you wont be able to call forth your han your power except in great anger what of the headaches that came from my gift the sisters said they would kill me without the collar the sisters nibble around the truth as if it were gristle in a piece of meat they only eat it if theyre starving they want us prisoners so they can bring us to their ways what they attempt to do when they train with you is what i have just done the headaches are dangerous but only if a young wizard is left alone with his power when you had the headaches were you ever able to make them go away yes sometimes when i concentrated on shooting arrows or when something inside warned me of danger or when i was angry and used the magic of the sword then they went away for a time thats because you were bringing the gift into harmony with your mind the only thing required to keep the gift from harming you is a bit of instruction like i just gave you teaching wizards should be a wizards business for a wizard bringing your mind into harmony with your gift is a simple matter because its the male gift teaching the male gift what i have just done with you is enough to keep the gift from harming you for a good long time without the radahan in the future joining with a wizard will take you the next step and protect you until you reach the following plain its only important to have help available when you need it the sisters need a hundred years to show you what i have just done they use the collar as an excuse to take us prisoner for their own purposes they have their own ideas about the training of wizards their idea is to control wizards why they think wizards are responsible for all the evil that has befallen mankind and if they collar the power control it and indoctrinate it they will bring the light of their theology to the people they are zealots who believe they are the only ones who know the true way to eternal reward in the creators light they feel justified in using any means to gain that end you mean that what you have just showed me with my power is enough to keep the gift from killing me without the collar its enough to keep the gift from killing you but it would take many more lessons to teach you to be a real wizard all i have done is to hold the stallions bit so he wont buck you off it would take much more work to teach you to ride with grace richard could feel the muscles in his face draw tight if this is true then they are kicking the rump of a badger thank you for helping me richard rubbed his fingers together nathan there is great trouble coming coming very soon i need to know a few things do you know the wizards second rule of course but you must learn the first before you have the second i already know the first i killed darken rahl with the first it states that people can be made to believe any lie either because they want to believe its true or because they are afraid its true and the counter to it the secret is that there is no counter i must be always vigilant knowing that i too am vulnerable and never arrogantly believe i am immune i must always be alert that i can fall prey very good and the second rule nathans white eyebrows hooded his azure eyes the second rule involves unintended results so what is it the second rule is that the greatest harm can result from the best intentions it sounds a paradox but kindness and good intentions can be an insidious path to destruction sometimes doing what seems right is wrong and can cause harm the only counter to it is knowledge wisdom forethought and understanding the first rule even then that is not always enough good intentions or doing right can cause harm such as nathan shrugged it would seem kind to give candy to a small child because they like it so knowledge wisdom and forethought tell us that it would make the child sick if we continued this kindness at the expense of good food thats obvious anyone would know that say a person hurts their leg and you bring them food while they heal but after time they still dont wish to get up because it hurts at first so you continue to be kind and bring them food over time their legs will shrivel and it will be even more painful to get up so you are kind and continue bringing food in the end they will be bedridden unable to ever walk again because of your kindness your good intentions have brought harm i dont think that happens often enough to be a problem im trying to give you obvious examples richard so you will be better able to extrapolate to more difficult problems and understand an obscure principle good intentions being kind can encourage the lazy and motivate sound minds to become indolent the more help you give them the more help they need as long as your kindness is openended they never gain discipline dignity or selfreliance your kindness impoverishes their humanity if you give a coin to a begger because he says his family is hungry and he uses it to get drunk and then kills someone is it your fault no he did the killing but had you given him food instead or gone and given his family food the killing would not have happened it was a good intention that resulted in harm wizards second rule the greatest harm can result from the best intentions violation can cause anything from discomfort to disaster to death some leaders have preached peace saying that even selfdefense is wrong it seems the best of intentions to shun violence in the end it often leads to a slaughter where their threat of violence in the beginning would have prevented attack and resulted in no violence they put their good intentions above the realities of life they accuse warriors of being bloodthirsty when the warriors would have actually prevented bloodshed are you trying to say i should feel no shame at being a war wizard it does the sheep no good to preach the goodness of a diet of grass if the wolves are of a different mind richard felt as though he were having a conversation with zedd but kindness cant always be wrong of course not thats where wisdom comes in you must be wise enough to foresee the consequences of your actions but the problem with the second rule is that you cant always tell for sure whether you are violating it or simply doing right worse magic is dangerous when you add magic to the good intentions violation of the second rule can lead to catastrophe using magic is easy knowing when to use magic is the hard part every time you use it you can bring unexpected ruin do you know richard that its the weight of one flake of snow that is one too many and causes an avalanche without that one last flake the catastrophe would not happen when using magic you must know which is the one snowflake too many before you add its weight the avalanche will be out of all proportion to what you think the weight of that flake could invoke richard rubbed his thumb on the hilt of his sword nathan i think i may have torn the veil because i violated the wizards second rule you did what did i do you used your magic through the wizards first rule to win in so doing you fed magic to the boxes the gateway tearing the veil you did it through ignorance you didnt know that the unintended results of doing what seemed right could be the destruction of all life one snowflake indeed magic is dangerous how can i fix it the stone of tears must be put back on the keeper the lock the seal must be restored the stone of tears must be sent back to its rightful place in the underworld where it will serve to restrain the keepers power in this world to do that requires both powers the key must then be turned in the lock so to speak by closing the gateway this also requires both magics doing any of this with only one side of the magic would rip the veil so a wizard with the gift for only the additive such as myself would be of no help only one such as you can accomplish the task until it is done we are in terrible danger if you act wrongly use the stone for your own reasons you have the power to destroy the balance and tear the veil the rest of the way sending us all into eternal night richard stared at the table while he thought do you know what an agent is ah you must be talking about the trouble with the upcoming winter solstice an agent is one who trades favors with the keeper favors such as the innocent souls of children in return for knowledge of the use of subtractive magic he gave richard a dark look but that would not be a problem because you sent darken rahl to the underworld where he has no power here darken rahl is in the underworld is he not richard felt a gnawing pain in the pit of his stomach he had not only torn the veil but in violating the second rule again by trying to help with a gathering he had brought an agent darken rahl back to this world where he could act to tear the veil it was all richards fault he felt hot and dizzy he thought he might be sick at any moment nathan i have to get this collar off nathan shrugged i cant help with that richard had come here for a specific reason he decided he had to try to get the answer he cleared his throat nathan there is someone very important to me she is in danger and i must help there is a prophecy about her that is written down but it also came to me in a vision which prophecy of all there were but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive when the shadows threat is lifted in his deep powerful voice nathan finished the prophecy therefore comes the greater darkness of the dead for there to be a chance at lifes bond this one in white must be offered to her people to bring their joy and good cheer then you know of it nathan i saw the meaning of the prophecy i was told not to speak of the vision but its not a joyful outcome as far as im concerned she is beheaded nathan said in a quiet voice that is the true meaning of that prophecy richard put his arm across his churning stomach that was what he had seen in the vision his world started spinning again nathan i have to get away from here i have to stop that from happening richard look at me richard looked up managing to hold the tears back richard i must tell you the truth if this prophecy does not happen there is nothing beyond we all die it will be the end of all life the keeper will have us if you use your power to stop it you will rip the veil asunder and allow the keeper to swallow the word of the living richard shot to his feet why why would she have to die to save the living it makes no sense his fist tightened around the hilt of the sword i have to stop it its just a stupid riddle i wont let her die for a riddle richard a time will come when you have to make a choice i have been hoping for a very long time now that when that time comes you will be wise enough to make the right choice you have the power to destroy us all if you choose wrongly i will not stand here while you tell me i must let her die the good spirits have done nothing to help i must i will richard stormed from the room cracks ran along the walls beside him as he marched down the hall chunks of plaster rained down behind as he went richard only dimly noticed but it pleased his temper when he went through the shield the paint on the walls to the side charred and curled richards thoughts ran wildly in all directions at once he knew now that his vision had been of what was going to happen if he didnt stop it it was going to come true if he couldnt get away from the palace maybe that was what the prophecy meant that he would be held prisoner there and he wouldnt be able to help and kahlan would die in the courtyard below richard saw a commotion guards were running from everywhere when he got closer he saw one of the baka ban mana blade masters there had to be close to a hundred worriedlooking guards surrounding him in a ring holding their distance the man in loosefitting clothes in the center of the ring looked unconcerned richard pushed through the throng whats going on the man bowed to richard caharin i am jiaan your wife du chaillu has sent me to give you a message richard decided not to contest the wife part what is it i am to tell you that she has followed her husbands instructions we have brought the majendie to a peace with us we no longer make war with them or the people here thats wonderful news jiaan tell her i am proud of her and her people your people jiaan corrected she wants you to know she has decided to bear the child and she also sends message that we are ready to return to our homeland she wishes to know when you will come to take us there richard glanced around at the people not only guards were gathered but sisters too he recognized a few of his teachers watching sisters tovi nicci and armina pasha stood nearby at the far edge of the crowd he saw sister verna on a balcony in the distance beyond the walls he saw the squat figure of the prelate richard turned back to jiaan tell her to be ready that it will be soon jiaan bowed thank you caharin we will be ready richard spoke to the guards in a circle around them this man has come in peace he is to be left in peace jiaan strode away unconcerned as if he were alone on a walk but the ring of guards moved with him as richard knew they would until he was well clear of the city the crowd started drifting away richards head was pounding he had brought his father back from the underworld by violating the wizards second rule a second time in the spirit house he had tried to do the right thing and instead had brought harm warren had told him that the keeper needed an agent to escape and richard had provided one his mind reeled he had just found out that kahlan loved him and life seemed good again only to discover that he was to be trapped here for hundreds of years and if he couldnt escape kahlan would die on winter solstice his thoughts went around and around in a desperate tangle he had to do something time was running out he decided to find the one person who might be able to help him chapter she heard the voices in the outer office and hoped it was who she thought it would be she was not looking forward to this but she was running out of time richard would have surely found a way to see nathan by now and nathan would have done his part now it was time to do hers she couldnt completely trust nathan but in this he would have done what was required he knew the consequences of failure his had been a task she didnt envy adding the weight of that snowflake with a flick of her fingers the door swung open she had had to have the carpenters fix the doorframe richard had shattered it with his han without even being aware of what he had done and that was before he had even gone to nathan the curt speech cut off as the door opened and the three faces looked in awaiting instruction sister ulicia finella its late why dont you two run along to your offices and tend to your paperwork i will see her sister verna please come in ann stood as sister verna strode in she liked verna she abhorred what she was going to have to do to her but she was running out of time hundreds of years to prepare and now time and events were slipping through her fingers the world was at the brink verna bowed prelate annalina please verna sit down it has been so long verna pulled a chair close to the opposite side of the table she sat with her back straight and her hands folded in her lap how good of you to take your valuable time to see me ann almost smiled almost dear creator thank you for sending her to me testy though it wont make my job any less onerous it will surely make it easier i have been busy so have i verna snapped for the last twentyodd years apparently not busy enough we seem to be having difficulty with a boy you collected who you should have taken to task before he even arrived vernas face turned scarlet had you not forbidden me from doing my duty using my skills i would have done so oh are you so barren of resourcefulness verna that you could not function with minor restrictions pasha a mere novice seems to be having better success and she functions under the same restrictions you think so you think he is under control he has not killed anyone since pasha took over verna stiffened i think i know something of richard i would advise the prelate caution in her confidence ann looked down moving papers about as if devoting attention to words she was not seeing i will take your advice under consideration thank you for coming verna im not finished i havent yet begun her eyes came slowly up if you raise your voice to me again you will be verna prelate annalina please forgive my tone but there are matters of grave importance i simply must raise ann sighed feigning impatience yes yes then please do get to it i have much work to do she folded her hands on the desk and gave verna a blank look go on then richard grew up with his grandfather how nice for him verna paused in annoyance at the interruption his grandfather is a wizard a wizard of the first order his grandfather wanted to teach him well we will see to his teaching is that all vernas eyes narrowed i do not need to remind the prelate that it is a direct violation of the truce to take a boy from a wizard who would teach him i was told that there were no wizards left in the new world to teach boys i was lied to i was used we have been stealing boys you made me a part of that ann smiled indulgently sister we serve the creator so all may learn to live in his light now in view of our duty to the creator what is a truce with heathen wizards verna was struck speechless dear creator i like this woman so please give me the strength to break her nathan had added his snowflake she had to add hers i have been sent on a twentyyear chase without knowing the reason i have been deceived my two companions died one at my hand i have been forbidden use of my power to do my job do you think i forbid your use of your power capriciously is that whats bothering you verna very well then if you must know the reason it was to save your life verna stiffened in caution if i remember my lessons in the vaults there is only one reason such restriction would save my life inwardly ann smiled verna wanted it spoken aloud indeed richard has subtractive magic you knew that you had one with subtractive magic collared you would risk that you would have him brought here to the palace her hands unfolded and she leaned in a bit why ann held the others gaze because there are sisters of the dark in the palace she didnt twitch she knew at least she suspected bless you verna you are a bright one forgive me for what i must do is this room shielded verna asked in an even tone of course she left unsaid that her shield would not protect against these sisters do you have proof of such an accusation prelate i do not need proof right now because this conversation is restricted you will not speak of it unless you plan to bring charges if you do i of course will deny it and say a bitter sister was trying to accuse the prelate of blasphemy for personal gain and then we would have to hang you neither of us wants that now do we verna sat stiff and still no prelate but what does that have to do with bringing richard here when your house is overrun with rats the only thing you can do is bring in a cat this cat sees us all as rats maybe with good reason some might say that perhaps you were not bringing in a cat for your rats but bait richard is a good person i would not like to think he is being sacrificed do you know why you were selected to go after richard i had thought it was your vote of confidence ann shrugged in a way it was although im not sure that there are sisters of the dark in the palace and i have no idea who they are if its true i had to assume that if it is true then since grace and elizabeth were at the top of the list they would be sisters of the dark i knew from prophecy that only my eyes have seen that richard probably has subtractive magic and further that he would refuse the first two offers i knew the first two sisters would die if the nameless ones disciples knew any of this they would want the third name on the list to be one of theirs too i used my prerogative as prelate to pick the third sister you chose me because you had faith that i was not one of them what ann wanted to say was i have known you since you were a child verna i know your quick mind your heart and your soul you of all the sisters were the one i trusted with the fate of the world i knew richard would be safe in your hands but she could not say that i chose you verna because you were far down on the list and because all in all you are quite unremarkable the room rang with silence for a long moment verna swallowed i see ann affected dispassionate objectivity inside her heart was breaking i doubted you were one of them you are a person of little note im sure grace and elizabeth made their way to the top of the list because whoever directs the sisters of the dark considered them expendable i direct the sisters of the light i chose you for the same reason there are sisters who are valuable to our cause i could not risk one of them on such a task the boy may prove a value to us but he is not as important as other matters at the palace he may be a help it was simply an opportunity i thought to take if there had been trouble and none of you made it back well im sure you can understand that a general would not want to lose his best troops on a lowpriority mission vernas breathing looked forced her voice sounded it of course prelate annalina ann shuffled her papers impatiently i have important matters to get back to is there anything else sister no prelate when the door closed ann lowered her face into her shaking hands tears dripped onto her papers she appraised his eyes for a long moment richard didnt know if she would say yes or not but he had had to tell her much of what he had learned just to get her to agree to listen to his plea he couldnt afford to fail he needed help he had to trust someone all right richard i will help you if half of what you say is true i must help you richard sighed as he closed his eyes in relief thank you liliana ill never forget you for this youre the only one around here who will listen to reason can we do it now time is critical now she whispered harshly here richard if what you say about you having subtractive magic is true it wont be a simple matter to remove your radahan i will need to retrieve an object of magic that the sisters keep guarded its an aid used to amplify power maybe through that and with your help it will be enough to get the collar off not only that but if the nameless one is involved there is no telling what ears or han might be paying attention then when where it has to be soon she wiped her fingers over her eyes as she considered well i think i can retrieve the object before tonight so we could try tonight but where it cant be in the palace it would be too dangerous the hagen woods richard said everyone avoids the hagen woods liliana looked up richard you cant be serious its dangerous there not for me i already told you how i can tell if the mriswith are coming well be safe enough and we wont have to worry about any sisters or pasha stumbling by while were trying to get this cursed thing off my neck she let out a frustrated breath at last she laid a hand on his shoulder and giving it a squeeze smiled all right the hagen woods then with a stern look she gripped his shoulder and held him out at arms length im violating a whole stack of rules by doing this i know its important and the right thing to do but if they catch us before we can do it they will make sure i never get near enough to you to ever again try im ready now lets go no i must try to retrieve the aid first she cocked her head to the side as she frowned and i just thought of something else they keep telling you not to let the sun set on you there why richard shrugged because its dangerous and after everything youve learned you believe them you trust them richard what if they dont want you to let the sun set on you there because you might learn something useful you said the hagen woods were placed there by the wizards of old who had subtractive magic in order to help those like you what if the sisters dont want you to have that help what if they are just trying to make you afraid so you wont discover it wizards first rule were they deceiving him was he believing a lie you may be right well go before sunset no we dont want to be seen together and it will take me some time to steal the aid do you know where the long split rock sits in the stream to southwest corner of the hagen woods i know the place good you get there before the sun sets you are the one the magic is for go in the woods by the split rock tie strips of cloth to branches so i can follow where you went and find you ill meet you there in the woods when the moon is two hands in the sky and richard dont you dare tell anyone about this or you will be risking not only my life and yours but kahlans too richard nodded with a smile of thanks on my word tonight then he paced his room after she left he was anxious to get this over with and be off he was running out of time if darken rahl had the skrin bone they were already out of time but that was just foolish how would he get it he was a spirit maybe it was as warren said that the elements were rarely all in place it was kahlan he was worried about he had to help her a knock brought him out of his thoughts he thought it might be liliana come back but when he opened the door a distraught perry pushed into the room richard i need your help he pulled out a fistful of robes look at this they promoted me richard glanced down the length of the simple brown robes congratulations thats great perry its a disaster richard i need your help richard frowned why is it a disaster perry threw his arms in the air as if it should be obvious to anyone because i cant go into the city im restricted in these robes im not allowed to go over the bridge well im sorry perry but i dont see how i can help you perry took a deep breath to calm himself he looked up pleadingly theres a woman in the city ive been seeing her steady of late richard i really like her im supposed to meet her tonight if i dont show up so i can explain if i never show up again shell think i dont care about her perry i still dont see what i can do about it perry grabbed him by his shirt they took all my clothes richard you could lend me some of yours then no one would recognize me and i could sneak into the city and see her please richard lend me some of your clothes richard thought a moment he didnt care if he was violating some obscure rule of the palace it seemed insignificant compared to what he was doing but he still worried for perry the guards all know me they will see its you in my clothes and tell the sisters then youll be in for trouble perry glanced away frantically thinking night ill wait until night and then ill go they wont see so clearly who it really is at night please richard please richard sighed its fine by me perry if you want to risk it just dont get yourself caught id hate to know i helped get you in trouble he gestured to the bedroom where the wardrobe was come on take whatever you like you arent quite my size but i guess youre close enough perry added a grin to his sidelong look the red coat i can have the red coat shed like me in that sure richard led a giddy perry toward the bedroom if that is what you would like take it im glad someone will enjoy wearing the red coat perry sorted through the wardrobe looking for a pair of pants and a shirt he thought would look dashing i saw sister liliana leaving your room just before i came he pulled out a ruffled white shirt she one of your teachers yes i like her shes the nicest of the lot perry held up the shirt in front of himself how does this look on me better than on me you know liliana not really she just always gave me the shivers those strange eyes of hers richard thought about lilianas pale pale blue eyes shot through with violet flecks he shrugged i thought they were strange too at first but shes so bubbly and friendly that i dont even notice them anymore she has such a warm smile that its hard to see anything else she considered the captain standing before her desk he was asking an outrageous price but then what was the palaces gold to her before it was missed she would be gone as she had feared the boy was proving troublesome to tame it was becoming important to cultivate other options there were other ways of seeing to the keepers wishes other ways of keeping her oath i agree to your price in fact i double it just to insure your loyalty she pushed the purse across the desk captain blake licked his cracked lips as he watched it moving closer he finally reached out and took it testing its weight before tucking it in his coat very generous of you sister youre a woman who knows how to win a mans loyalty you are not going to count it captain his cold eyes werent touched by his servile smile aye sister ill be counting it when i get back to the lady sefa when do you wish to sail there were still a few matters a few loose ends to attend to soon i have paid you more than enough to have you at the ready until im ready aye sister you have at that he scratched his scruffy chin im content to sit im in no great hurry to be sailing to where you want to go she leaned forward you are sure you can make the voyage aye sister the lady sefa has made the voyage before and can again still ive no itch to be off into those waters until i have to he straightened his tattered coat how many ladies will you be bringing an apologetic smile spread easily on his weathered face ill need to see to the proper accommodations sitting back she again ground her teeth at the memory of liliana pulling off her hood at the joining rite liliana had let every other sister know her identity by doing that worse she had been warned it was more than a mistake it was arrogance liliana was proving dangerously untrustworthy with the power she was appropriating there was no telling what she would do next there was certainly no reason to take liliana as for the others why take them all the prelate had made a mistake by speaking her suspicions aloud thinking a shield of additive magic would protect her the prelate would have cause to suspect six of the sisters but if the prelate were to die there would be no reason for anyone even liliana to suspect the others why take them when they might prove useful here she was liking this plan more by the moment myself and five others will be going mind if i ask why you fine ladies want to be sailing out around the great barrier isnt the old world to your liking she leveled a menacing glare on the man standing before her i have bought your ship your crew and you for as long as i want them and for whatever purpose i want them answering questions was not part of the bargain no sister i just thought your silence was without taking her eyes from his she flicked her wrist and brought a blade to hand i have always thought death too brief a lesson i believe in long lessons if i so much as suspect you have violated your part of the bargain any part of it they will find you still breathing but without an inch of skin left anywhere on you do we understand each other captain blake stared furiously at the blue and yellow carpet beneath his feet aye sister then that will be all captain i will be seeing you spon be ready to sail the instant you see six sisters coming after he had gone she pulled a spare dacra from a drawer and resting an elbow on the desk watched it spinning in her fingers as she thought she didnt like leaving matters to chance best if all the loose ends were taken care of someone would have to eliminate richard rahl someone not going with them she smiled someone expendable chapter richard sat quietly with his legs folded and the sword across his knees he wore his mriswith cape so that pasha and sister verna wouldnt know where he was he didnt want either to know the sun had set on him in the hagen woods either would surely come after him if they knew what he was doing he had found a small clearing high enough to be dry and had waited there since the sun had gone down he could see the full moon through the tight tangle of branches and judged it about two hands high he didnt know what was supposed to happen in the hagen woods when the sun set on you there but so far it seemed as it always had when he had been there before at night he returned lilianas call and she came out from behind a fat oak she looked about at the woods it wasnt a tentative glance but a confident appraisal she sat before him crossing her legs i got it the aid i told you about richard smiled in relief thanks liliana she pulled it from her cloak in the moonlight he could see it was a small statue of a man holding something clear as glass she held it up showing it to him what is it the crystal this clear part here has the power to amplify the gift i dont have the power to get your radahan off if it is true that you have subtractive magic because i have only additive you will hold this in your lap when we join our minds this will help amplify your power so i can use it and be able to break the hold good lets begin she pulled the statue back not until i tell you the rest he looked into her pale pale blue eyes at the dark flecks spread through them so tell me the reason you cant help get the collar off is because you dont have the training to use your gift you dont know how to direct the power this will overcome that deficiency i hope youre trying to work up to warning me about something she gave a single nod you dont know how to control the flow so you be will at the mercy of the aid but the aid doesnt understand pain it simply does what it must what i need so youre telling me it might hurt im prepared to endure pain lets get started not might she held up a cautionary finger richard this is dangerous it will hurt you it will feel like your mind is being torn apart i know you want to do this but i dont want to deceive you this will make you think you are dying he felt a trickle of sweat run down his neck it must be done i will be directing my han to try to break the hold of the collar the aid will be pulling power from you to do as i need to overcome the radahan it will hurt you liliana i can take whatever is necessary it must be done you listen to me richard i know you want to do this but you listen i will be pulling the gift from you to help break the collar your mind will feel like im trying to pull the very life from you your inner mind may interpret that as me trying to suck the gift the very life from you you will have to endure the feeling of having your life ripped from you you will have to endure it until the collar breaks if you try to stop it when my power is in you trying to do as i must so what you are saying is that if its too much and i want to stop i cant if i try to stop the pull on my magic it will kill me yes you must not resist if you do you will die her expression was as serious as he had ever seen it you must trust me and not try to stop what is happening to you or you will die and then kahlan will die are you sure you can do that liliana i would do anything endure anything to save kahlan i trust you i will put my life in your hands she at last nodded and placed the statue in his lap she gazed into his eyes a long moment and then kissed her finger she touched the kissed finger to his cheek into the void then together thank you for your trust richard you will never know what this means to me nor to me liliana what do you want me to do the same as we have always done before you just try to touch your han as always and i will do the rest she wiggled forward until their knees were pressed together they held hands letting them rest over their knees each drew a deep breath and closed their eyes at first it was the same as it always was just deep relaxation as he concentrated on the image of the sword of truth the pain at first was simply an uncomfortable tingling it spiraled deeper settling at the base of his spine feeling like a pulled muscle the pain worked its way up his back abruptly it erupted everywhere at once something like the pain of the agiel a hot ache searing through the marrow of his bones denna had taught him to endure pain he said a silent thank you to denna for what she had done maybe it would be what he needed to endure this to save kahlan the twisting torture took his breath his back stiffened sweat instantly drenched his face his lungs burned for air with the greatest of effort he drew a breath shattering pain exploded through his mind plunging him into a timeless place of ripping unending agony he struggled to hold the sword in his mind tears ran down his face he had to do this it felt as if every nerve in his body were exposed and being held to a flame he thought his eyes might burst he thought his heart might burst he flinched with each agonizing tug of pain it was torture beyond endurance and then it seemed as if what he had felt had not yet been the beginning of it he was unable to scream to breathe to move it seemed his very soul was being ripped from him as liliana had warned him it seemed as if his very life was being pulled from him he felt a wash of panic that this was killing him he felt dark death soaking into the void left by what was being ripped from him he dimly worried that this wasnt right terror burgeoned deep within him and then that too was pulled into the swirling torrent erupting outward he wanted nothing more than to scream as if it would somehow ameliorate the agony but he could not his muscles seemed to be losing their life along with the rest of him he could not breathe or even hold his head up please liliana please hurry please he struggled not to resist what she was doing he prayed that he would not fight her he had to get to kahlan she needed him his eyes were open he realized when he recognized the statue in his lap his head was hanging the crystal was beginning to glow a dull orange a dim part of him thought that that must mean it was working doing its job his head felt as if it were coming apart he expected to see blood dripping down but he saw only the orange glow increasing please liliana hurry blackness was enveloping him even the insufferable pain was beginning to seem distant he felt life slipping from his grasp he felt an emptiness coming upon him that was more ghastly that anything he thought possible in the fading recesses of his mind he felt a presence mriswith he felt them near his level of alarm rose they were around him closing in and then he heard as if from a great distance lilianas voice wait my pets you may have what is left when i am finished with him wait he could dimly see the mriswith in his mind as he always had when they came to him when liliana spoke they moved back why would she say that why would the mriswith move back at her command what did she mean maybe the pain had driven him insane and it was only a mad illusion he felt a presence at his back not a mriswith worse more gruesome by ten he felt its fetid breath on his neck lilianas voice came in a dangerous hiss i said wait the presence receded a bit but not as far as the mriswith what did she mean they could have what was left he was dying that was what she meant he could feel it he was dying no liliana said he would think that it was simply happening as she had said that was all he had to be strong for kahlan but he had so little left to give he was dying he knew he was the statue in his lap was glowing brighter the hot breath returned to his neck he heard a low growl from the loathsome thing he vehemently wanted it away from him lilianas menacing voice came again wait i will be finished in a moment and then you may have his body wait in that instant something deep within him told him that if he was ever going to save himself this was the last chance it had to be now the decision to act was sudden desperation from deep within from the core of his mind from the core of his being from the core of his soul he wrenched his will to action and by force of will with frantic colossal effort he yanked his power his life himself back a thundering boom sounded and an impact sundered the air throwing the two of them apart richard landed on his back at one edge of the clearing liliana at the other the sword of truth was in the center the mriswith and the other creature melted back into the darkness among the trees richard gasped for air he sat up and shook his head the statue lay on the ground in the center near his sword the orange glow was gone liliana floated upward without effort it looked as if an invisible hand had lifted her gently to her feet the sight raised hackles on the back of his neck she smiled wickedly richard hadnt thought liliana to be capable of such a vile grin it made his toes curl in his boots oh richard i was so close ive never experienced anything like it you have no idea of the glory of what you have but i will have it yet richard glanced to the sides trying to decide which way to run he felt like a fool and at the same time was overcome by a sense of profound loss liliana i trusted you i thought you cared for me she lifted an eyebrow did you the slow smile returned maybe i did maybe thats why i was doing it the easy way now we do it the hard way richard blinked what do you mean the hard way the quillion would have been the easy way i have taken on the gift from many a male but you resisted where they could not now i must skin you alive to have your gift first i will have to disable you you will lie helpless as i do it she held out a hand a sword floated out from behind the big oak out of the darkness and into her hand with a shriek she swept across the clearing toward him her sword flashed in the moonlight without thinking richard lifted his hand calling his sword and its magic the response was instant the anger inundated him he felt the hilt slam into his palm as liliana swung her sword the sword the magic the spirits were with him he brought the blade up blocking her strike dimly richard wondered why his sword didnt shatter hers but then he was moving the dance with death had begun he countered her strikes and she his he evaded attacks that should have had him and she thwarted attacks that should have had her she spun like the wind slipping away at the last instant he felt as if he were fighting a shadow no human could move the way she did he could not move the way she did behind he felt the sudden loathsome presence he checked the thrust of her blade and spun bringing the sword around with lightning speed for an instant he saw a snarl of fangs and a malicious glare and then the sword made solid contact and what was there was rendered unrecognizable as it disintegrated he felt her blade coming and dove over the falling hulk rolling to his feet he returned the attack the night air rang over and over with the sound of steel on steel richard realized that her blade must somehow be like his she had a weapon the match of the sword of truth besides that she had command of magic he could only imagine he didnt have to imagine long as the battle wound its way across the clearing both straining with all the fury they could bring forth she leapt back and sent a bolt of fire racing toward him he dodged at the last instant and it flew past hitting a tree the trunk exploded in a shower of splinters the top of the tree crashed down around him some of the branches knocking him from his feet liliana slashed through branches as thick as his arms to get at him they splintered the way the trunk had richard scrambled out from under and fought her back into the thick woods as they clashed over and over again while descending a steep hill he began to analyze her tactics she fought ferociously but without grace like a soldier in combat among the lines he didnt know how he knew that except it had to come from the spirits of his swords magic the way she attacked slashing and swinging left her open for a thrusting counterattack richard pressed that attack at her but when he finally managed to thrust at her middle the strike that should have found its mark slid to the side she was protected somehow she had the use of magic he didnt understand richard was exhausted and was fighting on the pure rage and fury of the magic she didnt even seem winded you cant win richard i will have you why you cant win in the end i will have my reward he ducked behind a tree just missing a swing that sent wood chips flying if you help the keeper escape he will swallow all life you think so you think wrong he will reward those who serve him he will grant me things the creator never could he stabbed at her but the sword slid to the side hes lying to you her blade whistled past his face her calm deliberate attacks were relentless we have a bargain my oath seals it and you believe he will keep his end join with us richard and i will show you the glory that awaits those who serve him you can live forever richard leapt to the top of a rock never she looked up with a cold detachment i thought this would be pleasurable but i find i am growing bored liliana swept a hand out twisting snaking lightning came from the hand but it was not like any lightning he had ever seen before it was black lightning instead of a bolt of light and heat it was an undulating void as dark as the night stone as dark as the boxes of orden as dark as eternal death the dim moonlit scene seemed a sunny day in comparison richard knew he was seeing subtractive magic liliana swept the black lightning across the rock beneath his feet it effortlessly sliced a smoothedged void through the rock the remaining part he stood atop collapsed onto the half below trees behind for a good distance severed in the same way by the same black bolt crashed to the ground in a roar of noise richard lost his footing and toppled backward onto the steep slope tumbling down the hill he threw his arms out to stop himself when he hit the flat at the bottom and immediately rolled over onto his back he looked up and gasped liliana was standing right over him her sword held high in both hands by where she was looking he knew she intended to cut off his legs he froze at seeing her sword commence its descent what he was doing was not working he had to do something else or he was going to die her blade was a blur in the moonlight he released himself gave sanction to his inner self his gift he would surrender to whatever was there or he would die it was his only chance he found the calm center within and did its bidding he saw the sword of truth thrusting upward his knuckles were white with effort the sword was a white glow in the gloomy light with all his force he drove the hissing white blade into liliana under her ribs when the tip severed her spine coming out her back between her shoulder blades she went limp only his sword and strength held her upright her mouth dropped open in a gasp her sword fell sticking in the ground to the side her wide pale eyes stared down at him i forgive you liliana richard whispered her arms twitched in an uncoordinated manner terror rilled her eyes she tried to speak but only blood frothed forth there was an earsplitting crack like a lightning strike but instead of a flash of light a ripple of total darkness swept through the forest its touch made his heart skip a beat when it lifted the moonlight seemed dazzling and liliana was dead richard knew the keeper had taken her before he had called the swords white magic knowing full well what it meant this time he had done as nathan had told him and let his instinct his gift call it forth it had been a surprise to him both the instant calling of the white magic and the fact that he had not consciously done it something within had known that that was what was needed to counter the keepers hate that rilled liliana richard was left stunned by what had happened he stared down at liliana as he withdrew his sword he had confided in her he had trusted her he realized that he was still where he had started with the collar around his neck and no ideas of how to get it off collar or no collar he had to get through the barrier that kept him here he decided that he would go get his things from the palace and then he would find a way through the invisible wall as he wiped the sword clean on her clothes he recalled how it had been in the center of the clearing a good distance from him he had somehow called it to him along with the magic the sword had flown through the air and come into his hand he set the sword on the ground and experimentally called its magic the anger the fury filled him as always he held his hand out and willed the blade to come to him it lay rocksolid on the ground try as he might it would not so much as twitch frustrated he returned it to its scabbard he pulled lilianas sword from the ground and broke the blade over his knee when he threw it aside he noticed something white nearby white bones gleaming in the moonlight were mostly all that remained of the desiccated corpse only the top half was there he assumed animals must have gotten the rest but then he found the pelvis and legs some distance away tattered remains of a dress that matched the top half still surrounded the leg bones richard knelt inspecting the upper body animals had not touched it there was not a single tooth mark on any bone it remained now as it had fallen with a frown he saw that the bones of the lower spine were shattered he had never seen bones splintered in such a way it was as if this woman had been blown in half while alive he knelt silently staring wondering someone had killed this woman somehow he knew magic had killed this woman who did this to you he whispered down at the corpse slowly a skeletal arm rose toward him in the moonlight the fingers uncurled a thin chain dropped down dangling from the bones of a finger richard his hair feeling as if it were trying to stand on end carefully took the chain from the fingers there was a single object on the chain he held it up in the moonlight and saw it was a lumpy piece of gold formed into the letter j jedidiah richard whispered not knowing what made him do so chapter as richard approached he noticed a commotion on the stone bridge a crowd lined one edge everyone looking down to the river at the center he eased his way through toward the low walled railing as he did he saw pasha at the crown too leaning out over the stone looking down whats going on he asked as he came up behind her pasha spun at the sound of his voice she flinched when she saw him richard i thought she looked back over the railing down to the river and then back to him you thought what she threw her arms around his middle oh richard i thought you were dead thank the creator richard pried her arms off and then leaned over looking down to the dark river below several small boats each with a lantern were towing a body tangled in their handcasting nets in the flickering yellow light he could see the red coat richard ran over the bridge and down the banks reaching the shore as the men were landing the boats grabbing the nets from a man he hauled them and their load up onto the grassy bank there was a small round hole in the lower back of the red coat he rolled the body over and looked into perrys dead eyes richard groaned wizards second rule perry had died because richard had violated it he had tried to do something good with the best of intentions and it had brought harm it was richard the dacra had been meant for it was he they thought they were killing pasha was standing on the bank behind him richard i was so afraid i thought it was you she started crying what was he doing in your red coat i loaned it to him he gave her a quick hug i have to go pasha you dont mean the palace you didnt really mean what you said about leaving i know you didnt you cant leave richard i meant every word good night pasha he left the men to their grisly task and headed for his room someone had meant to kill him and it hadnt been liliana someone else was trying to kill him as he was loading his things into his pack he heard a knock at his door he froze a shirt halffolded in his hands then he heard sister vernas voice beyond the door asking if she could come in richard yanked the door open preparing to launch into a tirade but the look on her face caught the words in his throat she stood woodenly staring off at nothing sister verna whats wrong he took her arm and led her into his room here sit down she sank to the edge of the chair richard knelt in front of her and took her hands sister verna whats wrong jive been waiting for you to return her puffy red eyes finally sought his richard she said in a subdued voice i could really use a friend right now you are the only one who came to mind richard hesitated she knew his condition though he now knew she couldnt get the collar off richard when sisters grace and elizabeth died they passed their gift to me i have more power than any sister at the palace any normal sister i know you wont believe this but i doubt even that will be enough to remove your collar but i wish to try richard knew that she couldnt remove it at least he was told that she couldnt maybe nathan was wrong all right try then there is pain involved richards brow drew together in a suspicious frown why do i not find that surprising not for you richard for me what do you mean i have discovered that you have subtractive magic what would that have to do with it you locked the radahan on yourself it locks on by using the magic of the one it is attached to i have only additive magic i dont think that will be sufficient to break the bond i have no power over your subtractive magic it will fight what i try to do and that will hurt me but dont be frightened it wont hurt you richard didnt know what to do what to believe she put her hands to his neck at the sides of his collar before she closed her eyes he saw a glazed look he recognized she was touching her han muscles tense with his hand on the hilt of his sword he waited prepared to react if she tried to harm him he didnt want to believe sister verna would harm him but then he hadnt thought liliana would ever hurt him either her brow wrinkled richard felt only a pleasant warm tingle the room vibrated with a dull hum the corners of carpets curled up windows rattled in their frames sister verna shook with effort the standing mirror in the bedroom shattered panes of glass in the doors exploded as the doors to the balcony banged open the curtains billowed outward as if in a wind plaster fell from the ceiling and a tall cabinet toppled over with a crash a low moan of pain issued from her throat as the flesh on her face trembled richard seized her wrists and pulled her hands from his collar she sagged forward oh richard she said in a mournful voice im sorry i cant do it richard took her in his arms and held her tight its all right i believe you sister i know you tried you have found a friend she squeezed him tight richard you have to get away from this place he sat her back in the chair as she wiped her fingers at the lower lids of her eyes richard rocked back on his heels tell me whats happened there are sisters of the dark in the palace sisters of the dark what does that mean the sisters of the light work to bring the light of the creators glory to the living sisters of the dark serve the keeper it has never been proven that they even exist the accusation without proof is a crime richard i know you arent going to believe me i realize this sounds like im just i killed sister liliana tonight i believe you she blinked at him you did what she told me she was going to take my collar off she had me meet her in the hagen woods sister verna she tried to take the gift from me for herself she cant do that a female cannot take on the gift of a male or the other way around it isnt possible she said she had done it many times before it seemed possible to me when she was trying i could feel her pulling the life the gift right out of me she almost succeeded i came close to death she brushed back her curly hair but i dont see how richard pulled out the statue she was using this the crystal started glowing orange when she was doing it do you know what it is sister verna shook her head i think ive seen it before somewhere but i cant remember it was so long ago before i left the palace what happened then when that didnt work because i used my power to stop her she called a sword from the shadows she wanted to wound me she said she was going to skin me alive and then steal my gift for herself she tried to cut off my legs somehow i got her first sister verna she had subtractive magic i saw her use it not only that but someone else is trying to kill me i loaned my red coat to perry they just dragged his body out of the river he had been stabbed in the back with a dacra she grimaced oh dear creator she twined her fingers together in her lap the palace knows you have subtractive magic theyre using you to flush out the keepers disciples she took his hand richard ive been a part of this i should have long ago questioned things that were wrong but i didnt i instead did as i thought was right questioned what forgive me richard you should never have had a radahan put around your neck it wasnt necessary i was told there were no wizards in the new world to help boys i thought you would die without our help your friend zedd could have kept the gift from harming you the prelate knew there were wizards to help you she let you be stolen from your friends and loved ones for her own selfish reasons you didnt need the radahan to save your life i know i talked to nathan he told me you went to the prophet what else did he say that i have more power than any wizard born in three thousand years but i have no idea how to use it and that i have subtractive magic he said that the sisters could not remove the collar im so sorry i brought this upon you richard sister verna you were deceived as was i youre a victim too theyve used both of us there is worse trouble there is a prophecy that says that on winter solstice kahlan is going to die i must stop that from happening and darken rahl my father an agent of the keeper is in this world you saw the mark he burned on me he is an agent who can tear the veil if he has all the elements in place though i doubt he does sister verna i have to get away from here i must get through the barrier ill help you somehow ill help you get through the barrier your problem will be the valley of the lost i dont think you can get through the valley again now that the collar has helped your subtractive magic grow you will call the spells to you the magic will find you this time i might have a way i must try sister verna thought a moment the keeper would want to stop you if there is a possibility for this prophecy about his agent to come to pass the sisters of the dark will work to stop you i am sure liliana wasnt the only one who placed her as my teacher the prelates office assigns teachers but the prelate probably wouldnt have done it herself such matters are usually handled by her administrators her administrators sisters ulicia and finella i thought they were her guards guards no maybe in a bureaucratic sense the prelate has more power than they she doesnt need guards some of the boys think of them as guards because they are always turned away from the prelates door by the two sisters they do some of their work in the prelates office and they have their own offices where they handle a variety of administrative tasks maybe the sisters of the dark came after me decided they had to act now because they had been discovered no the prelate told me no one but she knows could anyone have overheard no she shielded the room richard leaned in sister verna liliana had subtractive magic the prelates shield would not have worked against that one of those two administrators assigned sister liliana to me she drew a sudden breath and the other five if one or both of those two in the outer office heard what the prelate knows then the prelate sister ulicias office thats where i saw that statue richard grabbed her wrist and yanked her from the chair come on if they tried to kill me they may try to kill the prelate before she warns anyone else the two of them raced down the stairs and out of gillaume hall they crossed the lawns in the darkness ran down halls and through passageways kevin wasnt there another guard was on duty but he didnt stop them as he too knew richard and sisters were not restricted richard knew they were too late when he saw the charred doors to the prelates office broken from their hinges he slid to a stop on the slick marble floor of the hall papers and ledgers were scattered out into the hall sister verna was still running down the hall as he went into the office with his sword drawn it looked as if a thunderstorm had been turned loose inside what was left of sister finella lay on the floor behind her desk the rest of her was splattered across the wall he heard sister verna gasp as he kicked in the door to the prelates office when the door swung back richard dove through and rolled to his feet with his sword in both hands the prelates room was more of a mess than the outer room papers were nearly a foot deep over most of the floor it looked as if all the books from the shelves had exploded throwing the pages everywhere the heavy walnut table was in splinters against the far wall the room was in near darkness only the doorway behind and the open doors to the moonlit garden let in any light sister verna lit a bright flame in her palm in the sudden illumination he saw a form at the far end of the room near the overturned table the head came slowly up the eyes locked on his it was sister ulicia richard dove to the side as a bolt of blue lightning blasted through the room ripping open the wall behind sister verna returned the attack with a searing gout of yellow flame sister ulicia dove through the doorway into the courtyard to avoid the fire richard went after her sister verna ran to the overturned splintered table pawing scraps away duck richard screamed back to her a twisting rope of the black lightning sliced through the walls right over his head as he flattened to the floor severed bookshelves crashed down he could see through the void sliced by the black lightning into the next room and the rooms beyond plaster and lath and stone collapsed down raising boiling clouds of dust in a fury without thinking richard came to his feet when the black lighting ceased and ran outside he saw a dark form running down the path again black lightning arced from the shadows the snaking void raked the courtyard trees toppled over limbs snapping and popping as the trees fell a stone wall collapsed when it was sliced in two the noise was deafening when it stopped richard sprang to his feet again he was just about to start running down the path to find her when an invisible hand snatched him yanking him back richard sister vernas growl was as strong as he had ever heard it get in here he returned to the prelates room panting when he stopped over sister verna i have to go she shot to her feet and grabbed his shirt in her real hand go what go get killed what good will that do will that help kahlan sister ulicia is a master of powers you cannot even imagine but she might get away at least you will be alive when she does now come help me with this table i think the prelate is still alive hope leapt to life in him are you sure richard started pulling the broken pieces away throwing them behind he found the body at the bottom of the debris sister verna was right the prelate was alive but looked seriously hurt sister verna used her power to lift heavy pieces of the table and bookcases clear while richard carefully pulled lesser chunks off the small woman she was wedged into the bottom bookshelf against the wall and covered with blood she groaned when richard gently put his hands around her and drew her out he didnt think she was long for this life we have to get help he said sister vernas hands played over the prelates body richard this is very bad i can feel some of her injuries its more than i can help with i dont know if anyone will be able to help with this richard lifted ann in his arms i cant let her die if anyone can help her its nathan come on guards and sisters came rushing having heard the deafening roar of the power sister ulicia had unleashed richard didnt stop to explain as he made for nathans compound he tried to hold ann gently as he ran but he knew by her groans that he was hurting her nathan came in from his courtyard when he heard them call what was all that noise what is it whats happened its ann shes been hurt nathan led him into the bedroom i knew that stubborn woman was asking for trouble richard laid ann gently on the bed and stood near as nathan experimentally glided his spread fingers over the length of her sister verna waited and watched from the doorway nathan pushed up his sleeves this is serious i dont know if i can help her nathan you have to try of course i do boy he made a shooing motion with his hands you two go wait out there this will take a while at least an hour or two before i know if what i can do will help enough leave me to it you can be of no help sister verna sat with her back stiff while richard paced richard why do you care so much what happens to the prelate she had you taken when she shouldnt have richard combed his hair back with his fingers i guess because she had the chance to take me when i was little and she didnt she let me grow up with my parents she let me have their love what else is there to life but the chance to be nurtured by love she could have taken that too but she didnt im glad then that you are not bitter richard paced and thought he didnt pace for long sister i cant sit here doing nothing im going to talk to the guards we need to know where those teachers of mine are and what theyre doing the guards will find out for me i suppose it couldnt hurt go talk to the guards it will make the time pass more quickly richard strode down the dark stone corridors deep in thought he needed to find out where sisters tovi cecilia merissa nicci and armina were any or all could be sisters of the dark who knew what they were planning next they could all be looking for him they could all be stunning pain hurled him back it felt as if he had been whacked across the face with a club he staggered to his feet the world spinning and tipping he dumbly felt for blood but there was none another blow smashed into the back of his head he pushed himself up on his hands trying to decipher where he was his thoughts came thick and slow he struggled to understand what was happening a dark shadow stood over him with an effort and halting movements he came to his feet again he groped for his sword but couldnt remember which hand to use he couldnt make himself move fast enough out for a walk country boy richard looked up at a smirking jedidiah standing tall with his hands in opposite sleeves richard found the hilt of his sword he sluggishly worked at drawing it he lurched back as he battled to bring the magic forth as the rage flooded into his foggy brain jedidiah pulled his hands out he had a dacra his arm lifted the silver knife in his fist richard wondered what he should do and if this was real maybe he would wake and find it only a dream at the apex of his swing light seemed to come from within jedidiahs eyes slowly at first and then with gathering speed jedidiah toppled forward slamming facefirst to the stone floor a ripple of heartstopping darkness swept though the corridor when the torchlight returned sister verna was standing behind where jedidiah had stood she had a dacra in her hand richard collapsed to his knees still trying to gather his wits sister verna rushed forward putting her hands to the sides of his head alertness jolted into his mind as he came to his feet he glanced down at the body seeing a small round hole in the back i thought i had better go talk to some of the sisters she explained i realized that the more people who know about the sisters of the dark the better he was the one wasnt he he was the one you loved she slipped the dacra back up her sleeve he wasnt the jedidiah i knew the jedidiah i knew was a good man im sorry sister verna she nodded absently you go talk to the guards ill talk to the sisters meet me back in nathans room when youre through i think it best if we catch a few hours sleep there instead of our rooms i think youre right we can get our things when its light and then be off when he heard nathan come into the room richard sat up in the chair and rubbed his eyes sister verna rose more quickly from the couch richard blinked trying to banish the haze of sleep they both had been up late the whole palace was in an uproar what had happened in the prelates office was proof enough of the mythical sisters of the dark doubters had only to take one look at the smoothedged voids that lined up through a dozen walls or the cleanly sliced trees and stone to know that nothing short of subtractive magic had been used richard had sent the guards out to look discreetly for the six sisters sister ulicia and his five teachers the sisters were searching too he had also gone to talk to warren to tell him what had happened richard stretched his legs as he stood how is she is she going to recover nathan looked haggard shes resting more comfortably but its too soon to tell when she has rested i will be able to do more thank you nathan i know ann could be in no better hands than yours he added a grunt to his sour expression youre asking me to heal my jailer ann will appreciate it perhaps she will rethink your being held if she doesnt ill come back and see what i can do come back going somewhere my boy yes nathan and i need your help if i help you you might get it in your obstinate head to go off and destroy the world and do the prophecies say you were sent to stop me nathan let out a tired sigh what is it you want how can i get through the barrier my collar stops me what makes you think i would know richard took an angry stride toward the towering old wizard nathan dont play games with me im in no mood and this is too important youve been through you went with ann to get the book from the wizards keep in aydindril remember he smoothed his sleeves down its a simple matter of shielding the radahan ann helped me through sister verna can do the same for you ill tell her how and what of the valley of the lost can i get back through that nathan his eyes suddenly intent with a dark look shook his head you have called too much power to yourself the collar has helped it grow youll also call the spells sister verna cant pass again she has been through twice already additionally she has too much power now with passing twice and taking the gift of the other two sisters she is locked here then how did you ever get through three times youre from dhara thats once you went to the new world again with ann and came back that makes three times how did you do it if it cant be done a sly smile came to his lips i did not go through the valley three times only once he held up a hand to silence richards arguments ann and i didnt go through the valley we went around the obstacle we sailed around the ambit of the spells far out to sea landing finally in the southernmost reaches of westland its a long journey and not easily done but we made the crossing not many do by sea richard glanced back to sister verna i dont have that kind of time winter solstice is not even a week away i have to go through the valley richard sister verna said in a soft voice i can understand how you feel but it will take almost that much time just to reach the valley of the lost even if you find a way through there is no time to get where you want to go richard controlled his rage i am inexperienced at being a wizard i cannot count on my gift for that matter i dont care if i ever learn to use it but i am also the seeker in that sister verna i am not so inexperienced nothing is going to stop me nothing ive made a promise to kahlan that if i must go to the underworld and battle the keeper himself in order to protect her i will do it nathans expression darkened i have warned you richard if that prophecy is not allowed to take place the keeper will have us all you must not try to stop it you have the power to hand the world of the living to the keeper its just a meaningless riddle richard growled in frustration though he knew better nathans scowl was the scowl of a rahl the scowl richard had inherited richard death is intrinsic to life the creator brought it to be too if you make the wrong choice all the living will pay the price of your pertinaciousness and richard dont forget what i told you about the stone of tears if you misuse it to banish a soul to the depths of the underworld you will destroy the balance between everything stone of tears sister verna said in a suspicious tone what would richard have to do with the stone of tears richard turned back to sister verna were running out of time im going to my room to get my things we need to be on our way richard nathan said ann has put her faith in you she let you have the love of your family so that perhaps you will better understand the true meaning of life please consider that when the time for choice is upon you richard looked up at nathan for a long moment thank you for your help nathan but i wont let the one i love die for a riddle in an old book i hope to see you again there is much for us to talk about richard dumped the bowl full of gold coins into the bottom of his pack before stuffing the rest of his things in he reasoned that if it helped him save kahlan then it was the least the palace could do after all they had done to him the gold had been a kindness that lulled the rest of the young men at the palace into laziness it harmed their humanity as nathan had said maybe that was why jedidiah turned to promises from the keeper richard doubted that any of the young wizards except warren had done a days work since they had come here and had ready access to unlimited gold but no knowledge of its value just one more way the palace of the prophets destroyed lives he wondered how many children of young wizards that gold had spawned richard went out onto the balcony to take stock before he left guards were patrolling the grounds sisters too were diligently searching every building and covered corridor the sisters would have to somehow deal with those six he certainly had no idea how to contain their power when he heard the door in the front room he assumed it would be sister verna they had to get going when he turned and looked he had no time to react pasha was storming through the room toward him she threw her hands up the doors blew off their hinges and over the balcony railing falling the thirty feet to the stonepaved courtyard below the impact of the solid wall of air threw him back only the railing prevented him from being thrown over with the splintered doors the wind had been knocked from his lungs and a sharp pain in his side prevented him from taking another breath as he staggered away from the edge of the balcony another blow threw him back once again this time hammering his head against the stone railing he saw a shocking spray of blood hit the stone before the slate floor collected him pasha was screaming in a rage at first her words were nothing but an incoherent buzz in his mind he pushed himself up with his hands blood was running from his head a pool of it spread beneath him reeling he toppled to his side he managed to sit up and flop back against the railing pasha what keep your filthy mouth shut i wont hear any of it she was standing in the doorway fists at her sides one fist held a dacra tears streamed down her cheeks youre the keepers spawn youre an obscene disciple of the keeper you do nothing but hurt good people richard put his hands to his head they came away covered with blood he was so dizzy he had to fight the urge to be sick what are you talking about he managed to mumble sister ulicia told me she told me you serve the keeper she told me how you killed sister liliana pasha sister ulicia is a sister of the dark she told me you would say that she told me how you used your vile magic to kill sister finella and the prelate thats why you were always wanting to go to the prelates office so you could kill our leader in the light you are filth the world swam before his eyes he saw two of her moving around and around each other pasha thats not true only the keepers tricks saved you yesterday you gave someone else the coat i loved to humiliate me sister ulicia told me how the keeper whispers in your ear i should have killed you when i saw you on the bridge then none of this would have happened but i foolishly thought i could save you from the keepers clutches those sisters and the prelate would be alive now had i finished the job i failed the creator when you tricked me into killing perry but that will not save you again your vile underworld tricks will not save you again pasha please just listen to me youre being lied to please listen the prelate isnt dead i can take you to her you wish to kill me too thats all you ever talk of killing you profane us all and to think i could have ever thought i loved you she raised the dacra and with a scream ran for him richard somehow managed to pull the sword woozily wondering which image of her to try to stop the anger the magic of the sword brought strength to his arms he brought the sword up as she dove for him dacra first the two images of her converged the sword never touched her with a shriek she was propelled over the railing above him she screamed all the way down richards eyes winced shut when he heard her scream terminate as she hit the stone richard opened his eyes to see a stunned warren standing in the doorway he remembered jedidiahs fall on the stairs oh dear spirits no richard whispered he levered himself to his feet and took a quick glance over the edge people rushed from different directions toward the body warren was shuffling woodenly toward the railing richard stopped him halfway there no warren dont look tears welled up in warrens eyes richard put his arms around his friend why did you do that he thought i could have done it i was going to do it you didnt have to over warrens shoulder richard saw sister verna standing in the room she killed perry warren said i heard her admit it she was going to kill you i could have done it richard thought you didnt need to but instead he said thank you warren you saved my life she was going to kill you he cried against richards shoulder why would she do that sister verna put a comforting hand to warrens back she was lied to by the sisters of the dark the keeper filled her mind with lies she heard the whispers of the darkness the keeper can make even the good listen to his whispers you did a brave thing warren then why do i feel so ashamed i loved her and i killed her richard simply held him as he wept sister verna pulled them back into the room she made richard bend over as she examined his head blood was dripping all over the floor this must be tended to i cant fix this much damage i can warren said im fair at healing let me do it when warren had finished sister verna made richard hold his head over the basin while she poured the ewer of water over him washing off the blood warren sat on the edge of a chair his head in his hands richard thought that he was going to need the basin warrens head came up when the sister finished i figured out the rule you told me about people will believe a lie because they want to believe its true or because they are afraid it is just like pasha believed a lie am i right richard smiled you are warren warren managed a weak smile sister verna can you take this collar off me sister verna hesitated you would have to pass the test of pain warren sister richard said what do you think he just did what do you mean the young wizards sent back through the valley are able to pass because they dont have sufficient power to draw the spells to them they are not full wizards zedd told me that wizards have to pass a test of pain over the millennia the sisters have convoluted that into making them endure physical pain i think theyre wrong i think the test warren just passed is more pain than the sisters could ever give am i right warren he nodded his face going white again nothing they ever did hurt like this sister remember when i told you how i turned the blade white and killed that woman by loving her maybe that too was a form of the test of pain i know how much that hurt she spread her hands in dismay do you really think that one with the gift must kill someone they love to pass the test richard that cant be no sister they dont have to kill someone they love but they must prove they can make the right decision they must prove they have what it takes to choose the greater good would one with the gift be a good servant to this creator of yours to the hope of life if they could act only for selfish needs giving someone pain as the sisters do doesnt prove anything except that the victim does not die wouldnt serving the light of life and loving life require that the person prove instead that of their own free will they would choose right choose that light of life and love for all people dear creator she whispered have we had it wrong all this time her hand covered her mouth a moment and we thought we were bringing the creators light to these boys sister vernas back straightened with resolve she stood before warren putting her hands to the sides of his radahan as she stood with her eyes closed her hands to the collar there was a humming vibration in the air after a moment silence settled over the room and then richard heard a snapping sound the radahan cracked and fell away warren looked positively giddy at the sight of the broken collar richard wished it could be that easy for him what are you going to do now warren richard asked are you going to leave the palace maybe but i wish to study the books some more first if the sisters will allow it they will allow it sister verna said i will see to it then maybe i would like to travel to aydindril to the wizards keep and study the books and prophecies you told me were kept there that sounds a wise plan warren sister i must be going warren she said why dont you come along until i reach the valley you are free now she glanced to the balcony i think it would do you good to get away from here for a time and think of other things and i could use some help when we reach the valley if richard accomplishes what he thinks he will really i would like that as the three of them lugged their gear toward the stables three guards kevin walsh and bollesdun spotted them and ran to catch up we may have found them richard kevin said may have what do you mean where are they well last night the lady sefa set sail we talked to people down at the docks who said they saw some women maybe the sisters go aboard most agree they saw six women go aboard in the darkness just before she sailed sailed richard groaned whats the lady sefa a ship a big ship they left with the tide late in the night they have a good lead and from what i hear there isnt a ship in port that can catch the lady sefa or go as far to sea we cant go after them and do your other task sister verna said richard shifted his pack in annoyance youre right if its really them theyre gone for now but i know where theyre going well have to deal with them later at least the palace of the prophets is safe we have more important things to tend to right now lets get the horses and be on our way chapter kahlan ran down the dark stone corridors and through the tomblike chambers the first rays of light splashed golden patches against the coarse dark gray granite wall opposite the windows as she raced up an east stairway her heart pounded with the effort she had not stopped running since jebra had told her that she had spied a light in the wizards keep that zedd was back she remembered what it felt like to run with long hair the weight of it the way it streamed out behind flowing with her strides she felt none of that now but it didnt matter she felt only desperate elation that zedd was back she had been waiting so long she screamed his name as she ran bursting into the cluttered reading room she stumbled to a panting halt zedd stood behind a table with books and papers scattered over it just as she remembered it from the last time she had seen it months ago candles on stands gave the small room an intimate glow the reading room had but a single window facing the still murky western sky a big man with bushy eyebrows mostly gray hair and a weathered creased face looked up from a walking stick he was inspecting adie sat in a chair to the side her head flitting toward sounds zedd cocked his head with a curious frown zedd she gulped air oh zedd im so relieved to see you zedd he turned toward the big man zedd the big man gave a nod but i like ruben zedd i need your help who be there adie said from the chair adie its me kahlan kahlan she twitched her head toward zedd who be kahlan zedd shrugged a pretty girl with short hair she seems to know us what are you talking about zedd i need help richard is in trouble i need you zedds brow wrinkled in bewilderment richard i know that name i think kahlan was frantic zedd whats the matter dont you know me please zedd i need you richard needs you richard he rubbed his smooth chin as he stared in thought at the table richard your grandson dear spirits dont you know your own grandson he stared at the table thinking grandson i seem to remember no cant say i do zedd listen to me the sisters of the light have him theyve taken him away kahlan stood silently catching her breath zedds hazel eyes rose slowly to meet her gaze his face lost its curiosity as his eyebrows drew in to hood his glare the sisters of the light have richard kahlan had seen wizards angry but she had never seen a look in any wizards eyes like the look in zedds eyes yes she said she wiped her sweaty palms on her hips as she watched a crack run up the stone of the wall behind him they came and took him zedd put his knuckles to the table and leaned toward her thats not possible they couldnt take him unless they got one of their cursed collars around his neck richard would not put a collar around his neck kahlans knees were beginning to tremble he did his seething expression seemed it might ignite the very air why would he put their collar around his neck confessor because she said in a small voice i made him put it on the candles on one of the stands close to him abruptly melted dripping their wax to hissing puddles on the floor the iron arms that had held the candles drooped down like a plant needing water the big man shrank back toward the wall of shelves zedds voice came in a dangerous whisper you did what confessor the room echoed with silence as she stood quivering he didnt want to i had to do it i told him that he had to put it on to prove he loved me kahlan thought she felt herself hit the wall she couldnt understand why she was sprawled on the floor she pushed herself up with shaking arms she gasped as she was suddenly jerked to her feet and slammed against the wall again zedd his eyes wild was right in front of her you did that to richard kahlans head spun her own voice sounded distant you dont understand i had to zedd i need your help richard told me to find you and tell you what i had done please zedd help him in a rage zedd backhanded her across the face she skinned her hands on the stone floor as she went down he yanked her to her feet and slammed her to the wall once more i cant help him no one can you fool tears ran down her face why zedd we have to help him she brought up her arms in front of her face to ward him off when he drew his hand back again it didnt help her head smacked the wall again the room spun she shook all over she had never seen a wizard in a rage so out of control kahlan knew he was going to kill her for what she had done to richard you fool you treacherous fool no one can help him now please zedd you can please help him not even i no one can get to him i cant pass the towers richard is lost to us all i had left is lost what do you mean lost to us with trembling fingers she wiped blood from the corner of her mouth she didnt wipe the tears he will be back he has to come back zedds eyes never left hers as he slowly shook his head not while any of us are alive the palace of the prophets is in a spell of time richard will be there for the next three hundred years while they train him we will never see him again he is lost to this world kahlan shook her head no dear spirits no that cant be we will see him it cant be true true mother confessor you have put him beyond any help i will never again see my grandson you will never again see him richard will not return to this world for another three hundred years because of you because you made him put on that collar to prove he loves you he turned his back to her kahlan fell to her knees noooo she beat her fists on the floor dear spirits why have you done this to me she cried in choking sobs richard my richard what happened to your hair mother confessor zedd asked in a menacing voice his back still to her kahlan sat back on her heels what did it matter anymore the council convicted me of treason i have been sentenced to be executed to be beheaded the people all cheered at the pronouncement of sentence they all wanted to see it done but i escaped zedd nodded the people shall have their wish he grabbed what was left of her hair in his fist and started dragging her from the room for what you have done you shall be beheaded zedd she screamed zedd please dont do this he used magic to drag her down the hall like a sack of feathers tomorrow at the winter solstice festival the people shall have their wish they shall see the mother confessor beheaded as first wizard i will see to it i shall see it done kahlan went limp what did it matter the good spirits had abandoned her they had stripped her of everything that mattered worse she herself had condemned richard to three hundred years of the thing he feared most she wanted to die death couldnt come fast enough for her richard stood with his hands on his hips as he watched the dark clouds made by spells in the distance in the valley of the lost they looked beautiful in the sunrise with golden edges and striations of glowing rays but he knew they were deadly du chaillu put an affectionate hand to his arm my husband makes me proud this day he returns our land to us as the old words have foretold ive explained it to you a dozen times du chaillu i am not your husband you have simply misinterpreted the old words it only means we must do this together and we havent done it yet i wish you would have come with me without bringing everyone else i dont even know if this will work we could be killed she patted his arm reassuringly the caharin has come he can do anything he will return our land she left him to his thoughts and started back to the camp all our people should be with us it is their right she stopped and turned back will we be leaving soon caharin soon richard said absently she started off again i will be with our people when you are ready for me the entire baka ban mana nation was camped behind them thousands upon thousands of tents were spread out over the hills like mushrooms after a month of rain he hadnt been able to talk them out of coming to convince them to wait so they were all here with him richard sighed what difference did it make if he was wrong and this failed he had no reason to worry about all the baka ban mana being disappointed in him he would be dead warren and sister verna quietly came up behind richard warren said can we talk to you richard continued to stare out at the storms of course warren he cast a glance back whats on your mind warren pushed his hands up the opposite sleeves of his robes richard thought it made him look very wizardlike when he did that warren was going to someday end up being richards idea of what a wizard ought to be wise compassionate and charged with knowledge richard could only wonder at if they didnt all die that was well sister verna and i were talking about what happens after you get through the valley richard i know what you want to do but we have run out of time there never was enough time to begin with tomorrow is winter solstice it cant be done just because you dont know how to do something that does not mean it cant be done i dont understand richard smiled at them you will you will understand in a few hours warren looked away toward the valley he idly scratched his nose if you say so richard sister verna said nothing richard was still trying to get used to her not arguing with him whenever he said something oblique he wasnt sure she didnt want to warren about the prophecy the one about the gateway and the winter solstice are you sure its about this winter solstice warren nodded and if there were an agent with an open box of orden and the skrin bone are those the only elements needed to open the gateway to tear the veil a hot breeze ruffled warrens hair yes but you told me darken rahl is dead there is no agent it sounded more like a worried question than a statement must the agent be alive sister verna asked warren shifted his weight to the other foot well not in principle i guess if he were somehow called back into this world but i dont see how that could be done but if it were done that would be all that was needed richard sighed in frustration and then this spirit agent could do the things the living agent would have done suspicion crept onto warrens face well yes and no it would require another element a spirit cannot perform the physical requirements necessary to complete the covenant he would need a coadjutor you mean the spirit could not perform certain of the tasks needed so he would need hands that would work in this world yes with a helper a spirit could do what was needed but how could an agent be called back into this world i dont see how that could be accomplished sister verna glanced away you had better tell him richard pulled his shirt up and showed warren the scar darken rahl burned me with his hand when i unintentionally called him back into this world he said he was here to tear the veil warrens eyes opened wide his worried gaze darted to the sister and then back to richard if darken rahl is an agent as you said and he has someone to help him then we are only one element away from destruction the skrin bone we need to know richard pushed the mriswith cape back over his shoulder sister verna would you help me what is it you would like me to do the first time you told me how to try to touch my han i decided to concentrate on a mental image of my sword but that time the first time i used a background to put it against it was something from the book of magic i told you about the book of counted shadows when i tried to touch my han with the sword on that background something happened i was somehow in dhara in the peoples palace where the boxes are i saw darken rahl he saw me too and spoke to me he told me he was waiting for me sister vernas eyebrows lifted did this ever happen again no it frightened the wits out of me i never used that background again i think if i use that background now i may be able to see what is happening there she folded her hands together before herself ive never heard of such a thing but it may have something to do with the magic of orden it would not be the first thing about you that astonished me it could be real or just a fear like a dream i need to try would you sit with me im afraid of not being able to pull back of course richard she sat down on the ground and held up a hand come i will be with you richard pulled the mriswith cape around himself as he sat down folding his legs this thing hides my han maybe it will work to keep darken rahl from seeing me this time richard relaxed himself as he held hands with sister verna he concentrated on the mental image of the sword against the black square with a white border as he had done the first time as he concentrated seeking the calm center something began to happen the sword the black square and the white border all began to shimmer as if seen through heat waves the same as the first time the solid form of the sword softened becoming transparent and then vanished the background dissolved once again richard was looking into the garden of life at the peoples palace he searched the filmy image seeing white bones where before he had seen burned bodies he remembered them lying over the short walls in bushes and sprawled on the grass they were much as he remembered only now they were mostly exposed bones richard saw the white glowing figure of darken rahl but he was not standing before the stone altar before the three boxes of orden he was near the circle that had held white sand the sand had not been there the last time he had seen this vision a woman in a long brown skirt and white blouse knelt at darken rahls feet bent over the circle of sand richard willed himself closer she was drawing lines in the sparkling sorcerers sand richard remembered some of the symbols she was drawing darken rahl had drawn them before when he had opened the box richard watched her hand moving slowly carefully as she drew the lines of spells her right hand he noticed was missing the little finger in the center of the circle in the center of the sorcerers sand sat a round object richard went closer it was carved all over with beasts just as the prelate had described richard wanted to scream with rage just then darken rahl lifted his face and looked right into richards eyes a smile slowly spread on his lips richard didnt know if darken rahl was really looking at him or not but he didnt wait to find out with desperate effort he forced the image of the sword back into his mind like slamming a door at the same time banishing the blackandwhite background with a gasp richard forced his eyes open his chest heaved sister vernas eyes came open too richard are you all right youve been at it an hour i felt you trying to pull back so i pulled with you what happened what did you see an hour richard was still trying to catch his breath i saw darken rahl and the skrin bone he had a woman there helping him draw spells in the sorcerers sand warren leaned over richards shoulder maybe it was just a vision of a fear it may not have been real warren could be right sister verna said she drew her lower lip through her teeth as she thought what did the woman look like wavy shoulderlength brown hair maybe about your size she was bent over drawing in the sand so i couldnt see her eyes richard pressed his fingers to his forehead as he thought her hand she was missing the little finger on her right hand warren groaned sister vernas eyes slid closed what whats the matter sister odette she said thats sister odette warren nodded confirmation she has been gone for close to six months i thought she went to get a boy curse the spirits richard said under his breath he sprang to his feet warren run and get du chaillu tell her we must leave right now he ground his teeth in frustration he had thought he had all the time he needed well he still had enough time if he hurried du chaillu seemed in a trance as richard pulled her forward by the hand with the sword of truth in his other hand richard was in a world of his own too his thundering rage was a match for the angry black clouds the spells of magic circled them like a pack of dogs around a porcupine angry and insistent but holding their distance as they searched for an opening wisps of light emerged from the darkness and whirled around them spiraling down to vanish into an aura that surrounded du chaillu she seemed to be absorbing the magic as sister verna told him she had done before together they were the completed link warren had told him the old books said would contain the power and bring the towers down through the waves of heat and the boiling mist richard saw the first tower he pulled du chaillu onward toward the glistening black wall that disappeared into the darkness overhead dust and dirt lifted around them as they rushed toward the arched opening in the wall spells snatched at them but their light was sucked to du chaillu richard acted without thought not knowing what drove him onward and not trying to stop it if he was to succeed if he was to save kahlan he had to let those things within himself guide him he had to hope that if he truly had the gift it would react on instinct as nathan had told him and do what was needed du chaillu seemed not to notice the sparkling black sand they stood on in the center of the tower she seemed lost in a private spell of her own in the power passed down to her from those who built the towers and took her peoples land so far she had done her half of what was needed she had protected him now richard had to do his part on impulse holding her hand tight in his he lifted the sword high in the other pointing it straight up he lost himself in the fury of the magic letting it overwhelm him he felt the heat of it in the calm center he had always sought he let the rage fill the void lightning exploded from the sword arcing up into the darkness overhead jumping from one wall to the other bathing them all in liquid light the noise was deafening fire raced through the black stone until the whole of the tower glowed the stone turning white in the heat of the luminous discharge richard felt as if the lightning were passing through him too it seared him with its power erupting outward and up through the sword only his rage enabled him to endure the ferocity of the onrushing force coming from within flickering webs of lightning cascaded down the walls and across the black sand until everything was alive with it the black sand turned white as had the walls and the world burned with pulsing fire and light abruptly it ended the lightning cut off the fire winked out and the roar of noise ceased leaving silence ringing in his ears the polished black stone of the tower was left a blinding white gloss du chaillu seemed still not to notice what was around her and richard pulled her onward to complete the task for which they both had been born in the white tower as he held the sword high he expected the flash of heat and light again but it did not come instead the counter to it the balance to it exploded forth concussion ripped the air threatening to strip flesh from bone as black lightning blasted upward a void in the light like the lightning before richard felt the might of the power erupting from deep within himself as if his very soul were pouring it forth the snaking void in the light raked the walls and with a thunderous roar pierced a void into the darkness above as the black lightning twisted into the darkness overhead shadows oozed down the white walls making it seem as if they were melting into the depths of eternal night darkness reached the ground and flowed toward them soaking into the white sand turning it black richard never gave thought to trying to escape the encroaching night when it reached them he felt as if they were being plunged into icy water du chaillu her eyes closed shivered with the touch of it richard noted it but through the wrath of the swords magic it was a distant sensation that only fed the anger it seemed the whole world had vanished forever into inky obscurity light and vision were beyond even memory richard felt the undulating twisting rope of the black lightning the void in the world of life cut off sudden silence replaced the cacophony he could hear himself breathing hard he could hear du chaillu doing the same light and life and warmth emerged from the cold void outside through the arches in the stone now glossy black where it was once white richard could see light coming through the thinning fog the ground that before was baked and barren was now green and lush still holding hands he and du chaillu stood in the archway watching the haze and smoke lift on a world no one had seen in thousands of years hand in hand they walked out into the cool air across the thick grass and through shafts of sunlight the storms of spells were gone the dark clouds they spawned evaporating as they lifted the air smelled fresh and clean the feel of life vibrated around them the valley off to the pale blue line of mountains in the distance was lush and green groves of trees were gathered in places along meandering streams gentle rises overlaid each other in differing shades of green richard could understand why the baka ban mana would want their land back it was a place that simply looked like home this was a place of light and hope that would have stayed in a peoples heart throughout all the dark centuries it was not a place that belonged to them it was they that belonged to this place you have done it caharin du chaillu said you have returned our home from beyond the mist richard saw a few people scattered about in the distance those who had been trapped in spells for untold years they wandered aimless and confused he had to find two he knew sister verna and warren galloped toward them bringing his horse before they had completely stopped richard was up on bonnie du chaillu thrust a hand up she wanted to go with him reluctantly he pulled her up behind richard warren said that was astonishing how did you do it i havent the slightest idea warren i had been hoping you could explain it to me richard galloped bonnie off in the direction he remembered seeing chase and rachel when he had been through the valley the first time warren and sister verna followed after it wasnt long before he found them sitting on the bank of a brook chase with his arm around rachels shoulders and his usual look of strained tolerance nowhere in evidence looked confused richard swung his leg over bonnies neck and leapt down chase are you all right richard whats going on where are we we were coming to get you you cant go he looked around you cant go into the valley zedd needs you the veil is torn i know richard handed the reins to sister verna and quickly introduced everyone my friends will explain it all to you he put a knee to the ground in front of rachel the dark ambercolored stone of tears hung on a chain around her neck just as he remembered it rachel are you all right how do you feel she blinked up at him i was in a nice place richard this is a nice place too you will be fine now rachel did zedd give you that stone she nodded he said you might want it and i was to keep it for you until you came to get it thats why im here rachel may i have it then she smiled and pulled it over her head richard unclasped the chain and pulled the stone off holding it in his hand he could feel its warmth and zedds presence the chain was too small for him he handed it back to rachel telling her it looked prettier on her than it would on him and then strung the stone onto a leather thong he had ready he hung the stone of tears around his neck along with the agiel and the dragons tooth from the corner of his eye he watched the distant dot growing in the sky richard warren said after seeing what i just saw with the towers i have no doubt you can do what you say you can do but you have no time to reach where you must go tomorrow the world is going to end if you dont get there what are you going to do where is it we are going my husband du chaillu asked we are not going anywhere du chaillu you are staying here with your people husband chase said a scowl finally starting to creep onto his face i am not her husband its just some silly idea she got in her head richard watched the red shape growing high up in the sky look i dont have time to explain it sister verna and warren can tell you about it sister verna a suspicious frown on her face took a step toward him what are you going to do warren was right you have no time in the distance the red wings spread wide as the dragon plunged into a dive richard unhooked his pack from bonnie slinging it onto his back he gave bonnies neck a goodbye hug he hooked on the quiver and slipped the bow over his shoulder from the corner of his eye he watched the dragon plummet straight down im going to have time i must leave you now sister what do you mean you are leaving how at the last instant the dragon pulled out of the dive her long neck stretched out wings spread wide she shot toward them at incredible speed skimming along just above the ground i have only one chance to reach my goal in time i must fly fly warren and sister verna shouted together scarlet swept up with a roar everyone else saw her for the first time immense wings beat to slow the dragons speed their clothes flapped in the sudden burst of wind the grass all around flattened in the gusts warren sister verna and du chaillu stepped back in surprise scarlet settled to the ground as her forward speed was brought to a halt by her beating wings richard sister verna said as she slowly shook her head you have the oddest pets of anyone ive ever met red dragons are pets to no one sister scarlet is a dear friend richard trotted toward the huge red dragon glistening in the sunlight scarlet snorted a small cloud of gray smoke richard how good to see you again since you called me so urgently with my tooth i presume you are in trouble again as usual trouble indeed my friend richard patted a glossy red scale ive missed you scarlet well ive already eaten i guess i must instead give you a ride in the sky to work up an appetite then i will eat you richard laughed where is your little one her ears twitched off hunting gregory is not so little anymore he misses you and would like to see you i would like to see gregory too but im in a terrible hurry right now im running out of time richard du chaillu ran toward him i must go too i must go where my husband goes richard leaned toward scarlets ear as she lowered her head and peered at him with one yellow eye a little flame scarlet he whispered just for effect dont hurt her du chaillu leapt back with a squeal as a burst of fire charred the grass at her feet du chaillu your land is returned to your people you must stay with them you are their spirit woman they need you they need your guidance i would ask something else of you protect the towers that are on your land i dont know if they can bring any harm but as the caharin i order that no one shall ever enter them guard them and keep all others out too live in peace with others who would live in peace with you but continue to practice with the blades so you may protect yourselves du chaillu drew herself up tall the little strips of cloth on her prayer dress fluttered in the breeze along with her thick black hair you are wise caharin i will see that it is as you say until you return to your wife and your people richard sister verna said her face held a serious look do you know where kahlan is aydindril she would have gone there the prophecy takes place before her people she will be in aydindril the time of choosing is upon you richard where are you going now he looked long into her steady gaze dhara after appraising him silently for a moment she at last embraced him in a warm hug she kissed his cheek and then richard raked his fingers through his thick hair somehow i will stop what is to happen in dhara and then i must get to aydindril before its too late take care my friend she nodded warren and i will see to the people here who have been released from the spells they will need guidance i have been a sister of the light for nearly two hundred years all i ever wanted was to help people who needed it but you had help there is no excuse for taking you or others i want to try to set some of this right warren gave richard a firm hug thanks richard for everything i look forward to seeing you again richard winked try not to have any adventures ill go with you chase said no richard wiped a hand over his face no go home chase take rachel to her new mother and her brothers and sisters emma will be worried sick by now she hasnt seen you in ages go home to you wife and family ill need to be returning home soon too richard turned back to sister verna we must do something about those six sisters theyre sailing for westland the people there have no protection against magic in westland those sisters will be like hawks in a hatchery i think that journey will take them some time you have time enough for them richard good kahlan will want to wed before the mud people then i may need to come and get some advice on how to handle those six talk to nathan and ann we can decide what to do then be careful warren said he stood stoically with his hands in the opposite sleeves of his robes and i dont just mean with yourself dont forget the things nathan and i have told you dont forget that everyone else is in danger from what you can do with the stone of tears i dont think you have yet reached your time of choosing ill do my best scarlet lowered herself so he could climb up onto her shoulders he gripped the blacktipped spines and hauled himself up richard gave a slap to a red scale to dhara my friend again with a roar of flame scarlet launched into the sky chapter in the distance in the predawn gloom he could see the green glow it rose from the peoples palace through the glass roof of the garden of life like a beacon richard had seen that color of green from only one place the underworld the icy wind tore at his clothes as scarlets wings beat with a steady cadence she had put strenuous effort into the flight to dhara she understood the danger posed by the keeper the underworld would take her too and she hated darken rahl he had stolen her egg before and used it to enslave her as she began her descent she peered back her ears turning toward him there will be enough time richard we can still make it to aydindril it is only just dawn i know youll get me there scarlet ill try not to give you too much time to rest scarlet banked to the left steepening their descent down toward the courtyard where they had been before it was a place the huge dragon could land in the dark with room to spare the palaces vast jumble of roofs and walls rushed up toward them with frightening speed richards toes tingled with the feeling of floating off her back as she plummeted suddenly from the darkness below a blinding flash of lightning crackled up all about them it left yellow lines of afterimage in his vision before richard could make sense of it another came scarlet roared in pain and pitched to the left they dropped into a sickening spiral toward the ground richard gripped her spines as the huge dragon tried to recover on the vast steps rotating below he saw the woman illuminated by the light of the next bolt of lightning she sent forth from her hands once again scarlet roared in pain he couldnt see the woman in the darkness when the lightning cut off scarlet struggled to check the uncontrolled descent richard knew that another bolt of the lightning would finish her he tore the bow from his back and yanked an arrow from the quiver scarlet make fire so i can see her as richard drew the string to his cheek scarlet let out a fiery roar of pain and anger in its red glow he saw the woman raise her arms again before he could call the target the spiral took her out of his line of sight scarlet look out scarlet drew back her right wing and they tipped the other way the yellow lightning streaked past to the left just missing them the ground was coming up fast in the flickering red light of the dragons blast of fire richard saw her raise her hands again he drew the bowstring and twisted his body with their motion to keep her in sight before she could disappear again he calledthe target the instant it came to him the arrow was away turn scarlet beat her right wing making them wobble in the air as the yellow bolt erupted past between the dragons neck and wing almost before it began the lightning cut off a ripple of total blackness passed over them the arrow had found its mark the keeper now had sister odette with a hard jolt they hit the ground richard was thrown off and tumbled across the ground he sat up and shook his head then sprang to his feet scarlet are you hurt bad are you alive go she groaned in a deep vibrating voice hurry get him before he has us all she held her trembling left wing out richard stroked her snout ill be back hang on richard drew the sword as he charged up the hill of steps he didnt need to call forth the anger it was with him before he had even touched the hilt he ran in a blind rage toward doors between the colossal columns as he ran through the doors a handful of soldiers charged out of the darkness without pause richard scythed into them his blade flashed in the torchlight coming from the vast halls inside richard danced with the spirits his blade was fluid grace among the hacking soldiers the first he cut in half breastplate and all every charge was met with swift steel in a matter of moments the fifteen men lay scattered across the bloody floor and then richard was moving again so much for his welcome back he remembered the dharan army pledging their loyalty to him the last time he had been here when he had killed darken rahl maybe they just didnt know who he was more likely they knew precisely who he was richard chose a hall that led in the direction of the garden of life three levels of balconies looked down on the hall most of the torches were dark he saw no people as he ran past a devotion square with white sand raked in circles around a pitted rock from a staircase at the side a halfdozen mordsith charged down running toward him each wore her red leather uniform and each had an agiel in her hand through the rage he realized that he couldnt use the sword on them or they would capture him by its magic he was furious he needed to get to darken rahl he didnt need to have to deal with these deadly women reluctantly richard sheathed his sword and drew his knife denna had told him once that if he had just used his knife instead of his sword he would have had her he was not going to be able to outrun them he was going to have to kill them the biggest a blondeheaded woman at the lead held her hands out as he went for her lord rahl no the other five slid to a stop behind her richard slashed at her but she lurched back into a half crouch with her hands held out to the sides lord rahl stop we are here to help you though he had put the sword away he had no shortage of rage of his own he had to get to darken rahl if he was to get to kahlan help me in the afterlife you will be there shortly no lord rahl i am cara we are here to help you you cannot go that way that hall is not secure richard stood panting knife in hand i dont believe you you want to capture me i know very well what mordsith do to their captives i knew denna your mistress you wear her agiel mord sith do not live to hurt their captives any longer you set us free we would never hurt the one who set us free we revere you when i left here i told the soldiers to burn all those outfits and give you new clothes i ordered the agiel taken from you if you revere me why have you not followed my orders a sly smile touched her lips as she lifted an eyebrow over a cold blue eye because you cannot free us just to enslave us in a life you choose we are free to choose for ourselves you made that possible we chose to fight to protect our lord rahl we have sworn to lay down our lives for you if necessary not only the men of the first file can protect you we have chosen to be your personal bodyguards not even the first file dared argue with us we take orders from no one but lord rahl then i order you to leave me alone im sorry lord rahl but we cannot follow that order richard didnt know what to believe this could just be a trap im here to stop darken rahl i have to get to the garden of life if you dont get out of my way i will have to kill you we know where you go cara said we will take you but you must not go that way we do not hold all the palace that way is not safe in fact this whole section of the palace is in the hands of the insurgents the first file would have lost a thousand men to come down here we told them we would go that it would be less risk to you for that reason only they agreed richard started angling around the women i dont believe you and i cant risk what you would do if you are lying this is too important if you try to stop me i will have to kill you if you go that way lord rahl you will die please let me whisper a secret message in your ear cara handed her agiel to a woman behind her you may hold your knife to me i am without a weapon richard gripped her hair in one fist and held the razorsharp knife to her throat if she so much as flinched he intended to cut her throat cara put her mouth close to his ear we are here to help you lord rahl she whispered it is the toasted toads truth richard straightened where did you hear such a thing do you know its meaning commander general trimack said that it is a coded message from first wizard zorander so that you would know we are loyal to you he told me to tell no one but you who is general trimack the commander general first file of the palace guard they are loyal to you the first file is the ring of steel around the lord rahl wizard zorander told general trimack to guard the garden of life at all cost two days ago that magic woman came she killed nearly three hundred of our men getting into the garden of life we tried to stop her but we could not we have no magic against her she killed close to a hundred on her way out tonight we followed her out and watched from a window on the third level we saw her send lightning to strike your dragon from the sky we saw you kill her only the true lord rahl could do that please lord rahl terrible things are happening in the garden of life let us take you there so you may stop the evil spirit richard had no time to waste they had to have gotten that message from zedd he had to trust them all right lets go but im in a hurry grins came to each woman cara took back her agiel and grabbed him by the shirt at one shoulder another of the mordsith gripped his shirt at the other shoulder they started running dragging him along with them cara whispered that he should be as quiet as possible the other four spread out in front scouting the way they took him quickly but silently through small side halls and dark rooms while the scouts slipped up narrow servants stairs cara and the other pressed him up against the wall crossing their lips with a finger waiting until they heard a short whistle then dashed up the stairs pulling him along by his shirt at the top of the stairs he nearly tripped over the body of one of the four mordsith who had gone ahead her face had been split open by a sword eight dharan men in armor were sprawled in contorted positions down the hall blood running from their ears richard recognized death caused by an agiel one of the women in red leather at the end of the hall motioned them onward cara pulled him around a corner where the woman pointed and up another staircase he felt like a sack of laundry the way they yanked him this way and that jamming him up against walls and in corners while others scouted a clear course he could hardly keep up with them as they ran down halls still gripping his shirt at each shoulder hauling him along richard lost track of where they were going as they went up stairs and through countless rooms a few of the rooms had windows and he could see that the sun was coming up richard was winded when he finally recognized the broad corridor they entered hundreds of men in uniforms of mail and shiny breastplates all dropped to a knee when they saw him the clatter of all their armor and weapons echoed down the wide hall every man put a fist over his heart when they came up one stepped forward lord rahl i am commander general trimack we are close to the garden of life i will lead you there i know where it is lord rahl you must hurry the rebel generals have launched an attack i dont know if we will be able to hold this position long but we will hold it to the last man while you are beyond thank you general just hold them off until i send that bastard darken rahl back to the underworld the general gave a salute of his fist to his heart as richard started moving he trotted down a polished granite hall he remembered it took him to the huge goldcovered doors to the garden of life nearly in a trance of rage richard burst through the doors into the garden the sun was up its first rays lit the treetops in the garden richard marched down the path past the short vinecovered walls and out onto the grass in the center of the garden was a circle of white sand sorcerers sand the round skrin bone sat in the center with complicated lines drawn in the sand that encircled it beyond was the altar with the three boxes of orden the gateway to another world each was beyond black seeming as if it would suck the light from the room from the opened box a shaft of green light poured forth up through the glass roof and into the sky whatever darken rahl had been doing was opening the gateway sparkling light blue yellow and red spiraled around the shaft of green light the white glowing form of darken rahl watched him stride across the grass richard stopped before the circle of sorcerers sand opposite him a small smile spread on darken rahls lips welcome my son came the hiss of his voice richard felt the scar of the handprint heat on his chest he ignored the pain of it darken rahls glowing blue eyes moved to the stone of tears hanging from richards neck darken rahls gaze locked on richards i have spawned a great wizard we would like you to join with us richard richard said nothing he seethed with wrath as he watched darken rahls smile widen through the fury of anger the pounding wrath of magic he watched and he sought the calm center too we can offer you what no other can richard what the creator himself cannot offer we are greater than the creator we would like you to join with us what could you possibly offer me darken rahl spread his glowing arms immortality richard was too angry to laugh when did you succumb to the delusion that i would believe anything you would have to say it is true richard he whispered we have the power to grant it just because you managed to get some of the sisters to believe your lies that does not mean i would we are the keeper of the underworld we control life and death we have the power to grant either especially to one of your magic you can be the master of the world of life as i would have been before you interfered not interested got anything better to offer darken rahls cruel smile widened his eyebrows lifted oh yes my son he hissed oh yes he swept his hand out over the circle of sand shimmering light formed into a person kneeling forward the light coalesced into a recognizable form kahlan she was in her white confessors dress kneeling forward her hair was cut short just as in the vision he had had in the tower a tear fell from her closed eyes as the side of her face pressed to the block she mouthed his name and that she loved him richards heart pounded violently the dragon is wounded richard she cannot take you to aydindril your time has run out you have no option left but to let us help you what do you mean help rahls smile returned i told you we have the power over life and death without our help this afternoon before her people this is what will happen his glowing hand swept out again the blades broad edge glinted in the air above her the axe descended thunking into the wooden block sending out a spray of blood richard flinched kahlans head tumbled away bright red blood spread beneath her soaking into the sand into the white dress as her body toppled to the side noooo richard screamed his fists at his sides noooo darken rahl swept his hand over the body and it vanished into sparkling light and faded away just as i have taken away the vision of what will happen this day we can stop the reality we can offer immortality not only to you but if you join with us to her too richard stood stunned it sank in really sank in for the first time scarlet was wounded she could not fly him to aydindril this was winter solstice kahlan was going to die this day and he had no way of getting to her his breath came in ragged gasps the world was ending for him this was the meaning of the prophecy if he took this offer if he chose to stop her death then the world would end for everyone else he thought of chase taking rachel home to meet her new mother he thought of all the happiness she would have in that life with love around her he thought of his own life with his father and mother of the love the happy times together even the not so happy times and how much it had meant to him he thought about the time he had spent with kahlan and the joy of being in love with her and all the other people who must have had such joy and would in the future if there was a future you can walk hand in hand with her richard forever richards eyes came up from the white sand hand in hand through the ashes of death forever what would it do to kahlan to her love for him if he offered her such a selfish destiny she would be horrified then whenever she looked at him she truly would see a monster forever he would live forever with her revulsion not her love thus in trying to save her he would destroy not only everyone else but her heart too the price was too high even for his love but this would end his life his love too richard was consumed with rage and calm at the same time he stared into the glowing eyes of evil you would poison our love with your taint of hate you dont even know the meaning of love the wrath swelled to a wild storm within him at least he would extract his price for this his vengeance richard lifted the stone of tears in his fist darken rahl staggered back a step richard think about what you are doing you will pay for this richard pulled a handful of black sorcerers sand from his pocket and cast it onto the circle of white sand darken rahl threw his arms open no you fool the white sand writhed as if alive as if in pain the symbols drawn in it twisted contorting around themselves the ground shook steaming fissures raced across the grassy ground lightning flared up from the sparkling white sand flicking about the garden of life the room thundered with a riot of noise and blinding light the sorcerers sand melted into a liquid pool of blue fire the air shuddered with violent concussions darken rahl shook his fists to the sky no his head came down and when he saw richard coming slowly toward him the stone of tears held out in his fist he went still his hand came up in forbidding richard staggered to a stop the pain of the scar on his chest taking his breath the agony seared through him from deep within he pulled resolve and made himself move despite the torment each step only increased the pain it felt as if his flesh were burning off his bones and the marrow itself were boiling in the calm at the center of the storm of anger he was able to ignore it richard pulled the stone of tears off over his head he held the leather thong out in his hands the stone dangling before darken rahls face rahl shrank back you will wear this in the depths of death forever richard stepped closer kneel the glowing form sank to its knees the glowing eyes stayed on the stone in the air above richard lowered the leather thong to hang it over the head of his fathers spirit he paused over darken rahls head behind him he saw the altar that held the boxes the open one in the center alive with things beyond knowing was sending its green light upward in a beacon richard remembered what ann nathan and warren had told him if he used the stone for selfish reasons for hate it would tear the veil he wanted more than anything to send darken rahl to the depths of the underworld to punish him forever for what he had done but that would only accomplish what he had already decided was beyond price besides he had brought this on himself that he had not done it intentionally made no difference life was not fair it simply existed if you accidentally stepped on a poison snake you got bitten intentions were irrelevant i have caused my own grief richard whispered i must suffer the consequences of my own actions i cannot make others pay for what i have caused intentionally or not richard hung the stone of tears back around his own neck darken rahl came to his feet in alarm richard you dont know what youre saying punish me hang the stone around my neck have your vengeance richard turned partway toward the center of the garden of life and held out his hand the round skrin bone in the pool of blue fire hurtled to his palm his magic protected him he held the skrin bone up high in the grip of rage in the grip of calm he called the power onward it erupted from his fist lightning yellow and hot shot forth into darken rahl lightning black and cold shot forth into darken rahl they twisted together in the unleashed wrath of the skrin a ripple of total darkness swept across the room and when it lifted the lightning and darken rahl were gone the skrin bone felt cool in his fist the green light from the box glowed brighter making the room hum richard pulled the stone of tears from his neck the leather thong fell away as the stone turned to black in his palm richard thrust out his hand the stone of tears flew to the green light floating in it a moment rotating in the beam the green light faded as the stone of tears sank toward the box becoming transparent until it passed from existence the beacon of green light vanished plunging the garden of life into silence richard held the skrin bone out in his fist and once again the twin lightning erupted thundering across the distance flashes of whitehot light and icecold blackness washed over him when it ended and silence rang in his ears once more the three boxes sat on the altar each was closed richard knew they could not be opened again without the book and the book existed only in his head the boxes of orden and the gateway they represented would remain closed for all time richard heard a metallic snap he felt something brush at his neck felt something fall at his feet he looked down to see the collar the radahan on the ground it was off his neck he was free of it the pain too was gone he felt his chest the scar was gone in the silence richard stood dazed he wasnt sure what had just happened he didnt know how he had done it it was over for him everything was over kahlan was going to die this day and then he was running the day wasnt over yet as he emerged from the doors of the garden of life the five mordsith surrounded him he ignored them as he ran in the corridor beyond a sweaty dirty general trimack waited with hundreds of men just as grimylooking many were bloody with a cacophony of clanging armor and weapons the men as far as he could see down the smoky corridor fell to their knees fists clapped to hearts general trimack returned to his feet as he took three long strides toward richard cara moved protectively in front of him get out of my way woman cara didnt budge no one touches lord rahl im his protection just as much as stop it both of you cara relaxed and stepped to the side general trimack gripped richard by the shoulders lord rahl youve done it it took a long time but you did it done what what do you mean it took a long time his eyebrows lifted youve been in there most of the day richards breath faltered what we fought them fiercely for hours but we were being pushed back we were outnumbered ten or fifteen to one then you sent the lightning ive never seen anything like it wizard zorander told me that the palace is a huge power spell drawn on the ground of the plateau drawn to protect and give power to the lord rahl i never would have believed it until i saw it myself the whole of the palace was alive with lightning it flickered through every wall in the place every one of the those bastard generals who was loyal to darken rahl was cut down by the lightning their troops who fought on were ripped apart by it too those who laid down their weapons and joined us were unharmed richard didnt know what to say im glad general but i cant take credit i was in there the whole time im not even sure what i did in there much less what happened out here we are the steel against steel you did your part you were the lord rahl the magic against magic we are all proud of you general trimack gave richard a clap on the shoulder whatever you did you must have chosen right richard put his fingers to his forehead trying to think what time is it like i said you were in there most of the day while we fought out here its near to late afternoon richard clutched at his chest i have to go he started running everyone charged off after him before long he was confused by the huge converging halls he slid to a stop on the slick marble floor and turned to cara at his hip which way to where lord rahl where i came in the fastest way follow us lord rahl richard ran behind the five mordsith behind him came what seemed to be the entire army of the palace the racket of all the armor and boots echoed off the walls and ceilings high overhead columns arches staircases devotion squares and intersections of halls flew past they raced down halls and down stairs richard was winded when nearly an hour later he went through the doors between the giant columns and out into the cold air soldiers poured out behind he ran down the steps four at a time scarlet lay on her side in the snow the glossy red scales rising and falling with her labored breathing scarlet youre still alive richard rubbed her snout i was so worried richard i see you have managed to survive it must not have been as difficult as you thought she struggled to give a dragons grin it faded im sorry my friend but i cannot fly my wing is injured i tried but until it is healed im afraid im stuck on the ground richard shed a tear on her snout i understand my friend you got me here you saved the world of life you are a heroine more noble than any in history will you be all right will you be able to fly again she managed a weak laugh i will fly again but not for a month or so i will recover it is not so bad as it seems richard turned to the officers behind scarlet is my friend she has saved us all i want you to bring her food whatever she needs until she is recovered protect her as you would me fists went to hearts richard grabbed the generals arm i need a horse a strong horse right now and i need to know how to get to aydindril the general turned get a strong horse now you go get maps to aydindril for lord rahl men started running richard turned back to the dragon im so sorry youre suffering scarlet scarlets chuckle rumbled deep in her throat the injury is not so painful look over there around the side her head at the end of her long neck followed him around richard was astonished to see an egg nestled in a crook of her tail a big yellow eye peered at him i just gave birth that is most of my weakness just as well im to be aground she played fire over the egg tenderly she stroked her talons over it as richard watched he thought about the beauty of life and how happy he was that others could continue to have it but the vision of the falling axe kept playing over and over in his head he couldnt stop the horror of it his hands shook it could be happening at that very moment his breathing came in ragged pulls at last a man came running with a map he held it out and pointed here lord rahl is aydindril this is the fastest route but it will still take you several weeks richard stuffed the map in his shirt as another soldier galloped up on the horse richard retrieved his pack and bow from the snow where they had fallen when scarlet had come to ground general trimack held the reins to the muscular horse while richard quickly lashed his things to the saddle there is food in the saddlebags when will you return lord rahl richards mind was in a fog racing in a thousand directions at once all he could see was the axe falling he leapt up into the saddle i dont know when i can carry on until then and continue to guard the garden of life dont let anyone go in there safe return lord rahl our hearts are with you fists went to chests as he urged the powerful horse into a gallop and charged at full speed through the huge gates that stood open for him chapter richard cursed under his breath when the horse dropped dead under him he picked himself up when he had stopped rolling through the snow and started pulling his things off the lifeless lathered beast he felt an ache of sorrow for the horse it had given him everything it had he had lost count of how many horses had died under him some simply stumbled to a stop and refused to move anymore some dropped to a walk and would run no more some gave everything until their hearts quit richard had known he was being too hard on them and had tried to pace them but he simply could not bring himself to go slow enough when a horse died or quit running he managed to find another some owners were reluctant to sell thinking they would haggle with him richard threw a fistful of gold at them and took the horse he was near dead with exhaustion himself he had slept and eaten little sometimes he had walked while his mount recovered when he had had to find a new horse he had run richard hoisted the pack onto his back and started trotting off it had been two weeks since he had left dhara he knew he had to be close to aydindril the fact that it was two weeks past winter solstice somehow didnt seem as important as his rush to reach kahlan it somehow seemed to him that if he could hurry fast enough it would save her that if he put in his best effort it would somehow make time wait for him he could not accept that he was too late he came to a panting halt at the top of a rise in the road ahead in the sparkling sunlight lay aydindril on the wall of mountains to the far side of the city he could see the gray walls of the wizards keep richard ran on through the snow the streets were crowded with people people hurrying through the cold afternoon air and people standing about stomping their feet to keep warm as they hawked their wares richard rushed past them all when he saw people were staring at him because of the sword of truth he pulled the mriswith cape over it a hawker ahead stood by the side ofthe road with a short pole resting on the ground it had a crossbar with wispy strips hanging from it when richard realized what the man was calling out he came out of his mental fog with a jolt confessors hair the man bellowed get a lock of the mother confessors hair right off her vile head dont have many left show your children the hair of the last confessor richards eyes locked on the long hair it was kahlans he swept the lot of it off the pole and stuffed it in his shirt when the man thought to fight for it richard slammed him up against the wall he gripped the mans shirt in his fists and lifted him clear of the ground where did you get this the the council bought it from them to sell bought it fair after they cut it from her it belongs to me he shouted for help thief thief when an angry crowd pressed in to defend the man the sword came out people scattered the hawker ran for his life richards fury was building despite his putting the sword away as he headed for the confessors palace he saw it rising up on the vast grounds ahead heremembered kahlan telling him how magnificent it was he knew it almost as if he had seen it before he remembered too kahlan telling him about a woman there a cook no the head cook what was her name sand something sanderholt that was it mistress sanderholt the aroma of cooking led him to the kitchen entrance he charged through the door a roomful of working people shrank back at the sight of him it was obvious that no one wanted any part of whatever he was about sanderholt he called out mistress sanderholt where is she people nervously pointed to a hallway before he had gone more than a dozen strides down the hall a thin woman came rushing from the other direction whats the trouble whos calling me i am richard said her frown withered to a look of consternation what is it i can do for you young man she said in an uneasy voice richard worked at keeping threat out of his tone he didnt think he was very successful kahlan where can i find her her face turned nearly as white as her apron you would be richard she told me of you you look like she said yes where is she mistress sanderholt swallowed im sorry richard she whispered the council sentenced her to death the sentence was carried out at the winter solstice festival richard stood staring down at the thin woman he was having difficulty deciding if they were talking about the same person i think you misunderstood he managed i mean the mother confessor mother confessor kahlan amnell you must be talking about someone else my kahlan cant be dead i came as fast as i could i swear i did her eyes were filling with tears she tried to blink them away as she stared up at him slowly she shook her head she put a bandaged hand to his side come richard you look as if you could use a meal let me get you bowl of soup richard dropped his pack bow and quiver to the floor the central council sentenced her to death she gave a weak nod she escaped but was caught the central council reiterated the sentence before the people at the behead at the execution and then the members of the council all stood smiling while the people cheered them maybe she escaped again shes a resourceful woman i was there she said in a broken voice tears running down her face please dont make me tell you what i saw ive known kahlan since she was born i loved her maybe there was a way to go back somehow and get here in time there had to be a way he felt hot and dizzy no he was too late kahlan was dead he had had to let her die to stop the keeper the prophecy had beaten him richard gritted his teeth where is the council at last she managed to take her eyes from him she pointed a bandaged hand down the hall and gave him directions she turned back please richard i loved her too nothing can be done now you can accomplish nothing but he was already moving the mriswith cape flying behind as he swept down the hall he saw only enough of what was around him as he moved swiftly along to follow the directions she had given him he moved toward the council chambers the way his arrows flew to the target when he called it guards were everywhere but he paid them no heed he had no idea if they paid him any nor did he care he flew singlemindedly toward his target he heard the movement of menatarms around him in the side halls he barely noted them on the balconies at the end of a columnlined hall stood the doors to the council room as he marched down the hall men moved in front of the doors he only dimly noticed them he saw only the doors his sword still hadnt left its scabbard at his hip but the magic was coursing through him at full fury the soldiers closed rank before the doors he didnt slow the black cape billowing open his brow set in a glare as he charged ahead they made their move to stop him richard marched on he wanted them out of his way the power came by instinct without conscious effort he felt the concussion in his peripheral vision he saw blood hit the white marble without missing a stride he emerged from the ball of flame in a gaping hole twice the size the doorway had been huge chunks of stone hurtled through the air trailing smoke debris rained down about him one of the doors spiraled through the air in an arc the other spun like a top as it skittered across the floor of the council chamber along with ragged pieces of armor and shattered weapons at the far end of the room men behind a curved desk rose angrily to their feet as he advanced relentlessly onward richard drew the sword the unique sound of steel rang in the huge room i am supreme councilor thurstan the one in the center at the tallest chair said i demand to know the meaning of this intrusion richard was still coming be there one of you who did not vote to sentence the mother confessor to death she was sentenced to death for treason legally and unanimously sentenced by this council guards remove this man men came running across the vast floor but richard had already closed on the dais the councilors drew knives richard leapt to the top of the desk with a scream of rage the blade cleaved thurstan in two from ear to crotch a swing to each side took off heads several of the men tried to stab him they werent close to fast enough the sword found every robed figure including the ones who tried to run it was over in seconds before the guards had made half the distance richard leapt back atop the desk he stood in the grip of unbridled wrath holding the sword in both hands he waited for them to come he wanted them to come i am the seeker these men have murdered the mother confessor they have paid the price of murder decide if you wish to be on the side of dead cutthroats or on the side of right the ring of men slowed their advance looking tentatively to one another finally they stopped richard stood panting one man looked back at the hole in the wall where the doors had been and then glanced over the debris scattered across the floor you are a wizard richard met the mans eyes yes i guess i am the man sheathed his sword this is wizards business its not our place to challenge wizards ill not die for something thats not my place another sheathed his weapon soon the room rang with the clatter of steel being returned to hangers and scabbards they began leaving the room echoing with the sound of their boots in a matter of moments the vast council chamber was empty but for richard he sprang down from the desk and stared at the tall chair in the center it was about the only thing not dripping with gore that would have been the mother confessors chair kahlans chair she would have sat in that chair woodenly richard sheathed the sword it was over he had done everything there was to do the good spirits had deserted him they had deserted kahlan he had sacrificed everything to see right done and the good spirits had done nothing to help to the keeper with the good spirits richard dropped to his knees he thought about the sword of truth it had magic he decided that he couldnt count on it working for what he needed now instead he drew the knife at his belt he had done everything there was to do richard put the point of the knife to his chest with cold precision he looked down to make sure it was pointed at his heart kahlans hair the hair he had taken from the hawker stuck from his shirt richard pulled the lock she had given him from his pocket she had given it to him to remind him she would always love him he wanted only to end his uncontrollable agony she is awake prince harold said she is asking for you kahlan finally pulled her gaze from the flames in the hearth she darted a cool glance at the wizard sitting next to adie on a wooden bench though zedd had recovered his memory adie had not she still thought of herself as elda and was still blind kahlan crossed the dark dining hall when they had arrived the inn had been deserted as had the rest of the town for fear of the advance of the keltish forces the empty town was a good place to rest in their run from aydindril two weeks on the run had left them all in need of a rest and a little warmth a week out of aydindril their little company zedd adie ahern jebra chandalen orsk and kahlan had been intercepted by a small force led by prince harold prince harold and a handful of his men had escaped the slaughter of his forces in aydindril and had lain in wait when queen cyrilla was taken out to be beheaded he made a daring raid and in the confusion of people come to see the execution he snatched his sister from the axeman four days after joining with prince harold they encountered captain ryan and his remaining nine hundred men they had wiped out the imperial order to a man it had cost them dearly but they had carried out their mission even her pride in them failed to rally her spirits though she refused to betray that to those men after she wrung out a cloth in the basin kahlan sat on the edge of her half sisters bed cyrilla was aware as she was from time to time though she always slipped back into the dazed stupor before long when she was in that state she saw nothing heard nothing and said nothing she simply stared kahlan was heartened to see her tears now as it meant she was awake when she was alert only kahlan could talk to her the sight of men sent her either into a screaming fit or back into a stupor cyrilla clutched kahlans arm as kahlan wiped the cool cloth over her brow kahlan have you thought about what i said kahlan pulled the cloth back i dont want to be the queen of galea you are the queen my sister please kahlan our people need a leader i am not fit to do it now she clutched her hand tighter to kahlans arm tears poured forth kahlan you must do this for me for them kahlan wiped the tears with the cloth cyrilla things will turn out well you will see she clutched a fist over her belly i cannot lead now cyrilla i understand i do though they did not do to me what they did to you i was in that pit i understand but you will recover yourself you will i promise and you will be the queen for our people if i agree it would only be temporary only until you have regained your strength no she moaned she sobbed hiding her face against the pillow dont please dear spirits help me no and then she was gone again gone into the visions she went limp still as death staring up at the ceiling kahlan kissed her cheek prince harold waited in the darkness outside the door how is my sister the same im afraid but have faith she will recover kahlan you must do as she asks she is the queen why cant you be king that would make more sense i must fight on for our people for all the midlands i cannot devote myself to the struggle if im burdened with concern over being king too im a soldier and i wish to serve in the way i know it is what i was meant to do you are an amnell daughter to king wyborn you must be the queen of galea kahlan started to flip her long hair back over her shoulder but it wasnt there it was hard to forget the habits of a lifetime to remember that her hair was chopped short i will think on it she said as she started off she stood once more before the fireplace the only source of light in the dining hall staring into the flames watching the once living things turn to ash everyone avoided her and left her to herself after a time she realized zedd was standing beside her she was only now beginning to get used to him in those fancy robes he held his cup out why dont you have a sip of spiced tea she didnt look up from the flames no thank you he rolled the cup in his palms kahlan you cant go on blaming yourself it is not your fault you wear lies poorly wizard i saw the look in your eyes when i told you what i had done remember ive explained that to you you know i was under the spell cast by the three sorceresses and only great emotional shock could break it anger could do the task but once anger is brought on it must be allowed to rage uncontrolled if it is to break the spell i have told you how sorry i am for what i did to you i saw the look in your eyes you wanted to kill me he watched from under his eyebrows i had to do that mother confessor kahlan i told you i am no longer the mother confessor call yourself what you will but you are who you are denying the name does not make it so and as i told you i had to do that too to bring on a death spell the person to be spelled has to be convinced they are to die or it will not work once the anger brought back my memory i knew i had to use a death spell so i simply used what was happening to do what had to be done it was an act of desperation had i not done it in that way people would not have believed they saw you beheaded kahlan shuddered at the memory of that magic as long as she lived she would never forget the chill touch of the death spell you should have used magic to destroy that council of evil instead you should have saved me by killing those men and then everyone would have known you were still alive everyone there was under the madness of hate had i done that then we would have had the entire army and tens of thousands of people chasing after us this way no one chases us we can now proceed with what must be done you can proceed i have quit the cause of the good spirits kahlan you know what would happen if we were to give up it was you yourself last autumn who came to westland to find me and tell me that very thing you helped convince me that if we abandon the side of magic of right of helping those who are powerless then the enemy is handed an uncontested victory the spirits saw fit to leave me without help they stood by as i delivered richard into the hands of the sisters of the light they let me hurt him let him be taken from me forever the good spirits have chosen their side and it is not with me it is not the good spirits job to govern the world of the living it is our job the job of the living to tend our own world tell it to someone who cares you care you just dont realize it at the moment ive lost richard too but i know that i cannot allow that to deter me from right do you think richard would love you if you were really the kind of person who could abandon those who needed your help she said nothing so he pressed the attack richard loves you partly because of your passion for life he loves you because you fight for it with everything you have with the same ardor as his you have already proven that he was the only thing i ever wanted out of life the only thing i asked the good spirits for and look what i have done to him he thinks i betrayed him i made him put a collar around his neck the thing he feared more than death i am not fit to help anyone i only bring harm kahlan you have magic i have told you magic must not be allowed to die the world of life needs magic if magic is extinguished all life will be impoverished and could even be destroyed no one knows about the forces we have we will go to ebinissia no one will expect that and pull the midlands forces together from there to strike back against them no one will know we have brought ebinissia back from the ashes of death all right if it will still your tongue i will be the queen but only until cyrilla is better the fire crackled and popped zedd spoke in quiet admonition you know that is not what i mean mother confessor kahlan said nothing she bit the inside of her cheek to keep from crying she would not let him see her cry the wizards of old created the confessors you have unique magic it has elements to it that no other magic has not even mine kahlan you are the last confessor your magic must not be allowed to die with you richard is lost to us thats the way it is we must go on life and magic must go on you must take a mate and give the world that magic into the future still she stared into the flames kahlan he whispered you must do it to prove richards love and faith in you slowly she turned to the room behind orsk sat crosslegged on the floor beside chandalen only he looked at her with his one eye the scar across the other looking white and angry in the firelight he watched every move she made everyone else in the room tried to appear furiously engaged in their own business orsk she called the huge man sprang to his feet and crossed the room he stood hunched before her waiting word whether he was to fetch her a cup of tea or kill someone orsk go up to my room and wait for me yes mistress after he had bounded up the stairs she slowly crossed the room she could hear the bed creak when he sat on it to wait as she put her hand to the newel post zedd put his over it stopping her mother confessor it does not have to be him you can surely find one more suited to your likes it makes no difference i have already touched him with my power why harm another for no more than this kahlan im not saying it has to be now not this soon i am saying only that you must come to accept it and at some point it must be today tomorrow next year what does it matter it will be the same in ten years as it is today wizards have been using the confessors for thousands of years why should i be any different i may as well get it over so you will be content his watery gaze stayed on hers kahlan its not like that this is the hope of life she felt a tear roll down her cheek she could see the pain in his eyes but she showed him no mercy for it call it what you will that does not change what it is it is rape my enemies could not accomplish it it took my friends to rape me i know dear one how well i know she started up the stairs again but his hand on her arm stopped her kahlan please do just one thing for me first go for a little walk to think things over and ask the spirits for guidance pray to the good spirits seek their direction i have nothing to say to the good spirits it is they who wish this they have sent you to give me guidance his thin hand stroked her shortcropped hair then do it for richard she stood staring at him finally she glanced out the back door to the small frozen garden at the back of the inn it was just dusk outside kahlan stepped down for richard chapter richard sat in kahlans tall chair stroking the long locks of her hair he had pulled them out of his shirt not wanting to stab himself through her hair he didnt know how long he had been sitting there touching her hair lost in memories of her but he noticed it was just turning dark out the windows richard laid the hair carefully over the arm of the chair and picked up the knife once more in a daze of anguish he put the point to his heart his knuckles were white around the handle it was time at last it was going to be over the pain would end his brow creased what was it mistress sanderholt had said kahlan had told her of him he wondered if kahlan had told mistress sanderholt anything else maybe a last message for him before she died what could it hurt to ask he could die then richard pulled mistress sanderholt from her kitchen into a small pantry lined with stores he closed the door what have you done richard i killed her murderers well i cant say im sorry about that those men did not belong on the council let me get you something to eat no i dont want anything mistress sanderholt you said kahlan told you of me is that right she didnt look like she wished to dredge up the memories but at last she took a deep breath and nodded she came home but things had changed here kelton had i dont care what happened here just tell me about kahlan prince fyren was murdered she was convicted wrongly of that crime and a whole list of others including treason the wizard in charge sentenced her to be executed beheaded richard said she gave a reluctant nod she escaped with the help of some of her friends killing the wizard in so doing then went into hiding but she got word to me and i visited her at those visits she told me of all the things she had been through she told me all about you she liked to talk of no thing more why didnt she escape why didnt she run she said she had to wait for a wizard named zedd to help you richards eyes closed as pain tightened in his chest and so they caught her while she waited no thats not how it happened richard stared at the grain patterns on the wood floor while she went on the wizard she waited for returned he is the one who turned her in richards head came up what zedd came here zedd wouldnt turn kahlan over to be executed her back stiffened turn her in he did he stood on the platform before the cheering crowd and ordered it done i watched as that vile man gave the nod to the axeman richards mind spun in confusion zedd a skinny old man with long wavy white hair sticking out in every direction that is he first wizard zeddicus zul zorander for the first time a spark of hope ignited in him he didnt know everything about zedd but he did know him capable of similar things could it be he grabbed her by her shoulders where is she buried mistress sanderholt took him out into the dusk to the secluded courtyard where confessors were buried she told him that kahlans body had been burned in a funeral pyre supervised by the first wizard then she left him to be alone with the immense marker stone over her ashes richard ran his fingers over the letters carved in the gray granite kahlan amnell mother confessor she is not here but in the hearts of those who loved her she is not here he said aloud quoting from the marker could it be a message could she be alive had it been a trick by zedd to save her life why would he do it maybe maybe to keep them from chasing after her richard fell to his knees in the snow before the monument dare he hope just to have his hopes crushed he put his trembling hands together and bowed his head dear spirits i know i have done wicked things but i have always tried to do right i have fought to help people and to uphold your principles of honesty and right please dear spirits help me ive never prayed to you in earnest for anything before not like this ive never meant anything like this before please if you never again help me help me this one time please dear spirits i cant go on if i dont know ive given up everything to see right done please grant me this let me know if she is alive his head hanging tears dripping from his face he saw flickers of light on the ground before him richard looked up a glowing spirit towered over him when he recognized who it was he went rigid kahlan had walked around the garden countless times part of her hesitation was dread that she might be granted confirmation of her fear finally she she knelt down and folded her hands together on a rock before her she bowed her head dear spirits i know i am not worthy but please grant this i must know if richard is all right if he still loves me she swallowed back the burning sensation in her throat i must know if i will ever see him again i have been disrespectful i know and i have no excuse but my own failing as a good person if you grant me this i will do whatever the good spirits require of me but please dear spirits i must know if i will ever see my richard again her head hung as he cried tears dripped from her face before her on the ground flickers of light danced kahlan looked up into the face of the glowing spirit towering over her she felt the warmth of the calm smile from the face she knew slowly involuntarily kahlan rose to her feet is it really you yes kahlan it is i denna but you went to the keeper you took the mark darken rahl put on richard you went to the keeper in richards place the glowing smile of peace swelled kahlans heart with joy the keeper was repulsed by what i had done he rejected me i went instead to be with what you think of as the good spirits in much the same way that what i did earned me peace i never expected the sacrifices you and richard have selflessly made for others and each other have merited the granting of this peace to the two of you because you each possess both sides of the magic and are linked to me by deeds before i pass beyond the veil i am empowered to bring you together for a brief time in a place between the worlds denna draped in long flowing robes spread her arms wide the luminous folds hung from her arms all the way to the ground come child come into my arms and i will take you to richard trembling kahlan stepped under dennas outstretched arm richard stood under the illumination of dennas arm as it came tenderly around him the world vanished into the radiance he didnt know what to expect only that he wanted to see kahlan more than life itself the overpowering white blaze dimmed to a mellow glow kahlan appeared before him she gasped and then threw herself into his arms she wailed his name as she clutched him they embraced without words just feeling the presence of each other he felt her warmth her breathing her quaking he didnt want to ever let her go they sank to the soft support under them he didnt know what it was and he didnt care it was solid enough to hold them he wanted her arms around him forever she finally stopped weeping and put her head against his shoulder as he held her tight at last she looked up to his face her beautiful green eyes gazing deeply into his richard im so sorry i made you put that collar around your richard put his ringer to her lips it was all for a reason it took me time to understand how foolish i was being and how brave you are that is all that matters it makes me love you all the more because you sacrificed your own needs to save me she shook her head my richard how did you get here i prayed to the good spirits denna came me too denna made a sacrifice for you too she took the power of the mark so you would live denna gave your life back to me she is at peace now i know he ran his hand down her head down her short hair what happened to your hair a wizard cut it off a wizard well then i guess a wizard will have to restore it to you richard ran his hand lovingly down her hair he remembered the way zedd had stroked his hand down his own jaw to make his beard grow it seemed as if from having seen zedd do it he knew how to do it too with each stroke of his hand her hair lengthened richard continued to pull from the calm center within him and her hair continued to lengthen when it was the same as before he stopped kahlan lifted a long lock of her hair looking at it in wonder richard how did you do that i have the gift remember she beamed with her special smile the smile of sharing she gave no other kahlan ran her hand down his cheek im sorry richard but i dont like your beard i like you the way you were before he lifted an eyebrow really well then since we set you back to right we will just have to do the same for me too richard drew his hand down his jaw again pulling the power from the calm center kahlan gasped in astonishment richard its gone your beard is gone you made it vanish how did you do that i have the gift for both sides of the magic she blinked in surprise subtractive magic richard is any of this real or am i just dreaming it and then he kissed her long and deep feels real to me he said breathlessly richard im afraid youre with the sisters i will never again be able to be with you i cant go on if you are going to be taken from im not with the sisters im in aydindril aydindril he nodded i left the palace of the prophets sister verna helped me then i had to go to dhara richard told her everything that had happened since he had left her and she told him all she had been through richard could hardly believe the things she had done im so proud of you he said you truly are the mother confessor you are the greatest mother confessor that ever lived go back to the hall before the council chambers and you will see big paintings of confessors who were greater than i will ever be that my love i doubt he kissed her again a hot passionate kiss she kissed him back desperately as if she needed nothing so much from life as to be in his arms kissing him he kissed her cheek her ears and her neck she moaned against him richard is the scar darken rahls mark really gone he pulled his shirt open to show her her hand stroked his chest its really true she whispered tenderly she kissed his chest she ran her hand over him kissing where it had been she gave a sucking kiss to his nipple not fair he said breathlessly i get to kiss anything on you that you kiss on me kahlan looked him in the eye as she unbuttoned her shirt bargain struck she started pulling at his clothes as he trailed wet kisses down her soft flesh her breathing quickened with each kahlan he managed to say as he pulled away the good spirits may be watching us she pushed him onto his back and kissed him if they truly are good spirits they will turn their backs the feel of her warm flesh made his head spin the feel of the shape of her made him moan with need around them the mellow glow pulsed with their breathing it seemed to be an extension of their heat richard rolled over on top of her he gazed down into her green eyes i love you kahlan amnell now and always and i you my richard as they pressed their lips together she wrapped her arms around his neck and her soft legs around his in the void between worlds in the soft glow of a timeless place they were one chapter kahlan strolled back into the inn she stood in the shadows at the end of the hall leading into the dining room she still felt the glow the warmth the mindnumbing joy and fulfillment everyone looked up when they heard her footsteps zedd shot to his feet kahlan bags girl where have you been all night its just turning to dawn youve been missing since dusk weve been searching the town all night for you where did you go she turned and held her hand out to the little garden out back zedd stormed across the room you were not in the garden she smiled dreamily well that was where i went but i left that place i went to be with richard zedd he escaped from the sisters he is in aydindril zedd slowed to a stop kahlan i know you have had a hard time of it but you have simply had a vision of something you wished no zedd i prayed to the good spirits she came and took me to richard to be with him in a place between the worlds kahlan that is simply not kahlan stepped out of the shadows into the firelight zedds eyes went wide what what happened to your hair the wizard whispered its long again kahlan grinned richard made it right he has the gift you know she held out the agiel hanging from her neck he gave me this he said he doesnt need it anymore but there has to be some other explanation he gave me a message to give to you he said to thank you for not closing the opened box of orden he said he was glad his grandfather was wise enough not to violate the wizards second rule his grandfather tears ran down his wrinkled face you saw him you really saw him richard is safe she threw her arms around him yes zedd everything is going to be all right now he restored the stone of tears to where it belongs and closed the box of orden he called it the gateway he said it takes both additive and subtractive magic to do it or it would have destroyed all life he gripped her shoulders and held her out richard has subtractive magic impossible he had a beard and made it vanish he said to remind you of the lesson you gave him that only subtractive could do that wonder of wonders his sharp features came closer youre all in a lather girl he put a sticklike hand to her forehead you dont have a fever why are you sweating it was hot in that other world quite hot he peered at her hair you hair is all tangled what kind of wizard would grow hair back all tangled i would have grown it back straight that boy has a lot to learn he didnt do it right kahlans eyes went out of focus believe me he did it right he turned his head appraising her with one eye what were you doing all night youve been gone the whole night what have you two been doing kahlan could feel her ears heat she was glad she had long hair again well i dont know what do you and adie do when you are alone together all night zedd straightened well he cleared his throat well we he lifted his chin and pointed a finger skyward we talk thats what we do we talk kahlan shrugged thats what we did too just like you and adie do all night we talked a sly grin stole onto his face he hugged her tightly in his thin arms patting her back im so happy for you dear one zedd took her hands in his and danced around the room ahern smiled and pulled out a little flute playing a bouncy tune my grandson is a wizard my grandson will be a great wizard just like his grandfather the celebration went on for a few minutes with everyone joining in the laughing they all clapped in time with the tune as zedd danced with her around the room kahlan saw one person not joining in adie sat in a rocking chair in the corner she had a small sad smile on her face as she turned her ear to follow them she went to the old woman and knelt before her kahlan took up her frail hands i be happy for you child adie said adie kahlan said in a soft voice the spirits sent a message for you she shook her head regretfully i be sorry child but it would mean nothing to me i not remember being this woman adie i promised to deliver the message its important to one beyond that you have it will you hear the message tell me then though i be sorry i wont know its meaning its a message from one named pell the room was silent behind her adies rocking came to a halt she straightened the littlest bit her eyes filled with tears adies hands tightened around kahlans from pell a message from my pell yes adie he wants you to know that he loves you and that he is in a place of peace he said to tell you that he knows you never betrayed him he knows how much you love him and he is sorry you have had to suffer he said to tell you to be at peace knowing all is well between your spirits adie turned her ear away and looked at kahlan with her white eyes tears rolled down her cheeks my pell knows i did not betray him kahlan nodded yes adie he knows and loves you as always adie pulled kahlan into her arms as she wept thank you kahlan you could never know how much this means to me you have given me back everything you have given me back the meaning of life i know how much it means adie adie stroked the back of kahlans head as she held her close yes child perhaps you do jebra and chandalen cooked breakfast while the rest of them talked and planned though it would be a grisly job clearing ebinissia of all the bodies at least it was still winter and not the task it would be in spring from ebinissia they would pull the midlands back together kahlan told them that richard would try to meet up with them in the galean crown city and that he said that then he might need to take zedd back to westland to see about the sisters of the dark but for now they were safely out to sea after a good meal filled with joy and happy conversation that had been missing for so long they started packing up their things chandalen with an uneasy expression pulled kahlan aside mother confessor i wish to ask you something i would not ask you except i know no one else to ask what is it chandalen how do you say breasts in your tongue what what is the word for breasts i wish to tell jebra that she has fine breasts kahlan rolled her shoulder selfconsciously chandalen im sorry but i meant to have a talk with you about that i guess with everything that happened i never got around to it so talk now i wish to tell jebra how much i like her fine breasts chandalen with the mud people that is a proper thing to say to a woman its a compliment but in other places it is not taken as a compliment but as improper very improper until two people know each other i know her well not well enough will you trust me in this if you really like her then you must not tell her this or she will not like you but women here do not like to hear the truth its not that simple would you tell a woman in your village you would like to see her with the mud washed from her hair even though it is the truth he lifted an eyebrow i see what you mean do you like other things about her he nodded enthusiastically yes i like everything about her then tell her you like her smile or her hair or her eyes how do i know which is the proper thing to compliment kahlan sighed well for now just stick to anything that isnt covered by clothes and you will be safe he nodded thoughtfully you are wise mother confessor i am glad you have richard back as your mate or you would surely have chosen chandalen kahlan laughed and gave him a hug he returned it warmly outside she saw to the men captain ryan lieutenant hobson brin and peter and others she knew they were infected by her smile and good cheer in the stables she checked on nick chandalen had stolen him back when they fled aydindril the big warhorse neighed softly at her approach kahlan rubbed his gray nose as he nudged his head against her how you doing nick he nickered how would you like to carry the queen of galea to the palace in ebinissia nick tossed his head enthusiastically anxious to be out of the stables and off into the brightening day water dripped from melting icicles at the edge of the stable roof kahlan looked out over the hills it was going to be a rare warm day in the winter but soon it would be spring mistress sanderholt was surprised when richard took another bowl of soup and chunk of bread mistress sanderholt you make the best spice soup in the world after mine in the kitchen beyond the help was busily going about breakfast preparations she closed the door richard i am pleased you are so much better i was worried you would do something terrible last night you were grieving so but this is too much of a change something must have happened to make you have such a turnaround in spirit he looked up at her as he chewed he swallowed the bread i will tell you if you promise to keep it a secret for now it could cause serious trouble if you told anyone i promise then kahlan is not dead she stared blankly at him richard you are worse than i thought i myself saw i know what you saw the wizard you saw is my grandfather he used a spell to make everyone think she was executed so they would not be hunted down so that they could escape she is safe she threw her arms around his neck oh dear spirits be praised indeed richard said with a grin richard took the bowl of soup outside to watch the dawn he was too exhilarated to be cooped up indoors he sat on the vast steps looking around at the magnificent palace soaring up all around him towers and spires and sweeping roofs loomed in the early dawn light as he ate his soup he watched a gargoyle atop the edge of a nearby enormous frieze supported by fluted columns the pink clouds were just beginning to glow behind it silhouetting the grotesque hunched shape richard had just put a spoonful of spice soup in his mouth when he thought he saw the gargoyle take a deep breath richard set the bowl down he rose to his feet his eyes never leaving the dark shape it moved again just a little twitch gratch gratch is that you the shape didnt move maybe it was just his imagination richard held his arms open wide gratch please if thats you forgive me gratch ive missed you it was still a moment and then the wings stretched out it leapt from the corner of the building and swooped down in a glide toward him with a flutter of wings the huge gar landed on the steps a short distance away gratch oh gratch ive missed you the gar watched with glowing green eyes i dont know if you can understand but i didnt mean what i said i was only trying to save your life please forgive me richard loves gratch his wings fluttered a cloud of breath came from between long fangs his ears perked up grrratch luuug raaaach aaarg the gar bounded into richards arms knocking him to the steps richard hugged the furry beast and gratch enfolded him in arms and wings each stroked the others back and each grinned in his own way when they finally sat up gratch hunched down staring curiously at richards face with the back of a huge claw he stroked richards jaw richard felt his smooth face as he smiled its gone im not going to have a beard anymore gratchs nose wrinkled in disgust he let out a gurgling growl of displeasure richard laughed youll get used to it they sat together in the quiet of the dawn do you know gratch that im a wizard gratch gurgled a laugh and frowned dubiously richard wondered how a gar could know what a wizard was gratch never failed to astonish him with what he knew with what he could grasp no really i am here let me show you ill make fire richard held his palm out he called the power from the calm center try as he might nothing happened he could not make so much as a spark he sighed as gratch howled in a roar of laughter his wings flapping with the joke a sudden memory came to him something denna had told him he had asked her how he had done all those things with magic she had looked at him with that allknowing smile of peace and said be proud you made the right choices richard the choices that allowed to happen what came about but do not call arrogance to your heart by believing that all that happened was your doing richard wondered where the line was he realized he had a lot to learn before he was a real wizard he wasnt even sure he wanted to be a wizard but he now accepted who he was one born with the gift born to be the pebble in the pond son of darken rahl but lucky enough to have been raised by people who loved him he felt the hilt of the sword at his elbow it had been made for him he was the seeker the true seeker richards thoughts again touched the spirit who had brought him more happiness than in life had brought him pain he was deeply gratified that denna had found peace he could want nothing more for her for someone he loved he came out of his thoughts and patted the gars arm you wait here a minute gratch ill get you something richard ran into the kitchen and retrieved a leg of mutton as he ran back down the steps gratch danced from one foot to the other in excitement together they sat on the steps richard eating his soup and gratch tearing into the meat with his fangs when they had finished gratch had even eaten the bone richard pulled out a long lock of kahlans hair this is from the woman i love gratch considered then looked up as he gently reached out i want you to have it i told her about you and what you mean to me she will love you just as i love you gratch she will never chase you away you can be with us whenever you want for as long as you want here give it back a moment gratch held out the length of hair richard took off the thong holding scarlets tooth it would do him no good any longer he had already called her with it he tied the long lock of hair to the thong and then hung the whole thing over gratchs head with a claw gratch stroked the long hair his grin wrinkled his nose and showed the full length of his fangs im going to go to her now would you like to come along gratch nodded his enthusiasm his head bobbing his ears twitching and his wings fluttering richard looked down on the city troops were moving about a lot of troops imperial order troops it wouldnt be long before they gained the courage to investigate the death of the council even if it was at the hands of a wizard richard smiled then i guess i better find a horse and we can be on our way i think it best if we were away from here he looked out on the brightening day a breeze with a hint of warmth ruffled his mriswith cape before long it would be spring
