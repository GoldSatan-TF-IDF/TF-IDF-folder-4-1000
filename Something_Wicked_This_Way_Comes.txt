something wicked this way comes with gratitude to jenet johnson who taught me how to write the short story and to snow longley housh who taught me poetry at los angeles high school a long time ago and to jackguss who helped with this novel not so long ago man is in love and loves what vanishes wb yeats they sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause

prologue first of all it was october a rare month for boys not that all months arent rare but there be bad abd good as the pirates say take september a bad month schoool begins consider august a good month school hasnt begun yet july well julys really fine theres no chance in the world for school june no doubting it junes best of all for the school doors spring wide and septembers a billion years away but you take october now schools been on a month and youre riding easier in the reins jogging along you got time to think of the garbage youll dump on old man pricketts porch or the hairyape costume youll wear to the ymca the last night of the month and if its around october twentieth and everything smokysmelling and the sky orange and ash grey at twilight it seems halloween will never come in a fall of broomsticks and a soft flap of bedsheets around corners but one strange wild dark long year halloween came early one year halloween came on october three hours after midnight at that time james nightshade of oak street was thirteen years eleven months twentythree days old next door william halloway was thirteen years eleven months and twentyfour days old both touched toward fourteen it almost trembled in their hands and that was the october week when they grew up overnight and were never so young any more i arrivals the seller of lightningrods arrived just ahead of the storm he came along the street of green town illinois in the late cloudy october day sneaking glances over his shoulder somewhere not so far back vast lightnings stomped the earth somewhere a storm like a great beast with terrible teeth could not be denied so the salesman jangled and clanged his huge leather kit in which oversized puzzles of ironmongery lay unseen but which his tongue conjured from door to door until he came at last to a lawn which was cut all wrong no not the grass the salesman lifted his gaze but two boys far up the gentle slope lying on the grass of a like size and general shape the boys sat carving twig whistles talking of olden or future times content with having left their fingerprints on every movable object in green town during summer past and their footprints on every open path between here and the lake and there and the river since school began howdy boys called the man all dressed in stormcoloured clothes folks home the boys shook their heads got any money yourselves the boys shook their heads well the salesman walked about three feet stopped and hunched his shoulders suddenly he seemed aware of house windows or the cold sky staring at his neck he turned slowly sniffing the air wind rattled the empty trees sunlight breaking through a small rift in the clouds minted a last few oak leaves all gold but the sun vanished the coins were spent the air blew grey the salesman shook himself from the spell the salesman edged slowly up the lawn boy he said whats your name and the first boy with hair as blondwhite as milk thistle shut up one eye tilted his head and looked at the salesman with a single eye as open bright and clear as a drop of summer rain will he said william halloway the storm gentleman turned and you the second boy did not move but lay stomach down on the autumn grass debating as if he might make up a name his hair was wild thick and the glossy colour of waxed chestnuts his eyes fixed to some distant point within himself were mint rockcrystal green at last he put a blade of dry grass in his casual mouth jim nightshade he said the storm salesman nodded as if he had known it all along nightshade thats quite a name and only fitting said will halloway i was born one minute before midnight october thirtieth jim was born one minute after midnight which makes it october thirtyfirst halloween said jim by their voices the boys had told the tale all their lives proud of their mothers living house next to house running for the hospital together bringing sons into the world seconds apart one light one dark there was a history of mutual celebration behind them each year will lit the candles on a single cake at one minute to midnight jim at one minute after with the last day of the month begun blew them out so much will said excitedly so much jim agreed to silently so much the salesman running before the storm but poised here uncertainly heard looking from face to face halloway nightshade no money you say the man grieved by his own conscientiousness rummaged in his leather bag and seized forth an iron contraption take this free why one of those houses will be struck by lightning without this rod bang fire and ash roast pork and cinders grab the salesman released the rod jim did not move but will caught the iron and gasped boy its heavy and funnylooking never seen a lightningrod like this look jim and jim at last stretched like a cat and turned his head his green eyes got big and then very narrow the metal thing was hammered and shaped halfcrescent halfcross around the rim of the main rod little curlicues and doohingies had been soldered on later the entire surface of the rod was finely scratched and etched with strange languages names that could tie the tongue or break the jaw numerals that added to incomprehensible sums pictographs of insectanimals all bristle chaff and claw thats egyptian jim pointed his nose at a bug soldered to the iron scarab beetle so it is boy jim squinted and those therephoenician hen tracks right why asked jim why said the man why the egyptian arabic abyssinian choctaw well what tongue does the wind talk what nationality is a storm what country do rains come from what colour is lightning where does thunder go when it dies boys you got to be ready in every dialect with every shape and form to hex the st elmos fires the balls of blue light that prowl the earth like sizzling cats i got the only lightningrods in the world that hear feel know and sass back any storm no matter what tongue voice or sign no foreign thunder so loud this rod cant softtalk it but will was staring beyond the man now which he said which house will it strike which hold on wait the salesman searched deep in their faces some folks draw lightning suck it like cats suck babies breath some folks polarities are negative some positive some glow in the dark some snuff out you now the twoi what makes you so sure lightning will strike anywhere around here said jim suddenly his eyes bright the salesman almost flinched why i got a nose an eye an ear both those houses their timbers listen they listened maybe their houses leaned under the cool afternoon wind maybe not lightning needs channels like rivers to run in one of those attics is a dry river bottom itching to let lightning pour through tonight tonight jim sat up happily no ordinary storm said the salesman tom fury tells you fury aint that a fine name for one who sells lightningrods did i take the name no did the name fire me to my occupations yes grown up i saw cloudy fires jumping the world making men hop and hide thought ill chart hurricanes map storms then run ahead shaking my iron cudgels my miraculous defenders in my fists ive shielded and made snugsafe one hundred thousand count em godfearing homes so when i tell you boys youre in dire need listen climb that roof nail this rod high ground it in the good earth before nightfall but which house which asked will the salesman reared off blew his nose in a great kerchief then walked slowly across the lawn as if approaching a huge timebomb that ticked silently there he touched wills front porch newels ran his hand over a post a floorboard then shut his eyes and leaned against the house to let its bones speak to him then hesitant he made his cautious way to jims house next door jim stood up to watch the salesman put his hand out to touch to stroke to quiver his fingertips on the old paint this he said at last is the one jim looked proud without looking back the salesman said jim nightshade this your place mine said jim i shouldve known said the man hey what about me said will the salesman snuffed again at wills house no no oh a few sparksll jump on your rainspouts but the real shows next door here at the nightshades well the salesman hurried back across the lawn to seize his huge leather bag im on my way storms coming dont wait jim boy otherwisebamm youll be found your nickels dimes and indianheads fused by electroplating abe lincolns melted into miss columbias eagles plucked raw on the backs of quarters all run to quicksilver in your jeans more any boy hit by lightning lift his lid and there on his eyeball pretty as the lords prayer on a pin find the last scene the boy ever saw a boxbrownie photo by god of that fire climbing down the sky to blow you like a penny whistle suck your soul back up along the bright stair git boy hammer it high or youre dead come dawn and jangling his case full of iron rods the salesman wheeled about and charged down the walk blinking wildly at the sky the roof the trees at last closing his eyes moving sniffing muttering yes bad here it comes feel it way off now but running fast and the man in the stormdark clothes was gone his cloudcoloured hat pulled down over his eyes and the trees rustled and the sky seemed very old suddenly and jim and will stood testing the wind to see if they could smell electricity the lightningrod fallen between them jim said will dont stand there your house he said you going to nail up the rod or aint you no smiled jim why spoil the fun fun you crazy ill get the ladder you the hammer some nails and wire but jim did not move will broke and ran he came back with the ladder jim think of your mom you want her burnt will climbed the side of the house alone and looked down slowly jim moved to the ladder below and started up thunder sounded far off in the cloudshadowed hills the air smelled fresh and raw on top of jim nightshades roof even jim admitted that theres nothing in the living world like books on watercures deathsofathousandslices or pouring whitehot lava off castle walls on drolls and mountebanks so said jim nightshade thats all he read if it wasnt how to burgle the first national it was how to build catapults or shape black bumbershoots into lurking bat costumes for cabbage night jim breathed it out all fine and will he breathed it in with the lightningrod nailed to jims roof will proud and jim ashamed of what he considered mutual cowardice it was late in the day supper over it was time for their weekly jog to the library like all boys they never walked anywhere but named a goal and lit for it scissors and elbows nobody won nobody wanted to win it was in their friendship they just wanted to run forever shadow and shadow their hands slapped librarydoor handles together their chests broke track tapes together their tennis shoes beat parallel pony tracks over lawns trimmed bushes squirrelled trees no one losing both winning thus saving their friendship for other times of loss so it was on this night that blew warm then cool as they let the wind take them downtown at eight oclock they felt the wings on their fingers and elbows flying then suddenly plunged in new sweeps of air the clear autumn river flung them headlong where they must go up step three six nine twelve slap their palms hit the library door jim and will grinned at each other it was all so good these blowing quiet october nights and the library waiting inside now with its greenshaded lamps and papyrus dust jim listened whats that what the wind like music jim squinted at the horizon dont hear no music jim shook his head gone or it wasnt even there come on they opened the door and stepped in they stopped the library deeps lay waiting for them out in the world not much happened but here in the special night a land bricked with paper and leather anything might happen always did listen and you heard ten thousand people screaming so high only dogs feathered their ears a million folk ran toting cannons sharpening guillotines chinese four abreast marched on forever invisible silent yes but jim and will had the gift of ears and noses as well as the gift of tongues this was a factory of spices from far countries here alien deserts slumbered up front was the desk where the nice old lady miss watriss purplestamped your books but down off away were tibet and antarctica the congo there went miss wills the other librarian through outer mongolia calmly toting fragments of peiping and yokohama and the celebes way down the third book corridor an oldish man whispered his broom along in the dark mounding the fallen will stared it was always a surprisethat old man his work his name thats charles william halloway thought will not grandfather not farwandering ancient uncle as some might think butmy father so looking back down the corridor was dad shocked to see he owned a son who visited this separate fathomsdeep world dad always seemed stunned when will rose up before him as if they had met a lifetime ago and one had grown old while the other stayed young and this fact stood between far off the old man smiled they approached each other carefully is that you will grown an inch since this morning charles halloway shifted his gaze jim eyes darker cheeks paler you bum yourself at both ends jim heck said jim no such place as heck but hells right here under a for alighieri allegorys beyond me said jim how stupid of me dad laughed i mean dante look at this pictures by mister dore showing all the aspects hell never looked better heres souls sunk to their gills in slime theres someone upside down wrong side out boy howdy jim eyed the pages two different ways and thumbed on got any dinosaur pictures dad shook his head thats over in the next aisle he strolled them around and reached out here we are pterodactyl kite of destruction or what about drums of doom the saga of the thunder lizards pep you up jim im pepped dad winked at will will winked back they stood now a boy with corncoloured hair and a man with moonwhite hair a boy with a summerapple a man with a winterapple face dad dad thought will why why he lookslike me in a smashed mirror and suddenly will remembered nights rising at two in the morning to go to the bathroom and spying across town to see that one single light in the high library window and know dad had lingered on late murmuring and reading alone under these green jungle lamps it made will sad and funny to see that light to know the old manhe stopped to change the wordhis father was here in all this shadow will said the old man who was also a janitor who happened to be his father what about you huh will shook himself you need a whitehat or a blackhat book hats said will well jim they perambulated dad running his fingers along the book spineshe wears the black tengallon hats and reads books to fit middle names moriarty right jim any day now hell move up from fu manchu to machiavelli heremediumsize dark fedora or over along to dr faustusextra large black stetson that leaves the whitehat boys to you will heres gandhi next door is st thomas and on the next level wellbuddha you dont mind said will ill settle for the mysterious island what asked jim scowling is all this talk about white and black hats why dad handed jules verne to willits just a long time ago i had to decide myself which colour id wear so said jim which did you pick dad looked surprised then he laughed uneasily since you need to ask jim you make me wonder will tell mom ill be home soon get out of here both of you miss watriss he called softly to the librarian at the desk dinosaurs and mysterious islands coming up the door slammed outside a weather of stars ran clear in an ocean sky heck jim sniffed north jim sniffed south wheres the storm that darn salesman promised i just got to watch that lightning fizz down my drainpipes will let the wind ruffle and refit his clothes his skin his hair then he said faintly itll be here by morning who says the huckleberries all down my arms they say great the wind flew jim away a similar kite will swooped to follow watching the boys vanish away charles halloway suppressed a sudden urge to run with them make the pack he knew what the wind was doing to them where it was taking them to all the secret places that were never so secret again in life somewhere in him a shadow turned mournfully over you had to run with a night like this so the sadness could not hurt look he thought will runs because running is its own excuse jim runs because somethings up ahead of him yet strangely they do run together whats the answer he wondered walking through the library putting out the lights putting out the lights putting out the lights is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings scrapings all antennae shivering one big ganglion eternally knotting slipknotting squareknotting themselves they stoke a furnace all their lives sweat their lips shine their eyes and start it all in the crib caesars lean and hungry friends they eat the dark who only stand and breathe thats jim all bramblehair and itchweed and will why hes the last peach high on the summer tree some boys walk by and you cry seeing them they feel good they look good they are good oh theyre not above peeing off a bridge or stealing an occasional dimestore pencil sharpener its not that its just you know seeing them pass thats how theyll be all their life theyll get hit hurt cut bruised and always wonder why why does it happen how can it happen to them but jim now he knows it happens he watches for it happening he sees it start he sees it finish he licks the wound he expected and never asks why he knows he always knew someone knew before him a long time ago someone who had wolves for pets and lions for night conversants hell jim doesnt know with his mind but his body knows and while wills putting a bandage on his latest scratch jims ducking waving bouncing away from the knockout blow which must inevitably come so there they go jim running slower to stay with will will running faster to stay with jim jim breaking two windows in a haunted house because wills along will breaking one instead of none because jims watching god how we get our fingers in each others clay thats friendship each playing the potter to see what shapes we can make of the other jim will he thought strangers go on ill catch up some day the library door gasped open slammed five minutes later he turned into the corner saloon for his nightly oneandonly drink in time to hear a man say i read when alcohol was invented the italians thought it was the big thing theyd been looking for for centuries the elixir of life did you know that no the bartenders back was turned sure the man went on distilled wine ninth tenth century looked like water but it burnt i mean it not only burnt the mouth and stomach but you could set it on fire so they thought theyd mixed water and fire firewater the elixir vitae by god maybe they werent so far wrong thinking it was the cureall the thing that worked miracles have a drink i dont need it said halloway but someone inside me does who the boy i once was thought halloway who runs like the leaves down the sidewalk autumn nights but he couldnt say that so he drank eyes shut listening to hear if that thing inside turned over again rustling in the deep bons that were stacked for burning but never burned will stopped will looked at the friday night town it seemed when the first stroke of nine banged from the big courthouse clock all the lights were on and business humming in the shops but by the time the last stroke of nine shook everyones fillings in his teeth the barbers had yanked off the sheets powdered the customers trotted them forth the druggists fount had stopped fizzing like a nest of snakes the insect neons everywhere had ceased buzzing and the vast glittering acreage of the dime store with its ten billion metal glass and paper oddments waiting to be fished over suddenly blacked out shades slithered doors boomed keys rattled their bones in locks people fled with hordes of torn newspaper mice nibbling their heels bang they were gone boy yelled will folks run like they thought the storm was here it is shouted jim us they stomppoundthundered over iron grates steel trapdoors past a dozen unlit shops a dozen halflit a dozen dying dark the city was dead as they rounded the united cigar store corner to see a wooden cherokee glide in darkness by himself hey mr tetley the proprietor peered over the indians shoulder scare you boys naw but will shivered feeling cold tidal waves of strange rain moving down the prairie as on a deserted shore when the lightning nailed the town he wanted to be layered under sixteen blankets and a pillow mr tetley said will quietly for now there were two wooden indians upright in ripe tobacco darkness mr tetley amidst his jest had frozen mouth open listening mr tetley he heard something far away on the wind but couldnt say what it was the boys backed off he did not see them he did not move he only listened they left him they ran in the fourth empty block from the library the boys came upon a third wooden indian mr crosetti in front of his barber shop his door key in his trembling fingers did not see them stop what had stopped them a teardrop it moved shining down mr crosettis left cheek he breathed heavily crosetti you fool something happens nothing happens you cry like a baby mr crosetti took a trembling breath snuffing dont you smell it jim and will sniffed licorice heck no cotton candy i havent smelled that in years said mr crosetti jim snorted its around yes but who notices when now my nose tells me breathe and im crying why because i remember how a long time ago boys ate that stuff why havent i stopped to think and smell the last thirty years youre busy mr crosetti will said you havent got time mr crosetti wiped his eyes where does that smell come from theres no place in town sells cotton candy only circuses hey said will thats right well crosetti is done crying the barber blew his nose and turned to lock his shop door as he did this will watched the barbers pole whirl its red serpentine up out of nothing leading his gaze around rising to vanish into more nothing on countless moons will had stood here trying to unravel that ribbon watch it come go end without ending mr crosetti put his hand to the light switch under the spinning pole dont said will then murmuring dont turn it off mr crosetti looked at the pole as if freshly aware of its miraculous properties he nodded gently his eyes soft where does it come from where does it go eh who knows not you not him not me oh the mysteries by god so well leave it on its good to know thought will itll be running until dawn winding up from nothing winding away to nothing while we sleep goodnight goodnight and they left him behind in a wind that very faintly smelled of licorice and cotton candy charles halloway put his hand to the saloons double swing doors hesitant as if the grey hairs on the back of his hand like antennae had felt something beyond slide by in the october night perhaps great fires burned somewhere and their furnace blasts warned him not to step forth or another ice age had loomed across the land its freezing bulk might already have laid waste a billion people in the hour perhaps time itself fixed was draining off down an immense glass with powdered darkness failing after to bury all or maybe it was only that man in a dark suit seen through the saloon window across the street great paper rolls under one arm a brush and bucket in his free hand the man was whistling a tune very far away it was a tune from another season one that never ceased making charles halloway sad when he heard it the song was incongruous for october but immensely moving overwhelming no matter what day or what month it was sung i heard the bells on christmas day their old familiar carols play and wild and sweet their words repeat great of peace on earth good will to men charles halloway shivered suddenly there was the old sense of terrified elation of wanting to laugh and cry together when he saw the innocents of the earth wandering the snowy streets the day before christmas among all the tired men and women whose faces were dirty with guilt unwashed of sin and smashed like small windows by life that hit without warning ran hid came back and hit again then pealed the bells more loud and deep god is not dead nor doth he sleep the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth good will to men the whistling died charles halloway stepped out far up ahead the man who had whistled the tune was motioning his arms by a telegraph pole silently working now he vanished into the open door of a shop charles halloway not knowing why crossed the street to watch the man pasting up one of the posters inside the unrented and empty store now the man stepped out the door with his brush his paste bucket his rolled papers his eyes a fierce and lustful shine fixed on charles halloway smiling he gestured an open hand halloway stared the palm of that hand was covered with fine black silken hair it looked like the hand clenched tight it waved the man swept around the corner charles halloway stunned flushed with sudden summer heat swayed then turned to gaze into the empty shop two sawhorses stood parallel to each other under a single spotlight placed over these two sawhorses like a funeral of snow and crystal was a block of ice six feet long it shone dimly with its own effulgence and its colour was light greenblue it was a great cool gem resting there in the dark on a little white placard at one side near the window the following calligraphic message could be read by lamplight cooger darks pandemonium shadow showfantoccini marionette circus and your plain meadow carnival arriving immediately here on display one of our many attractions the most beautiful woman in the world halloways eyes leaped to the poster on the inside of the window and back to the cold long block of ice it was such a block of ice as he remembered from travelling magicians shows when he was a boy when the local ice company contributed a chunk of winter in which for twelve hours on end frost maidens lay embedded on display while people watched and comedies toppled down the raw white screen and coming attractions came and went and at last the pale ladies slid forth all rimed chipped free by perspiring sorcerers to be led off smiling into the dark behind the curtains the most beautiful woman in the world and yet this vast chunk of wintry glass held nothing but frozen river water no not quite empty halloway felt his heart pound one special time within the huge winter gem was there not a special vacuum a voluptuous hollow a prolonged emptiness which undulated from tip to toe of the ice and wasnt this vacuum this emptiness waiting to be filled with summer flesh was it not shaped somewhat like awoman yes the ice and the lovely hollows the horizontal flow of emptiness within the ice the lovely nothingness the exquisite flow of an invisible mermaid daring the ice to capture it the ice was cold the emptiness within the ice was warm he wanted to go away from here but charles halloway stood in the strange night for a long time looking in at the empty shop and the two sawhorses and the cold waiting arctic coffin set there like a vast star of india in the dark jim nightshade stopped at the comer of hickory and main breathing easily his eyes fixed tenderly on the leafy darkness of hickory street will no will stopped surprised at his own violence it is just there the fifth house just one minute will jim pleaded softly minute will glanced down the street which was the street of the theatre until this summer it had been an ordinary street where they stole peaches plums and apricots each in its day but late in august while they were monkeyclimbing for the sourest apples the thing happened which changed the houses the taste of the fruit and the very air within the gossiping trees will its waiting maybe somethings happening hissed jim maybe something is will swallowed hard and felt jims hand pinch his arm for it was no longer the street of the apples or plums or apricots it was the one house with a window at the side and this window jim said was a stage with a curtainthe shade that isup and in that room on that strange stage were the actors who spoke mysteries mouthed wild things laughed sighed murmured so much so much of it was whispers will did not understand just one last time will you know it wont be last jims face was flushed his cheeks blazing his eyes greenglass fire he thought of that night them picking the apples jim suddenly crying softly oh there and will hanging to the limbs of the tree tightpressed terribly excited staring in at the theatre that peculiar stage where people all unknowing flourished shirts above their heads let fall clothes to the rug stood raw and animalcrazy naked like shivering horses hands out to touch each other whatre they doing i thought will why are they laughing whats wrong with them whats wrong he wished the light would go out but he hung tight to the suddenly slippery tree and watched the bright window theatre heard the laughing and numb at last let go slid fell lay dazed then stood in dark gazing up at jim who still clung to his high limb jims face hearthflushed cheeks firefuzzed lips parted stared in jim jim come down but jim did not hear jim and when jim looked down at last he saw will as a stranger below with some silly request to give off living and come down to earth so will ran off alone thinking too much knowing what to think will please will looked at jim now with the library books in his hands we been to the library aint that enough jim shook his head carry these for me he handed will his books and trotted softly off under the hissing whispering trees tlree houses down he called back will know what you are a darn old dimwit episcopal baptist then jim was gone will seized the books tight to his chest they were wet from the hands dont look back he thought i wont i wont and looking only toward home he walked that way quickly halfway home will felt a shadow breathing hard behind him theatre dosed said will not looking back jim walked in silence beside him for a long while and then said nobody home swell jim spat dam baptist preacher you and around the corner a tumbleweed slithered a great cotton ball of pale paper which bounced then clung shivering to jims legs will grabbed the paper laughing pulled it off let it fly he stopped laughing the boys watching the pale throwaway rattle and flit through the trees were suddenly cold wait a minute said jim slowly all of a sudden they were yelling running leaping dont tear it careful the paper fluttered like a snare drum in their hands coming october twentyfourth their lips moved shadowing the words set in rococo type cooger and darks carnival october twentyfourth thats tomorrow it cant be said will all carnivals stop after labour day who cares a thousand and one wonders see mephistopheles the lava drinker mr electrico the monster montgolfier balloon said will a montgolfier is a balloon mademoiselle tarot read jim the dangling man the demon guillotine the illustrated man hey thats just an old guy with tattoos no jim breathed warm on the paper hes illustrated special see covered with monsters a menagerie jims eyes jumped see the skeleton aint that fine will not thin man no but skeleton see the dust witch whats a dust witch will no jim squinted off seeing things a gypsy that was born in the dust raised in the dust and some day winds up back in the dust heres more egyptian mirror maze see yourself ten thousand times saint anthonys temple f temptation the most beautiful read will woman in the world finished jim they looked at each other can a carnival have the most beautiful woman on earth in its sideshow will you ever seen carnival ladies jim grizzly bears but how come this handbill claims oh shut up you mad at me will no its justget it the wind had tom the paper from their hands the handbill blew over the trees and away in an idiot caper gone it s not true anyway will gasped carnivals dont come this late in the year silly darnsounding thing whod go to it me jim stood quiet in the dark me thought will seeing the guillotine flash the egyptian mirrors unfold accordions of light and the sulphurskinned devilman sipping lava like gunpowder tea that music jim murmured calliope must be coming tonight carnivals come at sunrise yeah but what about the licorice and cotton candy we smelled close and will thought of the smells and the sounds flowing on the river of wind from beyond the darkening houses mr tetley listening by his wooden indian friend mr crosetti with the single tear shining down his cheek and the barbers pole sliding its red tongue up and around forever out of nowhere and away to eternity wills teeth chattered lets go home we are home cried jim surprised for not knowing it they had reached their separate houses and now moved up separate walks on his porch jim leaned over and called softly will youre not mad heck no we wont go by that street that house the theatre again for a month a year i swear sure jim sure they stood with their hands on the doorknobs of their houses and will looked up at jims room where the lightningrod glittered against the cold stars the storm was coming the storm wasnt coming no matter which he was glad jim had that grand contraption up there night night their separate doors slammed will opened the door and shut it again quietly this time thats better said his mothers voice framed through the hall door will saw the only theatre he cared for now the familiar stage where sat his father home already he and jim must have run the long way round holding a book but reading the empty spaces in a chair by the fire mother knitted and hummed like a teakettle he wanted to be near and not near them he saw them close he saw them far suddenly they were awfully small in too large a room in too big a town and much too huge a world in this unlocked place they seemed at the mercy of anything that might break in from the night including me will thought including me suddenly he loved them more for their smallness than he ever had when they seemed tall his mothers fingers twitched her mouth counted the happiest woman he had ever seen he remembered a greenhouse on a winter day pushing aside thick jungle leaves to find a creamy pink hothouse rose poised alone in the wilderness that was mother smelling like fresh milk happy to herself in this room happy but how and why here a few feet off was the janitor the library man the stranger his uniform gone but his face still the face of a man happier at night alone in the deep marble vaults whispering his broom in the draughty corridors will watched wondering why this woman was so happy and this man so sad his father stared deep in the fire one hand relaxed halfcupped in that hand lay a crumpled paper ball will blinked he remembered the wind blowing the pale handbill skittering in the trees now the same colour paper lay crushed its rococo type hidden in his fathers fingers hey will stepped into the parlour immediately mom opened a smile that was like lighting a second fire dad stricken looked dismayed as if caught in a criminal act will wanted to say hey whatd you think of the handbill but dad was crammmg the handbill deep in the chair upholstery and mother was leafing the library books oh these are fine willy so will just stood with cooger and dark on his tongue and said boy the wind really flew us home streets full of paper blowing dad did not flinch at this anything new dad dads hand still lay tucked in the side of the chair he lifted a grey slightly worried very tired gaze to his son stone lion blew off the library steps prowling the town now looking for christians wont find any got the only one no in captivity here and shes a good cook bosh said mom walking upstairs will heard what he half expected to hear a soft fluming sigh as something fresh was tossed on the fire in his mind he saw dad standing at the hearth looking down as the paper crinkled to ash cooger dark carnival witch wonders he wanted to go back down and stand with dad hands out to be warmed by the fire instead he went slowly up to shut the door of his room some nights abed will put his ear to the wall to listen and if his folks talked things that were right he stayed and if not right he turned away if it was about time and passing years or himself or town or just the general inconclusive way god ran the world he listened warmly comfortably secretly for it was usually dad talking he could not often speak with dad anywhere in the world inside or out but this was different there was a thing in dads voice up over down easy as a hand winging soft in the air like a white bird describing flight pattern made the ear want to follow and the minds eye to see and the odd thing in dads voice was the sound truth makes being said the sound of truth in a wild roving land of city or plain country lies will spell any boy many nights will drowsed this way his senses like stopped clocks long before that halfsinging voice was still dads voice was a midnight school teaching deep fathom hours and the subject was life so it was this night wills eyes shut head leaned to the cool plaster at first dads voice a congo drum boomed softly horizons away mothers voice she used her waterbright soprano in the baptist choir did not sing yet sang back replies will imagined dad sprawled talking to the empty ceiling willmakes me feel so olda man should play baseball with his son not necessary said the womans voice kindly youre a good man in a bad season hell i was forty when he was born and you whos your daughter people say god when you lie down your thoughts turn to mush hell will heard the shift of weight as dad sat up in the dark a match was being struck a pipe was being smoked the wind rattled the windows man with poster under his arm carnival said his mothers voice this late in the year will wanted to turn away but couldnt most beautifulwomanin the world dads voice murmured mother laughed softly you know im not no thought will thats from the handbill why doesnt dad tell because will answered himself somethings going on oh something is going on will saw that paper frolicked in the trees its words the most beautiful woman and fever prickled his cheeks he thought jim the street of the theatre the naked people in the stage of that theatre window crazy as chinese opera darn odd crazy as old chinese opera judo jujitsu indian puzzles and now his fathers voice dreaming off sad sadder saddest much too much to understand and suddenly he was scared because dad wouldnt talk about the handbill he had secretly burned will gazed out the window there like a milkweed plume white paper danced in the air no he whispered no carnivals coming this late it cant he hid under the covers switched on his flashlight opened a book the first picture he saw was a prehistoric reptile trapdrumming a night sky a million years lost heck he thought in the rush i got jims book hes got one of mine but it was a pretty fine reptile and flying toward sleep he thought he heard his father restless below the front door shut his father was going back to work late for no reason with brooms or books downtown awayaway and mother asleep content not knowing he had gone no one else in the world had a name came so well off the tongue jim nightshade thats me jim stood tall and now lay long in bed strung together by marshgrass his bones easy in his flesh his flesh easy on his bones the library books lay unopenedby his relaxed right hand waiting his eyes were dark as twilight with shadows under the eyes from the time his mother said he had almost died when he was three and still remembered his hair was dark autumn chestnut and the veins in his temples and brow and in his neck and ticking in his wrists and on the backs of his slender hands all these were dark blue he was marbled with dark was jim nightshade a boy who talked less and smiled less as the years increased the trouble with jim was he looked at the world and could not look away and when you never look away all your life by the time you are thirteen you have done twenty years taking in the laundry of the world will halloway it was in him young to always look just beyond over or to one side so at thirteen he had saved up only six years of staring jim knew every centimetre of his shadow could have cut it out of tar paper furled it and run it up a flagpolehis banner will he was occasionally surprised to see his shadow following him somewhere but that was that jim you awake hi mom a door opened and now shut he felt her weight on the bed why jim your hands are ice you shouldnt have the window so high mind your health sure dont say sure that way you dont know until youve had three children and lost all but one never going to have any said jim you just say that i know it i know everything she waited a moment what do you know no use making more people people die his voice was very calm and quiet and almost sad thats everything almost everything youre here jim if you werent id have given up long ago mom a long silence can you remember dads face do i look like him the day you go away is the day he leaves forever whos going away why just lying there jim you run so fast i never saw anyone move so much just sleeping promise me jim wherever you go and come back bring lots of kids let them run wild let me spoil them some day im never going to own anything can hurt me you going to collect rocks jim no some day youve got to be hurt no i dont he looked at her her face had been hit a long time ago the bruises had never gone from around her eyes youll live and get hurt she said in the dark but when its time tell me say goodbye otherwise i might not let you go wouldnt that be terrible to just grab ahold she rose up suddenly and went to put the window down why do boys want their windows open wide warm blood warm blood she stood alone thats the story of all our sorrows and dont ask why the door shut jim alone raised the window and leaned into the absolutely clear night storm he thought you there yes feelaway to the westa real humdinger rushing along the shadow of the lightningrod lay in the drive below he sucked in cold air gave out a vast exhilaration of heat why he thought why dont i climb up knock that lightningrod loose throw it away and then see what happens yes and then see what happens just after midnight shuffling footsteps along the empty street came the lightningrod salesman his leather valise swung almost empty in his baseballmitt hand his face at ease he turned a corner and stopped papersoft white moths tapped at an empty store window looking in and in the window like a great coffin boat of starcoloured glass beached on two sawhorses lay a chunk of alaska snow company ice chopped to a size great enough to flash in a giants ring and sealed in this ice was the most beautiful woman in the world the lightningrod salesmans smile faded in the dreaming coldness of ice like someone fallen and slept in snow avalanches a thousand years forever young was this woman she was as fair as this morning and fresh as tomorrows flowers and lovely as any maid when a man shuts up his eyes and traps her in cameo perfection on the shell of his eyelids the lightningrod salesman remembered to breathe once long ago travelling among the marbles of rome and florence he had seen women like this kept in stone instead of ice once wandering in the louvre he had found women like this washed in summer colour and kept in paint once as a boy sneaking the cool grottoes behind a motion picture theatre screen on his way to a free seat he had glanced up and there towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a womens face as he had never seen it since of such size and beauty built of milkbone and moonflesh at to freeze him there alone behind the stage shadowed by the motion of her lips the birdwing flicker of her eyes the snowpaledeathshimmering illumination from her cheeks so from other years there jumped forth images which flowed and found new substance here within the ice what colour was her hair it was blonde to whiteness and might take any colour once set free of cold how tall was she the prism of the ice might well multiply her size or diminish her as you moved this way or that before the empty store the window the nightsoft raptapping everfingering gently probing moths not important for above allthe lightningrod salesman shiveredhe knew the most extraordinary thing if by some miracle her eyelids should open within that sapphire and she should look at him he knew what colour her eyes would be he knew what colour her eyes would be if one were to enter this lonely night shop if one were to put forth ones hand the warmth of that hand wouldwhat melt the ice the lightningrod salesman stood there for a long moment his eyes quickened shut he let his breath out it was warm as summer on his teeth his hand touched the shop door it swung open cold arctic air blew out round him he stepped in the door shut the white snowflake moths tapped at the window midnight then and the town clocks chiming on toward one and two and then three in the deep morning and the peals of the great clocks shaking dust off old toys in attics and shedding silver off old mirrors in yet higher attics and s up dreams about docks in all beds where children slept will heard it muffled away in the prairie lands the chuffing of an engine the slowslowfollowing dragonglide of a train will sat up in bed across the way like a mirror image jim sat up too a calliope began to play oh so softly grieving to itself a million miles away in one single motion will leaned from his window as did jim without a word they gazed over the trembling surf of trees their rooms were high as boys rooms should be from these gaunt windows they could riflefire their gaze artillery distances past library city hall depot cow barns farmlands to empty prairie there on the worlds rim the lovely snailgleam of the railway tracks ran flinging wild gesticulations of lemon or cherrycoloured semaphore to the stars there on the precipice of earth a small steam feather uprose like the first of a storm cloud yet to come the train itself appeared link by link engine coalcar and numerous and numbered allasleepandslumberingdream filled cars that followed the fireflysparked chum chant drowsy autumn hearthfire roar hellfires flushed the stunned hills even at this remote view one imagined men with buffalohaunched arms shovelling black meteor falls of coal into the open boilers of the engine the engine both boys vanished came back to life binoculars the engine civil war no other stack like that since the rest of the train all of its old the flags the cages its the carnival they listened at first will thought he heard the air whistling fast in his nostrils but noit was the train and the calliope sighing weeping on that train sounds like church music hell why would a carnival play church music dont say hell hissed will hell jim ferociously leaned out ive saved up all day everyones asleep sohell the music drifted by their windows goose pimples rose bid as boils on wills arms that is church music changed for criyi im froze lets go watch them set up at three am at three am jim vanished for a moment will watched jim dance around over there shirt uplifted pants going on while off in night country panting churning was this funeral train all blackplumed cars licoricecoloured cages and a sooty calliope clamouring banging three different hymns mixed and lost maybe not there at all here goes nothing jim slid down the drainpipe on his house toward the sleeping lawns jim wait will thrashed into his clothes jim dont go alone and followed after sometimes you see a kite so high so wise it almost knows the wind it travels then chooses to land in one spot and no other and no matter how you yank run this way or that it will simply break its cord seek its resting place and bring you bloodmouthed running jim wait for me so now jim was the kite the wild twine cut and whatever wisdom was his taking him away from will who could only run earthbound after one so high and dark silent and suddenly strange jim here i come and running will thought boy its the same old thing i talk jim runs i tilt stones jim grabs the cold junk under the stones andlicketysplit i climb hills jim yells off church steeples i got a bank account jims got the hair on his head the yell in his mouth the shirt on his back and the tennis shoes on his feet how come i think hes richer because will thought i sit on a rock in the sun and old jim he prickles his armhairs by moonlight and dances with hoptoads i tend cows jim tames gila monsters fool i yell at jim coward he yells back and here wego and they ran from town across fields and both froze under a rail bridge with the moon ready beyond the hills and the meadows trembling with a fur of dew wham the carnival train thundered the bridge the calliope wailed theres no one playing it jim stared up jim no jokes mothers honour look going away away the calliope pipes shimmered with star explosions but no one sat at the high keyboard the wind sluicing airwater air in the pipes made the music the boys ran the train curved away gonging its undersea funeral bell sunk rusted greenmossed tolling tolling then the engine whistle blew a great steam whiff and will broke out in pearls of ice way late at night will had heardhow oftentrain whistles jetting steam along the rim of sleep forlorn alone and far no matter how near they came sometimes he woke to find tears on his cheek asked why lay back listened and thought yes they make me cry going east going west the trains so far gone in country deeps they drown in tides of sleep that escape the towns those trains and their grieving sounds were lost forever between stations not remembering where they had been not guessing where they might go exhaling their last pale breaths over the horizon gone so it was with all trains ever yet this trains whistle the wails of a lifetime were gathered in it from other nights in other slumbering years the howl of moondreamed dogs the seep of rivercold winds through january porch screens which stopped the blood a thousand fire sirens weeping or worse the outgone shreds of breath the protests of a billion people dead or dying not wanting to be dead their groans their sighs burst over the earth tears jumped to wills eyes he lurched he knelt he pretended to lace one shoe but then he saw jims hands clap his ears his eyes wet too the whistle screamed jim screamed against the scream the whistle shrieked will shrieked against the shriek then the billion voices ceased instantly as if the train had plunged in a fire storm off the earth the train skimmed on softly slithering black pennants fluttering black confetti lost on its own sicksweet candy wind down the hill with the boys pursuing the air so cold they ate ice cream with each breath they climbed a last rise to look down boy whispered jim the train had pulled off into rolfes moon meadow socalled because town couples came out to see the moon rise here over a land so wide so long it was like an inland sea filled with grass in spring or hay in late summer or snow in winter it was fine walking here along its crisp shore with the moon coming up to tremble in its tides well the carnival train was crouched there now in the autumn grass on the old spur near the woods and the boys crept and lay down under a bush waiting its so quiet whispered will the train just stood in the middle of the dry autumn field no one in the locomotive no one in the tender no one in any of the cars behind all black under the moon and just the small sounds of its metal cooling ticking on the rails ssst said jim i feel them moving in there will felt the catfuzz on his body bramble up by the thousands you think they mind us watching maybe said jim happily then why the noisy calliope when i figure that jim said ill tell you look whisper as if exhaling itself straight down from the sky a vast mossgreen balloon touched at the moon it hovered two hundred yards above and away quietly riding the wind the basket under the balloon someone in it but then a tall man stepped down from the train caboose platform like a captain assaying the tidal weathers of this inland sea all dark suit shadowfaced he waded to the centre of the meadow his shirt as black as the gloved hands he now stretched to the sky he gestured once and the train came to life at first a head lifted in one window then an arm then another head like a puppet in a marionette theatre suddenly two men in black were carrying a dark tentpole out across the hissing grass it was the silence that made will pull back even as jim leaned forward eyes moonbright a carnival should be all growls roars like timberlands stacked bundled rolled and crashed great explosions of lion dust men ablaze with working anger pop bottles jangling horse buckles shivering engines and elephants in full stampede through rains of sweat while zebras neighed and trembled like cage trapped in cage but this was like old movies the silent theatre haunted with blackandwhite ghosts silvery mouth opening to let moonlight smoke out gestures made in silence so hushed you could hear the wind fizz the hair on your cheeks more shadows rustled from the train passing the animal cages where darkness prowled with unlit eyes and the calliope stood mute save for the faintest idiot tune the breeze piped wandering up the flues the ringmaster stood in the middle of the land the balloon like a vast mouldy green cheese stood fixed to the sky then darkness came the last thing will saw was the balloon swooping down as clouds covered the moon in the night he felt the men rush to unseen tasks he sensed the balloon like a great fat spider fiddling with the lines and poles rearing a tapestry in the sky the clouds arose the balloon sifted up in the meadow stood the skeleton main poles and wires of the main tent waiting for its canvas skin more clouds poured over the white moon shadowed will shivered he heard jim crawling forward seized his ankle felt him stiffen wait said will theyre bringing out the canvas l no said jim oh no for somehow instead they both knew the wires highflung on the poles were catching swift clouds ripping them free from the wind in streamers which stitched and sewn by some great monster shadow made canvas and more canvas as the tent took shape at last there was the clearwater sound of vast flags blowing the motion stopped the darkness within darkness was still will lay eyes shut hearing the beat of great oilblack wings as if a huge ancient bird had drummed down to live to breathe to survive in the night meadow the clouds blew away the balloon was gone the men were gone the tents rippled like black rain on their poles suddenly it seemed a long way to town instinctively will glanced behind himself nothing but grass and whispers slowly he looked back at the silent dark seemingly empty tents i dont like it he said jim could not tear his eyes away yeah he whispered yeah will stood up jim lay on the earth jim said will jim jerked his head as if slapped he was on his knees he swayed up his body turned but his eyes were fastened to those black flags the great sideshow signs swarming with unguessed wings horns and demon smiles a bird screamed jim jumped jim gasped cloud shadows panicked them over the hills to the edge of town from there the two boys ran alone the air was cold blowing in through the wideopen library window charles halloway had stood there for a long time now he quickened along the street below fled two shadows two boys above them matching shadow stride for stride they softly printed the night air with treads jim cried the old man will but not aloud the boys went away towards home charles halloway looked out into the country wandering alone in the library letting his broom tell him things no one else could hear he had heard the whistle and the disjointedcalliope hymns three he now said halfaloud three in the morning in the meadow the tents the carnival waited waited for someone anyone to wade along the grassy surf the great tents filled like bellows they softly issued forth exhalations of air that smelled like ancient yellow beasts but only the moon looked in at the hollow dark the deep caverns outside night beasts hung in midgallop on a carousel beyond lay fathoms of mirror maze which housed a multifold series of empty vanities one wave on another still serene silvered with age white with time any shadow at the entrance might stir reverberations the colour of fright unravel deepburied moons if a man stood here would he see himself unfolded away a billion times to eternity would a billion images look back each face and the face after and the face after that old older oldest would he find himself lost in a fine dust away off deep down there not fifty but sixty not sixty but seventy not seventy but eighty ninety ninetynine years old the maze did not ask the maze did not tell it simply stood and waited like a great arctic floe three oclock charles halloway was cold his skin was suddenly a lizards skin his stomach filled with blood turned to rust his mouth tasted of night damps yet he could not turn from the library window far off something glittered in the meadow it was moonlight flashing on a great glass perhaps the light said something perhaps it spoke in code ill go there thought charles halloway i wont go there i like it he thought i dont like it a moment later the library door slammed going home he passed the empty store window inside stood two abandoned sawhorses between lay a pool of water in the water floated a few shards of ice in the ice were a few long strands of hair charles halloway saw but chose not to see he turned and was gone the street was soon as empty as the hardwarestore window far away in the meadow shadows flickered in the mirror maze as if parts of someones life yet unborn were trapped there waiting to be lived so the maze waited its cold gaze ready for so much as a bird to come look see and fly away shrieking but no bird came three a voice said will listened cold but warming glad to be in with a roof above floor below wall and door between too much exposure too much freedom too much night three dads voice home now moving down the hall speaking to itself three why thought will thats when the train came had dad seen heard followed no he mustnt will hunched himself why not he trembled what did he fear the carnival rushing in like a black stampede of storm waves on the shore out beyond of him and jim and dad knowing of the town asleep not knowing was that it yes will buried himself deep yes three three in the morning thought charles halloway seated on the edge of his bed why did the train come at that hour for he thought its a special hour women never wake then do they they sleep the sleep of babes and children but men in middle age they know that hour well oh god midnights not bad you wake and go back to sleep one or twos not bad you toss but sleep again five or six in the mornings not bad theres hope for dawns just under the horizon but three now christ three am the blood moves slow youre the nearest to dead youll ever be save dying sleep is a patch of death but three in the morn full wideeyed staring is living death you dream with your eyes open god if you had strength to rouse up youd slaughter your half dreams with buckshot but no you lie pinned to a deep wellbottom thats burned dry the moon rolls by to look at you down there with its idiot face its a long way back to sunset a far way on to dawn so you summon all the fool things of your life the stupid lovely things done with people known so very well who are now so very deadand wasnt it true had he read it somewhere more people in hospitals die at am than at any other time stop he cried silently charlie his wife said in her sleep slowly he took off the other shoe his wife smiled in her sleep why shes immortal she has a son your son too but what father ever really believes it he carries no burden he feels no pain what man like woman lies down in darkness and gets up with child the gentle smiling ones own the good secret oh what strange wonderful clocks women are they nest in time they make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity they live inside the gift know power accept and need not mention it why speak of time when you are time and shape the universal moments as they pass into warmth and action how men envy and often hate these warm clocks these wives who know they will live forever so what do we do we men turn terribly mean because we cant hold to the world ourselves or anything we are blind to continuity all breaks down falls melts stops rots or runs away so since we cannot shape time where does that leave men sleepless staring three am thats our reward three in the morn the souls midnight the tide goes out the soul ebbs and a train arrives at an hour of despair why charlie his wifes hand moved to his youall rightcharlie she drowsed he did not answer he could not tell her how he was the sun rose yellow as a lemon the sky was round and blue the birds looped clear water songs in the air will and jim leaned from their windows nothing had changed except the look in jims eyes last night said will did or didnt it happen they both gazed toward the far meadows the air was sweet as syrup they could find no shadows anywhere even under trees six minutes cried jim five four minutes later cornflakes lurching in their stomachs they frisked the leaves to a fine red dust going out of town with a wild flutter of breath they raised their eyes from the earth they had been treading and the carnival was there hey for the tents were lemon like the sun brass like wheat fields a few weeks ago flags and banners bright as bluebirds snapped above lioncoloured canvas from booths painted cottoncandy colours fine saturday smells of bacon and eggs hot dogs and pancakes swam with the wind everywhere ran boys everywhere sleepy fathers followed its just a plain old carnival said will like heck said jim we werent blind last night cone on they marched one hundred yards straight on and deep into the midway and the deeper they went the more obvious it became they would find no night men cattreading shadow while strange tents plumed like thunder clouds instead close up the carnival was mildewed rope motheaten canvas rainworn sunbleached tinsel the sideshow paintings hung like sad albatrosses on their poles flapped and let fall flakes of ancient paint shivering and at the same time revealing the unwondrous wonders of a thin man fatman needlehead tattooed man hula dancer they prowled on but found no mysterious midnight sphere of evil gas tied by mysterious oriental knots to daggers plunged in dark earth no maniac ticket takers bent on terrible revenges the calliope by the ticket booth neither screamed deaths nor hummed idiot songs to itself the train pulled off on a spur in the warming grass it was old yes and welded tight with rust but it looked like a titanic magnet that had collected to itself from locomotive boneyards across three continents drive shafts flywheels smoke stacks and handmedown secondrate nightmares it did not cut a black and mortuary silhouette it asked permission but to lie dead in autumn strewings so much tired steam and iron gunpowder blowing away jim will here came miss foley their seventhgrade schoolteacher along the midway all smiles boys she said whats wrong you look as if you lost something well said will last night did you hear that calliope calliope no then whyre you out here so early miss foley asked jim i love carnivals said miss foley a little woman lost somewhere in her grey fifties beaming around ill buy hot dogs and you eat while i look for my fool nephew you seen him nephew robert staying with me a fewweeks fathers dead mothers sick in wisconsin i took him in he ran out here early today said hed meet me but you know boys my you look glum she shoved food at them eat cheer up ridesll open in ten minutes meantime i think ill spy through that mirror maze and no said will no what asked miss foley no mirror maze will swallowed he stared at fathoms of reflections you could never strike bottom there it was like winter standing tall waiting to kill you with a glance miss foley he said at last and wondered to hear his mouth say it dont go in there why not jim peered fascinated into wills face yeah tell us why not people get lost said will lamely all the more reason robert might be wandering loose and not find his way out if i dont grab his ear never can tell will could not take his eyes off the millions of miles of blind grasswhat might be s around in there swimming miss foley laughed what a lovely mind you have willy well yes but im an old fish so miss foley miss foley waved poised took a step and vanished into the mirror ocean they watched as she settled wandered sank deep deep and was finally dissolved grey among silver jim grabbed will what was all that gosh jim its the mirrors theyre the only things i dont like i mean theyre the only things like last night boy boy you been out in the sun snorted jim that maze there is his voice trailed off he sniffed the cold air blowing out as from an ice house between the tall reflections jim you were saying but jim said nothing after a long time he clapped his hand to the back of his neck it really does he cried in soft amaze what does hair i read it all my life in scary stories it stands on end mines doing itnow gosh jim sos mine they stood entranced with the delicious cold bumps on their necks and the suddenly stiffened small hairs quilled up over their scalps there was a flourish of light and shadow bumping through the mirror maze they saw two four a dozen miss foleys they didnt know which one was real so they waved to all of them but none of the miss foleys saw or waved back blind she walked blind she tacked her nails to cold glass miss foley her eyes flexed wide as from blasts of photographic powder were skinned white like a statues deep under the glass she spoke she murmured she whimpered now she cried now she shouted now she yelled she knocked glass with her head her elbows tilted drunken as a lightblind moth raised her hands in claws oh god help she wailed help oh god jim and will saw their own faces pale their own eyes wide in the mirrors as they plunged miss foley here jim cracked his brow this way but will found only cold glass a hand flew from empty space an old womans hand sinking for the last time it seized anything to save itself the anything was will she pulled him under will jim jim and jim held him and he held her and pulled her free of the silently rushing mirrors coming in from the desolate seas they stepped into sunlight miss foley one hand to her bruised cheek bleated muttered then laughed quickly then gasped and wiped her eyes thank you will jim oh thank you id of drowned i meanoh will you were right my god did you see her shes lost drowned in there poor girl oh the poor lost sweetsave her oh we must save her miss foley boy youre hurting will firmly removed her fists from clenching the flesh of his arm theres no one in there i saw her please look save her will jumped to the maze entrance and stopped the ticket taker gave him an idle glance of contempt will backed away to miss foley i swear no one went in ahead or after you maam its my fault i joked about the water you mustve got mixed up lost and scared but if she heard she went on biting the back of her hand her voice the voice of someone come out of the sea after no air a long dread time deep no hope of life and now set free gone shes at the bottom poor girl i knew her i know you i said when i first saw her a minute ago i waved she waved hello i ranbang i fell she fell a dozen a thousand of her fell wait i said oh she looked so fine so lovely so young but it scared me whatre you doing here i said why i think she said im real youre not she laughed way under water she ran off in the maze we must find her before miss foley wills arm around her took a last trembling breath and grew strangely quiet jim was staring deep into those cold mirrors looking for sharks that could not be seen miss foley he said what did she look like miss foleys voice was pale but calm the fact isshe looked like myself many many years ago ill go home now she said miss foley well no stay im just fine have fun boys enjoy and she walked slowly away alone down the midway somewhere a vast animal made water ammonia made the wind turn ancient as it passed im leaving said will will said jim were staying until sundown boy dark sundown and figure it all you chicken no murmured will butanybody want to dive back in that maze jim gazed fiercely deep into the bottomless sea where now only the pure light glanced back at itself help up emptiness upon emptiness beyond emptiness before their eyes nobody jim let his heart beat twice i guess a bad thing happened at sunset jim vanished through noon and after noon they had screamed up half the rides knocked over dirty milkbottles smashed kewpiedoll winning plates smelling listening looking their way through the autumn crowd trampling the leafy sawdust and then quite suddenly jim was gone and will not asking anyone but himself absolutely silent certainsure walked steadily through the late crowd as the sky was turning plum coloured until he came to the maze and paid his dime and stepped up inside and called softly just one time jim and jim was there half in half out of the cold glass tides like someone abandoned on a seashore when a dose friend has gone far out and there is wonder if he will ever come back jim stood as if he had not moved so much as an eyelash in five minutes staring his mouth halfopen waiting for the next wave to come in and show him more jim get outa there will jim sighed faintly let me be like heck with one leap will grabbed jims belt and hauled shuffling backward jim did not seem to know he was being dragged from the maze for he kept protesting in awe at some unseen wonder oh will oh willy will oh willy jim you nut im taking you home what what what they were in cold air the sky was darker than plums now with a few clouds burning late sunfire above the sunfire flamed on jims feverish cheeks his open lips his wide and terribly rich green shining eyes jim whatd you see in there the same as miss foley what what im gonna bust your nose come on he hustled pulled shoved half carried this fever this elation unstruggling friend cant tell you will wouldnt believe cant tell you in there oh in there in there shut up will socked his arm scare heck outa me just like she scared us bugs its almost suppertime folksll think were dead and buried they were striding now slashing the autumn grass with their shoes beyond the tents in the haysmelling leafmould fields will glaring at town jim staring back at the high nowdarkening banners as the last of the sun hid under the earth will we got to come back tonight okay come back alone jim stopped you wouldnt let me come alone youre always going to be around arent you will to protect me look who needs protection will laughed and then did not laugh again for jim was looking at him the last wild light dying in his mouth and caught in the thin hollows of his nostrils and in his suddenly deepset eyes youll always be with me huh will jim simply breathed warm upon him and his blood stirred with the old the familiar answers yes yes you know it yes yes and turning together they stumbled over a clanking dark mound of leather bag they stood for a long moment over the huge leather bag almost secretively will kicked it it made the sound of iron indigestion why said will that belongs to the lightningrod salesman jim slipped his hand through the leather mouth and hefted forth a metal shaft clustered with chimeras chinese dragons all fang eyeball and mossgreen armour all cross and crescent every symbol around the world that made men safe or seemed to clung there greaving the boys hands with odd weight and meaning storm never came but he went where and why did he leave his bag they both looked to the carnival where dusk coloured the canvas billows shadows ran coolly out to engulf them people in cars honked home in tired commotions boys on skeleton bikes whistled dogs after soon night would own the midway while shadows rode the ferris wheel up to cloud the stars people said jim dont leave their whole life lying around this is everything that old man owned something important jim breathed soft firemade him forget so he just walked off and left this here what whats so important you forget everything why jim examined his friend curiously twilight in his faceno one can tell you you find it yourself mysteries and mysteries storm salesman storm salesmans bag if we dont look now we might never know jim in ten minutes sure midwayll be dark everyone home for dinner just us alone but wont it feel great just us and here we go back in passing the mirror maze they saw two armiesa billion jims a billion willscollide melt vanish and like those armies so vanished the real army of people they boys stood alone among the encampments of dusk thinking of all the boys in town sitting down to warm food in bright rooms the redlettered sign said out of order keep off signs been up all day i dont believe signs said jim they peered in at the merrygoround which lay under a dry rattle and roar of windtumbled oak trees its horses goats antelopes zebras speared through their spines with brass javelins hung contorted as in a death rictus asking mercy with their frightcoloured eyes seeking revenge with their paniccoloured teeth dont look broke to me jim ambled across the clanking chain leaped to a turntable surface vast as the moon among the frantic but forever spelled beasts jim will this is the only ride we havent looked at so jim swayed the lunatic carousel world stirred atilt with his lean bulk he strolled through brass forests amidst animal rousts he swung astride a plumdusk stallion ho boy git a man rose from machinery darkness jim reaching out from the shadows among the calliope tubes and moonskinned drums the man hoisted jim yelling out on the air help will help will leaped through the animals the man smiled easily welcomed him handily swung him high beside jim they stared down at bright flamered hair bright flameblue eyes and rippling biceps out of order said the man cant you read put them down said a gentle voice hung high jim and will glanced over at a second man standing tall beyond the chains down he said again and they were carried through the brass forest of wild but uncomplaining brutes and set in the dust we were said will curious this second man was tall as a lamp post his pale face lunar pockmarks denting it cast light on those who stood below his vest was the colour of fresh blood his eyesbrows his hair his suit were licorice black and the sunyellow gem which stared from the tiepin thrust in his cravat was the same unblinking shade and bright crystal as his eyes but in this instant swiftly and with utter clearness it was the suit which fascinated will for it seemed woven of boarbramble clockspring hair bristle and a sort of evertrembling everglistening dark hemp the suit caught light and stirred like a bed of black tweedthorns interminably itching covering the mans long body with motion so it seemed he should excruciate cry out and tear the clothes free yet here he stood mooncalm inhabiting his itchweed suit and watching jims mouth with his yellow eyes he never looked once at will the name is dark he flourished a white calling card it turned blue whisper red whisk a green man dangled from a tree stamped on the card flit shh dark and my friend with the red hair there is mr cooger of cooger and darks flipflickshhh names appeared disappeared on the white square combined shadow shows tickwash a mushroomwitch stirred mouldering herb pots and crosscontinental pandemonium theatre company he handed the card to jim it now read our speciality to examine oil polish and repair death watch beetles calmly jim read it calmly jim put a fist into his copious and richly treasured pockets rummaged and held out his hand on his palm lay a dead brown insect here jim said fix this mr dark exploded his laugh superb i will he extended his hand his shirt sleeve pulled up bright purple black green and lightningblue eels worms and latin scrolls slid to view on his wrist boy cried will you must be the tattooed man no jim studied the stranger the illustrated man theres a difference mr dark nodded pleased whats your name boy dont tell him thought will and stopped why not he wondered why jims lips hardly twitched simon he said he smiled to show it was a lie mr dark smiled to show he knew it want to see more simon jim would not give him the satisfaction of a nod slowly with great mouthworking pleasure mr dark pushed his sleeve high to his elbow jim stared the arm was like a cobra weaving bobbing swaying to strike mr dark clenched his fist wriggled his fingers the muscles danced will wanted to run around and see but could only watch thinking jim oh jim for there stood jim and there was this tall man each examining the other as if he were a reflection in a shop window late at night the tall mans brambled suit shadowed out now to colour jims cheeks and storm over his wide and drinking eyes with a look of rain instead of the sharp catgreen they always were jim stood like a runner who has come a long way fever in his mouth hands open to receive any gift and right now it was a gift of pictures twitched in pantomime as mr dark made his illustrious jerk coldskinned over his warmpulsed wrist as the stars came out above and jim stared and will could not see and a long way off the last of the town people went away toward town in their warm cars and jim said faintly gosh and mr dark rolled down his sleeve shows over suppertime carnivals shut up until seven everyone out come back simon and ride the merrygoround when its fixed take this card free ride jim stared at the hidden wrist and put the card in his pocket so long jim ran will ran jim whirled glanced back leaped and for the second time in the hour vanished will looked up into the tree where jim squirmed on a limb hidden mr dark and mr cooger were turned away busy with the merrygoround quick will jim theyll see you jump will jumped jim hauled him up the great tree shook a wind roared by in the sky jim helped him cling gasping among the branches jim we dont belong here shut up look whispered jim somewhere in the carousel machinery there were taps and brass knockings a faint squeal and whistle of calliope steam what was on his arm jim a picture yeah but what kind it wasjim shut his eyes it wasa picture of asnakethats itsnake but when he opened his eyes he would not look at will okay if you dont want to tell me i told you will a snake ill get him to show it to you later you want that no thought will i dont want that he looked down at the billion footprints left in the sawdust on the empty midway and suddenly it was a lot closer to midnight than to noon im going home sure will go on mirror mazes old teacherladies lost lightningrod bags lightningrod salesmen disappear snake pictures dancing unbroken merrygorounds and you want to go home sure old friend will so long i will started dwon the tree and froze all clear cried a voice below clear someone shouted at the far end of the midway mr dark moved not fifty feet away to a red control box near the merrygoround ticket booth he glared in all directions he glared into the tree will hugged jim hugged the limb tightened into smallness start up with a pop a bang a jangle of reins a lift and downfall a rise and descent of brass the carousel moved but thought will its broke out of order he flicked a glance at jim who pointed wildly down the merrygoround was running yes but it was running backward the small calliope inside the carousel machinery rattlesnapped its nervousstallion shivering drums clashed its harvestmoon cymbals toothed its castanets and throatily choked and sobbed its reeds whistles and baroque flutes the music will thought its backward too mr dark jerked about glanced up as if he had heard wills thoughts a wind shook the trees in black tumults mr dark shrugged and looked away the carousel wheeled faster shrieking plunging going roundaboutback now mr cooger with his flaming red hair and fireblue eyes was pacing the midway making a last check he stood under their tree will could have let spit down on him then the calliope gave a particularly violent cry of foul murder which made dogs howl in far counties and mr cooger spinning ran and leaped on the backwhirling universe of animals who tail first head last pursued an endless circling night toward unfound and never to be discovered destinations handslapping brass poles he flung himself into a seat where with his bristly red hair pink face and incredible sharp blue eyes he sat silent going back around back around the music squealing swift back with him like insucked breath the music thought will what is it and how do i know its backside first he hugged the limb tried to catch the tune then hum it forward in his head but the brass bells the drums hammered his chest revved his heart so he felt his pulse reverse his blood turn back in perverse thrusts through all his flesh so he was nearly shaken free to fall so all he did was clutch hang pale and drink the sight of the backwardturning machine and mr dark alert at the controls on the sidelines it was jim who first noticed the new thing happening for he kicked will once will looked over and jim nodded frantically at the man in the machine as he came around the next time mr coogers face was melting like pink wax his hands were becoming dolls hands his bones sank away beneath his clothes his clothes then shrank down to fit his dwindling frame his face flickered going and each time around he melted more will saw jims head shift circling the carousel wheeled a great backdrifting lunar dream the horses thrusting the music ingasped after while mr cooger as simple as shadows as simple as light as simple as time got younger and younger and younger each time he wheeled to view he sat alone with his bones which shaped like warm candles burning away to tender years he gazed serenely at the fiery constellations the childreninhabited trees which went away from him as he removed himself from them and his nose finished and his sweet wax ears reshaped themselves to small pink roses now no longer forty where he had begun his backspiraled journey mr cooger was nineteen around went the reverse parade of horse pole music man become young man young man fast rendered down to boy mr cooger was seventeen sixteen another and another time around under the sky and trees and will whispering jim counting the times around around while the night air warmed to summer heat by friction of sunmetal brass the passionate backturned flight of beasts wore the wax doll down and down and washed him clean with the still stranger musics until all ceased all died away to stillness the calliope shut up its brassworks the ironmongery machines hissed off and with a last faint whine like desert sands blown backup arabian hourglasses the carousel rocked on seaweed waters and stood still the figure seated in the carved white wooden sleigh chair was very small mr cooger was twelve years old no wills mouth shaped the word no jims did the same the small shape stepped down from the silent world its face in shadow but its hands newborn wrinkled pink held out in raw carnival lamplight the strange manboy shot his gaze up down smelling fright somewhere terror and awe in the vicinity will balled himself tight and shut his eyes he felt the terrible gaze shoot through the leaves like brown needledarts pass on then rabbitrunning the small shape lit off down the empty midway jim was first to stir the leaves aside mr dark was gone too in the evening hush it seemed to take jim forever to fall down to earth will fell after and they both stood clamorous with alarms shaken by concussions of silent pantomime blasted by events all the more numbing because they ran off into the night unknown and it was jim who spoke from their mutual confusion and trembling as each held to the others arm seeing the small shadow rush luring them across the meadow oh will i wish we could go home i wish we could eat but its too late we saw we got to see more dont we lord said will miserably i guess we do and they ran together following they didnt know what on out and away to who could possibly guess where out on the highway the last faint watercolours of the sun were gone beyond the hills and whatever they were chasing was so far ahead as to be only a swiftfleck now shown in lamplight now set free running into dark twentyeight gasped jim twentyeight times the merrygoround sure will jerked his head twentyeight times i counted it went around back up ahead the small shape stopped and looked back jim and will ducked in by a tree and let it move on it thought will why do i think it hes a boy hes a mannoit is something that has changed thats what it is they reached and passed the city limits and swiftly jogging will said jim there mustve been two people on that ride mr cooger and this boy and no i never took my eyes off him they ran by the barber shop will saw but did not see a sign in the window he read but did not read he remembered he forgot he plunged on hey hes turned on culpepper street quick they rounded a corner hes gone the street lay long and empty in the lamplight leaves blew on the hopscotchchalked sidewalks will miss foley lives on this street sure fourth house but jim strolled casually whistling hands in pockets will with him at miss foleys house they glanced up in one of the softly lit front windows someone stood looking out a boy no more and no less than twelve years old will cried jim softly that boy her nephew nephew heck keep your head away maybe he can read lips walk slow to the corner and back you see his face the eyes will thats one part of people dont change young old six or sixty boys face sure but the eyes were the eyes of mr cooger no yes they both stopped to enjoy the swift pound of each others heart keep moving they moved jim held wills arm tight leading him you did see mr coogers eyes huh when he held us up fit to crack our heads together you did see the boy just off the ride he looked right up near me hid in the tree and boy it was like opening the door of a furnace ill never forget those eyes and there they are now in the window turn around now lets walk back easy and nice and slowwe got to warn miss foley whats hiding in her house dont we jim look you dont give a darn about miss foley or whats in her house jim said nothing walking arm in arm with will he just looked over at his friend and blinked once let the lids come down over his shiny green eyes and go up and again will had the feeling about jim that he had always had about an old almost forgotten dog some time every year that dog good for many months just ran on out into the world and didnt come back for days and finally did limp back all burred and scrawny and odorous of swamps and dumps he had rolled in the dirty mangers and foul droppingplaces of the world simply to turn home with a funny little smile pinned to his muzzle dad had named the dog plato the wilderness philosopher for you saw by his eyes there was nothing he didnt know returned the dog would live in innocence again tread patterns of grace for months then vanish and the whole thing start over now walking here he thought he heard jim whimper under his breath he could feel the bristles stiffen all over jim he felt jims ears flatten saw him sniff the new dark jim smelled smells that no one knew heard ticks from clocks that told another time even his tongue was strange now moving along his lower and now his upper lip as they stopped in front of miss foleys house again the front window was empty going to walk up and ring the bell said jim what meet him face to face my aunts eyebrows will we got to check dont we shake his paw stare him in his good eye or some such and if it is him we dont warn miss foley right in front of him do we well phone her later dumb up we go will sighed and let himself be walked up the steps wanting but not wanting to know if the boy in this house had mr cooger hid but showing like a firefly between his eyelashes jim rang the bell what if he answers will demanded boy im so scared i could sprinkle dust jim why arent you scared why jim examined both of his untrembled hands ill be darned he gasped youre right im not the door swung wide miss foley beamed out at them jim will how nice miss foley blurted will you okay jim glared at him miss foley laughed why shouldnt i be will flushed all those darn carnival mirrors nonsense ive forgotten all about it well boys are you coming in she held the door wide will shuffled a foot and stopped beyond miss foley a beaded curtain hung like a dark blue thunder shower across the parlour entry where the coloured rain touched the floor a pair of dusty small shoes poked out just beyond the downpour the evil boy loitered evil will blinked why evil because because was reason enough a boy yes and evil robert miss foley turned calling through the dark blue alwaysfalling beads of rain she took wills hand and gently pulled him inside come meet two of my students the rain poured aside a fresh candypink hand broke through all by itself as if testing the weather in the hall good grief thought will hell look me in the eye see the merrygoround and himself on it moving back back i know its printed on my eyeball like i been struck by lightning miss foley said will now a pink face stuck out through the dim frozen necklaces of storm we got to tell you a terrible thing jim struck wills elbow hard to shut him now the body came out through the dark watery flow of beads the rain shushed behind the small boy miss foley leaned toward him expectant jim gripped his elbow fiercely he stammered flushed then spat it out mr crosetti quite suddenly clearly he saw the sign in the barbers window the sign seen but not seen as they ran by closed on account of illness mr crosetti he repeated and added swiftly hesdead whatthe barber the barber echoed jim see this haircut will turned trembling his hand to his head he did it and we just walked by there and the sign was up and people told us what a shame miss foley was reaching out to fetch the strange boy forward im so sorry boys this is robert my nephew from wisconsin jim stuck out his hand robert the nephew examined it curiously what are you looking at he asked you look familiar said jim jim will yelled to himself like an uncle of mine said jim all sweet and calm the nephew flicked his eyes to will who looked only at the floor afraid the boy would see his eyeballs whirl with the remembered carousel crazily he wanted to hum the backward music now he thought face him he looked up straight at the boy and it was wild and crazy and the floor sank away beneath for there was the pink shiny halloween mask of a small pretty boys face but almost as if holes were cut where the eyes of mr cooger shone out old old eyes as bright as sharp blue stars and the light from those stars taking a million years to get here and through the little nostrils cut in the shiny mask mr coogers breath went in steam came out ice and the valentine candy tongue moved small behind those trim white candykernel teeth mr cooger somewhere behind the eyeslits went blinkclick with his insectkodak pupils the lenses exploded like suns then burnt chilly and serene again he swivelled his glance to jim blinkclick he had jim flexed focused shot developed dried filed away in the dark blinkclick yet this was only a boy standing in a hall with two other boys and a women and all the while jjm gazed steadily back feathers unruffled taking his own pictures of robert have you boys had supper asked miss foley were just sitting down we got to go everyone looked at will as if amazed he didnt want to stick here forever jim he stammered your moms home alone oh sure jim said reluctantly i know what the nephew paused for their attention when their faces turned mr cooger inside the nephew went silently blinkclick blinkclick listening through the toy ears watching through the toycharm eyes whetting the dolls mouth with a pekingese tongue join us later for dessert huh dessert im taking aunt willa to the carnival the boy stroked miss foleys arm until she laughed nervously carnival cried will and lowered his voice miss foley you said i said i was foolish and scared myself said miss foley its saturday night the best night for tent shows and showing my nephew the sights join us asked robert holding miss foleys hand later great said jim jim said will we been out all day your moms sick i forgot jim flashed him a look filled with purest snakepoison flick the nephew made an xray of both showing them no doubt as cold bones trembling in warm flesh he stuck out his hand tomorrow then meet you by the sideshows swell jim grabbed the small hand so long will jumped out the door then turned with a last agonized appeal to the teacher miss foley yes will dont go with that boy he thought dont go near the shows stay home oh please but then he said mr crosettis dead she nodded touched waiting for his tears and while she waited he dragged jim outside and the door swung shut on miss foley and the pink small face with the lenses in it going blinkclick snapshotting two incoherent boys and them fumbling down the steps in october dark while the merrygoround started again in wills head rushing while the leaves in the trees above cracked and fried with wind aside will spluttered jim you shook hands with him mr cooger youre not going to meet him its mr cooger all right boy those eyes if i met him tonight wed solve the whole shooting match whats eating you will eating me at the bottom of the steps now they tussled in fierce and frantic whispers glancing up at the empty windows where now and again a shadow passed will stopped the music turned in his head stunned he squinched his eyes jim the music that the calliope played when mr cooger got younger yeah it was the funeral march played backward which funeral march which jim chopin only wrote one tune the funeral march but why played backward mr cooger was marching away from the grave not toward it wasnt he getting younger smaller instead of older and dropping dead willy youre terrific sure but will stiffened hes there the window again wave at him so long now walk and whistle something not chopin for gosh sakes jim waved will waved both whistled oh susanna the shadow gestured small in the high window the boys hurried off down the street two suppers were waiting in two houses one parent yelled at jim two parents yelled at will both were sent hungry upstairs it started at seven oclock it was done by seventhree doors slammed locks clanked clocks ticked will stood by the door the telephone was locked away outside and even if he called miss foley wouldnt answer by now shed be gone beyond towngood grief anyway what could he say miss foley that nephews no nephew that boys no boy wouldnt she laugh she would for the nephew was a nephew the boy was a boy or seemed such he turned to the window jim across the way stood facing the same dilemma in his room both struggled it was too early to raise the windows and stagewhisper to each other parents below were busy growing crystalradio peachfuzz in their ears alert the boys threw themselves on their separate beds in their separate houses probed mattresses for chocolate chunks put away against the lean years and ate moodily clocks ticked nine ninethirty ten the knob rattled softly as dad unlocked the door dad thought will come in we got to talk but dad chewed his breath in the hall only his confusion his always puzzled halfbewildered face could be felt beyond the door he wont come in thought will walk around talk around back off from a thing yes but come sit listen when had he when would he ever will will quickened will said dad be careful careful cried mother coming along the hall is that all youre going to say what else dad was going downstairs now he jumps i creep how can you get two people together like that hes too young im too old god sometimes i wish wed never the door shut dad was walking away on the sidewalk will wanted to fling up the window and call suddenly dad was so lost in the night not me dont worry about me dad he thought you dad stay in its not safe dont go but he didnt shout and when he softly raised the window at last the street was empty and he knew it would be just a matter of time before that light went on in the library across town when rivers flooded when fire fell from the sky what a fine place the library was the many rooms the books with luck no one found you how could theywhen you were off to tanganyika in cairo in florence in careful what did dad mean did he smell the panic had he heard the music had he prowled near the tents no not dad ever will tossed a marble over at jims window tap silence he imagined jim seated alone in the dark his breath like phosphorous on the air ticking away to himself tap silence this wasnt like jim always before the window slid up jims head popped out ripe with yells secret hissings giggles riots and rebel charges jim i know youre there tap silence dads out in the town miss foleys with youknowwho he thought good gosh jim we got to do something tonight he threw a last marble tap it fell to the hushed grass below jim did not come to the window tonight thought will he bit his knuckles he lay back cold straight stiff on his bed in the alley behind the house was a huge oldfashioned pineplank boardwalk it had been there ever since will remembered since civilization unthinkingly poured forth the dull hard unresisting cement sidewalks his grandfather a man of strong sentiment and wild impulse who let nothing go without a roar had flexed his muscles in favour of this vanishing landmark and with a dozen handymen had toted a good forty feet of the walk into the alley where it had lain like the skeleton of some indefinable monster through the years baked by sun lushly rotted by rains the town clock struck ten lying abed will realized he had been thinking about grandfathers vast gift from another time he was waiting to hear the boardwalk speak in what language well boys have never been known to go straight up to houses to ring bells to summon forth friends they prefer to chunk dirt at clapboards hurl acorns down roof shingles or leave mysterious notes flapping from kites stranded on attic window sills so it was with jim and will late nights if there were gravestones to be leapfrogged or dead cats to be hurled down sour peoples chimneys one or the other of the boys would prowl out under the moon and xylophonedance on that old hollowechoing musical boardwalk over the years they had tuned the walk prising up an a board and nailing it here lifting up an f board and pounding it back down there until the walk was as near onto being melodious as weather and two entrepreneurs could fashion it by the tune treaded out you could tell the nights venture if will heard jim tramping hard on seven or eight notes of way down upon the swanee river he scrambled out knowing it was moontrail time on the creek leading to the river caves if jim heard will out leaping about like a scalded airedale on the timbers and the tune remotely suggested marching through georgia it meant plums peaches or apples were ripe enough to get sick on out beyond town so this night will held his breath waiting for some tune to call him forth what kind of tune would jim play to represent the carnival miss foley mr cooger andor the evil nephew tenfifteen tenthirty no music will did not like jim sitting in his room thinking what of the mirror maze what had he seen there and seeing what did he plan will stirred restively especially he did not like to think of jim with no father between him and the tent shows and all that lay dark in the meadows and a mother who wanted him around so very much he just had to get away get out breathe free night air know free night waters running toward bigger freer seas jim he thought lets have the music and at tenthirtyfive it came he heard or thought he heard jim out in the starlight leaping way up and coming flat down like a spring tomcat on the vast xylophone and the tune was or wasnt it like the funeral dirge played backward by the old carousel calliope will started to raise his window to be sure but suddenly jims window slid quietly up he hadnt been down on the boards it was just wills wild wish that made the tune will started to whisper but stopped for jim without a word scuttled down the drainpipe jim will thought jim on the lawn stiffened as if hearing his name youre not going without me jim jim glanced swiftly up if he saw will he made no sign jim will thought were still pals smell things nobody else smells hear things no one else hears got the same blood run the same way now this first time ever youre sneaking out ditching me but the driveway was empty a salamander flicking the hedge there went jim will was out the window down the trellis and over the hedge before he thought im alone if i lose jim its the first time ill be out alone at night too and where am i going wherever jim goes lord let me keep up jim skimmed like a dark owl after a mouse will loped like a weaponless hunter after the owl they sailed their shadows over october lawns and when they stopped there was miss foleys house jim glanced back will became a bush behind a bush a shadow among shadows with two starlight rounds of glass his eyes holding the image of jim calling up in a whisper toward the secondfloor windows hey therehey good grief thought will he wants to be slit and stuffed with broken mirror maze glass hey called jim softly you a shadow uprose on a dimlit shade above a small shadow the nephew had brought miss foley home they were in their separate rooms oroh lord thought will i hope shes safe home maybe like the lightningrod salesman she hey jim gazed up with that funny warm look of breathless anticipation he often had nights in summer at the shadowshow window theatre in that house a few streets over looking up with love with devotion like a cat jim waited for some special dark mouse to run forth crouched now slowly he seemed to grow taller as if his bones were pulled by the in the window above which now suddenly vanished will ground his teeth he felt the shadow sift down through the house like a cold breath he could wait no longer he leaped forth jim he seized jims arm will what you doing here jim dont talk to him get out of here my gosh hell chew and spit out your bones jim writhed himself free will go home youll spoil everything he scares me jim what you want from him this afternoonin the maze did you see something yes for gosh sakes what will grabbed jims shirt front felt his heart bang under the chest bones jim let go jim was terribly quiet if he knows youre here he won t come out willy if you dont let go ill remember when when what when im older darn it older jim spat as if he was struck by lightning will jumped back he looked at his empty hands and put one up to wipe the spittle off his cheek oh jim he mourned and he heard the merrygoround motioning gliding on black night waters around around and jim on a black stallion riding off and about circling in treeshadow and he wanted to cry out look the merrygoround i you want it to go forward dont you jim forward instead of back and you on it around once and youre fifteen circling and youre sixteen three times more and nineteen music and youre twenty and off standing tall not jim any more still thirteen almost fourteen on the empty midway with me small me young me scared will hauled off and hit jim hard on the nose then he jumped jim wrapped him tight and toppled him rolling down yelling in the bushes he slapped jims mouth stuffed it mashed it full of fingers to snap and bite at suffocating the angry grunts and yells the front door opened will crushed the air out of jim lay heavy on him fisting his mouth tight something stood on the porch a tiny shadow scanned the town searching for but not finding jim but it was just the boy robert the friendly nephew come almost casually forth hands in pockets whistling under his breath to breathe the night air as boys do curious for adventures that they themselves must make that rarely happen by threshed tight mortally locked and bound to jim staring up will was all the more shaken to see the normal boy the airy glance the unassuming poise the small the easy self in which no man at all was revealed by street light at any moment robert in full cry might leap to play with them tangle legs lock arms barksnap like pups in may the whole thing end with them strewn in laughing tears on the lawn the terror spent the fear melted off in dew a dream of nothings quickly gone such as dreams go when the eye snaps wide for there indeed stood the nephew his face round fresh and creamsmooth as a peach and he was smiling down at the two boys he now saw locked limb in limb on the grass then swiftly he darted in he must have run upstairs scrabbled about and hurtled down again for suddenly as the two boys outthrashed outgripped outraged each other there was a rain of tinkling rattling glitter on the lawn the nephew leaped the porch rail and landed panthersoft imbedded in his shadow on the grass his hands were delicious with stars these he liberally sprinkled they thudded slithered winked at jims side both boys lay stricken by the rain of gold and diamond fire that pelted them help police cried robert will was so shocked he let go jim jim was so shocked he let go will both reached at the same time for the cold strewn ice good grief a bracelet a ring a necklace robert kicked two trash cans at the curb fell thundering a bedroom light above flicked on police robert threw one last spray of glitter at their feet shut up his freshpeach smile like locking an explosion away in a box and shot away down the street wait jim jumped we wont hurt you will tripped him jim fell the window upstairs opened miss foley leaned out jim on his knees held a womans wrist watch will blinked at a necklace in his hands whos there she cried jim will whats that you got but jim was running will stopped only long enough to see the window empty itself with a wail as miss foley pulled in to see her room when he heard her full scream he knew she had discovered the burglary running will knew he was doing just what the nephew wanted he should turn back pick up the jewels tell miss foley what happened but he must save jim far back he heard miss foleys new cries turn on more lights will halloway jim nightshade night runners thieves thats us thought will oh my lord thats us no onell believe anything we say from now on not about carnivals not about carousels not about mirrors or evil nephews not about nothing and so they ran three animals in starlight a black otter a tomcat a rabbit me thought will im the rabbit and he was white and much afraid they hit the carnival grounds at a good twenty miles an hour give or take a mile the nephew in the lead jim close behind and will further back gasping shotgun blasts of fatigue in his feet his head his heart the nephew running scared looked back not smiling fooled him thought will he figured i wouldnt follow figured id call the police get stuck not be believed or run hide now hes scared ill beat the tar out of him and wants to jump on that ride and run around getting older and bigger than me oh jim jim we got to stop him keep him young tear his skin off but he knew from jims running thered be no help from jim jim wasnt running after nephews he was running toward free rides the nephew vanished around a tent far ahead jim followed by the time will reached the midway the merrygoround was popping to life in the pulse the din the squealaround of music the small freshfaced nephew rode the great platform in a swirl of midnight dust jim ten feet back watched the horses leap his eyes striking fire from the highjumped stallions eyes the merrygoround was going forward jim leaned at it jim cried will the nephew swept from sight borne around by the machine drifted back again he stretched out pink fingers urging softly jim jim twitched one foot forward no will plunged he knocked seized held jim they toppled they fell in a heap the nephew surprised whisked on in darkness one year older one year older thought will on the earth one year taller bigger meaner oh god jim quick he jumped up ran to the control box the complex mysteries of brass switch and porcelain covering and sizzling wires he struck the switch but jim behind babbling tore at wills hands will youll spoil it no jim knocked the switch full back will spun and slapped his face each clenched the others elbows rocked failed they fell against the control box will saw the evil boy a year older still glide around into night five or six more times around and hed be bigger than the two of them jim hell kill us not me no will felt a sting of electricity he yelled pulled back hit the switch handle the control box spat lightning jumped to the sky jim and will flung by the blast lay watching the merrygoround run wild the evil boy whistled by clenched to a brass tree he cursed he spat he wrestled with wind with centrifuge he was trying to clutch his way through the horses the poles to the outer rim of the carousel his face came went came went he clawed he brayed the control box erupted blue showers the carousel jumped and bucked the nephew slipped he fell a black stallions steel hoof kicked him blood printed his brow jim hissed rolled thrashed will riding him hard pressing him to grass trading yell for yell both frightpale heart ramming heart electric bolts from the switch flushed up in white stars a gush of fireworks the carousel spun thirty spun fortywill let me upspun fifty times the calliope howled boiled steam ran ancient dry then played nothing its keys gibbering as only chitterings boiled up through the vents lightning unravelled itself over the sweated outflung boys delivered flame to the silent horse stampede to light their way around around with the figure lying on the platform no longer a boy but a man no longer a man but more than a man and even more and even more much more than that around around hes hes oh hes oh look will hes gasped jim and began to sob because it was the only thing to do locked down nailed tight oh god will get up we got to make it run backward lights flashed on in the tents but no one came out why not will thought crazily the explosions the electric storm do the freaks think the whole worlds jumping through the midway wheres mr dark in town up to no good what where why he thought he heard the agonized figure sprawled on the carousel platform drum his heart superfast then slow fast slow very fast very slow incredibly fast then as slow as the moon going down the sky on a white night in winter someone something on the carousel wailed faintly thank god its dark thought will thank god i cant see there goes someone here comes something there whatever it is goes again there there a black shadow on the shuddering machine tried to stagger up but it was late late later still very late latest of all oh very late the shadow crumbled the carousel like the earth spinning whipped away air sunlight sense and sensibility leaving only dark cold and age in a final vomit the switch box blew itself completely apart all the carnival lights blinked out the carousel slowed itself through the cold night wind will let jim go how many times thought will did it go around sixty eightyninety how many times said jims face all nightmare watching the dead carousel shiver and halt in the dead grass a stopped world now which nothing not their hearts hands or heads could send back anywhere they walked slowly to the merrygoround their shoes whispering the shadowy figure lay on the near side on the plank floor its face turned away one hand hung off the platform it did not belong to a boy it seemed a huge wax hand shrivelled by fire the mans hair was long spidery white it blew like milkweed in the breathing dark they bent to see the face the eyes were mummified shut the nose was collapsed upon gristle the mouth was a ruined white flower the petals twisted into a thin wax sheath over the clenched teeth through which faint bubblings sighed the man was small inside his clothes small as a child but tall strung out and old so old very old not ninety not one hundred no not one hundred and ten but one hundred and twenty or one hundred and impossible years old will touched the man was cold as an albino frog he smelled of moon swamps and old egyptian bandages he was something found in museums wrapped in nicotine linens sealed in glass but he was alive puling like a babe and shrivelling unto death fast very fast before their eyes will was sick over the side of the carousel then falling against each other jim and will sledgehammered the insane leaves the unbelievable grass the insubstantial earth with their numbed shoes fleeing off down the midway moths ticked off the high tinshaded arc light which swung abandoned above the crossroads below in a deserted gas station in the midst of country wilderness there was another ticking in a coffinsized phone booth speaking to people lost somewhere across night hills two whitefaced boys were crammed holding to each other at every flit of bat each sliding of cloud across the stars will hung up the phone the police and an ambulance were coming at first he and jim had shoutwhisperedwheezed at each other pumping along stumbling they should go home sleep forgetno they should take a freight train westno for mr cooger if he survived what theyd done to him that old man that old old old man would follow them over the world until he found them and tore them apart arguing shivering they ended up in a phone booth and now saw the police car bouncing along the road its siren moaning with the ambulance behind all the men looked out at the two boys whose teeth chattered in the mothflicked light three minutes later they all advanced down the dark midway jim leading the way talking gibbering hes alive hes got to be alive we didnt mean to do it were sorry he stared at the black tents you hear were sorry take it easy boy said one of the policemen go on the two policemen in midnight blue the two internes like ghosts the two boys made the last turn past the ferris wheel and reached the merrygoround jim groaned the horses trampled the night air in midplunge starlight glittered on the brass poles that was all hes gone he was here we swear said jim one hundred and fifty two hundred years old and dying of it jim said will the four men stirred uneasily they mustve taken him in a tent will started off a policeman took his elbow did you say one hundred and fifty years old he asked jim why not three hundred maybe he was oh god jim turned yelling mr cooger we brought help lights blinked on in the freak tent the huge banners out front rumbled and lashed as arc lights flushed over them the police glanced up mr skeleton the dust witch the crusher vesuvio the lava sippfr danced soft big painted each on its separate flag jim paused by the rustling freak show entry mr cooger he pleaded youthere the tent flaps mouthed out a warm lion air what asked a policeman jim read the moving flaps they said yesthey said come in jim stepped through the others followed inside they squinted through crisscrossed tent pole shadows to the high freak platforms and all the worldwandered aliens crippled of face of bone of mind waiting there at a rickety card table nearby four men sat playing orange limegreen sunyellow cards printed with moon beasts and winged sunsymbolled men here the akimbo skeleton one might play like a piccolo here the blimp who could be punctured every night pumped up at dawn here the midget known as the wart who could be mailed parcel post dirtcheap and next to him an even littler accident of cell and time a dwarf so small and perched in such a way you could not see his face behind the cards clenched before him in arthritic and tremulous oakgnarled fingers the dwarf will started something about those hands familar familiar where who what but his eyes snapped on there stood monsieur guillotine black tights black long stockings black hood over head arms crossed over his chest stiff straight by his chopping machine the blade high in the tent sky a hungry knife all flashes and meteor shine much desiring to cleave space below in the head cradle a dummy sprawled waiting quick doom there stood the crusher all ropes and tendons all steel and iron all bonemonger jawcruncher horseshoetaffypuller and there the lava sipper vesuvio of the chafed tongue of the scalded teeth who spun scores of fireballs up hissing in a ferris of flame which streaked shadows along the tent roof nearby in booths another thirty freaks watched the fires fly until the lava sipper glanced saw intruders and let his universe fall the suns drowned in a water tub steam billowed all froze in a tableau an insect stopped buzzing will glanced swiftly there on the biggest stage a tattoo needle poised like a blowgun dart in his rosecrusted hand stood mr dark the illustrated man his picture crowds flooded raw upon his flesh stripped bare to the navel he had been stinging himself adding a picture to his left palm with this dragonfly contraption now with the insect droned dead in his hand he wheeled but will staring beyond him cried there he is theres mr cooger the police the internes quickened behind mr dark sat the electric chair in this chair sat a ruined man last seen strewn wheezing in a collapse of bones and albino wax on the broken carousel now he was erected propped strapped in this device full of lightning power thats him he wasdying the blimp ascended to his feet the skeleton spun about tall the wart fleahopped to the sawdust the dwarf let fall his cards and flirted his now mad now idiot eyes ahead around over i know him thought will oh god what theyve done to him the lightningrod salesman thats who it was squeezed tight smashed small convulsed by some terrible nature into a clenched fist of humanity the seller of lightningrods but now two things happened with beautiful promptitude monsieur guillotine cleared his throat and the blade above in the canvas sky like a homing hawk scythed down whisperwhiskslitherthunderrushwham the dummy head chopcut fell and falling looked like wills own head own face destroyed he wanted he did not want to run lift the head turn it to see if it held his own profile but how could you ever dare do that never never in a billion years could one empty that wicker basket the second happened a mechanic working at the back of an upright glassfronted coffin booth released a trip wire this made a last cog click within the machinery under the sign mlle tarot the dust witch the wax womans figure within the glass box nodded her head and fixed the boys with her pointing nose as the boys passed leading the men her cold wax hand brushed the dust of destiny on a ledge within the coffin her eyes did not see they were sewn shut with laced blackwidow web dark threads a waxworks fright good and proper she was and the policemen beamed viewing her and strolled on and beamed at monsieur guillotine for his act too and moving the police were relaxing now and seemed not to mind being called late on a jolly venture into a rehearsing world of acrobats and seedy magicians gentlemen mr dark and his mob of illustrations surged forward on the pine platform a jungle beneath each arm an egyptian viper scrolled on each bicep welcome youre just in time were rehearsing all our new acts mr dark waved and strange monsters gaped their fangs from his chest a cyclops with a navel for a squinted moron eye twitched on his stomach as he strode lord thought will is he bringing that crowd with him or is the crowd pulling him along by his skin from all the creaked platforms from the muffled sawdust will felt the freaks wheel and fix their eyes enchanted as were internes and police by this illustrated throng of humanity that in one agglomerative move dominated and filled the immediate air and tent sky with silent shootings for attention now part of the waspneedle tattooed population spoke it was mr darks mouth over and above this calligraphic explosion this railroad accident of monsters in tumult upon his sweating skin mr dark chanted forth the organ tones from his chest his personal electric bluegreen populations trembled even as the real freaks on the sawdust tent floor trembled even as hearing in their most secret marrow jim and will trembled and felt more freak than the freaks themselves gentlemen boys weve just perfected the new act youll be the first to see cried mr dark the first policeman his hand casually nestled to his pistol holster squinted up at that vast corral of beasts and beings this boy said said the illustrated man barked a laugh the freaks leaped in a frolic of shock then calmed as the carnival owner continued with great ease patting and soothing his own illustrations which somehow patted and soothed the freaks said but what did he see boys always scare themselves at sideshows eh run like rabbits when the freaks pop out but tonight especially tonight the policemen glanced beyond to the erectorsetpapier mache relic constricted in the electric chair whos he will saw fire lick up through mr darks smokeclouded eyes saw him just as quickly snuff it out the new act mr electrico no look at the old man look will yelled the police turned to appraise his demon cry dont you see said will hes dead only thing holds him up is the straps the internes gazed up at the great flake of winter flung into and held by the black chair oh gosh thought will we thought it would all be simple the old man mr cooger dying so we bring doctors to save him so he forgives us maybe maybe the carnival doesnt hurt us lets us go but now this whats next hes dead its too late everyone hates us and will stood among the others feeling the cold air waft down from the unearthed mummy from the cold mouth and cold eyes locked up in frozen eyelids inside the frozen nostrils not a white hair stirred mr coogers ribs under his collapsed shirt were stonerigid and his teeth under his clay lips were dryice cold put him out at noon and fog would steam off him the internes glanced at each other they nodded the policemen at this took one step forward gentlemen mr dark scuttled a tarantula hand up an electric brass switchboard one hundred thousand volts will now bum mr electricos body no dont let him will cried the policemen took another step the internes opened their mouths to speak mr dark flicked a swift demanding glance at jim jim cried no its all right jim will yes its okay stand back the spider clutched the switch handle this man is in a trance as part of our new act i have hypnotized him he could suffer injury if you shocked him from his spell the internes shut their mouths the police stopped moving one hundred thousand volts yet he will come forth alive whole in sound mind and body no a policeman grabbed will the illustrated man and all the men and beasts asprawl in frenzies on him now snatched and banged the switch the tent lights snuffed out policemen internes boys jumped up their flesh in cobbles and boils but now in the swift midnight shuttering the electric chair was a hearth and on it the old man blazed like a blue autumn tree the police flinched back the internes leaned ahead as did the freaks blue fire in their eyes the illustrated man hand glued to switch looked upon the old old old man the old man was flintrock dead yes but electricity alive sheathed over him it swarmed on his cold shell ears it flickered in his deepasanabandonedstonewell nostrils it crept blue eels of power on his prayingmantis fingers and his grasshopper knees the illustrated mans lips thrust wide perhaps he yelled but no one heard against the immense fry blast the slam and sizzle of power which prowled in around over under about man and prisoning chair come alive cried the hum come alive cried the storming colour and light come alive yelled mr darks mouth which no one heard but jim reading lips read thunderous loud in his mind and will the same come alive willing the old man to five start up tick hum work juice summon spit ungum spirit melt wax soul hes dead but no one heard will either no matter how he pushed against the lightning clamour alive mr darks lips licked and savoured alive come alive he racheted the switch to the last notch live live somewhere dynamos protested skirled shrilled moaned a bestial energy the fight turned bottlegreen dead dead thought will but live alive cried machines cried flame and fire cried mouths of crowds of livid beasts on illustrated flesh so the old mans hair stood up in prickling fumes sparks bled from his fingernails dripped seething spatters on pine planks green simmerings wove shuttles through dead eyelids the illustrated man bent violently above the old old dead dead thing his prides of beasts drowned deep in sweat his right hand thrust in hammering demand upon the air live live and the old man came alive will yelled himself hoarse and no one heard for now very slowly as if roused by thunder as if the electric fire were new dawn one dead eyelid peeled itself slowly open the freaks gaped a long way off in the storm jim was yelling too for will had his elbow tight and felt the yell pouring out through the bones as the old mans lips fell apart and frightful sizzles zigzagged between lips and threaded teeth the illustrated man cut the power to a whine then turning he fell to his knees and put out his hand away off up there on the platform there was the faintest stir as of an autumn leaf beneath the old mans shirt the freaks exhaled the old old man sighed yes will thought theyre breathing for him helping him making him to live inhale exhale inhale exhaleyet it looked like an act what could he say or do lungs sososo someone whispered the dust witch back in her glass box inhale the freaks breathed exhale their shoulders slumped the old old mans lips trembled heart beatonetwososo the witch again will feared to look a vein ticked a small watch in the old mans throat very slowly now that right eye of the old man opened full wide fixed stared like a broken camera it was like looking through a hole in space with no bottom forever he grew warmer the boys below grew colder now the old and terriblywisewithnightmare eye was so wide and so deep and so alive all to itself in that smashed porcelain face that there at the bottom of the eye somewhere the evil nephew peered along and out at the freaks internes police and will will saw himself saw jim two little pictures posed in reflection on that single eye if the old man blinked the two images would be crushed by his lid the illustrated man on his knees turned at last and gentled all with his smile gentlemen boys here indeed is the man who lives with lightning the second policeman laughed this motion shook his hand off his holster will shuffled to the right the old spittleeye followed sucking at him with its emptiness will squirmed left as did the phlegm that was the old mans gaze while his chill lips peeled wide to shape reshape an echoed gasp a flutter from deep below the old man bounced his voice ricocheting off the dank stone walls of his body until it fell out his mouth welcomemmmmmm the words fell back in wellcummmmmmm the policemen nudged each other with identical smiles no cried will suddenly thats no act he was dead hed die again if you cut the power will slapped his own hand to his mouth lord he thought what am i doing i want him alive so hell forgive us let us be but oh lord even more i want him dead i want them all dead they scare me so much i got hairballs big as cats in my stomach im sorryhe whispered dont be cried mr dark the freaks made a commotion of blinks and glares what next from the statue in the cold sizzling chair the old old mans one eye gummed itself the mouth collapsed a bubble of yellow mud in a sulphur bath the illustrated man banged the switch a notch grinning wildly at no one he thrust a steel sword in the old mans empty glovelike hand a drench of electricity prickled from the sere musicbox tines of the ancient stubbled cheeks that deep eye showed swift as a bullet hole hungry for will it found and ate of his image the lips steamed isssawtheboysssssssssssneak into hee tenttttttt the desiccated bellows refilled then pinpunctured the swamp air out in faint wails werehearsingsssso i thoughtplaythissss trickpretend

electricity hemstitched the whistling lips the illustrated man coughed gently this act it tires mr electrico oh sure one of the policemen started sorry he touched his cap fine show fine said one of the internes will glanced swiftly to see the internes mouth what it looked like saying this but jim stood in the way boys a dozen free passes mr dark held them out here jim and will didnt move well said one policeman sheepishly will reached up for the flamecoloured tickets but stopped as mr dark said your names the officers winked at each other tell him boys silence the freaks watched simon said jim simon smith mr darks hand holding the tickets constricted oliver said will oliver brown the illustrated man sucked in a mighty breath the freaks inhaled the vast ingasped sigh might have seemed to stir mr electrico his sword twitched its tip leaped to sparksting wills shoulder then sizzle over in bluegreen explosions at jim lightning shot jims shoulder the policemen laughed the old old mans one wide eye blazed i dub theeasses and foolssssssi dubtheemr sicklyandmr pale mr electrico finished the sword tapped them asssshortsad lifefor you both then his mouth slit shut his raw eye glued over containing his cellar breath he let the simple sparks swarm his blood like dark champagne the tickets murmured mr dark free rides free rides come any time come back come back jim grabbed will grabbed the tickets they jumped they bolted from the tent the police smiling and waving all around followed at their leisure the internes not smiling like ghosts in their white suits came after they found the boys huddled in the back of the police car they looked as though they wanted to go home ii pursuits she could feel the mirrors waiting for her in each room much the same as you felt without opening your eyes that the first snow of winter has just fallen outside your window miss foley had first noticed some years ago that her house crowded with bright shadows of herself best then to was ignore the cold sheets of december ice in the hall above the bureaus in the bath best skate the thin ice lightly paused the weight of your attention might crack the shell plunged through the crust you might drown in depths so cold so remote that all the past lay carved in tombstone marbles there ice water would syringe your veins transfixed at the mirror sill you would stand forever unable to lift your gaze from the proofs of time yet tonight with the echo of the running feet of the three boys dying away she kept feeling snow fall in the mirrors of her house she wanted to thrust through the frames to test their weather but she was afraid that doing this might cause all the mirrors to somehow assemble in billionfold multiplications of self an army of women marching away to become girls and girls marching to become infinitely small children so many people crammed in one house would provoke suffocation so what must she do about mirrors will halloway jim nightshade andthe nephew strange why not say my nephew because she thought from the first when he came in the door he didnt belong his proof was not proof she kept waiting forwhat tonight the carnival music the nephew said that must be heard rides that must be ridden stay away from the maze where winter slept swim around with the carousel where summer sweet as clover honeygrass and wild mint kept its lovely time she looked out at the night lawn from which she had not yet retrieved the scattered jewels somehow she guessed this was a way the nephew had of getting rid of the two boys who might stop her using this ticket she took from the mantel carousel admit one she had waited for the nephew to come back with time passing she must act on her own something must be done not to hurt no but slow down interference from such as jim and will no one must stand between her and nephew her and carousel her and lovely gliding ridearound summer the nephew had said as much by saying nothing by just holding her hands and breathing bakedapplepie scent from his small pink mouth upon her face she lifted the telephone across town she saw the light in the stone library building as all the town had seen it over the years she dialled a quiet voice answered she said library mr halloway this is miss foley wills teacher in ten minutes please meet me in the police stationmr halloway a pause are you still there id have sworn said one interne when we first got therethat old man was dead the ambulance and the police car had pulled up at the same moment at the crossroads going back into town one of the intermes had called over now one of the policemen called back youre joking the internes sat in their ambulance they shrugged yeah sure joking they drove on ahead their faces as quiet and white as their uniforms the police followed with jim and will huddled in back trying to say more but the police started talking and laughing retelling everything that happened to one another so will and jim wound up lying giving wrong names again saying they lived around the comer from the police station they let the police drop them at two dark houses near the station and they ran up on those porches and grabbed the doorknobs and waited for the prowl car to swing off around the corner into the station and then they came down and followed and stood looking at the yellow lights of the station all suncoloured at midnight and will glanced over and saw the whole evening come and go in jims face and jim watching the police station windows as if at any moment darkness might fill every room and put the lights out forever on my way back into town thought will i threw away my tickets butlook jim still has his in his hand will trembled what did jim think want plan now that dead men lived and only lived through the fire of whitehot electric chair machines did he stiff very much love carnivals will searched faint echoes yes they came they went in jims eyes for jim after all was jim even standing here with the calm light of justice falling on his cheekbones the chief of police will said hed listen to us yeah said jim hed wake just long enough to send for the butterfly net hell william hell even i dont believe whats happened the last twentyfour hours but we got to find someone higher up keep trying now we know what the score is okay whats the score whats the carnival done so bad scared a woman with a mirror maze so she scared herself the policed say burgled a house okay wheres the burglar hiding inside an old mans skin whod believe that whod believe an old old man was ever a boy of twelve what else is the score did a lightningrod salesman disappear sure and left his bag but he couldve left town that dwarf in the sideshow i saw him you saw him looks kinda like the lightningrod man sure but again can you prove he was ever big no just like you cant prove cooger was ever small so that leaves us right here will on the sidewalk no proof except what we saw and us just kids the carnivals word against ours and the police had a fine time anyway there oh gosh its a mess if only if only there was still some way to apologize to mr cooger apologize will yelled to a maneating crocodile jehoshaphat you still dont see we cant do business with those ulmers and goffs ulmers goffs jim gazed upon him thoughtfully for that was how the boys talked of the creatures who dragged and swayed and slumped through their dreams in the bad dreams of william the ulmers moaned and gibbered and had no faces in the equally bad dreams of jim the goffs his peculiar name for them grew like monster meringuepaste mushrooms which fed on rats which fed on spiders which fed in turn because they were large enough on cats ulmers goffs said will you need a tenton safe to fall on you look what happened to two folks already mr electrico and that terrible crazy dwarf all kinds of things can go wrong with people on that darn machine we know we seen it maybe they squashed the lightningrod man down that way on purpose or maybe something went wrong fact is he wound up in a wine press anyway got run over by a steamroller carousel ands so crazy now he doesnt even know us aint that enough to scare the jesus out of you jim why maybe even mr crosetti mr crosettis on vacation maybe yes maybe no theres his shop theres the sign closed on account of illness what kind of illness jim he eat too much candy out at the show he get seasick on everybodys favourite ride cut it will no sir i wont cut it sure sure the merrygoround sounds keen you think i like being thirteen all the time not me but for criyi jim face it you dont really want to be twenty what else we talked about all summer talk sure but throwing yourself head first in that taffy machine and getting your bones pulled long jim you wouldnt what to do with your bones then id know said jim in the night id know sure youd just go away and leave me here jim why protested the other i wouldnt leave you will wed be together together you two feet taller and going around feeling your legandarmbones you looking down at me jim and whatd we talk about me with my pockets full of kitestring and marbles and frogeyes and you with clean nice and empty pockets and making fun is that what wed talk and you able to run faster and ditch me id never ditch you will ditch me in a minute well go on jim just go on leave me because i got my pocket knife and theres nothing wrong with me sitting under a tree playing mumbletypeg while you get yourself plain crazy with the heat of all those horses racing around but thank god theyre not racing any more and its your fault cried jim he stopped will stiffened and made fists you mean i shouldve let young meanandterrible get old meanandterrible enough to chew our heads off just let him ride around and hock his spit in our eye and maybe you with him waving goodbye going around again waving so long and all i got to do is wave back jim that what you mean sh said jim like you say its too late the carousels broke and when its fixed they ride old horrible cooger back make him young enough so he can speak and remember our names and then they come like cannibals after us or just me if you want to get in good with them and go tell them my name and where i live i wouldnt do that will jim touched him oh jim jim you do see dont you everything in its time like the preacher said only last month everything one by one not two by two will you remember everything said jim in its time and then they heard voices from the police station in one of the rooms to the right of the entrance a woman was talking now and men were talking will nodded to jim and they ran quietly over to pick their way through bushes and look into the room there sat miss foley there sat wills father i dont understand said miss foley to think will and jim would break in my house steal run off you saw their faces asked mr halloway when i screamed they looked back under the light shes not mentioning the nephew thought will and she wont of course you see jim he wanted to shout it was a trap the nephew waited for us to come prowling he wanted to get us in so much trouble no matter what we said to anybody police parents that nobodyd listen to us about carnivals late hours merrygorounds because our wordd be no good i dont want to prosecute said miss foley but if they are innocent where are the boys here someone cried will said jim too late for will had jumped high and was scrambling through the window here he said simply as he touched the floor they walked home quietly on the mooncoloured sidewalks mr halloway between the boys when they reached home wills father sighed jim i dont see any reason to tear your mother to bits at this hour if you promise to tell her this whole thing at breakfast ill let you off can you get in without waking her up sure look what we got we jim nodded and took them over to fumble among the clusters of thick moss and leaves on the side of the house until they found the iron rungs they had secretly nailed and placed to make a hidden ladder up to jims room mr halloway laughed once almost with pain and a strange wild sadness shook his head how long has this gone on no dont tell i did it too your age he looked up the ivy toward jims window fun being out late free as all hell he caught himself you dont stay out too long this week was the very first time after midnight dad pondered a moment having permission would spoil everything i suppose its sneaking out to the lake the graveyard the rail tracks the peach orchards summer nights that counts gosh mr halloway did you once yes but dont let the women know i told you up he motioned and dont come out again any night for the next month yes sir jim swung monkeywise to the stars flashed through his window shut it drew the shade dad looked up at the hidden rungs coming down out of the starlight to the runningfree world of sidewalks that invited the onethousandyard dash and the high hurdles of the dark bushes and the polevault cemetery trellises and walls you know what i hate most of all will not being able to run any more like you yes sir said his son lets have it clear now said dad tomorrow go apologize to miss foley again check her lawn we may have missed some of thestolen propertywith matches and flashlights then go to the police chief to report youre lucky you turned yourself in youre lucky miss foley wont press charges yes sir they walked back to the side of their own house dad raked his hand in the ivy our place too his hand found a rung will had nailed away among the leaves our place too he took out his tobacco pouch filled his pipe as they stood by the ivy the hidden rungs leading up to warm beds safe rooms then lit his pipe and said i know you youre not acting guilty you didnt steal anything no then why did you say you did to the police because miss foleywho knows whywants us guilty if she says we are we are you saw how surprised she was to see us come in through the window she never figured wed confess well we did we got enough enemies without the law on us too i figured if we made a clean breast theyd go easy they did at the same time boy miss foleys won too because now were criminals nobodyll believe what we say ill believe will you will searched the shadows on his fathers face saw whiteness of skin eyeball and hair dad the other night at three oclock in the morning three in the morning he saw dad flinch as from a cold wind as if he smelled and knew the whole thing and simply could not move reach out touch and pat will and he knew he could not say it tomorrow yes some other day yes for perhaps with the sun coming up the tents would be gone the freaks off over the world leaving them alone knowing they were scared enough not to push it say anything just keep their mouths shut maybe it would all blow over maybemaybe yes will said his father with difficulty the pipe in his hand going dead go on no thought will let jim and me be cannibalized but no one else anyone that knows gets hurt so no one else must know aloud he said in a couple of days dad ill tell you everything i swear moms honour moms honour said dad at last is good enough for me the night was sweet with the dust of autumn leaves that smelled as if the fine sands of ancient egypt were drifting to dunes beyond the town how come thought will at a time like this i can even think of four thousand years of dust of ancient people sliding around the world and me sad because no one notices except me and dad here maybe and even us not telling each other it was indeed a time between one second their thoughts all brambled airedale the next all silken slumbering cat it was a time to go to bed yet still they lingered reluctant as boys to give over and wander in wide circles to pillow and night thoughts it was a time to say much but not all it was a time after first discoveries but not last ones it was wanting to know everything and wanting to know nothing it was the new sweetness of men starting to talk as they must talk it was the possible bitterness of revelation so while they should have gone upstairs they could not depart this moment that promised others on not so distant nights when man and boybecomingman might almost sing so will at last said carefully dad am i a good person i think so i know so yes willwill that help when things get really rough itll help will it save me if i need saving i mean if im around bad people and theres no one else good around for miles what then itll help thats not good enough dad good is no guarantee for your body its mainly for peace of mind but sometimes dad arent you so scared that even the mind isnt peaceful his father nodded his face uneasy dad said will his voice very faint are you a good person to you and your mother yes i try but no mans a hero to himself ive lived with me a lifetime will i know everything worth knowing about myself and adding it all up the sum as they come and go and i mostly sit very still and tight yes im all right then dad asked will why arent you happy the front lawn at lets seeonethirty in the morningis no place to start a philosophical i just wanted to know is all there was a long moment of silence dad sighed dad took his arm walked him over and sat him down on the porch steps relit his pipe puffing he said all right your mothers asleep she doesnt know were out here with our tomcat talk we can go on now look since when did you think being good meant being happy since always since now learn otherwise sometimes the man who looks happiest in town with the biggest smile is the one carrying the biggest load of sin there are smiles and smiles learn to tell the dark variety from the light the sealbarker the laughshouter half the time hes covering up hes had his fun and hes guilty and men do love sin will oh how they love it never doubt in all shapes sizes colours and smells times come when troughs not tables suit our appetites hear a man too loudly praising others and look to wonder if he didnt just get up from the sty on the other hand that unhappy pale putupon man walking by who looks all guilt and sin why often thats your good man with a capital g will for being good is a fearful occupation men strain at it and sometimes break in two ive known a few you work twice as hard to be a farmer as to be his hog i suppose its thinking about trying to be good makes the crack run up the wall one night a man with high standards too the least hair falls on him sometimes wilts his spine he cant let himself alone wont lift himself off the hook if he falls just a breath from grace oh it would be lovely if you could just be fine act fine not think of it all the time but its hard right with the last piece of lemon cake waiting in the icebox middle of the night not yours but you he awake in a hot sweat for it eh do i need tell you or a hot spring day noon and there you are chained to your school desk and away off there goes the river cool and fresh over the rockfall boys can hear clear water like that miles away so minute by minute hour by hour a lifetime it never ends never stops you got the choice this second now this next and the next after that be good be bad thats what the dock ticks thats what it says in the ticks run swim or stay hot run eat or lie hungry so you stay but once stayed will you know the secret dont you dont think of the river again or the cake because if you do youll go crazy add up all the rivers never swum in cakes never eaten and by the time you get my age will its a lot missed out on but then you console yourself thinking the more times in the more times possibly drowned or choken on lemon frosting but then through plain dumb cowardice i guess maybe you hold off from too much wait play it safe look at me married at thirtynine will thirtynine but i was so busy wrestling myself two falls out of three i figured i couldnt marry until i had licked myself good and forever too late i found you cant wait to become perfect you got to go out and fall down and get up with everybody else so at last i looked up from my great selfwrestling match one night when your mother came to the library for a book and got me instead and i saw then and there you take a man halfbad and a women halfbad and put their two good halves together and you got one human all good to share between thats you will for my money and the strange thing is son and sad too though youre always racing out there on the rim of the lawn and me on the roof using books for shingles comparing life to libraries i soon saw you were wiser sooner and better than i will ever be dads pipe was dead he paused to tap it out and reload it no sir will said yes said his father id be a fool not to know im a fool my one wisdom is youre wise funny will said after a long pause youve told me more tonight than ive told you ill think some more maybe ill tell you everything at breakfast okay ill be ready if you are becausei want you to be happy dad he hated the tears that sprang to his eyes ill be all right will anything i could say or do to make you happy i would willy william dad lit his pipe again and watched the smoke blow away in sweet dissolvings just tell me ill live forever that would do nicely his voice will thought i never noticed its the same colour as his hair pa he said dont sound so sad me im the original sad man i read a book and it makes me sad see a film sad plays they really work me over is there anything said will doesnt make you sad one thing death boy will started i should think that would no said the man with the voice to match his hair death makes everything else sad but death itself only scares if there wasnt death all the other things wouldnt get tainted and will thought here comes the carnival death like a rattle in one hand life like candy in the other shake one to scare you offer one to make your mouth water here comes the sideshow both hands full he jumped to his feet dad oh listen youll live forever believe me or youre sunk sure you were sick a few years agobut thats over sure youre fiftyfour but thats young and another thing yes willy his father waited for him he swayed he bit his lips then blurted out dont go near the carnival strange his father said thats what i was going to tell you i wouldnt go back to that place for a billion dollars but will thought that wont stop the carnival searching through town to visit me promise dad why dont you want me to go there will thats one of the things ill tell tomorrow or next week or next year you just got to trust me dad i do son dad took his hand its a promise as if at a signal both turned to the house the time was up the hour was late enough had been said they properly sensed they must go the way you came out said dad is the way you go in will walked silently to touch the iron rungs hidden under the rustling ivy dad you wont pull these off dad probed one with his fingers some day when youre tired of them youll take them off yourself ill never be tired of them is that how it seems yes to someone your age you figure youll never get tired of anything all right son up you go he saw how his father looked up along the ivy and the hidden path you want to come up this way too no no his father said quickly because said will youre welcome thats all right go on but he still looked at the ivy stirring in the dark morning light will sprang up grabbed the first the second the third rungs and looked down from just this distance dad looked as if he were shrinking there on the ground somehow he didnt want to leave him behind there in the night like someone ditched by someone else one hand up to move but not moving dad he whispered you aint got the stuff who says cried dads mouth silently and he jumped and laughing without sound the boy the man swung up the side of the house unceasingly hand over hand foot after foot he heard dad slip scrabble grab hold tight he thought ah the man breathed hard eyes tight will prayed holdtherenow the old man gusted out sucked in swore in a fierce whisper then climbed again will opened his eyes and climbed and the rest was smooth high higher fine sweet wondrous done they swung in and sat upon the sill same size same weight coloured same by the stars and sat embraced once more with grand fine exhaustion gasping on huge ingulped laughs which swept their bones together and for fear of waking god country wife mom and hell they snugclapped hands to each others mouths felt the vibrant warm hilarity fountained there and sat one instant longer eyes bright with each other and wet with love then with a last strong clasp dad was gone the bedroom door shut drunk on the long nights doings lolled away from fear toward better grander things found in dad will slung off limpfalling clothes with tipsy arms and delightfully aching legs and like a fall of timber chopped himself to bed he slept for exactly one hour and then as if remembering something he had only half seen he woke sat up and peered out at jims rooftop the lightningrod he yelled its gone which indeed it was stolen no jim take it down yes why for the shucks of it smiling he had climbed to scuttle the iron dare any storm to strike his house afraid no fear was a new electricpower suit jim must try for size jim will wanted to smash his confounded window go nail the rod back before morn jim the blasted carnivalll send someone to find where we live dont know how theyll come or what theyll look like but lord your roofs so empty the clouds are moving fast that storms rushing at us and will stopped what sort of noise does a balloon make adrift none no not quite it noises itself it soughs like the wind billowing your curtains all white as breaths of foam or it makes a sound like the stars turning over in your sleep or it announces itself like moonrise and moonset that last is best like the moon sailing the universal deeps so rides a balloon how do you hear it how are you warned the ear does it hear no but the hairs on the back of your neck and the peachfuzz in your ears they do and the hair along your arms sings like grasshopper legs frictioned and trembling with strange music so you know you feel you are sure lying abed that a balloon is submerging the ocean sky will sensed a stir in jims house jim too with his fine dark antennae must have felt the waters part high over town to let a leviathan pass both boys felt a shadow bulk the drive between their houses both flung up their windows both poked their heads out both dropped their jaws in surprise at this friendly this always exquisite timing this delightful pantomime of intuition of apprehension their tandem teamwork over the years then silverfaced for the moon was rising both glanced up as a balloon wafted over and vanished holy cow whats a balloon doing here jim asked but wished no answer for peering they both knew the balloon was searching the best search ever no carmotor racket no tires whining asphalt no footstepped street just the wind clearing a great amazon through the clouds for a solemn voyage of wicker basket and storm sail riding over neither jim nor will crashed his window or pulled his shade they simply had to stay motionless waiting for they heard the noise again like a murmur in someone elses dream the temperature dropped forty degrees because now the stormbleached balloon whisperpurled plummetsank softly down its elephant shadow cooling gemmed lawns and sundials as they flaunted their swift gaze high through that shadow and what they saw was something akimbo and arustle in the downhung wicker carriage was that head and shoulders yes with the moon like a silver cloak thrown up behind mr dark thought will the crusher thought jim the wart thought will the skeleton the lava sipper the hanging man monsieur guillotine no the dust witch the witch who might draw skulls and bones in the dust then sneeze it away jim looked to will and will to jim both read their lips the witch but why a wax crone flung out in a night balloon to search thought will why none of the others with their lizardvenom wolffire snakepit eyes why send a crumbled statue with blindnewt lashes sewn tight with blackwidow thread and then looking up they knew for the witch though peculiar wax was peculiarly alive blind yes but she thrust down rustsplotched fingers which petted stroked the sluices of air which cut and splayed the wind peeled layers of space blinded stars which hovered and danced then fixed and pointed as did her nose and the boys knew even more they knew that she was blind but special blind she could dip down her hands to feel the bumps of the world touch house roofs probe attic bins reap dust examine draughts that blew through halls and souls that blew through people draughts vented from bellows to thumpwhist to poundtemples to pulsethroat and back to bellows again just as they felt that balloon sift down like an autumn rain so she could feel their souls disinhabit reinhabit their tremulous nostrils each soul a vast warm fingerprint felt different she could roll it in her hand like clay smelled different will could hear her snuffing his life away tasted different she savoured them with her rawgummed mouth her puffadder tongue sounded different she stuffed their souls in one ear tissued them out the other her hands played down the air one for will one for jim the balloon shadow washed them with panic rinsed them with terror the witch exhaled the balloon freed of the small sour ballast uprose the shadow passed oh god said jim now they know where we live both gasped some monstrous baggage brushed and dragged across the shingles of jims house will shes got me no i think the drag brush rustle scurried from bottom to top of jims roof then will saw the balloon whirl up fly off toward the hills shes gone there she goes jim she did something to your roof shove the monkey pole over jim slid the long slender clothesline pole over will fixed it on his sill then swung out hand over hand swung until jim pulled him through his window and they barefooted it into jims clothes closet and boosted and hoisted each other up inside the attic that smelled like lumber mills old dark and too silent perched out on the high roof shivering will cried jim there it is and there it was in the moonlight it was a track like a snail paints on a sidewalk it glistened it was silverslick but this was a path left by a gigantic snail that if it existed at all weighed a hundred pounds the silver ribbon was a yard across starting down at the leafflued rain trough the silver track shimmered to the rooftop then tremored down the other side why gasped jim why easier than looking for house numbers or street names she marked your roof so you can see it for miles around night or day ohmigosh jim bent to touch the track a faint evilsmelling glue covered his finger will whatll we do ive got a hunch the other whispered they wont be back till morning they cant just start a rumpus they got some plan right nowtheres what we do coiled across the lawn below like a vast boa constrictor waiting for them was the garden hose will was gone down fast and didnt knock anything over or wake anyone up jim on the roof was surprised in no time at all when will came scuttling up all panting teeth the waterfizzing hose in his fist will youre a genius sure quick they dragged the hose to drench the shingles to wash the silver flood the evil mercury paint away working will glanced off at the pure colour of night turning toward morn and saw the balloon trying to make decisions on the wind did it sense would it come back would she mark the roof again and they have to wash it off and she mark it and they wash it until dawn yes if need be if only thought will i could stop the witch for good they dont know our names or where we live mr coogers too near dead to remember or tell the dwarfif he is the lightningrod manis madand god willing wont recollect and they wont dare bother miss foley until morning so grinding their teeth way out in the meadows theyve sent the dust witch to search im a fool grieved jim quietly rinsing the roof where the lightningrod had been why didnt i leave it up lightning hasnt struck yet will said and if we jump lively it wont nowover here they showered the roof below someone put down a window mom jim laughed bleakly she thinks its raining the rain ceased the roof was clean they let the hose snake away to thump on the night grass a thousand miles below beyond town the balloon still paused between unpromising midnight and promised and hopedfor sun whys she waiting maybe she smells what were up to they went back down through the attic and soon were in separate rooms and beds after many fevers and chills of talk quietly separate listening to hearts and clocks beat and now lay too quickly toward dawn whatever they do thought will we must do it first he wished the balloon might fly back the witch might guess they had washed her mark off and soar down to trace the roof again why because he found himself staring at his boy scout archery set the big beautiful bow and quiver of arrows arranged on the east wall of his room sorry dad he thought and sat up smiling this time its me out alone i dont want her going back to report on us for hours maybe days he grabbed the bow and quiver from the wall hesitated thinking then stealthily ran the window up and leaned out no need to holler loud and long no but just think real hard they cant read thoughts i know thats sure or they wouldnt send her and she cant read thoughts but she can feel body heat and special temperatures and special smells and excitements and if i jump up and down and let her know just by my feeling good about having tricked her maybe maybe four oclock in the morning said a drowsy clockchime off in another land witch he thought come back witch he thought louder and let his blood pound the roofs clean hear we made our own rain you got to come back and remark it witch and the witch moved he felt the earth turn under the balloon okay witch come on theres just me the noname boy you cant read my mind but heres me spitting on you and heres me yelling we tricked you and the general idea gets through so come on come on dare doubledare you miles away there was a gasp of assent rising coming near holy cow he thought suddenly i dont want her back to this house come on he thrashed into his clothes clutching his weapons he aped down the hidden ivy rungs and dogged the wet grass witch here he ran leaving patterns ran feeling crazy fine wild as a hare who has chewed some secret delicious sweetly poisonous root that now gallops him berserk knees striking his chin shoes crushing wet leaves he soared over a hedge his hands full of bristly porcupine weapons fear and joy a tumble of mixed marbles in his mouth he looked back the balloon swung near it inhaled exhaled itself along from tree to tree from cloud to cloud where am i going he thought wait the redman house not lived in in years two blocks more there was the swift shush of his feet in the leaves and the big shush of the creature in the sky while moonlight snowed everything and stars glittered he pulled up in front of the redman house a torch in each lung tasting blood crying out silently here this is my house he felt a great river change its bed in the sky good he thought his hand turned the doorknob of the old house oh god he thought what if they are inside waiting for me he opened a door on darkness dust came and went in that dark and a harpstring gesticulation of spiders nothing else will jumped two at a time up the crumbling stairs around and out on the roof where he stashed his weapons behind the chimney and stood tall the balloon green as slime printed with titan pictures of winged scorpions ancient phoenixes smokes fires clouded weathers swung its wicker basket wheezing down witch he thought here the dank shadow struck him like a batwing will toppled he flung up his hands the shadow was almost black flesh striking he fell he clutched the chimney the shadow draped him hushing down it was cold as a sea cave in that clouddark but suddenly the wind of itself veered the witch hissed in frustration the balloon swam a washing circle up around the wind thought the boy wildy its on my side no dont go he thought come back for he feared she had smelled his plan she had she itched for his scheme she snuffed she gasped at it he saw the way her nails filed and scraped the air as if running over grooved wax to seek patterns she turned her palms out and down as ff he were a small stove burning softly somewhere in a nether world and she came to warm her hands at him as the basket swung in an upglided pendulum he saw her squinched blindsewn eyes the ears with moss in them the pale wrinkled apricot mouth mummifying the air it drew in trying to taste what was wrong with his act his thought he was too good too rare too fine too available to be true surely she knew that and knowing it she held her breath which made the balloon suspend itself half between inhale and exhale now tremulously experimentally daring to test the witch inhaled the balloon so weighted sank exhaledso freed of vapourthe craft ascended now now the waiting the holding of dank sour breath in the wry tissues of her childlike body will waggled his fingers thumb to nose she sucked air the weight of this one breath skimmed the balloon down closer he thought but careful she circled her craft scenting the sharp adrenalin wafted from his pores he wheeled following as the balloon spun and him reeling you he thought you want me sick spin me will you make me dizzy there was one last thing to try he stood very still with his back to the balloon witch he thought you cant resist he felt the sound of the green slime cloud the kept bag of sour air the squeal and stir of mousewicker on wicker as the shadow cooled his legs his spine his neck close the witch took air weight night burden starandcoldwind ballast closer elephant shadow stroked his ears he nudged his weapons the shadow engulfed him a spider flicked his hairher hand choking a scream he spun the witch leaned out was a mere foot away he bent he snatched the witch tried to scream out breath when she smelled felt knew what he held tight but in reaction horrified she seized a breath sucked weight burdened the balloon it dragged the roof will pulled the bowstring back freighted with single destruction the bow broke in two pieces he stared at the unshot arrow in his hands the witch let out her breath in one great sigh of relief and triumph the balloon swung up it struck him with its dry rattlechuckling heavyladen basket the witch shouted again with insane happiness clutched to the basket rim will with one free hand drew back and with all his strength threw the arrowhead flint up at the balloon flesh the witch gagged she tore at his face then the arrow a long hour it seemed in flight razored a small vent in the balloon rapidly the shaft sank as if cutting a vast green cheese the surface slit itself further in a wide ripping smile across the entire surface of the gigantic pear as the blind witch gabbled moaned blistered her lips shrieked in protest and will hung fast hands gripped to wicker kicking legs as the balloon wailed whiffled guzzled mourned its own swift gaseous death as dungeon air raved out as dragon breath gushed forth and the bag thus driven retreated up will let go space whistled about him he turned hit shingles fell skidding down the inclined ancient roof over down to rim to rainspout where feet first he spilled into further emptiness yelling clawed at the rain gutter held felt it groan give way as he swept the sky to see the balloon whistling wrinkling flying up like a wounded beast to evacuate its terrified exhalations in the clouds a gunshot mammoth not wanting to expire yet in terrible flux coughing out its stinking winds all this in a flash then will flailed into space with no time to be glad for a tree beneath when it netted him cut him but broke his fall with mattress twig branch and limb like a kite he was held face up to the moon where at his exhausted leisure he might hear the last witch lamentations for a wake in progress as the balloon spiralled her away from house street town with inhuman mourns the balloon smile the balloon rip was allencompassing now as it wandered in deliriums to die in the meadows from which it had come sinking down now beyond all the sleeping ignorant and unknowing houses for a long while will could not move buoyed in the tree branches afraid he might slip through and kill himself on the black earth below he waited for the sledgehammer to subside in his head the blows of his heart might jar him loose crash him down but he was glad to hear them know himself alive but then at last gone calm he gathered his limbs most carefully searched for a prayer and climbed himself down through the tree nothing much else happened all the rest of that night at dawn a juggernaut of thunder wheeled over the stony heavens in a sparkthrowing tumult rain fell softly on town cupolas chuckled from rainspouts and spoke in strange subterranean tongues beneath the windows where jim and will knew fitful dreams slipping out of one trying another for size but finding all cut from the same dark mouldered cloth in the rustling drumbeat a second thing occurred from the sodden carnival grounds the carousel suddenly spasmed to life its calliope fluted up malodorous steams of music perhaps only one person in town heard and guessed that the carousel was working again the door to miss foleys house opened and shut her footsteps hurried away along the street then the rain fell hard as lightning did a crippled dance down the nowtotallyrevealed nowvanishingforever land in jims house in wills house as the rain nuzzled the breakfast windows there was a lot of quiet talk some shouting and more quiet talk again at ninefifteen jim shuffled out into the sunday weather wearing his raincoat cap and rubbers he stood gazing at his roof where the giant snail track was washed away then he stared at wills door to make it open it did will emerged ms fathers voice followed want me to come along will shook his head firmly the boys walked solemnly the sky washing them toward the police station where they would talk to miss foleys where they would apologize again but right now they only walked hands in pockets thinking of yesterdays fearful puzzles at last jim broke the silence last night after we washed off the roof and i finally got to sleep i dreamed a funeral it came right down main street like a visit ora parade thats it a thousand people all dressed in black coats black hats black shoes and a coffin forty feet long criminentry right what forty feet long needs to be buried i thought and in the dream i ran up and looked in dont laugh i dont feel funny jim in the long coffin was a big long wrinkled thing like a prune or a big grape lying in the sun like a big skin or a giants head drying the balloon hey jim stopped you mustve had the same dream butballoons cant die can they will was silent and you dont have funerals for them do you jim i darn balloon laid out like a hippo someone leaked the wind out of jim last night black plumes waving band banging on black velvetmuffled drums with black ivory bones boy boy then on top of it have to get up this morning and tell mom not everything but enough so she cried and yelled and cried some more women sure like to cry dont they and called me her criminal son butwe didnt do anything bad did we will someone almost took a ride on a merrygoround jim walked along in the rain i dont think i want any more of that you dont think after all this good grief let me tell you the witch jim the balloon last night all alone i but there was no time to tell it no time to tell his stabbing the balloon so it gusted away to die in the lonely country sinking the blind woman with it no time because walking in the cold rain now they heard a sad sound they were passing an empty lot deep within which stood a vast oaktree under it were rainy shadows and the sound jim said will someonescrying no jim moved on theres a little girl in there no jim would not look what would a girl be doing out under a tree in the rain come on jim you hear her no i dont i dont but then the crying came stronger across the dead grass flew like a sad bird through the rain and jim had to turn for there was will marching across the rubble jimthat voicei know it will dont go there and jim did not move but will stumbled and walked until he entered the shade of the raining tree where the sky fell and was lost in autumn leaves and crept down at last in shining rivers along the branches and trunk and there was the little girl crouched face buried in her hands weeping as if the town were gone and the people in it and herself lost in terrible woods and at last jim came edging up and stood at the edge of the shadow and said who is it i dont know but will felt tears start to his eyes as if some part of him guessed its not jenny holdridge is it no jane franklin no his mouth felt full of novocaine his tongue merely stirred in his numb lips no the little girl wept feeling them near but not looking up yet memehelp menobodyll help mememei dont like this then when she had strength enough and was quieter she turned her face her eyes almost swollen shut with weeping she was shocked to see anyone near then surprised jim will oh god its you she seized jims hand he writhed back yelling no i dont know you let go will help me jim oh dont go dont leave she gasped brokenly new tears bursting from her eyes no no dont screamed jim he thrashed he broke free fell leaped to his feet one fist raised to strike he stopped trembling held it to his side oh will will lets get out of here im sorry oh god god the little girl in the shadow of the tree flung back widened her eyes to fix the two in wetness moaned clutched herself and rocked back and forth her own childbaby comforting her elbows soon she might sing to herself and sing that way alone beneath the dark tree forever no one able to join or stop the song someone must help mesomeone must help her she mourned as for one dead someone must help hernobody willnobody hashelp her if not meterribleterrible she knows us said will hopelessly half bent down to her half turned to jim i cant leave her lies said jim wildly lies she dont know us never saw her before shes gone bring her back shes gone bring her back mourned the girl eyes shut find who will got down on one knee dared to touch her hand she grabbed him almost immediately she knew this was wrong for he tried to tear free so she let him go and wept while he waited near and jim far out in the dead grass called in for them to go he didnt like it they must they must go oh shes lost sobbed the little girl she ran off in that place and never come back will you find her please please shivering will touched her cheek hey now he whispered youll be okay ill find help he said gently she opened her eyes this is will halloway okay cross my heart well be back ten minutes but you mustnt go away she shook her head youll wait here under the tree for us she nodded mutely he stood up this simple motion frightened her and she flinched so he waited and looked at her and said i know who you are he saw the great familiar eyes open grey in the small wounded face he saw the long rainwashed black hair and the pale cheeks i know who you are but i got to check wholl believe she wailed i believe will said and she lay back against the tree her hands in her lap trembling very thin very white very lost very small can i go now he said she nodded and he walked away at the edge of the lot jim stomped his feet in disbelief almost hysterical with outrage and declamation it cant be it is said will the eyes thats how you tell like it was with mr cooger and the evil boytheres one way to be sure come on and he took jim through the town and they stopped at last in front of miss foleys house and looked at the unlit windows in the morning gloom and walked up the steps and rang the bell once twice three times silence very slowly the front door moved whining back on its hinges miss foley jim called softly somewhere off in the house shadows of rain moved on far windowpanes miss foley they stood in the hall by the beadrain in the entry door listening to the great attic beams ashift and astir in the downpour miss foley louder but only the mice in the walls warmly nested made sgraffito sounds in answer shes gone out to shop said jim no said will we know where she is miss foley i know youre here shouted jim suddenly savagely dashing upstairs come on out you will waited for him to search and drag slowly back down as jim reached the bottom of the steps they both heard the music blowing through the front door with the smell of fresh rain and ancient grass the carousel calliope among the hills piping the funeral march backwards jim opened the door wider and stood in the music as one stands in the rain the merrygoround they fixed it will nodded she mustve heard the music gone out at sunrise something went wrong maybe the carousel wasnt fixed right maybe accidents happen all the time like to the lightningrod man him insideout and crazy maybe the carnival likes accidents gets a kick out of them or maybe they did something to her on purpose maybe they wanted to know more about us our names where we live or wanted her to help them hurt us who knows what maybe she got suspicious or scared then they just gave her more than she ever wanted or asked for i dont understand but now in the doorway in the cold rain there was time to think of miss foley afraid of mirror mazes miss foley alone not so long ago at the carnival and maybe screaming when they did what they finally did to her around and around around and around too many years more years than she had ever dreamed of shucked away rubbing her raw leaving her naked small alone and bewildered because unknowneventoherself around and around until all the years were gone and the carousel rocked to a halt like a roulette wheel and nothing gained and all lost and nowhere for her to go no way to tell the strangeness and nothing to do but weep under a tree alone in the autumn rain will thought this jim thought it and said oh the poorthe poor we got to help her jim who else would believe if she tells anyone im miss foley get away theyd say miss foleys left town disappeared go on little girl oh jim i bet shed pounded a dozen doors this morning wanting help scared people with her screaming and yelling then ran off gave up and hid under that tree police are probably looking for her now but so what its just a wild girl crying and theyll lock her away and shell go crazy that carnival boy do they know how to punish so you cant hit back they just shake you up and change you so no one ever knows you again and let you run free its okay go ahead talk cause folks are too scared of you to listen only we hear jim only you and me and right now i feel like i just ate a cold snail raw they looked back a last time at the shadows of rain crying on the windows inside the parlour where a teacher had often served them cookies and hot chocolate and waved to them from the window and moved tall through the town then they stepped out and shut the door and ran back toward the empty lot we got to hide her until we can help help panted jim we cant help ourselves theres got to be weapons right in front of us were just too blind they stopped beyond the thump of their own hearts a greater heart thumped brass trumpets wailed trombones blared a herd of tubas made an elephant charge alarmed for unknown reasons the carnival gasped jim we never thought it can come right into town a parade or that funeral i dreamt about for the balloon not a funeral and only what looks like a parade buts a search for us jim for us or miss foley if they want her back they can march down any old street fine and dandy and spy as they go drum and bugle jim we got to get her before they and breaking off they flung themselves down an alley but stopped suddenly and leaped to hide in some bushes at the far end of the alley the carnival band animal wagons clowns freaks and all banged and crashed between them and the empty lot and the great oak tree it must have taken five minutes for the parade to pass the rain seemed to move on away the clouds moving with them the rain ceased the strut of drums faded the boys loped down the alley across the street and stopped by the empty lot there was no little girl under the tree they circled it looked up in it not daring to call a name then very much afraid they ran to hide themselves somewhere in the town the phone rang mr halloway picked it up dad this is willy we cant go to the police station we may not be home today tell mom tell jims mom willy where are you we got to hide theyre looking for us who for gods sake i dont want you in it dad you got to believe well just hide one day two until they go away if we came home theyd follow and hurt you or ma or jims mom i got to go willy dont oh dad said will wish me luck click mr halloway looked out at the trees the houses the streets hearing faraway music willy he said to the dead phone luck and he put on his coat and hat and went out into the strange bright rainy sunshine that filled the cold air in front of the united cigar store on this beforenoon sunday with the bells of all churches ringing across here colliding with each other there showering sound from the sky now that the rain was spent in front of the cigar store the cherokee wooden indian stood his carved plumes pearled with water oblivious to catholic or baptist bells oblivious to the steadily approaching sunbright cymbals the thumping pagan heart of the carnival band the flourished drums the oldwomanish shriek of calliope the shadow drift of creatures far stranger than he did not witch the indians yellow hawkfierce gaze still the drums did tilt churches and plummet forth mobs of boys curious and eager for any change mild or wild so as the church bells stopped up their silver and iron rain pewstiffened crowds became relaxed parade crowds as the carnival a promotion of brass a flush of velvet all lionpacing mammothshuffling flagfluttered by the shadow of the indians wooden tomahawk lay on an iron grille embedded in the sidewalk in front of the cigar store over this grille with faint metallic reverberations year after year people passed dropping tonnages of mintgum wrapper gold cigarband matchstub cigarette butt or copper penny which vanished below forever now with the parade hundreds of feet rang and clustered on the grille as the carnival strode by on stilts roared by in tiger and volcano sounds and colours under the grille two shapes trembled above like a great baroque peacock striding the bricks and asphalt the freaks eyes opened out to stare to search office roofs church spires read dentists and opticians signs check dime and dry goods stores as drums shocked plate glass windows and wax dummies quaked in facsimiles of fear a multitude of hot and incredibly bright fierce eyes the parade moved desiring but not quenching its desire for the things it most wanted were hidden in dark jim and will under the cigar store sidewalk grille crouchpressed knee to knee heads up eyes alert they sucked their breaths like iron popsicles above womens dresses flowered in a cold breeze above men tilted on the sky the band in a collision of cymbals knocked children against their mothers knees with concussion there exclaimed jim the parade its right out front the cigar store whatre we doing here will lets go no cried will hoarsely clenching jims knee its the most obvious place in front of everybody theyll never think to check here shut up thrrrummmmm the grille above rang with the touch of a mans shoe and the worn nails in that shoe dad will almost cried he rose sank back biting his lips jim saw the man above wheel this way wheel that searching so near yet so far three feet away i could just reach upthought will but dad pale nervous hurried on and will felt his soul fall over cold and whitejelly quivering inside bang the boys jerked a chewed lump of pink bubblegum falling had hit a pile of old paper near jims foot a fiveyearold boy above crouched on the grille peered down with dismay after his vanished sweet get thought will the boy knelt hands to the grille go on thought will he had a crazy wish to grab the gum and stuff it back up into the little boys mouth a paradedrum thumped one huge time thensilence jim and will glanced at each other the parade both thought its halted the small boy stuck one hand half through the grille above in the street mr dark the illustrated man glanced back over his river of freaks cages at the sunburst tubas and python brass horns he nodded the parade fell apart the freaks hurried half to one sidewalk half to the other mingling with the crowd passing out handbills eyes firecrystal quick striking like snakes the small boys shadow cooled wills cheek the parades over he thought now the search begins look ma the small boy pointed down through the grille there in neds night spot half a block from the cigar store charles halloway exhausted from no sleep too much thinking far too much walking finished his second coffee and was about to pay when the sharp silence from the street outside made him uneasy he sensed rather than saw the mild intermingled disturbance as the parade melted among the sidewalk crowds not knowing why charles halloway put his money away warm it up again ned ned was pouring coffee when the door swung wide someone entered and splayed his right hand lightly on the counter charles halloway stared the hand stared back at him there was a single eye tattooed on the back of each finger mom down there look the boy cried pointing through the grille more shadows passed and lingered includingthe skeleton tall as a dead tree in winter all skull all scarecrowstilted bones the thin man the skeleton mr skull played his xylophone shadow upon hidden things cold paper rubbish warm flinching boys below go thought will go the plump fingers of the child gesticulated through the grille go mr skull walked away thank god thought will then gasped oh no for the dwarf as suddenly appeared waddling along a fringe of bells on his dirty shirt jingling softly his toadshadow tucked under him his eyes like broken splinters of brown marble now brightonthesurface mad now deeply mournfully foreverlostandgoneburiedaway mad looking for something could not be found a lost self somewhere lost boys for an instant then the lost self again two parts of the little squashed man fought to jerk his flashing eyes here there around up down one seeking the past one the immediate present mama said the child the dwarf stopped and looked at the boy no bigger than himself their eyes met will flung himself back tried to gum his body into the concrete he felt jim do the same not moving but moving his mind his soul thrusting it into darkness to hide from the little drama above come on junior a womans voice the boy was puffed up and away too late for the dwarf was looking down and in his eyes were the lost bits and fitful pieces of a man named fury who had sold lightningrods how many days how many years ago in the long the easy the safe and wondrous time before this fright was born oh mr fury thought will what theyve done to you threw you under a piledriver squashed you in a steel press squeezed the tears and screams out of you trapped you in a jackinabox all pressed down until theres nothing left of you mr furynothing left but this dwarf and the dwarfs face was less human more machine now in fact a camera the shuttering eyes flexed sightless opening upon darkness tick two lenses expandedcontracted with liquid swiftness a picturesnap of the grille a snap also of what lay beneath is he staring at the metal thought will or the spaces between the metal for a long moment the ruinedsquashed clay doll dwarf squatted while standing tall his flashcamera eyes were bulged wide perhaps still taking pictures will jim were not seen really at all only their shape their colour and size were borrowed by these dwarf camera eyes they were clapped away in the boxbrownie skull later how much laterthe picture would be developed by the wild the tiny the forgetful the wandering and lost lightningrod mind what lay under the grille would then be really seen and after that revelation revenge destruction clicksnaptick children ran laughing by the dwarfchild drawn by their running joy was swept along with them madly he skipped off remembered himself and went looking for something he knew not what the cloudy sun poured fight through all the sky the two boys boxed in lightslotted pit hisstled their breath softly out through gritted teeth jim squeezed wills hand tight tight both waited for more eyes to stride along and rake the steel grille the blueredgreen tattooed eyes all five of them fell away from the counter top charles halloway sipping his third coffee turned slightly on the revolving stool the illustrated man was watching him charles halloway nodded the illustrated man did not nod or blink but stared until the janitor wanted to turn away but did not and simply gazed as calmly as possible at the impertinent intruder whatll it be asked the cafe proprietor nothing mr dark watched wills father im looking for two boys who isnt charles halloway rose paid walked off thanks ned in passing he saw the man with the tattoos hold his hands out palms up toward ned boys said ned how old the door slammed mr dark watched charles halloway walk off outside the window ned talked but the illustrated man did not hear outside wills father moved toward the library stopped moved toward the courthouse stopped waited for some better sense to direct him felt his pocket missed his smokes and turned toward the united cigar store jim looked up saw familiar feet pale faces salt and pepper hair will your dad call to him hell help us will could not speak ill call to him will bit jims arm shook his head violently no why not mouthed jim because said wills lips becausehe gazed updad looked even smaller up there than he had last night seen from the side of the house it would be like calling to one more boy passing they didnt need one more boy they needed a general no a major general he tried to see dads face at the cigar counter window and discover whether it looked really older firmer stronger than it did last night washed with all the milk colours of the moon but all he saw was dads fingers twitching nervously his mouth working as if he didnt dare ask his needs from mr tetley onethat isone twentyfive cent cigar my god said mr tetley above the mans rich charles halloway took his time removing the cellophane waiting for some hint some move on the part of the universe to show him where he was going why he had come back this way for a cigar he did not really want he thought he heard himself called twice glanced swiftly at the crowds saw clowns passing with handbills then lit the cigar he did not want from the eternal bluegas flame that burned in a small silver jet pipe on the counter and puffing smoke dropped the cigar band with his free hand saw the band bounce on the metal grille and vanish his eyes following it farther down to where it lit at the feet of will halloway his son charles halloway choked on cigar smoke two shadows there yes and the eyes terror gazing up out of the dark well under the street he almost bent to seize the grate yelling instead incredulous he only blurted softly with the crowd around and the weather clearing jim will what the hells going on at which moment one hundred feet away the illustrated man came out of neds night spot mr halloway said jim come up out of there said charles halloway the illustrated man a crowd among crowds pivoted slowly then walked toward the cigar store dad we cant dont look at us down here the illustrated man was some eighty feet away boys said charles halloway the police mr halloway said jim hoarsely were dead if you dont look up the illustrated man if he the what asked mr halloway the man with the tattoos from the cafe counter five electric blueinked eyes fixed mr halloways memory dad look over at the courthouse clock while we tell you what happened mr halloway straightened up and the illustrated man arrived he stood studying charles halloway sir said the illustrated man elevenfifteen charles halloway judged the courthouse clock adjusted his wrist watch cigar in mouth one minute slow sir said the illustrated man will held jim jim held will fast in the gumwrapper tobaccolittered pit as the four shoes rocked shuffled tilted above sir said the man named dark probing charles halloways face for the bones there to compare to other bones in other halfsimilar people the coogerdark combined shows have picked two local boys two to be our special guests during our celebratory visit well i wills father tried not to glance at the sidewalk these two boys will watched the toothsharp shoenails of the illustrated man flash sparking the grille these boys will ride all rides see each show shake hands with every performer go home with magic kits baseball bats who interrupted mr halloway are these lucky boys two selected from photos snapped on our midway yesterday identify them sir and you will share their fortune there are the boys he sees us down here thought will oh god the illustrated man thrust out his hands wills father lurched tattooed in bright blue ink wills face gazed up at him from the palm of the right hand inksewn to the left palm jims face was indelible and natural as life you know them the illustrated man saw mr halloways throat clench his eyelids squinch his bones struck vibrant as from a sledgehammer blow their names dad careful will thought i dont said wills father you know them the illustrated mans hands shook held out to view asking for the gift of names making jims face on the flesh wills face on the flesh jims face hidden beneath the street wills face hidden beneath the street tremble writhe pinch sir you wouldnt want them to lose out no but but but but mr dark loomed closer magnificent in his picturegallery flesh his eyes the eyes of all his beasts and hapless creatures cutting through his shirt coat trousers fastening the old man tight biting him with fire fixing him with thousandfold attentions mr dark shoved his two palms near but mr halloway needing something to excruciate bit his cigar i thought for a moment thought what grand delight from mr dark one of them looked like like who too eager thought will you see that dad dont you mister said wills father why are you so jumpy about two boys jumpy mr darks smile melted like cotton candy jim scootched himself down into a dwarf will crammed himself down into a midget both looking up waiting sir said mr dark is my enthusiasm that to you jumpy wills father noted the muscles cord along the arms roping and unroping themselves with a writhe like the puff adders and sidewinders doubtless inked and venomous there one of those pictures drawled mr halloway looks like milton blumquist mr dark clenched a fist a blinding ache struck jims head the other wills father was almost bland looks like avery johnson oh dad thought will youre great the illustrated man clenched his other fist will his head in a vice almost screamed both boys finished mr halloway moved to milwaukee some weeks ago you said mr dark coldly lie wills father was truly shocked me and spoil the prizewinners fun fact is said mr dark we found the names of the boys ten minutes ago just want to doublecheck so said wills father disbelieving jim said mr dark will jim writhed in the dark will sank his head deep in his shoulder blades eyes tight wills fathers face was a pond into which the two dark stone names sank without a ripple first names jim will lots of jims and wills couple hundred town like this will crouched and squirming thought who told miss foley but she was gone her house empty and full of rain shadows only one other person the little girl who looked like miss foley weeping under the tree the little girl who frightened us so bad he wondered in the last half hour the parade going by found her and her crying for hours afraid and ready to do anything say anything if only with music horses plunging world racing they would grow her old again grow her around again lift her shut up her crying stop up the awful thing and make her as she was did the carnival promise lie to her when they found her under the tree and ran her off the little girl crying but not telling all because jim will said wills father first names what about the last mr dark did not know the last names his universe of monsters sweated phosphorus on his hide soured his armpits reeked slammed between his ironsinewed legs now said wills father with a strange and to him almostdefightfulbecausenew calm i think youre lying you dont know the last names now why should you a carnival stranger lie to me here on a street in some town on the backside of nowhere the illustrated man clenched his two calligraphic fists very hard wills father his face pale considered these mean constricted fingers knuckles digging nails inside which two boys faces crushed hard in dark vice tight very tight in prison flesh were kept in fury two shadows below thrashed in agony the illustrated man erased his face to serenity but a bright drop fell from his right fist a bright drop fell from his left fist the drops vanished through the steel sidewalk grille will gasped wetness had struck his face he clapped his hand to it then looked at his palm the wetness that had hit his cheek was bright red he glanced from it to jim who lay still now also for the scarification real or imagined seemed over and both flicked their eyes up to where the illustrated mans shoes flintsparked the grille grinding steel on steel wills father saw the blood ooze from the clenched fists but forced himself to look only at the illustrated mans face as he said sorry i cant be more help beyond the illustrated man rounding the corner hands weaving the air dressed m harlequin gypsy colours face waxen eyes hid behind plumdark glasses the fortune teller the dust witch came mumbling a moment later looking up will saw her not dead he thought carried off bruised fallen yes but now back and mad lord yes mad looking especially for me wills father saw her his blood slowed by instinct alone to a pudding in his chest the crowd opened happily laughing and commenting on her bright if tattered costume trying to remember what she rhymed so as to tell it later she moved fingers feeling the town as if it were an immensely complicated and lush tapestry and she sang tell you your husbands tell you your wives tell you your fortunes tell you your lives see me i know see me at the show tell you the colour of his eyes tell you the colour of her lies tell you the colour of his goal tell you the colour of her soul come now dont go see me see me at the show children appalled children impressed parents delighted parents in high good humour and still the gypsy from the dusts of living sang time walked in her murmuring she made and broke microscopic webs between her fingers wherewith to feel soot fly up breath fly out she touched the wings of flies the souls of invisible bacteria all specks mites and micasnowings of sunlight filtrated with motion and much more hidden emotion will and jim cracked their bones cowered down hearing blind yes blind but i see what i see i see where i be said the witch softly theres a man with a straw hat in autumn hello andwhy theres mr dark andan old manan old man hes not that old cried will to himself blinking up at the three as the witch stopped her shadow falling moistfrog cool on the hidden boys old man mr halloway was jolted as by a series of cold knives thrust in his stomach old manold man said the witch she stopped this ah the hairs in her nostrils bristled she gaped her mouth to savour air ah the illustrated man quickened wait sighed the gypsy her fingernails scraped down an unseen blackboard of air will felt himself yip bark whimper like an aggravated hound slowly her fingers climbed down feeling the spectrums weighing the light in another moment a forefinger might thrust to the sidewalk grille implying there there dad thought will do something the illustrated man gone sweetly patient now that his blind but immensely aware dust lady was here watched her with love now the witchs fingers itched now said wills father loud the witch flinched now this is a fine cigar yelled wills father turning with great pomp back to the counter quiet said the illustrated man the boys looked up now the witch sniffed the wind got to light it again mr halloway stuck the cigar in the eternal blue flame silence suggested mr dark ever smoke yourself asked dad the witch from the concussion of his fiercely erupted and overly jovial words dropped one wounded hand to her side wiped sweat from it as one wipes an antenna for better reception and drifted it up again her nostrils flared with wind ah wills father blew a dense cloud of cigar smoke it made a fine thick cumulus surrounding the woman gah she choked fool the illustrated man barked but whether at man or woman the boys below could not tell here lets buy you one mr halloway blew more smoke handing mr dark a cigar the witch exploded a sneeze recoiled staggered away the illustrated man snatched dads arm saw that he had gone too far let go and could only follow his gypsy woman off in some clumsy and totally unexpected defeat but then in going he heard wills father say a fine day to you sir no dad thought will the illustrated man came back your name sir he asked directly dont tell him thought will wills father debated a moment took the cigar from his mouth tapped ash and said quietly halloway work in the library drop by some time you can be sure mr halloway i will the witch was waiting near the corner mr halloway whetted his forefinger tested the wind and sent a cumulus her way she flailed back gone the illustrated man went rigid spun about and strode off the ink portraits of jim and will crushed hard iron tight in his fists silence it was so quiet under the grille mr halloway thought the two boys had died of fright and will below gazing up eyes wet mouth wide thought oh my gosh why didnt i see it before dads tall dads very tall indeed still charles halloway did not look down at the grille but only at the small comets of splashed red colour left on the sidewalk trailed around the corner dropped from the clenched hands of the vanished mr dark he was also gazing with surprise at himself accepting the surprise the new purpose which was half despair half serenity now that the incredible deed was done let no one ask why he had given his true name even he could not assay and give its real weight now he could only read the numerals on the courthouse clock and speak to it while the boys below listened oh jim will something is going on can you hide keep out from under the rest of the day we got to have time with things like this where do you begin no laws been broken none on the books anyway but i feel dead and buried a month my flesh ripples hide jim will hide ill tell your mothers youve got jobs at the carnival good excuse for you not coming home stay hid until dark then come to the library at seven meantime ill check police records on carnivals newspaper files at the library books old folios everything that might fit god willing by the time you show up after dark ill have a plan walk easy until then bless you jim bless you will the small father who was very tall now walked slowly away its cigar unnoticed fell from his hand dropped in a spark shower through the grate it lay in the square pit glowing its single fiery pink eye at jim and will who looked back and at last snatched to blind and put it out the dwarf bearing his demented and wildly lighted eyes made his way south on main street stopping suddenly he developed a film strip in his head scanned it bleated and blundered back through the forest of legs to reach for and pull the illustrated man down where a whisper was as good as a shout mr dark listened then fled leaving the dwarf far behind reaching the cigar store indian the illustrated man sank to his knees clutching the steel latticegrille he peered down in the pit below lay yellow newspapers wilted candy wrappers burnt cigars and gum mr darks cry was muffled fury lose something mr tetley blinked over his counter the illustrated man clenched the grate nodding once i clean under the grate once a month for the money said mr tetley how much you lose dime quarter half dollar bing the illustrated man glared up in the cashregister window a small firered sign jumped high no sale the town clock struck seven the echoes of the great chime wandered in the unlit halls of the library an autumn leaf very crisp fell somewhere in the dark but it was only the page of a book turning off in one of the catacombs bent to a table under a grassgreenshaded lamp lips pursed eyes narrowed sat charles halloway his hands trembling the pages lifting rearranging the books now and then he hurried off to peer into the autumn night watchful of the streets then again he came back to paperclip pages to inset papers to scribble out quotations whispering to himself his voice brought forth quick echoes from the library vaults look here here said the night passages this picture picture said the halls and this this the dust settled it had been the longest day of all the days he could remember in his life he had mingled with strange and notsostrange crowds he had searched after the searchers in the wake of the widescattering parade he had resisted telling jims mother wills mother more than they needed to know for a happy sunday and meantime crossed shadows with dwarf traded nods with pinhead and fireeater kept free of shadowed alleys and controlled his panic when doubling back he saw the basement pit empty under the cigar store grille and knew that the boys were at hideandseek somewhere nearby or somewhere praise god very far away then in the crowds he moved to the carnival ground stayed out of tents stayed free of rides observed watched the sun go down and just at twilight surveyed the cold glass waters of the mirror maze and saw just enough on the shore to pull him back before he drowned wet all over cold to the bone before night caught him he let the crowd protect warm and bear him away up into town to the library and to most important books which he arranged in a great literary clock on a table like someone learning to tell a new time so he paced round and round the huge clock squinting at the yellowed pages as if they were mothwings pinned dead to the wood here lay a portrait of the prince of darkness next a series of fantastic sketches of the temptations of st anthony next some etchings from the bizarie by giovanbatista bracelli depicting a set of curious toys humanlike robots engaged in various alchemical rites at five minutes to twelve stood a copy of dr faustus at two lay on occult iconography at six under mr halloways trailed fingers now a history of circuses carnivals shadow shows puppet menageries inhabited by mountebanks minstrels stiltwalking sorcerers and their fantoccini more a manual of the air kingdoms things that fly down history at nine sharp by demons possessed lying atop egyptian philtres lying atop the torments of the damned which in turn crushed flat the spell of mirrors very late up the literary clock one named locomotives and trains the mystery of sleep between midnight and dawn the witches sabbath and pacts with demons it was all laid out he could see the face but there were no hands on this clock he could not tell what hour of the night of life it was for himself the boys or the unknowing town for in sum what had he to go by a threeoclockinthemorning arrival a grotesquelooking glass maze a sunday parade a tall man with a swarm of electricblue pictures itching on his sweaty hide a few drops of blood falling down through a pavement grille two frightened boys staring up out of the earth and himself alone in mausoleum quiet nudging the puzzle together what was there about the boys that made him believe the simplest word they whispered up through the grille fear itself was proof here and he had seen enough fear in his fife to know it like the smell from a butchers shop in summer twilight what was there about the illustrated carnival owners silences that spoke thousands of violent corrupt and crippling words what was there in that old man he had seen through a tent flap late this afternoon seated in a chair with the words mr electrico bannered over him power webbing and crawling on his flesh like green lizards all all all of it and now these books this he touched physiognomonie the secrets of the individuals character as found in his face were jim and will then featured all angelic pure halfinnocent peering up through the sidewalk at marching terror did the boys represent the ideal for your woman man or child of excellent bearing colour balance and summer disposition converselycharles halloway turned a pagedid the scurrying freaks the illustrated marvel bear the foreheads of the irascible the cruel the covetous the mouths of the lewd and untruthful the teeth of the crafty the unstable the audacious the vainglorious and your murderous beast no the book slipped shut if faces were judged the freaks were no worse than many hed seen slipping from the library late nights in his long career there was only one thing sure two lines of shakespeare said it he should write them in the middle of the clock of books to fix the heart of his apprehension by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes so vague yet so immense he did not want to live with it yet he knew that during this night unless he lived with it very well he might have to live with it all the rest of his life at the window he looked out and thought jim will are you coming will you get here waiting his flesh took paleness from his bones the library then at sevenfifteen seventhirty sevenfortyfive of a sunday night cloistered with great drifts of silence and transfixed avalanche of books poised like the cuneiform stones of eternity on shelves so high the unseen snows of time fell all year there outside the town breathed back and forth to the carnival hundreds of people passing near where jim and will lay strewn in bushes to one side of the library now ducking up now ducking down to nose raw earth cheezit both smothered in grass across the street there passed what could have been a boy could have been a dwarf could have been a boywithdwarfmind could have been anything blown along like the scuttlecrab leaves on the frostmica sidewalks but then whatever it was went away jim sat up will still lay face buried in good safe dirt come on whats wrong the library said will im even afraid of it now all the books he thought perched there hundreds of years old peeling skin leaning on each other like ten million vultures walk along the dark stacks and all the gold titles shine their eyes at you between old carnival old library and his own father everything oldwell i know dads in there but is it dad i mean what if they came changed him made him bad promised him something they cant give but he thinks they can and we go in there and some day fifty years from now someone opens a book in there and you and me drop out like two dry mothwings on the floor jim someone pressed and hid us between pages and no one ever guessed where we went this was too much for jim who had to do something to flog his spirits next thing will knew jim was hammering on the library door both hammered frantic to jump from this night to that warmer bookbreathing night inside given a choice of darkness this one was the better the oven smell of books as the door opened and dad stood with his ghostcoloured hair they tiptoed back through the deserted corridors will feeling a crazy urge to whistle as he often did past the graveyard at sundown dad asking what made them late and they trying to remember all the places they hid in one day they had hid in old garages they had hid in old barns they had hid in the highest trees they could climb and got bored and boredom was worse than fear so they came down and reported in to the police chief and had a fine chat which gave them twenty safe minutes right in the station and will got the idea of touring churches and they climbed all the steeples in town and scared pigeons off the belfries and whether or not it was safer in churches and especially up with the bells or not no one could claim but it felt safe but there again they began to get starchy with boredom and fatigued with sameness and were almost on the point of giving themselves up to the carnival in order to have something to do when quite fortunately the sun went down from sundown to now it had taken a wonderful time creeping upon the library as if it were a once friendly fort that might now be manned by arabs so here we are whispered jim and stopped why am i whispering its after hours heck he laughed then stopped for he thought he heard a soft tread off in the subterranean vaults but it was only his laughter walking back through the deep stacks on panther feet so when they talked again it was still in whispers deep forests dark caves dim churches halflit libraries were all the same they tuned you down they dampened your ardour they brought you to murmurs and soft cries for fear of raising up phantom twins of your voice which might haunt corridors long after your passage they reached the small room and circled the table on which charles halloway had laid out the books where he had read many hours and for the first time looked in each others faces and saw a dreadful paleness so did not comment from the beginning wills father pulled out chairs please so each taking his part in their own good time the boys told of the wanderingby lightningrod salesman the predictions of storms to come the longaftermidnight train the suddenly inhabited meadow the moonblown tents the untouched but fullwept calliope then the light of noon showering over an ordinary midway with hundreds of christians wandering through but no lions for them to be tossed to only the maze where time lost itself backward and forward in waterfall mirrors only the out of order carousel the dead supper hour mr cooger and the boy with the eyes that had seen all the glistery tripes of the world shaped like hunganddripping sins and all the sins tenterhooked and running red and verminous this boy with the eyes of a man who has lived forever seen too much might like to die but doesnt know how the boys stopped for breath miss foley the carnival again the carousel run wild the ancient cooger mummy gasping moonlight exhaling silver dust dead then resurrected in a chair where green lightning struck his skeleton alight all of it a storm minus rain minus thunder and parade the cigar store basement the hiding and at last them here finished done with the telling for a long moment wills father sat staring blindly into the centre of the table then his lips moved jim will he said i believe the boys sank in their chairs all of it all will wiped his eyes boy he said gruffly im going to start bawling we got no time for that said jim no time and wills father stood up stuffed his pipe with tobacco rummaged his pockets for matches brought out a battered harmonica a penknife a cigarette lighter that wouldnt work and a memo pad he had always meant to write some great thoughts down on but never got around to and lined up these weapons for a pygmy war that could be lost before it even started probing this idle refuse shaking his head he finally found a tattered matchbox lit his pipe and began to muse pacing the room looks like were going to do a lot of talking about one particular carnival wheres it come from wheres it going whats it up to we thought it never hit town before yet by god look here he tapped a yellowed newspaper ad dated october and ran his fingernail along under this j c cooger and g m dark present the pandemonium theatre co combined sideshows and unnatural museums international jc gm said jim those are the same initials as on the throwaways around town this week butit couldnt be the same men no wills father rubbed his elbows my goose pimples run counter to that he laid forth other old newspapers same ad same names same initials dark and cooger cooger and dark they came and went but only once every twenty thirty forty years so people forgot where were they all the other years travelling and more than travelling always in october october october october october and october now tonight his voice trailed off beware the autumn people what an old religious tract pastor newgate phillips i think read it as a boy how does it go again he tried to remember he licked his lips he did remember for some autumn comes early stays late through life where october follows september and november touches october and then instead of december and christs birth there is no bethlehem star no rejoicing but september comes again and old october and so on down the years with no winter spring or revivifying summer for these beings fall is the ever normal season the only weather there be no choice beyond where do they come from the dust where do they go the grave does blood stir their veins no the night wind what ticks in their head the worm what speaks from their mouth the toad what sees from their eye the snake what hears with their ear the abyss between the stars they sift the human storm for souls eat flesh of reason fill tombs with sinners they frenzy forth in gusts they beetlescurry creep thread filter motion make all moons sullen and surely cloud all clearrun waters the spiderweb hears them tremblesbreaks such are the autumn people beware of them after a pause both boys exhaled at once the autumn people said jim thats them sure then will swalloweddoes that make ussummer people not quite charles halloway shook his head oh youre nearer summer than me if i was ever a rare fine summer person thats long ago most of us are halfandhalf the august noon in us works to stave off the november chills we survive by what little fourth of july wits weve stashed away but there are times when were all autumn people not you dad not you mr halloway he turned quickly to see both appraising him paleness next to paleness hands on knees as if to bolt its a way of speaking easy boys im after the facts will do you really know your dad shouldnt you know me and me you if its going to be usns against themns hey yeah breathed jim who are you we know who he is darn it will protested do we said wills father lets see charles william halloway nothing extraordinary about me except im fiftyfour which is always extraordinary to the man inside it born in sweet water lived in chicago survived in new york brooded in detroit floundered in lots of places arrived here late after living in libraries around the country all those years because i liked being alone liked matching up in books what id seen on the roads then in the middle of all the running away which i called travel in my thirtyninth year your mother fixed me with one glance been here ever since still most comfortable in the library nights in out of the rain of people is this my last stop chances are why am i here at all right now it seems to help you he paused and looked at the two boys and their fine young faces yes he said very late in the game to help you every nightblind library window clattered with cold the man the two boys waited for the wind to pass away then will said dad youve always helped thanks but its not true charles halloway examined one very empty hand im a fool always looking over your shoulder to see whats coming instead of right at you to see whats here but then for what salve it gives me every mans a fool which means you got to pitch in all your life bail out board over tie rope patch plaster pat cheeks kiss brows laugh cry make do against the day youre the worst fool of all and shout help then all you need is one persons answer i see it so clear across the country tonight lie cities towns and mere jerkwater stops of fools so the carnival steams by shakes any tree it rains jackasses separate jackasses i should say individuals with no one they think or no one actual to answer their help unconnected fools thats the harvest the carnival comes smiling after with its threshing machine oh gosh said will its hopeless no the very fact were here worrying about the difference between summer and autumn makes me sure theres a way out you dont have to stay foolish and you dont have to be wrong evil sinful whatever you want to call it theres more than three or four choices they that dark fellow and his friends dont hold all the cards i could tell that today at the cigar store im afraid of him but i could see he as was afraid of me so theres fear on both sides now how can we use it to advantage how first things first lets bone up on history if men had wanted to stay bad forever they could have agreed agreed did we stay out in the fields with the beasts no in the water with the barracuda no somewhere we let go of the hot gorillas paw somewhere we turned in our carnivores teeth and started chewing blades of grass we been working mulch as much as blood into our philosophy for quite a few lifetimes since then we measure ourselves up the scale from apes but not half so high as angels it was a nice new idea and we were afraid wed lose it so we put it on paper and built buildings like this one around it and we been going in and out of these buildings chewing it over that one new sweet blade of grass trying to figure how it all started when we made the move when we decided to be different i suppose one night hundreds of thousands of years ago in a cave by a night fire when one of those shaggy men wakened to gaze over the banked coals at his woman his children and thought of their being cold dead gone forever then he must have wept and he put out his hand in the night to the woman who must die some day and to the children who must follow her and for a little bit next morning he treated them somewhat better for he saw that they like himself had the seed of night in them he felt that seed like slime in his pulse splitting making more against the day they would multiply his body into darkness so that man the first one knew what we know now our hour is short eternity is long with this knowledge came pity and mercy so we spared others for the later more intricate more mysterious benefits of love so in sum what are we we are the creatures that know and know too much that leaves us with such a burden again we have no choice to laugh or cry no other animal does either we do both depending on the season and the need somehow i feel the carnival watches to see which were doing and how and why and moves in on us when it feels were ripe charles halloway stopped for the boys were watching him so intently he suddenly had to turn flushing away boy mr halloway cried jim softly thats great go on dad said will amazed i never knew you could talk you should hear me here late nights nothing but talk charles halloway shook his head yes you shouldve heard i shouldve said more to you any day you name in the past hell where was i leading up to love i think yeslove will looked bored jim looked wary of the word and these looks gave charles halloway pause what could he say that might make sense to them could he say love was above all common cause shared experience that was the vital cement wasnt it could he say how he felt about their all being here tonight on this wild world running around a big sun which fell through a bigger space falling through yet vaster immensities of space maybe toward and maybe away from something could he say we share this billonmileanhour ride we have common cause against the night you start with little common causes why love the boy in a march field with his kite braving the sky because our fingers burn with the hot string singeing our hands why love some girl viewed from a train bent to a country well the tongue remembers iron water cool on some long lost noon why weep at strangers dead by the road they resemble friends unseen in forty years why laugh when clowns are hit by pies we taste custard we taste life why love the woman who is your wife her nose breathes in the air of a world that i know therefore i love that nose her ears hear music i might sing half the night through therefore i love her ears her eyes delight in seasons of the land and so i love those eyes her tongue knows quince peach chokeberry mint and lime i love to hear it speaking because her flesh knows heat cold affliction i know fire snow and pain shared and once again shared experience billions of prickling textures cut one sense away cut part of life away cut two senses life halves itself on the instant we love what we know we love what we are common cause common cause common cause of mouth eye ear tongue hand nose flesh heart and soul buthow to say it look he tried put two men in a rail car one a soldier the other a farmer one talks war the other wheat and bore each other to sleep but let one spell longdistance running and if the other once ran the mile why those men will run all night like boys sparking a friendship up from memory so all men have one business in common women and can talk that till sunrise and beyond hell charles halloway stopped flushed selfconscious again knowing vaguely there was a target up ahead but not quite how to get there he chewed his lips dad dont stop thought will when you talk its swell in here youll save us go on the man read his sons eyes saw the same look in jim and walked slowly around the table touching a night beast here a clutch of ragged crones there a star a crescent moon an antique sun an hourglass that told time with bone dust instead of sand have i said anything i started out to say about being good god i dont know a stranger is shot in the street you hardly move to help but if half an hour before you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it really knowing is good not knowing or refusing to know is bad or amoral at least you cant act if you dont know acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff god god you must think im crazy this talk probably think we should be out duckshooting elephantgunning balloons like you did will but we got to know all there is to know about those freaks and that man heading them up we cant be good unless we know what bad is and its a shame were working against time showll close and the crowds go home early on a sunday night i feel well have a visit from the autumn people then that gives us maybe two hours jim was at the window now looking out across the town to the far black tents and the calliope that played by the turning of the world in the night is it bad he asked bad cried will angrily bad you ask that calmly said wills father a good question part of that show looks just great but the old saying really applies you cant get something for nothing fact is from them you get nothing for something they make you empty promises you stick our your neck andwham whered they come from asked jim who are they will went to the window with his father and they both looked out and charles halloway said to those far tents maybe once it was just one man walking across europe jingling his ankle bells a lute on his shoulder making a hunchbacked shadow before columbus maybe a man walked around in a monkey skin a million years ago stuffing himself with other peoples unhappiness chewed their pain all day like spearmint gum for the sweet savour and trotted faster revivified by personal disaster maybe this son after him refined his fathers deadfalls mantraps bonecrunchers headachers fleshtwitchers soulskinners these laid the scum on lonely ponds from which came vinegar gnats to snuff up noses mosquitoes to ride summernight flesh and sting forth those bumps that carnival phrenologists dearly love to fondle and prophesy upon so from one man here one man there walking as swift as his oily glances it became scuttles of dogmen begging gifts of trouble pandering misery seeking under carpets for centipede treads watchful of night sweats harkening by all bedroom doors to hear men twist basting themselves with remorse and warmwater dreams the stuff of nightmare is their plain bread they butter it with pain they set their clocks by deathwatch beetles and thrive the centuries they were the men with the leatherribbon whips who sweated up the pyramids seasoning it with other peoples salt and other peoples cracked hearts they coursed europe on the white horse of the plague they whispered to caesar that he was mortal then sold daggers at halfprice in the grand march sale some must have been lazing clowns foot props for emperors princes and epileptic popes then out on the road gypsies in time their populations grew as the world grew spread and there was more delicious variety of pain to thrive on the train put wheels under them and here they run down the long road out of the gothic and baroque look at their wagons and coaches the carving like medieval shrines all of it stuff once drawn by horses mules or maybe men all those years jims voice swallowed itself the same people you think mr cooger mr dark are both a couple hundred years old riding that merrygoround they can shave off a year or two any time they want right why then the abyss opened at wills feetthey could live forever and hurt people jim turned it over again and again but why why all the hurt because said mr halloway you need fuel gas something to run a carnival on dont you women live off gossip and whats gossip but a swap of headaches sour spit arthritic bones ruptured and mended flesh indiscretions storms of madness calms after the storms if some people didnt have something juicy to chew on their choppers would prolapse their souls with them multiply their pleasure at funerals their chuckling through breakfast obituaries add all the catfight marriages where folks spend careers ripping skin off each other and patching it back upside around add quack doctors slicing persons to read their guts like tea leaves then sewing them tight with fingerprinted thread square the whole dynamite factory by ten quadrillion and you got the black candlepower of this one carnival all the meannesses we harbour they borrow in redoubled spades theyre a billion times itchier for pain sorrow and sickness than the average man we salt our lives with other peoples sins our flesh to us tastes sweet but the carnival doesnt care if it stinks by moonlight instead of sun so long as it gorges on fear and pain thats the fuel the vapour that spins the carousel the raw stuffs of terror the excruciating agony of guilt the screams from real or imagined wounds the carnival sucks that gas ignites it and chugs along its way charles halloway took a breath shut his eyes and said how do i know this i dont i feel it i taste it it was like old leaves burning on the wind two nights ago it was a smell like mortuary flowers i hear that music i hear what you tell me and half what you dont tell me maybe ive always dreamt about such carnivals and was just waiting for it to come sols to see it once and nod now that tent show plays my bones like a marimba my skeleton knows it tells me i tell you can they said jim i mean do they buy souls buy when they can get them free said mr halloway why most men jump at the chance to give up everything for nothing theres nothing were so slapstick with as our own immortal souls besides youre inferring thats the devil out there i only say its a type of creature has learned to live off souls not the souls themselves that always worried me in the old myths i asked myself why would mephistopheles want a soul what does he do with it when he gets it of what use is it stand back while i throw my own theory over the plate those creatures want the gas off souls who cant sleep nights that fever by day from old crimes a dead soul is no kindling but a live and raving soul crippled with selfdamnation oh thats a pretty snoutful for such as them how do i know this i observe the carnival is like people only more so a man a woman rather than walk away from or kill each other ride each other a lifetime pulling hair extracting fingernails the pain of each to the other like a narcotic that makes existence worth the day so the carnival feels ulcerated egos miles off and lopes to toast its hands at that ache it smells boys ulcerating to be men paining like great unwise wisdom teeth twenty thousand miles away summer abed in winters night it feels the aggravation of middleaged men like myself who gibber after longlost august afternoons to no avail need want desire we burn those in our fluids oxidize those in our souls which jet streams out lips nostrils eyes cars broadcasts from antennaefingers long or short wave god only knows but the freakmasters perceive itches and come crabclustering to scratch its traveled a long way on an easy map with people handy by every crossroad to lend it lustful pints of agony to power it on so maybe the carnival survives living off the poison of the sins we do each other and the ferment of our most terrible regrets charles halloway snorted good grief how much have i said out loud how much to myself the last ten minutes you said jim talk a lot in what language dammit cried charles halloway for suddenly it seemed he had done no more than other nights walking exquisitely alone deliciously propounding his ideas to halls which echoed them once then made them vanish forever he had written books a lifetime on the airs of vast rooms in vast buildings and had it all fly out the vents now it all seemed fireworks done for color sound the high architecture of words to dazzle the boys powder his ego but with no mark left on retina or mind after the color and sound faded a mere exercise in selfdeclamation sheepishly he accosted himself how much of all this got through one sentence out of five two out of eight three in a thousand said will charles halloway could not but laugh and sigh in one then jim cut across with is is it death the carnival the old man lit his pipe blew smoke seriously studied the patterns no but i think it uses death as a threat death doesnt exist it never did it never will but weve drawn so many pictures of it so many years trying to pin it down comprehend it weve got to thinking of it as an entity strangely alive and greedy all it is however is a stopped watch a loss an end a darkness nothing and the carnival wisely knows were more afraid of nothing than we are of something you can fight something but nothing where do you hit it has it a heart soul buttbehind brain no no so the carnival just shakes a great croupiers cupful of nothing at us and reaps us as we tumble back headoverheels in fright oh it shows us something that might eventually lead to nothing all right that flourish of mirrors out there in the meadow thats a raw something for sure enough to knock your soul sidewise in the saddle its a hit below the belt to see yourself ninety years gone the vapors of eternity rising from you like breath off dry ice then when its frozen you stiff it plays that fine sweet soulsearching music that smells of freshwashed frocks of women dancing on backyard lines in may that sounds like haystacks trampled into wine all that blue sky and summer nightonthelake kind of tune until your head bangs with the drums that look like full moons beating around the calliope simplicity lord i do admire their direct approach hit an old man with mirrors watch his pieces fall in jigsaws of ice only the carnival can put together again how waltz around back on the carousel to beautiful ohio or merry widow but theyre careful not to tell one thing to people who go riding to its music what asked jim why that if youre a miserable sinner in one shape youre a miserable sinner in another changing size doesnt change the brain if i made you twentyfive tomorrow jim your thoughts would still be boy thoughts and itd show or if they turned me into a boy of ten this instant my brain would still be fifty and that boy would act funnier and older and weirder than any boy ever then too times out of joint another way which way asked will if i became young again all my friends would still be fifty sixty wouldnt they id be cut off from them forever for i couldnt tell them what id up and done could i theyd resent it theyd hate me their interests would no longer be mine would they especially their worries sickness and death for them new life for me so wheres the place in this world for a man who looks twenty but who is older than methuselah what man could stand the shock of a change like that carnival wont warn you its equal to postoperative shock but by god i bet it is and more so what happens you get your reward madness change of body change of personal environment for one thing guilt for another guilt at leaving your wife husband friends to die the way all men dielord that alone would give a man fits so more fear more agony for the carnival to breakfast on so with the green vapors coming off your stricken conscience you say you want to go back the way you were the carnival nods and listens yes they promise if you behave as they say in a short while theyll give you back your twoscore and ten or whatever on the promise alone of being returned to normal old age that train travels with the world its side show populated with madmen waiting to be released from bondage meantime servicing the carnival giving it coke for its ovens will murmured something what mss foley mourned will oh poor miss foley they got her now just like you say once she got what she wanted it scared her she didnt like it oh she was crying so hard dad so hard now i bet they promise her someday she can be fifty again if shell mind i wonder what theyre doing with her right now oh dad oh jim god help her wills father put a heavy hand out to trace the old carnival portraits theyve probably thrown her in with the freaks and what are they sinners whove traveled so long hoping for deliverance theyve taken on the shape of their original sins the fat man what was he once if i can guess the carnivals sense of irony the way they like to weight the scales he was once a ravener after all kinds and varieties of lust no matter there he lives now anyway collected up in bursting skin the man skeleton or whatever did he starve his wifes childrens spiritual as well as physical hungers the dwarf was he or was he not your friend the lightningrod salesman always on the road never settling evermoving facing no encounters running ahead of the lightning and selling rods yes but leaving others to face the storm so maybe through accident or design when he fell in with the free rides he shrank not to a boy but a mean ball of grotesque tripes all selfinvolved the fortunetelling gypsy dust witch maybe someone who lived always tomorrow and let today slide like myself and so wound up pen having to guess other peoples wild sunrises and sad sunsets you tell me youve seen her near the pinhead the sheep boy the fire eater the siamese twins good god what were they twins all bound up in tandem narcissism well never know theyll never tell weve guessed and probably guessed wrong on ten dozen things the last half hour nowsome plan where do we go from here charles halloway placed forth a map of the town and drew in the location of the carnival with a blunt pencil do we keep hiding out no with miss foley and so many others involved we just cant well then how do we attack so we wont be picked off first thing what kind of weapons silver bullets cried will suddenly heck no snorted jim theyre not vampires if we were catholic we could borrow church holy water and nuts said jim movie stuff it dont happen that way in real life am i wrong mr halloway i wish you were boy wills eyes glowed fiercely okay only one thing to do trot down to the meadow with a couple gallons of kerosene and some matches thats against the law jim exclaimed look whos talking hold on but everyone stopped right then whisper a faint tide of wind flowed up along through the library corridors and into this room the front door jim whispered someone just opened it far away a gentle click the draft that had for a moment stirred the boys trouser cuffs and blown the mans hair ceased someone just closed it silence just the great dark library with its labyrinths and hedgerow mazes of sleeping books someones inside the boys half rose bleating in the backs of their mouths charles halloway waited then said one word softly hide we cant leave you hide the boys ran and vanished in the dark maze charles halloway then rigidly slowly breathing in breathing out forced himself to sit back down his eyes on the yellowed newspapers to wait to wait then again to wait some more a shadow moved among shadows charles halloway felt his soul submerge it took a long time for the shadow and the man it escorted to come stand in the doorway of the room the shadow seemed deliberate in its slowness so as to shingle his flesh and cheesegrate his steadily willed calm and when at last the shadow reached the door it brought not one not a hundred but a thousand people with it to look in my name is dark said the voice charles halloway let out two fistfuls of air better known as the illustrated man said the voice where are the boys boys wills father turned at last to appraise the tall man who stood in the door the illustrated man sniffed the yellow pollen that whiffed up from the ancient books as quite suddenly wills father saw them laid out in full sight leaped up stopped then began to close them one by one as casually as possible the illustrated man pretended not to notice the boys are not home the two houses are empty what a shame theyll miss those free rides i wish i knew where they were charles halloway started carrying the books to the shelves hell if they knew you were here with free tickets theyd shout for joy would they mr dark let his smile melt like a white and pink paraffin candy toy he no longer had appetite for softly he said i could kill you charles halloway nodded walking slowly did you hear what i said barked the illustrated man yes charles halloway weighed the books as if they were his judgment but you wont kill now youre too smart youve kept the show on the road a long time being smart so youve read a few papers and think you know all about us no not all just enough to scare me be more scared then said the crowd of nightcrawling illustrations locked under black suiting speaking through the thin lips one of my friends outside can fix you so it seems you died of most natural heart failure the blood banged at charles halloways heart knocked at his temples tapped twice at his wrists the witch he thought his lips must have formed the words the witch mr dark nodded the other shelved the books withholding one well what have you there mr dark squinted a bible how very charming how childish and refreshingly oldfashioned have you ever read it mr dark read it ive had every page paragraph and word read at me sir mr dark took time to light a cigarette and blow smoke toward the no smoking sign then at wills father do you really imagine that books can harm me is naivete really your armor here and before charles halloway could move mr dark ran lightly forward and took the bible he held it in his two hands arent you surprised see i touch hold even read from it mr dark blew smoke on the pages as he riffled them do you expect me to fall away into so many dead sea scrolls of flesh before you myths unfortunately are just that life and by life i could mean so many fascinating things goes on makes shift for itself survives wildly and i not the least wild among many your king james and his literary version of some rather stuffy poetic materials is worth just about this much of my time and sweat mr dark hurled the bible into a wastepaper basket and did not look at it again i hear your heart beating rapidly said mr dark my ears are not so finely tuned as the gypsys but they hear your eyes jump beyond my shoulder the boys hide out there in the warrens good i would not wish for their escape not that anyone will believe their gibberings in fact its good advertisement for our shows people titillate nightsweat then come prowling down to look us over lick their lips and wonder about investing in our special securities you came you prowled and it wasnt just for curiosity how old are you charles halloway pressed his lips shut fifty purred mr dark fiftyone he murmured fiftytwo like to be younger no no need to yell politely please mr dark hummed strolling the room running his hand over the books as if they were years to be counted oh its nice to be young really wouldnt forty be nice again fortys ten years nicer than fifty and thirtys twenty years nicer by an incredible long shot i wont listen charles halloway shut his eyes mr dark tilted his head sucked on his cigarette and observed strange you shut your eyes not to listen clapping your hands over your ears would be better wills father clapped his hands to his ears but the voice came through tell you what said mr dark casually waving his cigarette if you help me within fifteen seconds ill give you your fortieth birthday ten seconds and you can celebrate thirtyfive a rare young age a stripling almost by comparison ill start counting by my watch and by god if you should jump to it lend a hand i might just cut thirty years off your life bargains galore as the posters say of it starting all over again everything fine and new and glorious all the things to be done and thought and savored again last chancel here goes one two three four charles halloway hunched away half crouched propped hard against the shelves grinding his teeth to drown the sound of counting youre losing out old man my dear old fellow said mr dark five losing six losing very much seven really losing eight frittering away nine ten my god you fool eleven halloway twelve almost gone thirteen gone fourteen lost fifteen lost forever mr dark put down his arm with the watch on it charles halloway gasping had turned away to bury his face in the smell of ancient books the feel of old and comfortable leather the taste of funeral dust and pressed flowers mr dark stood in the door now on his way out stay there he directed listen to your heart ill send someone to fix it but first the boys the crowd of unsleeping creatures saddled upon tall flesh strode quietly forth into darkness borne with and all over upon mr dark their cries and whines and utterances of vague but excruciating excitements sounded in his husky summoning boys are you there wherever you are answer charles halloway sprang forward then felt the room spin and whirl him as that soft that easy that most pleasant voice of mr dark went calling through the dark charles halloway fell against a chair thought listen my heart sank down to his knees he said listen to my heart it explodes oh god its tearing freeand could not follow the illustrated man trod catsoft in the labyrinths of shelved and darkly waiting books boys hear me silence boys somewhere in the recumbent solitudes the motionless but teeming millions of books lost in two dozen turns right three dozen turns left down aisles through doors toward dead ends locked doors halfempty shelves somewhere in the literary soot of dickenss london or dostoevskys moscow or the steppes beyond somewhere in the vellumed dust of atlas or geographic sneezes pent but set like traps the boys crouched stood lay sweating a cool and constant brine somewhere hidden jim thought hes coming somewhere hidden will thought hes near boys mr dark came carrying his panoply of friends his jewelcase assortment of calligraphical reptiles which lay sunning themselves at midnight on his flesh with him strode the stitchinked tyrannosaurus rex which lent to his haunches a machined and ancient wellspring mineraloil glide as the thunder lizard strode all glassbead pomp so strode mr dark armored with vile lightning scribbles of carnivores and sheep blasted by that thunder and arun before storms of juggernaut flesh it was the pterodactyl kite and scythe which raised his arms almost to fly the marbled vaults and with the inked and stencilled flashburnt shapes of pistoned or bladed doom came his usual crowd of hangerson spectators gripped to each limb seated on shoulder blades peering from his jungled chest hung upside down in microscopic millions in his armpit vaults screaming batscreams for encounters ready for the hunt and if need be the kill like a black tidal wave upon a bleak shore a dark tumult infilled with phosphorescent beauties and badly spoiled dreams mr dark sounded and hissed his feet his legs his body his sharp face forward boys immensely patient that soft voice ever the warmest friend to chilly creatures burrowed away nested amongst dry books so he scuttered crept scurried stalked tiptoed wafted stood immensely still among the primates the egyptian monuments to bestial gods brushed black histories of dead africa stayed awhile in asia then sauntered on to newer lands boys i know you hear me the sign reads silence so ill whisper one of you still wants what we offer eh eh jim thought will me thought jim no oh no not still not me come out mr dark purred the air through his teeth i guarantee rewards whoever turns himself in wins it all bangitybang my heart thought jim is that me thought will or jim i hear you mr darks lips quivered closer now will jim isnt it jim whos the smart one come along boy no thought will i dont know anything thought jim wildly jim yes mr dark wheeled in a new direction jim show me where your friend is softly well shut him up give you the ride that would have been his if hed used his head right jim a dove voice cooing closer i hear your heart jump stop thought will to his chest stop jim clenched his breath stop i wonder are you in this alcove mr dark let the peculiar gravity of a certain group of stacks tug him forward you here jim or over behind he shoved a trolley of books mindlessly off on rubber rollers to bump through the night a long way off it crashed and spilled its contents to the floor like so many dead black ravens smart hideandseekers both said mr dark but someones smarter did you hear the carousel calliope tonight did you know someone dear to you was down to the carousel will willy william william halloway wheres your mother tonight silence she was out riding the night wind willywilliam around we put her on around we left her on around you hear willy around a year another year another around around dad thought will where are you in the far room charles halloway seated his heart pounding heard and thought he wont find them i wont move unless he does he cant find them they wont listen they wont believe hell go away your mother will called mr dark softly around and around can you guess which direction willy mr dark circled his thin ghost hand in the dark air between the stacks around around and when we let your mother off boy and showed her herself in the mirror maze you should have heard the one single sound she made she was like a cat with a hair ball in her so big and sticky there was no way to gag it out no way to scream around the hair coming out her nostrils and ears and eyes boy and her old old old the last we saw of her boy willy she was running off away from what she saw in the mirrors shell bang jims house door but when his ma sees a thing two hundred years old slobbering at the keyhole begging the mercy of gunshot death boy jims ma will gag the same way like a hairballed cat sick but cant be sick and beat her away send her beggaring the streets where no onell believe will such a kettle of bones and spit no onell believe this was a rose beauty your kind relations so will its up to us to run find ran save her for we know who she isright will right will right right right the dark mans voice hissed away to silence very faintly now somewhere in the library someone was sobbing ah the illustrated man gassed the air pleasantly from his dank lungs yesssssssssss here he murmured what filed under b for boys a for adventure h for hidden s for secret t for terrified or filed under j for jim or n for nightshade w for william h for halloway where are my two precious human books so i may turn their pages eh he kicked a place for his right foot on the first shelf of a towering stack he shoved his right foot in put his weight there and swung his left foot free there his left foot hit the second shelf knocked space he climbed his right foot kicked a hole on the third shelf plunged books back and so up and up he climbed to fourth shelf to fifth to six groping dark library heavens hands clutching shelfboards then scrabbling higher to leaf night to find boys if boys there were like bookmarks among books his right hand a princely tarantula garlanded with roses cracked a book of bayeaux tapestries aspin down the sightless abyss below it seemed an age before the tapestries struck all askew a ruin of beauty an avalanche of gold silver and skyblue thread on the floor his left hand reaching the ninth shelf as he panted grunted encountered empty spaceno books boys are you here on everest silence except for the faint sobbing nearer now is it cold here colder coldest the eyes of the illustrated man came abreast of the eleventh shelf like a corpse laid rigid out face down just three inches away was jim nightshade one shelf further up in the catacomb eyes trembling with tears lay william halloway well said mr dark he reached a hand to pat wills head hello he said to will the palm of the hand that drifted up was like a moon rising upon it was the fiery blueinked portrait of himself jim too saw a hand before his face his own picture looked back at him from the palm the hand with wills picture grabbed will the hand with jims picture grabbed jim shrieks and yells the illustrated man heaved twisting he felljumped to the floor the boys kicking yelling fell with him they landed on their feet toppled collapsed to be held reared set right fistfuls of their shirts in mr darks fists jim he said will what were you doing up there boys surely not reading dad mr halloway wills father stepped from the dark the illustrated man rearranged the boys tenderly under one arm like kindling then gazed with genteel curiosity at charles halloway and reached for him wills father struck one blow before his left hand was seized held squeezed as the boys watched shouting they saw charles halloway gasp and fall to one knee mr dark squeezed that left hand harder and doing this slowly certainly pressured the boys with his other arm crushing their ribs so air gushed from their mouths night spiraled in fiery whorls like great thumbprints inside wills eyes wills father groaning sank to both knees flailing his right arm damn you but said the carnival owner quietly i am already damn you damn you not words old man said mr dark not words in books or words you say but real thoughts real actions quick thought quick action win the day so he gave one last mighty clench of his fist the boys heard charles halloways finger bones crack he gave a last cry and fell senseless in one motion like a solemn pavane the illustrated man rounded the stacks the boys kicking books from shelves under his arms will feeling walls books floors fly by foolishly thought pressed close why why mr dark smells like calliope steam both boys were dropped suddenly before they could move or regain their breath each was gripped by the hair on their head and roused marionetteswise to face a window a street boys you read dickens mr dark whispered critics hate his coincidences but we know dont we lifes all coincidence turn death and happenstance flakes off him like fleas from a killed ox look both boys writhed in the ironmaiden clutch of hungry saurians and bristly apes will did not know whether to weep with joy or new despair below across the avenue passing from church going home was his mother and jims mother not on the carousel not old crazy dead in jail but freshly out in the good october air she had been not a hundred yards away in church during all the last five minutes mom screamed will against the hand which anticipating his cry clamped tight to his mouth mom crooned mr dark mockingly come save me no thought will save yourself run but his mother and jims mother simply strolled content from the warm church through town mom screamed will again and some small muffled bleat of it escaped the sweaty paw wills mother a thousand miles away over on that sidewalk paused she couldnt have heard thought will yet she looked over at the library good sighed mr dark excellent fine here thought will see us mom run call the police why doesnt she look at this window asked mr dark quietly and see us three standing as for a portrait look over then come running well let her in will strangled a sob no no his mothers gaze trailed from the front entrance to the firstfloor windows here said mr dark second floor a proper coincidence lets make it proper now jims mother was talking both women stood together at the curb no thought will oh no and the women turned and went away into the sundaynight town will felt the illustrated man slump the tiniest bit not much of a coincidence no crisis no one lost or saved pity well dragging the boys feet he glided down to open the front door someone waited in the shadows a lizard hand scurried cold on wills chin halloway husked the witchs voice a chameleon perched on jims nose nightshade whisked the drybroom voice behind her stood the dwarf and the skeleton silent shifting apprehensive obedient to the occasion the boys would have given their best stored yells air but again on the instant recognizing their need the illustrated man trapped the sound before it could issue forth then nodded curtly to the old dust woman the witch toppled forward with her seamed black wax sewnshut iguana eyelids and her great proboscis with the nostrils caked like tobaccoblackened pipe bowls her fingers tracing weaving a silent plinth of symbols on the mind the boys stared her fingernails fluttered darted feathered cold winterwater air her pickled green froes breath crawled their flesh in pimples as she sang softly mewing humming glistering her babes her boys her friends of the slick snailtracked roof the straightflung arrow the stricken and skydrowned balloon darningneedle dragonfly sew up these mouths so they not speak touch sew touch sew her thumbnail stabbed punched drew stabbed punched drew along their lower upper lips until they were threadpouch shut with invisible read darning needledragonfly sew up these ears so they not hear cold sand funneled wills ears burying her voice muffled far away fading she chanted on with a rustle tick tickle tap flourish of caliper hands moss grew in jims ears swiftly sealing him deep darning needledragonfly sew up these eyes so they not see her whitehot fingerprints rolled back their stricken eyeballs to throw the lids down with bangs like great tin doors slammed shut will saw a billion flashbulbs explode then suck to darkness while the unseen darningneedle insect out beyond somewhere pranced and fizzed like insect drawn to sunwarmed honeypot as closeted voice stitched off their senses forever and a day beyond darningneedle dragonfly have done with eye ear lip and tooth finish hem sew dark mound dust heap with slumber sleep now tie all knots ever so neat pump silence in blood like sand in river deep so so the witch somewhere outside the boys lowered her hands the boys stood silent the illustrated man took his embrace from them and stepped back the woman from the dust sniffed at her twin triumphs ran her hand a last loving time over her statues the dwarf toddled madly about in the boys shadows nibbling daintily at their fingernails softly calling their names the illustrated man nodded toward the library the janitors clock stop it the witch mouth wide savoring doom wandered off into the marble quarry mr dark said left right one two the boys walked down the steps the dwarf at jims side the skeleton at wills serene as death the illustrated man followed somewhere near charles halloways hand lay in a whitehot furnace melted to sheer nerve and pain he opened his eyes at the same moment he heard a great breath as the front door swung shut and a womans voice came singing in the hall old man old man old man old man where his left hand should be was this swelled blood pudding which pulsed with such ecstasies of pain it fed forth his life his will his whole attention he tried to sit up but the pain hammerblowed him down again old man not old fiftyfours not old he thought wildly and here she came on the worn stone floors her mothfingers tapping scanning braille book titles as her nostrils siphoned the shadows charles halloway hunched and crawled hunched and crawled toward the nearest stack cramming pain back with his tongue he must climb out of reach climb where books might be weapons flung down upon any nightcrawling pursuer old man hear you breathing she on his tide let her body be summoned by every sibilant hiss of his pain old man feel your hurt if he could fling the hand the pain out the window where it might lie beating like a heart summoning her away tricked to go seek this awful fire bent in the street he imagined her brisking her palms at this throb an abandoned chunk of delirium but no the hand stayed glowed poisoned the air hurrying the strange nungypsys tread as she gasped her avaricious mouth most ardently damn you he cried get it over with im here so the witch wheeled swift as a black clothes dummy on rubber rollers and swayed over him he did not even look at her such weights and pressures of despair and exertion fought for his attention he could only free his eyes to watch the inside of his lids upon which multiple and ever changing looms of terror jigged and gamboled very simple the whisper bent low stop the heart why not he thought vaguely slow she murmured yes he thought slow very slow his heart once bolting now fell away to a strange ease disquiet then quiet then ease much more slow slow she suggested tired yes you hear that heart he wondered his heart heard like a tight fist it began to relax a finger at a time stop all for good forget all for good she whispered well why not slower slowest his heart stumbled and then for no reason save perhaps for a last look around because he did want to get rid of the pain and sleep was the way to do that charles halloway opened his eyes he saw the witch he saw her fingers working at the air his face his body the heart within his body and the soul within the heart her swamp breath flooded him while with immense curiosity he watched the poisonous drizzle from her lips counted the folds in her stitchwrinkled eyes the gila monster neck the mummylinen ears the dryrivulet riversand brow never in his life had he focused so nearly to a person as if she were a puzzle which once touched together might show lifes greatest secret the solution was in her it would all spring clear this moment no the next no the next watch her scorpion fingers hear her chant as she diddled the air yes diddled was it tickling tickling slow she whispered slow and his obedient heart pulled rein diddletickle went her fingers charles halloway snorted faintly he giggled he caught this why why am i gigling at such a time the witch pulled back the merest quarter inch as if some strange but hidden electric light socket touched with wet whorl gave shock charles halloway saw but did not see her flinch sensed but seemed in no way to consider her withdrawal for almost immediately seizing the initiative she flung herself forward not touching but mutely gesticulating at his chest as one might try to spell an antique clock pendulum slow she cried senselessly he permitted an idiot smile to balloon itself up from somewhere to attach itself with careless ease under his nose slowest her new fever her anxiety which changed itself to anger was even more of a toy to him a part of his attention secret until now leaned forward to scan every pore of her halloween face somehow irresistibly the prime thing was nothing mattered life in the end seemed a prank of such size you could only stand off at this end of the corridor to note its meaningless length and its quite unnecessary height a mountain built to such ridiculous immensities you were dwarfed in its shadow and mocking of its pomp so with death this near he thought numbly but purely upon a billion vanities arrivals departures idiot excursions of boy boyman man and oldman goat he had gathered and stacked all manner of foibles devices playthings of his egotism and now between all the silly corridors of books the toys of his life swayed and none more grotesque than this thing named witch gypsy readerofdust tickling thats what just tickling the air fool didnt she know what she was doing he opened his mouth of itself like a child born of an unsuspecting parent one single raw laugh broke free the witch swooned back charles halloway did not see he was far too busy letting the joke rush through his fingers letting hilarity spring forth of its own volition along his throat eyes squeezed shut there it flew whipping shrapnel in all directions you he cried to no one everyone himself her them it all funny you no the witch protested stop tickling he gasped not she lunged back frantically not sleep slow very slow no tickling is all it is for sure he roared oh ha ha stop yes stop heart she squealed stop blood her own heart must have shaken like a tambourine her hands shook in midgesticulation she froze and became aware of the silly fingers oh my god he wept beautiful glad tears get off my ribs oh ha go on my heart your heart yesssssss god he popped his eyes wide gulped air released more soap and water washing everything clear incredibly clean toys the key sticks out your back who wound you up and the largest roar of all flung at the woman burnt her hands seared her face or so it seemed for she seized herself as from a blast furnace wrapped her fried hands in egyptian rags gripped her dry dugs skipped back gave pause then started a slow retreat nudged pushed pummeled inch by inch foot by foot clattering bookracks shelves fumbling for handholds on volumes that thrashed free as she scrambled them down her brow knocked dim histories vain theories dunedup time promised but compromised years chased bruised beaten by his laugh which echoed rang swam to fill the marble vaults she whirled at last claws razoring the wild air and fled to fall downstairs moments later she managed to cram herself through the front door which slammed her fall the door slam almost broke his frame with laughter oh god god please stop stop yourself he begged of his hilarity and thus begged his humor let be in midroar at last all faded to honest laughter pleasant chuckling faint giggling then softly and with great contentment receiving and giving breath shaking his happyweary head the good ache of action in his throat and ribs gone from his crumpled hand he lay against the stacks head leaned to some dear befriending book the tears of releaseful mirth salting his cheeks and suddenly knew her gone why he wondered what did i do with one last bark of mirth he rose up slow whats happened oh god lets get it clear first the drug store a halfdozen aspirin to cure this hand for an hour then think in the last five minutes you did win something didnt you whats victory taste like try to remember and smiling a new smile at the ridiculous deadanimal left hand nested in his right crooked elbow he hurried down the night corridors and out into town iii departures the small parade moved soundless past the eternally revolving endingbutunending candy serpentine of mr crosettis barber pole past all the darkening or darkened shops the emptying streets for people were home now from the church suppers or out at the carnival for the last side show or the last highladder diver floating like milkweed down the night wills feet far away below clubbed the sidewalk one two he thought someone tells me left right dragonfly whispers onetwo is jim in the parade wills eyes flicked the briefest to one side yes but whos the other little one the gonemad everythingsinterestingsotouchit everythings redhot pullback dwarf plus the skeleton and then behind who were all those hundreds no thousands of people marching along breathing down his neck the illustrated man will nodded and whined so high and silently that only dogs dogs who were no help dogs who could not speak might hear and sure enough looking obliquely over he saw not one not two but three dogs who smelling the occasion their own parade now ran ahead now fell behind their tails like guidons for the platoon bark thought will like in the movies bark bring the police but the dogs just smiled and trotted coincidence please thought will just a small one mr tetley yes will sawbutdidnotsee mr tetley rolling the wooden indian back into his shop closing for the night turn heads murmured the illustrated man jim turned his head will turned his head mr tetley smiled smile murmured mr dark the two boys smiled hello said mr tetley say hello someone whispered hello said jim hello said will the dogs barked a free ride at the carnival murmured mr dark free ride said will at the carnival cracked jim then like good machines they shut up their smiles have fun called mr tetley the dogs barked joy the parade marched on fun said mr dark free rides when the crowds go home half an hour from now well ride jim round you still want that jim hearing but not hearing locked away in himself will thought jim dont listen jims eyes slid wet or oily it was hard to tell youll travel with us jim and if mr cooger doesnt survive its a near thing for him we havent saved him yet well try again now but if he doesnt make it jim how would you like to be partners ill grow you to a fine strong age eh twentytwo twentyfive dark and nightshade nightshade and dark sweet lovely names for such as we with such as the side shows to run around the world what say jim jim said nothing sewn up in the witchs dream dont listen wailed his best friend who heard nothing but heard it all and will said mr dark lets ride him back and back eh make him a babe in arms a babe for the dwarf to

thats best for will a plaything a little wet friend for the dwarf will must have screamed but not out loud for only the dogs barked in terror yiping off they ran as if pelted with rocks a man came around the comer a policeman whos this muttered mr dark mr kolb said jim mr kolb said will darningneedle whispered mr dark dragonfly pain stabbed wills ears moss stuffed his eyes gum glued his teeth he felt a multitudinous tapping shuttling weaving about his face all numb again say hello to mr kolb hello said jim kolb said the dreaming will hello boys gentlemen turn here said mr dark they turned away toward meadow country away from warm lights good town safe streets the drumless march progressed stretched out over a mile of territory the straggling parade now moved as follows at the edge of the carnival midway stumping the grass with their dead feet jim and will paced friends who constantly retold the wondrous uses of darningneedle dragonflies behind a good half mile trying to catch up walking mysteriously wounded the gypsy who whorlsymboled the dust and yet farther back came the janitorfather now slowing himself with remembrances of age now pacing swiftly young with thoughts of the brief first encounter and victory carrying his left hand patted to his chest chewing medicines as he went at the midway rim mr dark looked back as if an inner voice had named the stragglers in his widely separated maneuver but the voice failed he was unsure he nodded briskly and dwarf skeleton jim will thrust through the crowd jim felt the river of bright people wash by all around but not touching will heard waterfall laughter here there and him walking through the downpour an explosion of fireflies blossomed on the sky the ferris wheel exultant as a titanic fireworks dilated above them then they were at the mirror maze and sidling coliding bumping careening through the unfolded ice ponds where stricken spiderstung boys much like themselves appeared vanished a thousand times over thats me thought jim but i cant help me thought will no matter how many of me there are and crowd of boys plus crowd of reflected mr darks illustrations for he had taken off his coat and shirt now crammed and crushed through to the waxworks at the end of the maze sit said mr dark stay among the wax figures of murdered gunshot guillotined garroted men and women the two boys sat like egyptian cats unblinked untwitched unswallowing some late visitors passed through laughing they commented on all the wax figures they did not notice the thin line of saliva crept from the comer of one wax boys mouth they did not see how bright was the second wax boys stare which suddenly brimmed and ran clear water down his cheek outside the witch limped in through back alleys of rope and peg between the tents ladies and gentlemen the last crowd of the night three or four hundred strong turned as a body the illustrated man stripped to the waist all nightmare viper sabertooth libidinous ape clotted vulture all salmonsulphur sky rose up with annunciations the last free event this evening come one come all the crowd surged toward the main platform outside the freak tent where stood dwarf skeleton and mr dark the most amazingly dangerous ofttimes fatalworld famous bullet trick the crowd gasped with pleasure the rifles if you please the thin one cracked wide a racked display of bright artillery the witch hurrying up froze when mr dark cried and here our deathdefier the bulletcatcher who will stake her lifemademoiselle tarot the witch shook her head bleated but darks hand swept down to swing her like a child to the platform still protesting which gave dark pause but in front of everyone now he went on a volunteer please to fire the rifle the crowd rumbled softly daring itself to speak up mr darks mouth barely moved under his breath he asked is the clock stopped not she whined stopped no he almost burst out he burnt her with his eyes then turned to the audience and let his mouth finish the spiel his fingers rapping over the rifles volunteers please stop the act the witch cried softly wringing her hands it goes on damn you worse than doubledamn you he whispered whistled fiercely secretly dark gathered a pinch of flesh on his wrist the illustration of a blacknun blind woman which he bit with his fingernails the witch spasmed seized her breast groaned ground her teeth mercy she hissed half aloud silence from the crowd mr dark nodded swiftly since there are no volunteers he scraped his illustrated wrist the witch shuddered we will cancel our last act and here a volunteer the crowd turned mr dark recoiled then asked where here far out at the edge of the crowd a hand lifted a path opened mr dark could see very clearly the man standing there alone charles halloway citizen father introspective husband nightwanderer and janitor of the town library the crowds appreciative clamor faded charles halloway did not move he let the path grow leading down to the platform he could not see the expression on the faces of the freaks standing up there his eyes swept the crowd and found the mirror maze the empty oblivion which beckoned with ten times a thousand million light years of reflections counterreflections reversed and doublereversed plunging deep to nothing facefalling to nothing stomachdropping away to yet more sickening plummets of nothing and yet wasnt there an echo of two boys in the powdered silver at the back of each glass did or did he not perceive with the tremulous tip of eyelash if not the eye their passage through their wait beyond warm wax amongst cold waiting to be keywound by terrors run free in panics no thought charles halloway dont think get on with this coming he shouted go get em pop a man said yes said charles halloway i will and he walked down through the crowd the witch spun slowly magnetized at the nightwandering volunteers approach her eyelids jerked at their sewn blackwax threads behind dark glasses mr dark the illustrationdrenched superinfested civilization of souls leaned from the platform gladly whetting his lips thoughts spun fiery catherine wheels in his eyes quick quick what what what and the aging janitor fixing a smile to his face like a white celluloid set of teeth from a cracker jack box strode on and the crowd opened as the sea before moses and closed behind and him wondering what to do why was he here but on the move steadily nevertheless charles halloways foot touched the first step of the platform the witch trembled secretly mr dark felt this secret glanced sharply swiftly he put his hand out to grab for the good right hand of this fiftyfouryearold man but the fiftyfouryearold man shook his head would not give his hand to be held touched or helped up thanks no on the platform charles halloway waved to the crowd the people set off a few firecrackers of applause but mr dark was amazed your left hand sir you cant hold and fire a rifle if you have only the use of one hand charles halloway paled ill do it he said with one hand hoorah cried a boy below go it charlie a man called out beyond mr dark flushed as the crowd laughed and applauded even louder now he lifted his hands to ward off the wave of refreshing sound like rain that washed in from the people all right all right lets see if he can do it brutally the illustrated man snapped a rifle from its locks hurled it through the air the crowd gasped charles halloway ducked he put up his right hand the rifle slapped his palm he grabbed it did not fall he had it good the audience hooted said things against mr darks bad manners which made him turn away for a moment damning himself silently wills father lifted the rifle beaming the crowd roared and while the wave of applause came in crashed and went back down the shore he looked again to the maze where the sensed but unseen shadowshapes of will and jim were filed among titanic razor blades of revelation and illusion then back to the medusa gaze of mr dark swiftly reckoned with and on to the stitched and jittering sightless nun of midnight sidling back still more now she was as far as she could sidle at the far end of the platform almost pressed to the whorled redblack rifle bullseye target boy shouted charles halloway mr dark stiffened i need a boy volunteer to help me hold the rifle shouted charles halloway someone anyone he shouted a few boys in the crowd shifted around on their toes boy shouted charles halloway hold on my sons out there hell volunteer wont you will the witch flung one band up to feel the shape of this audacity which came off the fiftyfouryearold man like a fever mr dark was spun round as if hit by a fasttraveling gunshot will called his father in the wax museum will sat motionless will called his father come on boy the crowd looked left looked right looked back no answer will sat in the wax museum mr dark observed all of this with some respect some degree of admiration some concern he seemed to be waiting just as was wills father will come help your old man mr halloway cried jovially will sat in the wax museum mr dark smiled will willy come here no answer mr dark smiled more willy dont you hear your old man mr dark stopped smiling for this last was the voice of a gentleman in the crowd speaking up the crowd laughed will called a woman willy called another yoohoo a gentleman in a beard come on william a boy the crowd laughed more jostled elbows charles halloway called they called charles halloway cried to the hills they cried to the hills will willy william a shadow shuttled and wove in the mirrors the witch broke out chandeliers of sweat there the crowd stopped calling as did charles halloway choked on the name of his son now and silent for will stood in the entrance of the maze like the wax figure that he almost was will called his father softly the sound of this chimed the sweat off the witch will moved unseeing through the crowd and handing the rifle down like a cane for the boy to grasp his father drew him up onto the stand heres my good left hand announced the father will neither saw nor heard the crowd sound forth a solid and offensive applause mr dark had not moved though charles halloway could see him during all this lighting and setting off cannon crackers in his head but each one by one fizzled and died mr dark could not guess what they were up to for that matter charles halloway did not know or guess it was as if he had written this play for himself over the years in the library nights torn up the play after memorizing it and now forgotten what he had set forth to remember he was relying on secret discoveries of self moment by moment playing by ear no heart and soul and now the brightness of his teeth seemed to strike the witch blinder impossible she flung one hand to her glasses her sewn eyelids closer everyone called wills father the crowd gathered in the platform was an island the sea was people watch the bullseye targeteer the witch melted in her rags the illustrated man looked left found no pleasure in the skeleton who simply looked thinner found no pleasure looking right to a dwarf who blandly dwelt in squashed idiot madness the bullet please wills father said amiably the thousand illustrations on his jerking horseflesh frame did not hear so why should mr dark if you please said charles halloway the bullet so i may knock that flea off the old gypsys wart will stood motionless mr dark hesitated out in the choppy sea smiles flashed here there a hundred two hundred three hundred whitenesses as if a vast titillation of water had been provoked by a lunar gravity the tide ebbed the illustrated man in slow motion proffered the bullet his arm a long molasses undulation lazed to offer the bullet to the boy to see if he would notice he did not notice his father took the missile mark it with your initials said mr dark by rote no with more charles halloway raised his sons hand and made him hold the bullet so he could take a penknife with his one good hand and carve a strange symbol on the lead whats happening will thought i know whats happenmg i dont know whats happening what mr dark saw a crescent moon on the bullet saw nothing wrong with such a moon rammed it in the rifle slapped the rifle back at wills father who once more caught it deftly ready will the boys peach face drowsed in the slightest nod charles halloway flicked a last glance at the maze thought jim you there still get ready mr dark turned to go pat conjure calm his dustcrone friend but cracked to a halt at the crack of the rifle being reopened the bullet ejected by wills father to assure the audience it was there it seemed real enough yet he had read long ago that this was a substitute bullet shaped of a very hard steelcolored crayon wax shot through the rifle it would dissolve out the barrel as smoke and vapor at this very moment having somehow switched bullets the illustrated man was slipping the real marked bullet into the witchs jerking fingers she would hide it in her cheek at the shot she would pretend to jolt under the imagined impact then reveal the bullet caught by her yellow rat teeth fanfare applause the illustrated man glancing up saw charles halloway with the opened rifle the wax bullet but instead of revealing what he knew mr halloway simply said lets cut our mark more clearly eh boy and with his penknife the boy holding the bullet in his senseless hand he marked this fresh new wax unmarked bullet with the same mysterious crescent moon then snapped it back into the rifle ready mr dark looked to the witch who hesitated then nodded once faintly ready announced charles halloway and all about lay the tents the breathing crowds the anxious freaks a witch iced with hysteria jim hidden to be found an ancient mummy still seated glowing with blue fire in his electric chair and a merrygoround waiting for the show to cease the crowd to go and the carnival to have its way with boys and janitor trapped if possible and alone will said charles halloway conversationally as he lifted the now suddenly heavy rifle your shoulder here is my brace take the middle of the rifle gently with one hand take it will the boy raised a hand thats it son when i say hold hold your breath hear me the boys head tremored with the slightest affirmation he slept he dreamed the dream was nightmare the nightmare was this and the next part of this was his father shouting ladies gentlemen the illustrated man clenched his fist wills picture lost in it like a flower was crushed will twisted the rifle fell charles halloway pretended not to notice me and will here will now together him being the good left arm i cant use do the one and only most dangerous sometimes fatal bullet trick applause laughter quickly the fiftyfouryearold janitor denying each year laid the rifle back on the boys jerking shoulder hear that will listen thats for us the boy listened the boy grew calm mr dark tightened his fist will was taken with slight palsy well hit em bullseye on wont we boy said his father more laughter and the boy grew very calm indeed with the rifle on his shoulder and mr dark squeezed tight on the peachfuzz face nestled in the flesh of his hand but the boy was serene in the laughter which still flowed and his father kept the hoop rolling thus show the lady your teeth will will showed the woman against the target his teeth the blood fell away from the witchs f ace now charles halloway showed her his teeth too such as they were and winter lived in the witch boy said someone in the audience shes great acts scared look im looking thought wills father his left hand useless at his side his right hand up to the rifle trigger his face to the sight as his son held the rifle unswervingly pointed at the bullseye and the witchs face superimposed there and the last moment come and a wax bullet in the chamber and what could a wax bullet do a bullet that dissolved in transit what use why were they here what could they do silly silly no thought wills father stop he stopped the doubts he felt his mouth shape words with no sound but the witch heard what he said above the dying laughter before the warm sound was completely goes he made these words silently with his lips the crescent moon i have marked on the bullet is not a crescent moon it is my own smile i have put my smile on the bullet in the rifle he said it once he waited for her to understand he said it silently again and in the moment before the illustrated man himself translated the mouthings quickly charles halloway cried faintly hold will held his breath far back among wax statues jim hid away dripped saliva from his chin strapped in electric chair a deadalive mummy hummed power in its teeth mr darks illustrations writhed with sick sweat as he clenched his fist a final time buttoo late serene will held breath held weapon serene his father said now and fired the rifle one shot the witch sucked breath jim in the wax museum sucked breath as did will asleep as did his father as did mr dark as did all the freaks as did the crowd the witch screamed jim among the wax dummies blew all the air from his lungs will shrieked himself awake on the platform the illustrated man let the air from his mouth in a great angry bray whipping up his hands to stop all events but the witch fell she fell off the platform she fell in the dust the smoking rifle in his one good hand charles halloway let his breath go slow feeling every bit of it move from him he still stared along the rifle sights at the target where the woman had been at the platform rim mr dark looked down at the screaming crowd and what they were screaming about shes fainted no she slipped shes shot at last charles halloway came to stand by the illustrated man looking down there were many things in his face surprise dismay and some small strange relief and satisfaction the woman was lifted and put on the platform her mouth was frozen open almost with a look of recognition he knew she was dead in a moment the crowd would know he watched the illustrated mans hand move down to touch trace feel for life then mr dark lifted both her hands like a doll in some marionette strategy to give her motion but the body refused so he gave one of the witchs arms to the dwarf the other to the skeleton and they shook and moved them in a ghastly semblance of reawakening as the crowd backed dead but theres no wound shock you think shock thought charles halloway my god did that kill her or the other bullet when i fired the shot did she suck the other bullet down her throat did she choke on my smile oh christ its all right shows over just fainted said mr dark all an act all part of the show he said not looking at the woman not looking at the crowd but looking at will who stood blinking around out of one nightmare and fresh into the next as his father stood with him and mr dark cried everyone home shows over lights lights the carnival lights flickered the crowd herded before the failing illumination turned like a great carousel and as the lamps dimmed hustled toward the few remaining pools of light as if to warm themselves there before braving the wind one by one one by one the lights indeed were going off lights said mr dark jump said wills father will jumped will ran with his father who still carried the weapon that had fired the smile that had killed the gypsy and put her to dust is jim in there they were at the maze behind them on the platform mr dark bellowed lights go home all over done is jim in there wondered will yes yes he is inside the wax museum jim still had not moved had not blinked jim the voice came through the maze jim moved jim blinked a rear exit door stood wide jim blundered toward it im coming for you jim no dad will caught at his father who stood at the first turn of the mirrors with the pain come back to his hands racing up along the nerves to strike a fireball near his heart dad dont go in will gabbed his good arm behind them the platform was empty mr dark was running where somewhere as the night shut in the lights went off went off went off the night sucked around gathering whistling simpering and the crowd like a shake of leaves from one huge tree blew off the midway and wills father stood facing the glass tides the waves the gauntlet of horror he knew waited for him to swim through stride through to fight the desiccation the annihilation of ones self that waited there he had seen enough to know eyes shut youd be lost eyes open youd know such utter despair such gravities of anguish would weight you you might never drag past the twelfth turn but charles halloway took wills hands away jims there jim wait im coming in and charles halloway took the next step into the maze ahead flowed sluices of silver light deep slabs of shadow polished wiped rinsed with images of themselves and others whose souls passing scoured the glass with their agony curried the cold ice with their narcissism or sweated the angles and flats with their fear jim he ran will ran they stopped for the lights in here were going blind one by one going dim changing color now blue now a color like lilac summer lightning which flared in haloes then a flickerlight like a thousand ancient windblown candles and between himself and jim in need of rescue stood an army of one million sickmouthed frosthaired whitetinebearded men them all of them he thought thats me dad thought will at his back dont be afraid its only you all only my father but he did not like their look they were so old so very old and got much older the farther away they marched wildly gesticulating as dad threw up his hands to fend off the revelation this wild image repeated to insanity dad he thought its you but it was more and all the lights went out and both squeezed still in mufflegasping silence stood afraid a hand dug like a mole in the dark wills hand it emptied his pockets it delved it rejected it dug again for while it was dark he knew those million old men might march hustle rush leap smash dad with what they were in this shutup night with just four seconds to think of them they might do anything to dad if will didnt hurry these legions from time future all the alarms of coming life so mean raw and true you couldnt deny thats how dadd look tomorrow next day the day after the day after that that cattle run of possible years might sweep dad under so quick who has more pockets than a magician a boy whose pockets contain more than a magicians a boys will seized forth kitchen matches oh god dad here he struck the match the stampede was close they had come running now fixed by light they widened their eyes as did dad amazed their mouths at their own ancient quakes and masquerades halt the match had cried and platoons left squads right had stiltmuscled themselves to fitful rest to baleful glare itching for the match to whiff out then given lease to run next time theyd hit this old very old much older terribly old man suffocate him with fates in one instant no said charles halloway no a million dead lips moved will thrust the match forward in the mirrors a wizened multiplication of boyapes did likewise posing a single rosebud of blueyellow flame no every glass threw javelins of light which invisibly pierced sank deep found heart soul lungs to frost the veins cut nerves send will to ruin paralyze and then kickfootball heart hamstrung the old old man foundered to his knees as did his suppliant images his congregation of terrified selves one week one month two years twenty fifty seventy ninety years from now every second minute and longaftermidnight hour of his possible survival into insanity there all sank grayer more yellow as the mirrors ricocheted him through bled him lifeless mouthed him dry then threatened to whiff him to skeletal dusts and litter his moth ashes to the floor no charles halloway struck the match from his sons hand dad dont for in the new dark the restive herd of old men shambled forward hearts hammering dad we gotta see he struck his second and final match and in the flare saw dad sunk down eyes clenched fists tight and all those other men who would have to shunt crawl scramble on knees once this last light was gone will grabbed his fathers shoulder and shook him oh dad dad i dont care how old you are ever i dont care what i dont care anything oh dad he cried weeping i love you at which charles halloway opened his eyes and saw himself and the others like himself and his son behind holding him the flame trembling the tears trembling on his face and suddenly as before the image of the witch the memory of the library defeat for one victory for another swam before him mixed with sound of rifle shot flight of marked bullet surge of fleeing crowd for only a moment longer he looked at all of himselves at will a small sound escaped his mouth a little larger sound escaped his mouth and then at last he gave the maze the mirrors and all time ahead beyond around above behind beneath or squandered inside himself the only answer possible he opened his mouth very wide and let the loudest sound of all free the witch if she were alive would have known that sound and died again jim nightshade out the back door of the maze lost on the carnival grounds running stopped the illustrated man somewhere among the black tents running stopped the dwarf froze the skeleton turned all had heard not the sound that charles halloway made no but the terrific sounds that followed one mirror alone and then a second mirror followed by a pause and then a third mirror and a fourth and another after that and another after that and still another and another after that in domino fashion they formed swift spiderwebs over their fierce stares and then with faint tinkles and sharp cracks fell one minute there was this incredible jacobs ladder of glass folding refolding and folding away yet again images pressed in a book of light the next all shattered to meteor precipitation the illustrated man halted listening felt his own eyes crystal almost spiderweb and splinter with the sounds it was as if charles halloway once more a choirboy in a strange subsubdemon church had sung the most beautiful high note of amiable humor ever in his life which first shook mothsilver from the mirror backs then shook images from glass faces then shook glass itself to ruin a dozen a hundred a thousand mirrors and with them the ancient images of charles halloway sank earthward in delicious moonfalls of snow and sleety water all because of the sound he had let come from his lungs through his throat out his mouth all because he accepted everything at last accepted the carnival the hills beyond the people in the hills jim will and above all himself and all of life and accepting threw back his head for the second time tonight and showed his acceptance with sound and lo like jericho and the trump with musical thunders the glass gave up its ghosts charles halloway cried out released he took his hands from his face fresh starlight and dying carnival glow rushed in to set him free the reflected dead men were gone buried under the cymbaled slide the splash and surfing of glass at his feet lights lights a far voice cried away more warmth the illustrated man unfrozen vanished among the tents the crowd was now gone dad whatd you do but the match burned wills fingers he dropped it but now there was dim light enough to see dad shuffle the trash stir the mess of mirrored glass heading back through the empty places where the maze had been and was no more jim a door stood open pale carnival illumination fading poured through to show them wax figures of murderers and murderess jim did not sit among them jim they stared at the open door through which jim had run to be lost in the swarms of night between black canvases the last electric light bulb went out well never find him now said will yes said his father standing in the dark well find him where will thought and stopped far down the midway the carousel steamed the calliope tortured itself with musics there thought will if jims anywhere its there to the music old funny jim the freeride ticket hid in his pocket still i bet oh damn jim damn him damn him he cried and then thought no dont you hes damned already or near it so how do we find him in the dark no matches no lights just the two of us all of them and us alone in their territory how said will aloud but his father said there very softly with gratitude and will stepped to the door which was lighter now the moon thank god it was rising from the hills the police no time its the next few minutes or nothing three people we got to worry about the freaks three people will number one jim number two mr cooger frying in his electric chair number three mr dark and his skinful of souls save one kick the other two to hell and gone then i think the freaks go too you ready will will eyed the door the tents the dark the sky with new light paling it god bless the moon hands tight together they stepped out the door as if to greet them the wind flung up and down all the tent canvases in a great prehistoric thunderkite display of leprous wings they ran in urine smell of shadow they ran in clean ice smell of moon the calliope steamthrob whispered tatted trilled the music thought will is it running backward or forward which way dad whispered through here will pointed a hundred yards off beyond a foothill of tents there was a flare of blue light sparks jumped up and fell away then dark again mr electrico thought will theyre trying to move him sure get him to the merrygoround kill or cure and if they cure him then oh gosh then its angry him and angry illustrated man against just dad and me and jim well where was jim this way one day that way the next and tonight whose side would he wind up on ours old friend jim ours of course but will trembled did friends last forever then for eternity could they be counted to a warm round and handsome sum will glanced left the dwarf stood half enfolded by tent flaps waiting motionless dad look cried will softly and therethe skeleton further over the tall man the man all marble bone and egyptian papyrus stood like a dead tree the freakswhy dont they stop us scared of us wills father crouched and squinted out from around an empty cage theyre walking wounded anyway they saw what happened to the witch thats the only answer look at them and there they stood like uprights like tent poles spotted all through the meadow grounds hiding in shadow waiting for what will swallowed hard maybe not hiding at all but spread out for the running fight to come at the right time mr dark would yell and theyd just circle in but the time wasnt right mr dark was busy when hed done what must be done then hed give that yell so so thought will we got to see he never yells at all wills feet slithered in the grass wills father moved ahead the freaks watched with moonglass eyes as they passed the calliope changed it whistled sadly sweetly around a curve of tents around a riverflow of darkness its going ahead thought will yes it was going backward but now it stopped and started again and this time forward whats mr dark up to jim will burst out sh dad shook him but the name had tumbled from his mouth only because he heard the calliope summing the golden years ahead felt jim isolate somewhere pulled by warm gravities swung by sunrise notes wondering what it could be like to stand sixteen seventeen eighteen years tall and then oh then nineteen and most incredibletwenty the great wind of time blew in the brass pipes a fine a jolly a summer tune promising everything and even will hearing began to run toward the music that grew up like a peach tree full of sunripe fruit no he thought and instead made his feet step to his own fear jump to his own tune a hum cramped back by throat held fast by lungs which shook the bones of his head and drowned the calliope away there said dad softly and between the tents ahead in transit they saw a grotesque parade like a dark sultan in a palanquin a halffamiliar figure rode a chair borne on the shoulders of assorted sizes and shapes of darkness at dads cry the parade jolted then broke into a run mr electrico said will theyre taking him to the carousel the parade vanished a tent lay between them around here will jumped pulling his father the calliope played sweet to pull jim to draw jim and when the parade arrived with electrico back the music would spin back the carousel run to shard away his skin to freshen forth his years will stumbled fell dad picked him up and then there arose a human barking yapping baying whining as if all had fallen in a longdrawn moan a gasp a shuddering sigh an entire crowd of people with crippled throats made chorus together jim theyve got jim no murmured charles halloway strangely maybe jim or us got them they stepped around the last tent wind blew dust in their faces will clapped his hand up squinched his nose the dust was antique spice burnt maple leaves a prickling blue that teemed and sifted to earth swarming its own shadows the dust filtered over the tents charles halloway sneezed figures jumped and scurried away from an upended halftilted object abandoned halfway between one tent and the carousel the object was the electric chair capsized with straps dangling from wooden arms and legs and a metal headcap hanging from its top but said will wheres mr electrico i mean mr cooger that must have been him what must have been him but the answer was there sifting down the midway in the whorling wind devils the burnt spice the autumn incense that had floured them when they turned this comer kill or cure charles halloway thought he imagined them rushed in the last few seconds toting the ancient dustsack boneheap over starched grasses in his disconnected chair perhaps only one in a running series of attempts to foster encourage preserve life in what was really nothing but a mortuary junkpile rustflakes and dying coals that no wind could blow alight again yet they must try how many times in the last twentyfour hours had they run out on such excursions only in panic to cease activity because the merest jolt the slightest breath threatened to shake old ancient cooger down to mealmush and chaff better to leave him propped in electricwarm chair a continual exhibit an evergoingon performance for gaping audiences and try again but especially try now when lights out and crowds herded off in the dark all threatened by one smile on a bullet there was need of cooger as he once was tall flameheaded and riven with earthquake violence but somewhere twenty seconds ten seconds ago the last glue crumbled the last bolt of life fell free and the mummydoll the erectorset grotesque disencumbered itself in smoke puffs and november leaflets a broadcast of mortality along the wind mr cooger threshed in a final harvest was now a billion parchment flecks tumbled seascrolls capered in meadows a mere dust explosion in a silo of ancient grain gone oh no no no no no someone murmured charles halloway touched wills arm will stopped saying oh no no no he too in the last few moments had thought the same as his father of the toted corpse the strewn bonemeal the mineralenriched hills of grass now there was only the empty chair and the last particles of mica the radiant motes of peculiar dirt crusting the straps and the freaks who had been toting the baroque dump now fled to shadows we made them run thought will but something made them drop it no not something someone will flexed his eyes the carousel deserted empty traveled on its way through its own special time forward but between the fallen chair and the carousel standing alone was that a freak no jim dad knocked his elbow and will shut up jim he thought and where now was mr dark somewhere for he had started the carousel hadnt he yes to draw them to draw jim andwhat else right now there was no time for jim turned from the spilled chair turned and walk slowly toward the free free ride he was going where he had always known he must go like a weather vane in wild seasons he had tremored this way wandered that hesitated upon bright horizons and warm directions only at last now to tilt and half sleepwalking tremble about in the bright brass pull and summer march of music he could not look away another step and then another toward the merrygoround there went jim go get him will said his father will went jim raised his right hand the brass poles flashed by into the future pulling the flesh like syrup stretching the bones like taffy the sunmetal color burning jims cheeks flinting his eyes jim reached the brass poles flickknocked his fingernails tinkling their own small tune jim the brass poles chopped by in a yellow sunrise at night the music leaped in a clear fountain high eeeeeeeeeeeeeee jim opened his mouth with the same cry eeeeeeeeeeeeee jim cried will running jims palm slapped one brass pole the pole whipped on he slapped another brass pole this time his palm glued itself tight wrist followed fingers arm followed wrist shoulder and body followed arm jim sleepwalked was torn from his roots in the earth jim will reached felt jims foot flick from his grasp jim swung round the waiting night in a great dark summer circle will racing after jim get off jim dont leave me here flung by centrifuge jim grasped the pole with one hand spun and as if by some lone lost and final instinct gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind the one part of him the small white separate part that still remembered their friendship jim jump will snatched for that hand missed stumbled almost fell the first race was lost jim must circle once alone will stood waiting the next charge of horses the flingabout of boy notsomuch boy jim jim jim awoke circled half round his face showed now july now december he seized the pole bleating out his despair he wanted he did not want he wished he rejected he ardently wished again in flight in heatspell river of wind and blaze of metal in jog of july and august horses whose hoofs thudded the air like thrown fruit his eyes blazed tongue clamped in teeth he hissed his frustration jim jump dad stop the machine charles halloway turned to see where the control box stood fifty feet off jim wills side was stabbed with pain i need you come back and far over away on the far side of the carousel traveling fasttraveling jim fought with his own hands the pole the empty windwhipped journey the growing night the wheeling stars he let go the pole he grabbed it and still his right hand trailed down and out begging wills last full ounce of strength jim jim came around there below in the blacknight station from which this train pulled away forever in a flurry of ticketpunch confetti he saw willwillywilliam halloway young pal young friend who would seem younger still at the end of this journey and not just young but unknown vaguely remembered from some other time in some other year but now that boy that friend that younger friend ran along by the train reached up asking passage or demanding he get off which jim remember me will lunged his final lunge fingers touched fingers palm touched palm jims face white cold stared down will trotpaced the circling machine where was dad

shouted will shouted they traveled half a year in slithering orchardwarm dark before will seized jims arm tight and dared to leap from so much promise so many fine tallgrowing years flail out off down pull jim with but jim could not let go the pole could not give up the ride will jim half between machine and friend one hand on each screamed it was like a great tearing of cloth or flesh jims eyes went blind as a statues the carousel whirled jim screamed fell spun crazily on the air will tried to break his fall but jim struck earth rolling he lay silent charles halloway hit the carousel control switch empty the machine slowed its horses paced themselves down from their trot toward some far midsummer night together charles halloway and his son knelt by jim to touch his wrist to put ear to his chest jims eyes skinned white were fixed on the stars oh god cried will is he dead dead wills father moved his hand over that cold face the cold chest i dont feel a long way off someone cried for help they looked up a boy came running down the midway bumping into the ticket booths falling over tent ropes looking back over his shoulder help hes after me the boy cried the terrible man the terrible man i want to go home the boy flung himself forward and grabbed at wills father oh help im lost i dont like it take me home that man with the tattoos mr dark gasped will yes gibbered the boy hes down that way oh stop him will his father rosetake care of jim artificial respiration all right boy the boy trotted off this way following charles halloway watched the distraught boy who led him observed his head his frame the way his pelvis hung from his spine boy he said by the shadowed merrygoround twenty feet around from where will bent to jim whats your name no time cried the boy jed quick quick charles halloway stopped jed he said the boy no longer moved but turned chafing his elbows how old are you jed nine said the boy my gosh this is no time we this is a fine time jed said charles halloway only nine so young i was never that young holy cow shouted the boy angrily or unholy something said the man and reached out the boy backed away youre only afraid of one man jed me you the boy still backed off cut it out why why because sometimes good has weapons and evil none sometimes tricks fail sometimes people cant be picked off led to deadfalls no divideandconquer tonight jed where were you taking me jed to some lions cage you got fixed and ready to some side show like the mirrors to someone like the witch what what jed what lets just roll up your right shirt sleeve shall we jed the great moonstone eyes flashed at charles halloway the boy leaped back but not before the man had leaped with him seized his arm grabbed the back of his shirt and instead of simply rolling up the sleeve as first suggested tore the entire shirt off the boys body why yes jed said charles halloway almost quietly just as i thought you you you you yes jed me but especially you look at you and look he did for there on the back of the small boys hand on the fingers and up along the wrist scrambled blue serpents bluevenomed snake eyes blue scorpions scuttling about blue shark maws which gaped eternally hungry to feed upon all the freaks crammed and stungsewn cheek by jowl skin to skin flesh to flesh all up and down the chest the tiny torso and tucked in the secret gathering places on this small small very small body this cold and now shocked and trembling body why jed thats fine artwork that is you the boy struck yes still me charles halloway took the blow in the face and clamped a vise on the boy no oh yes said charles halloway using just his good right hand his ruined left hand hanging limp yes jed jump squirm go ahead it was a fine idea get me off alone fix me then go back and get will and when the police come why youre just a boy nine or ten and the carnival oh no its not yours doesnt belong to you stay here jed why you trying to get out from under my arm the police look and the owners of the show have vanished isnt that it jed a fine escape you cant hurt me the boy shrieked funny said charles halloway i think i can he pressed the boy almost lovingly close very close murder wailed the boy murder im not going to murder you jed mr dark whoever whatever you are youre going to murder yourself because you cant stand being near people like me not this close close not this long evil groaned the boy writhing youre evil evil wills father laughed which made the boy waspstung and brambled by the sound jerk all the more violently evil the mans hands were flypaper fastened to the small bones strange hearing that from you jed so it must seem good to evil seems evil so i will do only good to you jed i will simply hold you and watch you poison yourself i will do good to you jed mr dark mr proprietor boy until you tell whats wrong with jim wake him up let him free give him life cant cantthe boys voice fell down a well inside his body fading away away cant you mean you wont cant all right boy all right then here and here and this and this they looked like father and son long apart passionately met embraced yet more embraced as the man lifted his wounded hand to gently touch the stricken face as the crowd the teem of illustrations shivered and flew now this way and that in microscopic forays quickly abandoned the boys eyes swiveled wildly fixed upon the manes mouth he saw there the strange and somehow lovely smile once flung as beatification to the witch he gathered the boy somewhat closer and thought evil has only the power that we give it i give you nothing i take back starve starve starve the two matchstick lights in the boys affrighted eyes blew out the boy and his stricken and bruised conclave of monsters his felt but halfseen crowd fell to earth there should have been a roar like a mountain slid to ruin but there was only a rustle like a japanese paper lantern dropped in the dust charles halloway stood for a long while breathing deep lungs aching looking down at the body the shadows swooned and fluttered in all the canvas alleys where odd assorted sizes of freaks and people fleshed in their own terrors and sins held to poles moaning in disbelief somewhere the skeleton moved out in the light somewhere else the dwarf almost knew who he was and scuttled forth like a crab from a cave to blink and blink again at will bent working over jim at wills father bent to exhaustion over the still form of the silent boy while the merrygoround at last slow slow came to a stop rocking like a ferryboat in the wateryblowing grass the carnival was a great dark hearth lit with gathered coals as shadows came to stare and fire their gaze with the tableau by the carousel there in the moonlight lay the illustrated boy named dark there lay dragons slaughtered towers ruined monsters from dim ages toppled into rusted coinages pterodactyls smashed like biplanes from old and always meaningless wars crustacea the color of emeralds abandoned on a white sand shore where the tide of life was going out all all the illustrations changing now shifting shriveling as the small flesh cooled there the obscene wink of the navel eye gasped in on itself there the nippleiris of a trumpeting mastodon went blind and raved at its blindness each and every picture remembered from the tall mr dark now rendered down to miniature canvas pronged and forked over a boys tennisracket bones more freaks with faces the color of beds where so many had lost the battle of souls emerged from the shadows to glide in a great and ever more curious carousel motion about charles halloway and his dropped burden will paused in his desperate push and relaxation push and relaxation trying to shape jim back to life unafraid of the watchers in the dark no time for that even if there were time these freaks he sensed were breathing the night as if they had not been fed on such rare fine air in years and as charles halloway watched and the foxfire lobstermoist phlegmtrapped eyes watched from distances the boywhohadbeenmrdark grew yet colder as death cut the timbers of nightmares and the calligraphies the smoky lightnings of sketch that coiled and crouched and soared like terrible banners of a lost war began to vanish one by one from the strewn small body a score of freaks glanced fearfully round as if the moon had suddenly filled itself full and they could see they chafed their wrists as if chains had fallen from them chafed their necks as if weights had crumbled from their bowed shoulders stumbled forth after long entombments they blinked swiftly disbelieving the packet of their misery sprawled near the spent carousel if they dared they might have bent to tremble their hands over that suddenly deathsweet mouth the marbling brow as it was they watched benumbed as their portrait pictures the vital stuffs of their mortal greed rancor and poisonous guilt the emerald abstracts of their selfblinded eyes selfwounded mouths selftrapped bodies melted one by one from this insignificant mound of snow there melted the skeleton there the sidewisescuttling crayfish dwarf now the lava sipper took leave of autumn flesh followed by the black executioner from london dock there soared off and gone went the human montgolfier the balloon man avoirdupois the magnificent deflated to purest air there there fled mobs and bands as death washed the drawing board clean now there lay just a plain dead boy unbruised by pictures staring up at the stars with mr darks empty eyes ahhhh in a chorus of release the strange people in the shadows sighed perhaps the calliope gave a last ringmasters bark perhaps thunder turned sleeping in the clouds suddenly all wheeled about the freaks stampeded north south east west free of tent master dark law free above all of each other they ran like albino pigs tuskless boars and stricken sloths before storms it must have been it seemed each yanked a rope loosed a tentpeg running for now the sky was shaken with a fatal respiration the breathing down the insunk rattle and pule of collapsing darkness as the tents gave way with hiss of viper swirl of cobra the ropes insanely raveled slithered snapped cut grass with frictioned whips the networks of the vast main freak tent convulsed parted bones small from medium and medium from brontosaur magnificent all swayed with impending fall the menagerie tent shut up like a dark spanish fan other small tents caped figures in the meadow fell down at the winds command then at last the freak tent the great melancholy mothering reptile bird after a moment of indecision sucked in a niagara of blizzard air broke loose three hundred hempen snakes crackrattled its black sidepoles so they fell like teeth from a cyclopean jaw slammed the air with acres of moldered wing as if trying to kite away but earthtethered must succumb to plain and most simple gravity must be crushed by its own locked bulk now this greatest tent stated out hot raw breaths of earth confetti that was ancient when the canals of venice were not yet staked and wafts of pink cotton candy like tired feather boas in rushing downfalls the tent shed skin grieved soughed as flesh fell away until at last the tall museum timbers at the spine of the discarded monster dropped with three cannon roars the calliope simmered moronic with wind the train stood an abandoned toy in a field the freak oil paintings clapped hands high on the last standing pennant poles then plummeted to earth the skeleton the only strange one left bent to pick up the body of the porcelain boywhowasmr dark he moved away into the fields will in a swift moment saw the thin man and his burden go over a hill among all the footprints of the vanished carnival race wills face shadowed this way then that pulled by the swift concussions the tumults the deaths the fleeing away of souls cooger dark skeleton dwarfwhowaslightningrodsalesman dont run come back miss foley where are you mr crosetti its over be still quiet its all right come back come back but the wind was blowing their footprints out of the grass and they might run forever now trying to outflee themselves so will turned back astride jim and pushed the chest and let go pushed and let go then trembling touched his dear friends cheek jim but jim was cold as spaded earth beneath the cold was a fugitive warmness in the white skin lay some small color but when will felt jims wrist there was nothing and when he put his ear to the chest there was nothing hes dead charles halloway came to his son and his sons friend and knelt down to touch the quiet throat the unstirred rib cage no puzzled not quite dead the tears burst from wills eyes but then as swiftly be felt himself knocked struck shaken stop that cried his father you want to save him its too late oh dad shut up listen but will wept and again his father hauled off and hit him once on the left cheek once on the right cheek hard all the tears in him were knocked flying there were no more will his father savagely jabbed a finger at him and at jim damn it willy all this all these mr dark and his sort they like crying my god they love tears jesus god the more

miss foley so she joined the grand march nowhere joined the fools who wanted everything idiot thing to want everything poor damned fools so wound up with nothing like the dumb dog who dropped his bone to go after the reflection of the bone in the pond will you saw every mirror fell like ice in a thaw with no rock or rifle no knife just my teeth tongue and lungs i gunshot those mirrors with pure contempt knocked down ten million scared fools and let the real man get to his feet now on your feet will but jim will faltered half in half out jims been that always soretempted now he went too far and maybe hes lost but he fought to save himself right put his hand out to you to fall free of the machine so we finish that fight for him move will sailed up giddily yanked run will sniffed again dad slapped his face tears flew like meteors hop jump yell he banged will ahead shuffled with him shoved his hand in his pockets tearing them inside out until he pulled forth a bright object the harmonica dad blew a chord will stopped staring down at jim dad clouted him on the car run dont look will ran a step dad blew another chord yanked wills elbow flung each of his arms sing what god boy anything the harmonica tried a bad swanee river dad will shuffled shaking his head immensely tired silly sure we want that silly damn fool man silly harmonica bad offkey tune dad whooped he circled like a

seized wills hair shook him nothing funny sure there is me you jim all of us the whole shooting works look and charles halloway pulled faces popped his eyes mashed his nose winked cavorted like

knees dust flow off his soles oh susanna oh dont you cry for me for im come from alabama with my banjo on my together knee the harmonica knocked teeth wheezing dad hocked forth great chords of squeezeeyed hilarity turning in a circle jumping up to kick his heels ha they collided halfcollapsed knocked elbows cracked heads which blew the air out faster ha oh god ha oh god will ha weak ha in the middle of wild laughter a sneeze they spun they stared who lay there on the moonlit earth jim jim nightshade had he stirred was his mouth wider his eyelids quivering were his cheeks pinker dont took dad swung will handily round in a further reel they dosidoed hands extended the harmonica seeping and guzzling raw tunes from a father who storked his legs and turkeyed his arms they hopped jim one way hopped back as if he were but a lumpstone on the grass someones in the kitchen with dinah someones in the kitchen i knowohohoh jims tongue slid out on his lips no one saw this or if they saw ignored it fearing it might pass jim did the final things himself his eyes opened he watched the dancing fools he could not believe he had been off on a journey of years now returned no one said hi all jigged sambostyle tears might have jumped to his eyes but before they could start jims mouth curved he gave up a ghost of laughter for after all there indeed was silly will and his silly old janitor dad racing like gorillas knuckledusting the meadows their faces a puzzlement they toppled above him clapped bands wiggled cars bent to wash him all over with their now bright fullriver flowing laughter that could not be stopped if the sky fell or the earth rent open to blend their good mirth with his to fuselight and set him off in a detonation which could not stop exploding from ladyfingers to fourinchers to doomsday cannon crackers of delight and looking down joltdancing his bones loose and delicious will thought jim dont remember he was dead so we wont tell not nowsome day sure but not doodah doodah they didnt even say hello jim or join in the dance they just put out hands as if he had fallen from their swung pandemonium commotion and needed a boost back into the swarm they yanked jim jim flew jim came down dancing and will knew hand in hand hot palm to palm they had truly yelled sung gladly shouted the live blood back they had slung jim like the newborn knocked his lungs slapped his back shocked joyous breath to where it made room then dad bent and will leaped over him and will bent and dad jumped him and they both waited crouched in a line wheezing songs deliciously tired while jim swallowed spit and ran full tilt he got half over dad when they all fell rolled in the grass all hootowl and donkey all brass and cymbal as it must have been the first year of creation and joy not yet thrown from the garden until at last they drew up their feet socked each others shoulders embraced knees tight rocking and looking with swift bright happiness at each other growing winedrunkenly quiet and when they were done smiling at each others faces as at burning torches they looked away across the field and the black tent poles lay in elephant boneyards with the dead tents blowing away like the petals of a great black rose the only three people in a sleeping world a rare trio of tomcats they basked in the moon what happened asked jim at last what didnt cried dad and they laughed again when suddenly will grabbed jim held him tight and wept hey jim said over and over quietly hey hey jim jim will said well be pals forever sure hey sure jim was very quiet now its all right said dad have a small cry were out of the woods then well laugh some more going home will let jim go they got to their feet and stood looking at each other will examined his father with fierce pride oh dad dad you did it you did it no we did it together but without you itd all be over oh dad i never knew you i sure know you now do you will darn right each to the other shimmered in bright halos of wet light why then hello reply son and curtsey dad held out his hand will shook it both laughed and wiped their eyes then looked quickly at the foot prints scattered in the dew over the hills dad will they ever come back no and yes dad tucked away his harmonica no not them but yes other people like them not in a carnival god knows what shape theyll come in next but sunrise noon or at the latest sunset tomorrow theyll show theyre on the road oh no said will oh yes said dad we got to watch out the rest of our lives the fights just begun they moved around the carousel slowly what will they look like how will we know them why said dad quietly maybe theyre already here both boys looked around swiftly but there was only the meadow the machine and themselves will looked at jim at his father and then down at his own body and hands he glanced up at dad dad nodded once gravely and then nodded at the carousel and stepped up on it and touched a brass pole will stepped up beside him jim stepped up beside will jim stroked a horses mane will patted a horses shoulders the great machine softly tilted in the tides of night just three times around ahead thought will hey just four times around ahead thought jim boy just ten times around back thought charles halloway lord each read the thoughts in the others eyes how easy thought will just this once thought jim but then thought charles halloway once you start youd always come back one more ride and one more ride and after awhile youd offer rides to friends and more friends until finally the thought hit them all in the same quiet moment finally you wind up owner of the carousel keeper of the freaks proprietor for some small part of eternity of the traveling dark carnival shows maybe said their eyes theyre already here charles halloway stepped back into the machinery of the merrygoround found a wrench and knocked the flywheels and cogs to pieces then he took the boys out and he hit the control box one or two times until it broke and scattered fitful lightnings maybe this isnt necessary said charles halloway maybe it wouldnt run anyway without the freaks to give it power but he hit the box a last time and threw down the wrench its late must be midnight straight up obediently the city hall clock the baptist church clock the methodist the episcopalian the catholic church all the clocks struck twelve the wind was seeded with time last one to the railroad semaphore at green crossing is an old lady the boys fired themselves off like pistols the father hesitated only a moment he felt the vague pain in his chest if i run he thought what will happen is death important no everything that happens before death is what counts and weve done fine tonight even death cant spoil it so there went the boys and why not follow he did just that and lord it was fine printing their life in the dew on the cool fields that new dark suddenlylikechristmas morning the boys ran as tandem ponies knowing that someday one would touch base first and the other second or not at all but now this first minute of the new morning was not the minute or the day or morning of ultimate loss now was not the time to study faces to see if one was older and the other too much younger today was just another day in october in a year suddenly better than anyone supposed it could ever be just a short hour ago with the moon and the stars moving in a grand rotation toward inevitable dawn and them loping and the last of this nights weeping done and will laughing and singing and jim giving answer line by line as they breasted the waves of dry stubble toward a town where they might live another few years across from each other and behind them jogged a middleaged man with his own now solemn now amiable thoughts perhaps the boys slowed they never knew perhaps charles halloway quickened his pace he could not say but running even with the boys the middleaged man reached out will slapped jim slapped dad slapped the semaphore signal base at the same instant exultant they banged a trio of shouts down the wind then as the moon watched the three of them together left the wilderness behind and walked into the town
