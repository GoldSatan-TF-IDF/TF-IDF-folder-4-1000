the fifth elephant a discworld novell by terry pratchett they say the world is flat and supported on the back of four elephants who themselves stand on the back of a giant turtle they say that the elephants being such huge beasts have bones of rock and iron and nerves of gold for better conductivity over long distances they say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains no one actually saw it land which raised the interesting philosophical question when millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky and there is no one to hear it does it philosophically speaking make a noise and if there was no one to see it hit did it actually hit not rock and iron in their dead form as they are now but living rock and iron the dwarfs have quite an inventive mythology about minerals in other words wasnt it just a story for children to explain away some interesting natural occurrences as for the dwarfs whose legend it is and who mine a lot deeper than other people they say that there is a grain of truth in it on a clear day from the right vantage point on the ramtops a watcher could see a very long way across the plains if it was high summer they could count the columns of dust as the ox trains plodded on at a top speed of two miles an hour each pair pulling a train of two wagons carrying four tons apiece things took a long time to get anywhere but when they did there was certainly a lot of them to the cities of the circle sea they carried raw material and sometimes people who were off to seek their fortune and a fistful of diamonds to the mountains they brought manufactured goods rare things from across the oceans and people who had found wisdom and a few scars there was usually a days travelling between each convoy they turned the landscape into an unrolled time machine on a clear day you could see last tuesday heliographs twinkled in the distant air as the columns flashed messages back and forth about bandit presence cargoes and the best place to get double egg treble chips and a steak that overhung the plate all round lots of people travelled on the carts it was cheap it beat walking and you got there eventually some people travelled for free the driver of one wagon was having problems with his team they were skittish hed expect this in the mountains where all sorts of wild creatures might regard the oxen as a travelling meal but here there was nothing more dangerous than cabbages behind him down in a narrow space between the loads of cut lumber something slept it was just another day in ankhmorpork sergeant colon balanced on a shaky ladder at one end of the brass bridge one of the citys busiest thoroughfares he clung by one hand to the tall pole with the box on top of it and with the other he held up a homemade picture book to the slot in the front of the box and this is another sort of cart he said got it s said a very small voice from within the box okay said colon apparently satisfied he dropped the book and pointed down the length of the bridge now you see those two markers what has been painted across the cobbles and they mean ifacartgstweendeminlessnaminutes gointoofas the little voice parroted well done and then you paintapiccher taking care to show driversfaceorcartlicence and if its nighttime you use dersalmandertomakeitbright well done rodney and one of us will come along every day and collect your pictures got everything you want whats that sergeant colon looked down at the very large brown upturned face and smiled afternoon all he said climbing ponderously down the ladder what youre looking at mister jolson is the modern watch for the new millenienienum num s a bit big fred said all jolson looking at it critically ive seen lots of smaller ones watch as in city watch all ah right anyone goes too fast around here and lord vetinarill be looking at his picture next morning the iconographs do not lie all right fred cos theyre too stupid his lordships got fed up with carts speeding over the bridge see and asked us to do something about it im head of traffic now you know is that good fred i should just think so said sergeant colon expansively its up to me to keep the er arteries of the city from clogging up leadin to a complete breakdown of commerce and ruination for us all most vital job there is you could say and its just you doing it is it well mainly mainly corporal nobbs and the other lads help of course all jolson scratched his nose it was on a similar subject that i wanted to talk to you fred he said no problem all something very odds turned up outside my restaurant fred sergeant colon followed the huge man around the corner fred usually liked alls company because next to all he was very skinny indeed all jolson was a man whod show up on an atlas and change the orbit of small planets paving stones cracked under his feet he combined in one body and there was plenty of room left over ankhmorporks best chef and its keenest eater a circumstance made in mashed potato heaven sergeant colon couldnt remember what the mans real first name had been hed picked up the nickname by general acclaim since no one seeing him in the street for the first time could believe that it was all jolson there was a big cart on broad way other traffic was backed up trying to manoeuvre around it had my meat delivered at lunchtime fred and when my carter came out all jolson pointed to the large triangular construction locked around one wheel of the cart it was made of oak and steel with yellow paint sloshed over it fred tapped it carefully i can see where your problem is right here he said so how long was your carter in there well i gave him lunch and very good lunches you do all ive always said what was the special today smitten steak with cream sauce and slumpie and black death meringue to follow said all jolson there was a moment of silence as they both pictured this meal fred colon gave a little sigh butter on the slumpie you wouldnt insult me by suggesting id leave it off would you a man could linger a long time over a meal like that said fred the trouble is the patrician all gets very short about carts parking on the street for more than ten minutes he reckons thats a sort of crime taking ten minutes to eat one of my lunches isnt a crime fred its a tragedy said all it says here city watch removal fred thats a couple of days profits fred thing is said fred colon itll be paperwork see i cant just wave that away i only wish i could theres all them counterfoils on the spike in my office if it was me running the watch of course but my hands are tied see the two men stood some way apart hands in pockets apparently paying little attention to one another sergeant colon began to whistle under his breath i know a thing or two said all carefully people think waiters aint got ears i know lots of stuff all said colon jingling his pocket change both men stared at the sky for a while i may have some honey ice cream left over from yesterday sergeant colon looked down at the cart here mister jolson he said in a voice of absolute surprise some complete bastards put some sort of clamp on your wheel well well soon see about that colon pulled a couple of round whitepainted paddles from his belt sighted on the watch house semaphore tower peeking over the top of the old lemonade factory waited until the watching gargoyle signalled him and with a certain amount of verve and flair ripped off an impression of a man with stiff arms playing two games of table tennis at once the teamll be along any minute ah watch this a little further along the street two trolls were carefully clamping a hay wagon after a minute or two one of them happened to glance at the watch house tower nudged his colleague produced two bats of his own and with rather less elan than sergeant colon sent a signal when it was answered the trolls looked around spotted colon and lumbered towards him tada said colon proudly amazing this new technology said all jolson admiringly and they mustve been what forty or fifty yards away sright all in the old days idve had to blow a whistle and theyll arrive here knowin it was me who wanted em too instead of having to look and see it was you said jolson well yeah said colon aware that what had transpired might not be the brightest ray of light in the new dawn of the communications revolution of course itd have worked just as well if theyd been streets away on the other side of the city even and if i told the gargoyle to as we say put it on the big tower over on the tump theyd have got it in sto lat within minutes see and thats twenty miles at least amazing fred time moves on all said colon as the trolls reached them constable chert who told you to clamp my friends cart he demanded well sarge dis morning you said we was to clamp every not this cart said colon unlock it right now and well say no more about it eh constable chert seemed to reach the conclusion that he wasnt being paid to think and this was just as well because sergeant colon did not believe trolls gave value for money in that department if you say so sarge while youre doing that me and all here will have a little chat right all said fred colon thats right fred well i say chat but ill be mostly listenin on account of having my mouth full snow cascaded from the fir branches the man forced his way through stood fighting for breath for a moment and then set off across the clearing at a fast trot across the valley he heard the first blast on the horn he had an hour then if he could trust them he might not make it to the tower but there were other ways out he had plans he could outwit them keep off the snow as much as you can double back make use of the streams it was possible it had been done before he was sure of that a few miles away sleek bodies set out through the forest the hunt was on elsewhere in ankhmorpork the fools guild was on fire this was a problem because the guilds fire brigade consisted largely of clowns and this was a problem because if you show a clown a bucket of water and a ladder he knows only one way to act years of training take over its something in the red nose speaking to him he cant help himself sam vimes of the ankhmorpork city watch leaned against a wall and watched the show we really must put that proposal for a civic fire service to the patrician again he said across the street a clown picked up a ladder turned knocked the clown behind him into a bucket of water then turned again to see what the commotion was thus sending his rising victim into the bucket again with a surprising parping noise the crowd watched silently if it was funny clowns wouldnt be doing it the guilds are all very much against it said captain carrot ironfoundersson his second in command as the clown with the ladder had a bucket of water poured down his trousers they say itd be trespass the fire had taken hold in a firstfloor room if we let it burn itd be a blow for entertainment in this city said carrot earnestly vimes looked sideways at him that was a true carrot comment it sounded as innocent as hell but you could take it a different way it certainly would he said nevertheless i suppose wed better do something he stepped forward and cupped his hands all right this is the watch bucket chain he shouted aw must we said someone in the crowd yes you must said captain carrot come on everyone if we form two lines well have this done in no time at all what dyou say eh it might even be fun and they did it vimes noted carrot treated everyone as if they were jolly good chaps and somehow in some inexplicable way they couldnt resist the urge not to prove him wrong and to the disappointment of the crowd the fire was soon put out once the clowns were disarmed and led away by kind people carrot reappeared wiping his forehead as vimes lit a cigar apparently the fireeater was sick he said its just possible we might never be forgiven said vimes as they set off on patrol again oh no what now carrot was staring upwards towards the nearest clacks tower riot in cable street he said its all officers sir they broke into a run you always did for an all officers the people in trouble might well be you there were more dwarfs on the streets as they got nearer and vimes recognized the signs the dwarfs all wore preoccupied looks and were walking in the same direction its over he said as they rounded a corner you can tell by the sudden increase of suspiciously innocent bystanders whatever else the emergency had been it had been a big one the street was strewn with debris and a fair amount of dwarfs vimes slowed down third time this week he said whats got into them hard to say sir said carrot vimes shot him a glance carrot had been raised by dwarfs he also if he could possibly avoid it never told a lie that isnt the same as dont know is it he said the captain looked awkward i think its sort of political he said vimes noted a throwing axe buried in a wall yes i can see that he said someone was coming along the street and was probably the reason why the riot had broken up lanceconstable bluejohn was the biggest troll vimes had ever met he loomed he was so big that he didnt stand out in a crowd because he was the crowd people failed to see him because he was in the way and like many overgrown people he was instinctively gentle and rather shy and inclined to let others tell him what to do if fate had led him to join a gang hed be the muscle in the watch he was the riot shield other watchmen were peering around him looks like it started in gimlets delicatessen said vimes as the rest of the watch moved in get a statement off gimlet not a good idea sir said carrot firmly he didnt see anything how do you know he didnt see anything you havent asked him i know sir he didnt see anything he didnt hear anything either with a mob trashing his restaurant and scrapping in the street outside thats right sir ah i get it theres none so deaf as those that wont hear are you saying something like that sir yes look its all over sir i dont think anyones seriously hurt itll be for the best sir please is this one of those private dwarf things captain yes sir well this is ankhmorpork captain not some mine in the mountains and its my job to keep the peace and this captain doesnt look like it whatre people going to say about rioting in the streets theyll say its another day in the life of the big city sir said carrot woodenly yes i suppose they would at that however vimes picked up a groaning dwarf who did this he demanded im not in the mood for being messed around come on i want a name agi hammerthief muttered the dwarf struggling all right said vimes letting him go write that down carrot no sir said carrot excuse me there is no agi hammerthief in the city sir you know every dwarf a lot of them sir but agi hammerthief is only found down mines sir hes a sort of mischievous spirit sir for example put it where agi puts the coal sir means yes i can guess said vimes youre telling me that that dwarf just said this riot was started by sweet fanny adams the dwarf had disappeared smartly around a corner more or less sir excuse me a moment sir carrot stepped across the street pulling two whitepainted paddles out of his belt ill just get a line of sight on a tower he said id better send a clacks why well weve kept the patrician waiting sir so itd be good manners to let him know were late vimes pulled out his watch and stared at it it was turning out to be one of those days the sort that you got every day it is in the nature of the universe that the person who always keeps you waiting ten minutes will on the day you are ten minutes tardy have been ready ten minutes early and will make a point of not mentioning this sorry were late sir said vimes as they entered the oblong office oh are you late said lord vetinari looking up from his paperwork i really hadnt noticed nothing serious i trust the fools guild caught fire sir said carrot many casualties no sir well that is a blessing said lord vetinari carefully he put down his pen now what do we have to discuss he pulled another document towards him and read it swiftly ah i see that the new traffic division is having the desired effect he indicated a large pile of paper i am getting any amount of complaints from the carters and drovers guild well done do pass on my thanks to sergeant colon and his team i will sir i see in one day they clamped seventeen carts ten horses eighteen oxen and one duck it was parked illegally sir indeed however a strange pattern seems to emerge sir many of the carters say that they were not in fact parked but had merely halted while an extremely old and extremely ugly lady crossed the road extremely slowly thats their story sir they know she was an old lady by her constant litany on the lines of oh deary me my poor old feet and similar expressions certainly sounds like an old lady to me sir said vimes his face wooden quite so what is rather strange is that several of them then report seeing the old lady subsequently legging it away along an alley rather fast id discount this of course were it not for the fact that the lady has apparently been seen crossing another street very slowly some distance away shortly afterwards something of a mystery vimes vimes put his hand over his eyes its one i intend to solve quite quickly sir the patrician nodded and made a short note on the list in front of him as he went to move it aside he uncovered a much grubbier muchfolded scrap of paper he picked up two letter knives and using them fastidiously unfolded the paper and inched it across the desk towards vimes do you know anything about this he said vimes read in large round crayoned letters deer cur the cruelt to homliss dogs in this city is a dissgrays wat are the watch do ing a bout itz sined the leak agyansct crule t to dogs not a thing he said my clerks say that one like it is pushed under the door most nights said the patrician apparently no one is seen do you want me to investigate said vimes it shouldnt be hard to find someone in this city who dribbles when he writes and spells even worse than carrot thank you sir said carrot none of the guards report noticing anyone said the patrician is there any group in ankhmorpork particularly interested in the welfare of dogs i doubt it sir then i shall ignore it pro tem said vetinari he let the soggy letter splash into the wastepaper basket on to more pressing matters he said briskly now then what do you know about bonk vimes stared there was a polite cough from carrot the river or the town sir he said the patrician smiled ah captain you have long ago ceased to surprise me yes i was referring to the town its one of the major towns in uberwald sir said carrot exports precious metals leather timber and of course fat from the deep fat mines at schmaltzberg theres a place called bonk said vimes still marvelling at the speed with which theyd got here from a damp letter about dogs strictly speaking sir its more correctly pronounced beyonk said carrot even so and in beyonk sir morpork sounds exactly like their word for an item of ladies underwear said carrot theres only so many syllables in the world when you think about it how do you know all this stuff carrot oh you pick it up sir here and there really so exactly which item of something extremely important will be taking place there in a few weeks said lord vetinari something which i have to add is vital to the future prosperity of ankhmorpork the crowning of the low king said carrot vimes stared from him to the patrician and back again is there some kind of circular that goes around which doesnt get as far as me he said the dwarf community has been talking about little else for months sir really said vimes you mean the riots those fights every night in the dwarf bars captain carrot is correct vimes it will be a grand occasion attended by representatives of many governments and from various uberwald principalities of course because the low king only rules those areas of uberwald that are below ground his favour is valuable borogravia and genua will be there without a doubt and probably even klatch klatch but theyre even further from uberwald than we are what are they bothering to go for he paused for a moment and then added hah im being stupid wheres the money i beg your pardon commander thats what my old sergeant used to say when he was puzzled sir find out where the money is and youve got it half solved vetinari stood up and walked over to the big window with his back to them a large country uberwald he said apparently addressing the glass dark mysterious ancient huge untapped reserves of coal and iron ore said carrot and fat of course the best candles lamp oils and soap come ultimately from the schmaltzberg deposits why weve got our own slaughterhouse havent we ankhmorpork uses a great many candles sir it certainly doesnt use much soap said vimes there are so many uses for fats and tallows sir we couldnt possibly supply ourselves ah said vimes the patrician sighed obviously i hope that we may strengthen our trading links with the various nations within uberwald he said the situation there is volatile in the extreme do you know much about uberwald commander vimes vimes whose knowledge of geography was microscopically detailed within five miles of ankhmorpork and merely microscopic beyond that nodded uncertainly only that its not really a country said vetinari its its rather more what you get before you get countries said carrot its mainly fortified towns and fiefdoms with no real boundaries and lots of forest in between theres always some sort of feud going on theres no law apart from whatever the local lords enforce and banditry of all kinds is rife so unlike the home life of our own dear city said vimes not quite under his breath the patrician gave him an impassive glance in uberwald the dwarfs and trolls havent settled their old grievances carrot continued there are large areas controlled by feudal vampire or werewolf clans and there are also tracts with much higher than normal background magic it is a chaotic place indeed and youd hardly think you were in the century of the fruitbat it is to be hoped that things will improve however and uberwald will happily be joining the community of nations vimes and vetinari exchanged looks sometimes carrot sounded like a civics essay written by a stunned choirboy well put said the patrician at last but until that joysome day uberwald remains a mystery inside a riddle wrapped in an enigma let me see if ive got this right said vimes uberwald is like this big suet pudding that everyones suddenly noticed and now with this coronation as an excuse weve all got to rush there with knife fork and spoon to shovel as much on our plates as possible your grasp of political reality is masterly vimes you lack only the appropriate vocabulary ankhmorpork must send a representative obviously an ambassador as it were youre not suggesting i should go to this affair are you said vimes oh i couldnt send the commander of the city watch said lord vetinari most of the uberwald countries have no concept of a modern civil peacekeeping authority vimes relaxed im sending the duke of ankh instead vimes sat bolt upright they are mostly feudal systems vetinari went on they set great store by rank im not being ordered to go to uberwald ordered your grace vetinari looked shocked and concerned good heavens i must have misunderstood lady sybil she told me yesterday that a holiday a long way from ankhmorpork would do you the world of good you spoke to sybil at the reception for the new president of the tailors guild yes i believe you left early you were called away some emergency i understand lady sybil happened to mention how you seemed to be as she put it constantly on the job and one thing led to another oh dear i do hope i havent caused some marital misunderstanding i cant leave the city now of all times said vimes desperately theres so much to do that is exactly why sybil says you ought to leave the city said vetinari but theres the new training school ticking over nicely now sir said carrot the whole carrierpigeon network is a complete mess more or less sorted out sir now weve changed their feed besides the clacks seems to be functioning very well weve got to get the river watch set up cant do much for a week or two sir until weve dredged up the boat the drains at the chitterling street station are ive got the plumbers working on it sir vimes knew that he had lost he had lost as soon as sybil was involved because she was always a reliable siege engine against the walls of his defences but there was such a thing as going down fighting you know im no good at diplomatic talk he said on the contrary vimes you appear to have amazed the diplomatic corps here in ankhmorpork said lord vetinari theyre not used to plain speech it confuses them what was it you said to the istanzian ambassador last month he riffled through the papers on his desk let me see the complaint is here somewhere oh yes on the matter of military incursions across the slipnir river you indicated that further transgressions would involve him personally that is to say the ambassador and i quote going home in an ambulance im sorry about that sir but it had been a long day and he was really getting on my since when their armed forces have pulled back so far that they are nearly in the next country said lord vetinari moving the paper aside i have to say that your observation complied only with the general thrust of my view in this matter but was at least succinct apparently you also looked at the ambassador in a very threatening way it was only the way i usually look to be sure happily in uberwald you will only need to look friendly ah but you dont want me saying things like how about selling us all your fat really cheap do you said vimes desperately you will not be required to do any negotiating vimes that will be dealt with by one of my clerks who will set up the temporary embassy and discuss such matters with his opposite numbers among the courts of uberwald all clerks speak the same language you will simply be as ducal as you can and of course you will take a retinue a staff vetinari added seeing vimess blank look he sighed people to go with you i suggest sergeant angua sergeant detritus and corporal littlebottom ah said carrot nodding encouragingly sorry said vimes i think there must have been a whole piece of conversation just then that i must have missed a werewolf a troll and a dwarf said carrot ethnic minorities sir but in uberwald they are ethnic majorities said lord vetinari all three officers come from there originally i believe their presence will speak volumes so far it hasnt sent me a postcard said vimes id rather take sir it will show people in uberwald that ankhmorpork is a multicultural society you see said carrot oh i see people like us people you can do business with said vimes glumly y sometimes vetinari said testily it really does seem to me that the culture of cynicism in the watch is is insufficient said vimes there was silence all right he sighed id better go off and polish the knobs on my coronet hadnt i ђ the ducal coronet if i remember my heraldry does not have knobs on it is decidedly spiky said the patrician pushing across the desk a small pile of papers topped by a goldedged invitation card good i will have a a clacks sent immediately you will be more fully briefed later do y give my regards to the duchess and now please do not let me detain you further he always says that muttered vimes as the two men hurried down the stairs he knows i dont like being married to a duchess i thought you and lady sybil oh being married to sybil is fine fine said vimes hurriedly its just the duchess bit i dont like where is everyone tonight corporal littlebottoms on pigeon duty detritus is on night patrol with swires and anguas on special duty in the shades sir you remember with nobby oh gods yes well when they come in tomorrow youd better get them to report to me i incidentally get that bloody wig off nobby and hide it will you vimes leafed through the paperwork ive never heard of the low king of the dwarfs i thought that king in dwarfish just meant a sort of senior engineer ah well the low king is rather special said carrot why well it all starts with the scone of stone sir the what would you mind a little detour on the way back to the yard sir itll make things clearer the young woman stood on a corner in the shades her general stance indicated that she was in the specialized patois of the area a ladyinwaiting to be more precise a ladyinwaiting for mr right or at least mr right amount she idly swung her handbag this was a very recognizable signal for anyone with the brains of a pigeon a member of the thieves guild would have passed carefully by on the other side of the lane giving her nothing more than a gentlemanly and above all nonaggressive nod even the lesspolite freelance thieves who lurked in this area would have thought twice before eyeing the handbag the seamstresses guild operated a very swift and nonreversible kind of justice the skinny body of done it duncan however did not have the brains of a pigeon the little man had been watching the bag like a cat for fully five minutes and now the very thought of its contents had hypnotized him he could practically taste the money he rose on his toes lowered his head dashed out of the alley grabbed the bag and got several inches before the world exploded behind him and he ended up flat in the mud something right by his ear started to drool and there was a long very longdrawnout growl not changing in tone at all just unrolling a deep promise of what would happen if he tried to move he heard footsteps and out of the corner of his eyes saw a swirl of lace oh done it said a voice bagsnatching thats a bit low isnt it even for you you couldve got really hurt its only duncan miss hell be no trouble you can let him up the weight was removed from duncans back he heard something pad off into the gloom of an alley i done it i done it said the little thief desperately as corporal nobbs helped him to his feet yes i know you did i saw you said nobby and you know whatd happen to you if the thieves guild spotted you youd be dead in the river with no time off for good behaviour they hate me cos im so good said duncan through his matted beard ere you know the robbery at all jolsons last month i done that thats right duncan you done that an that haul at the gold vaults last week i done that too it wasnt coalface and his boys no it was you wasnt it duncan an that job at the goldsmiths that everyone says crunchie ron done you done it did you sright said duncan and it was you what stole fire from the gods too wasnt it duncan said nobby grinning evilly under his wig yeah that was me duncan nodded he sniffed i was a bit younger then of course he peered shortsightedly at nobby nobbs whyve you got a dress on nobby its hushhush duncan ah right duncan shifted uneasily you couldnt spare me a bob or two could you nobby i aint eaten for two days small coins gleamed in the dark now push off said corporal nobbs thanks nobby you got any unsolved crimes you know where to find me duncan lurched off into the night sergeant angua appeared behind nobby buck ling on her breastplate poor old devil she said he was a good thief in his day said nobby taking a notebook out of his handbag and jotting down a few lines kind of you to help him said angua werl i can get the money back out of petty cash said nobby an now we know who did the bullion job dont we thatll be a feather in my cap with mister vimes bonnet nobby what your bonnet nobby its got a rather fetching band of flowers around it oh yeah its not that im complaining said angua but when we were assigned this job i thought it was me who was going to be the decoy and you who was going to be the backup nobby yeah but what with you bein nobbys expression creased as he edged his way into unfamiliar linguistic territory mor phor log is ally gifted a werewolf nobby i know the word right well obviously youd be a lot better at lurkin an an obviously its not right women havin to act as decoys in police work angua hesitated as she so often did when attempting to talk to nobby on difficult matters and waved her hands in front of her as if trying to shape the invisible dough of her thoughts its just that i mean people might she began i mean well you know what people call men who wear wigs and gowns dont you yes miss you do yes miss lawyers miss good yes good said angua slowly now try another one er actors miss angua gave up you look good in taffeta nobby she said you dont think it makes me look too fat angua sniffed oh no she said quietly i thought id better put scent on for verysillymitude said nobby quickly what oh angua shook her head took another breath i can smell some thing else thats surprising cos this stuffs a bit on the pungent side and frankly i dont think lily of the valley is supposed to smell like this its not perfume but the lavender stuff they had you could clean brass with can you get back to the chitterling station by yourself nobby said angua despite her rising panic she mentally added after all what could happen mean really yes miss theres something id better sort out angua hurried away the new scent filling her nostrils it would have to be powerful to combat eau de nobbs and it was oh it was not here she thought not now not him the running man swung along a branch wet with snow and managed at last to lower himself on to a branch belonging to the next tree that took him a long way from the stream how good was their sense of smell pretty damn good he knew but this good hed got out of the stream on to another overhanging branch if they followed the banks and theyd be bright enough to do that theyd surely never know hed left the stream there was a howl away to the left he headed right into the gloom of the forest vimes heard carrot scrabble around in the gloom and the sound of a key in the lock i thought the campaign for equal heights was running this place now he said its so hard to find volunteers said carrot ushering him through the low door and lighting a candle i come in every day just to keep an eye on things but no one else seems very interested i cant imagine why said vimes looking around the dwarf bread museum the one positive thing you could say about the bread products around him was that they were probably as edible now as they had been on the day they were baked forged was a better term dwarf bread was made as a meal of last resort and also as a weapon and a currency dwarfs were not as far as vimes knew religious in any way but the way they thought about bread came close there was a tinkle and a scrabbling noise somewhere in the gloom rats said carrot they never stop trying to eat dwarf bread poor things ah here we are the scone of stone a replica of course vimes stared at the misshapen thing on its dusty display stand it was vaguely sconelike but only if someone pointed this out to you beforehand otherwise the term a lump of rock was pretty accurate it was about the size and shape of a well saton cushion there were a few fossilized currants visible my wife rests her feet on something like that when shes had a long day he said its fifteen hundred years old said carrot with something like awe in his voice i thought this was the replica well yes but its a replica of a very important thing sir said carrot vimes sniffed the air had a certain pungent quality smells strongly of cats in here doesnt it im afraid they get in after the rats sir a rat whos nibbled on dwarf bread tends not to be able to run very fast vimes lit a cigar carrot gave it a look of uncertain disapproval we do thank people for not smoking in here sir he said why you dont know theyre not going to said vimes he leaned against the display cabinet all right captain why am i really going to bonk i dont know a lot about diplomacy but i do know its never just about one thing whats the low king whyre our dwarfs scrapping well sir have you heard of kruk dwarf mining law said vimes well done sir but its a lot more than that its about how you live laws of ownership marriage laws inheritance rules for dealing with disputes of all kinds that sort of thing everything really and the low king well you could call him the final court of appeal hes advised of course but hes got the last word still with me makes sense so far and he is crowned on the scone of stone and sits on it to give his judgements because all the low kings have done that ever since bhrian bloodaxe fifteen hundred years ago it gives authority vimes nodded dourly that made sense too you did something because it had always been done and the explanation was but weve always done it this way a million dead people cant have been wrong can they does he get elected or born or what he said i suppose you could say hes elected said carrot but really a lot of senior dwarfs arrange it among themselves after listening to other dwarfs of course taking soundings its called traditionally hes from one of the big families but er yes things are a little different this year tempers are a bit stretched ah thought vimes wrong dwarf won he said some dwarfs would say so but its more that the whole process has been called into question said carrot by the dwarfs in the biggest dwarf city outside uberwald dont tell me that must be that place hubwards of its ankhmorpork sir what were not a dwarf city fifty thousand dwarfs now sir really yes sir are you sure yes sir of course he is vimes thought he probably knows them all by name you have to understand sir that theres a sort of big debate going on said carrot on how you define a dwarf well some people might say that theyre called dwarfs because no sir not size nobby nobbs is shorter than many dwarfs and we dont call him a dwarf we dont call him a human either said vimes and of course i am also a dwarf you know carrot i keep meaning to talk to you about that adopted by dwarfs brought up by dwarfs to dwarfs im a dwarf sir i can do the rite of kzakra i know the secrets of hragna i can hak my grakha correctly i am a dwarf what do those things mean im not allowed to tell nondwarfs carrot tactfully tried to stand out of the way of the cigar smoke unfortunately some of the mountain dwarfs think that dwarfs whove moved away arent proper dwarfs either but this time the kingship has been swung by the views of the ankhmorpork dwarfs and a lot of dwarfs back home dont like it theres been a lot of bad feeling all round families falling out that sort of thing much pulling of beards really vimes tried not to smile its not funny if youre a dwarf sorry and im afraid this new low king is only going to make matters worse although of course i wish him well tough is he er i think you can assume sir that any dwarf who rises sufficiently in dwarf society to even be considered as a candidate for the kingship did not get there by singing the hiho song and bandaging wounded animals in the forest but by dwarf standards king rhys rhysson is a modern thinker although i hear he doesnt like ankhmorpork very much sounds like a very clear thinker too anyway this has upset a lot of the more er traditional mountain dwarfs who thought the next king would be albrecht albrechtson who is not a modern thinker he thinks even coming up above ground is dangerously nondwarfish vimes sighed well i can see theres a problem carrot but the thing about this problem the key point is that its not mine or yours dwarf or not he tapped the scones case replica eh he said sure its not the real one sir there is only one real scone we call it the thing and the whole of the thing well if its a good replica whod know any dwarf would sir only joking there was a hamlet down there where two rivers met there would be boats this was working the slopes behind him were white and free of dark shapes no matter how good they were let them try to outswim a boat hardpacked snow crunched under his feet he staggered past the few rough hovels saw the jetty saw the boats fought with the frozen rope that moored the nearest one grabbed an oar and pushed himself out into the current there was still no movement on the hills now at last he could take stock it was a bigger boat than one man could handle but all he had to do was fend off the banks thatd do for tonight in the morning he could leave it somewhere perhaps ask someone to get a message through to the tower and then hed buy a horse and behind him under the tarpaulin in the bows something started to growl they really were very clever in a castle not far away the vampire lady margolotta sat quietly leafing through twurps peerage it wasnt a very good reference book for the countries on this side of the ramtops where the standard work was the almanac de gothick in which she herself occupied almost four pages but if you needed to know who thought they were who in ankhmorpork it was invaluable her copy was now bristling with bookmarks she sighed and pushed it away beside her was a fluted glass containing a red liquid she took a sip and made a face then she stared at the candlelight and tried to think like lord vetinari how much did he suspect how much news got back the clacks tower had only been up for a month and it was being roundly denounced vampires evolve tong names its something to do to pass the long years throughout bonk as an intrusion but it seemed to be doing a good if stealthy local traffic who would he send his choice would tell her everything she was sure someone like lord rust or lord selachii well shed think a lot less of him from all that she had heard and lady margolotta heard a lot of things the ankhmorpork diplomatic corps as a whole could not find its backside with a map of course it was good business for a diplomat to appear stupid right up to the moment where hed stolen your socks but lady margolotta had met some of ankhmorporks finest and no one could act that well the growing howling outside began to get on her nerves she rang for her butler yeth mithtreth said igor materializing out of the shadows go and tell the children of the night to make vonderful music somevhere else vill you i have a headache indeed mithtreth lady margolotta yawned it had been a long night shed think better after a good days sleep as she went to blow out the candle she glanced again at the book there was a marker in the vs but surely even the patrician couldnt know that much she hesitated and then pulled the bellrope above the coffin igor reappeared in the way of igors those keen young men at the clacks tower vill be avake vont they yeth mithtreth send a clacks to our agent asking for everything about commander vimes of the vatch vill you ith he a diplomat mithtreth lady margolotta lay back no igor hes the reason for diplomats close the lid vill you sam vimes could parallelprocess most husbands can they learn to follow their own line of thought while at the same time listening to what their wives say and the listening is important because at any time they could be challenged and must be ready to quote the last sentence in full a vital additional skill is being able to scan the dialogue for telltale phrases such as and they can deliver it tomorrow or so ive invited them for dinner or they can do it in blue really quite cheaply lady sybil was aware of this sam could coherently carry an entire conversation while thinking about something completely different ill tell willikins to pack winter clothes she said watching him itll be pretty cold up there at this time of year yes thats a good idea vimes continued to stare at a point just above the fireplace well have to host a party ourselves i expect so we ought to take a cartload of typical ankhmorpork food show the flag you know do you think i should take a cook along yes dear that would be a good idea no one outside the city knows how to make a knuckle sandwich properly sybil was impressed ears operating entirely on automatic had nevertheless triggered the mouth into making a small but pertinent contribution she said do you think we ought to take the alligator with us yes that might be advisable she watched his face small furrows formed on vimess brow as the ears nudged the brain he blinked what alligator you were miles away sam in uberwald i expect sorry is there a problem whys he sending me sybil im sure havelock shares with me a conviction that you have hidden depths sam vimes sank gloomily into his armchair it was he felt a persistent flaw in his wifes otherwise practical and sensible character that she believed against all evidence that he was a man of many talents he knew he had hidden depths there was nothing in them that hed like to see float to the surface they contained things that should be left to lie there was also a nagging worry that he couldnt quite pin down had he been able to he might have expressed it like this policemen didnt go on holiday where you got policemen as lord vetinari was wont to remark you got crime so if he went to bonk however you pronounced the damn place there would be a crime it was something the world always laid on for policemen itll be nice to see serafine again said sybil yes indeed said vimes in bonk he would not officially be a policeman he did not like this at all he liked this even less than all the other things on the few occasions hed been outside ankhmorpork and its surrounding fiefdom hed either been going to other local cities where the ankhmorpork badge carried some weight or he had been in hot pursuit that most ancient and honourable of police procedures from the way carrot talked in bonk his badge would merely figure as extra roughage on someones menu his brow wrinkled again serafine lady serafine von uberwald said sybil sergeant anguas mother you remember me telling you last year we were at finishing school together of course we all knew she was a werewolf but nobody would ever dream of talking about that sort of thing in those days well you just didnt there was all that business over the ski instructor of course but im certain in my own mind that he must have fallen down some crevasse or other she married the baron and they live just outside beyonk i write to her with a little news every hogswatch a very old werewolf family a good pedigree said vimes absently you know you wouldnt like angua to hear you say that sam dont worry so youll have a chance to relax im sure itll be good for you yes dear itll be like a second honeymoon said sybil yes indeed said vimes remembering that what with one thing and another theyd never really had a first one on that er subject said sybil a little more hesitantly you remember i told you i was going to see old mrs content oh yes how is she vimes was staring at the fireplace again it wasnt just old schoolfriends sometimes it seemed sybil kept in touch with anyone shed ever met her hogswatch card list ran to a second volume quite well i believe anyway she agrees that there was a knocking at the door she sighed its willikins evening off she said youd better answer it sam i know you want to ive told them not to disturb me unless its serious said vimes getting up yes but you think all crime is serious sam carrot was on the doorstep its a bit political sir he said whats so political at a quarter to ten at night captain the dwarf bread museums been broken into sir said carrot vimes looked into carrots honest blue eyes a thought occurs to me captain he said slowly and the thought is a certain item has gone missing thats right sir and its the replica scone yes sir either they broke in just after we left or carrot licked his lips nervously they were hiding while we were there not rats then no sir sorry sir vimes fastened his cloak and took his helmet off its peg so someone has stolen a replica of the scone of stone a few weeks before the real one is due to be used in a very important ceremony he said i find this intriguing thats what i thought too sir vimes sighed i hate the political ones when theyd gone lady sybil sat for a while staring at her hands then she took a lamp into the library and pulled down a slim volume bound in white leather on which had been embossed in gold the words our wedding it had been a strange event ankhmorporks high society so high that its stinking sam always said had turned up mostly out of curiosity she was ankhmorporks most eligible spinster whod never thought shed be married and he was a mere captain of the guard who tended to annoy a lot of people and here were the iconographs of the event there she was looking rather more expansive than radiant and there sam was scowling at the viewer with his hair hastily smoothed down there was sergeant colon with his chest inflated so much his feet had almost left the ground and nobby grinning widely or perhaps just making a face it was so hard to tell with nobby sybil turned over the pages with care she had put a sheet of tissue between each one to protect them in many ways she told herself she was very lucky she was proud of sam he worked hard for a lot of people he cared about people who werent important he always had far more to cope with than was good for him he was the most civilized man shed ever met not a gentleman thank goodness but a gentle man she never really knew what it was he did oh she knew what the job was but by all accounts he didnt spend much time behind his desk when he eventually came to bed he tended to drop his clothes straight into the laundry basket so shed only hear later from the laundry girl about the bloodstains and the mud there were rumours of chases over rooftops handtohand and kneetogroin fights with men who had names like harry the boltcutter weems there was a sam vimes she knew who went out and came home again and out there was another sam vimes who hardly belonged to her and lived in the same world as all those men with the dreadful names sybil ramkin had been brought up to be thrifty thoughtful genteel in an outdoor sort of way and to think kindly of people she looked at the pictures again in the silence of the house then she blew her nose loudly and went off to do the packing and other sensible things corporal cheery littlebottom pronounced her name cheri she was a she and therefore a rare bloom in ankhmorpork it wasnt that dwarfs werent interested in sex they saw the vital need for fresh dwarfs to leave their goods to and continue the mining work after they had gone it was simply that they also saw no point in distinguishing between the sexes anywhere but in private there was no such thing as a dwarfish female pronoun or once the children were on solids any such thing as womens work then cheery littlebottom had arrived in ankhmorpork and had seen that there were men out there who did not wear chainmail or leather underwear but did wear interesting colours and exciting makeup and these men were called woment and in the little bullet head the thought had arisen why not me now she was being denounced in cellars and dwarf bars across the city as the first dwarf in ankhmorpork to wear a skirt it was hardwearing brown leather and as objectively erotic as a piece of wood but as some older dwarfs would point out somewhere under there were his knees worse they were now finding that among their sons were some they choked on the word daughters cheery was only the frothy bit on the tip of the wave some younger dwarfs were shyly wearing eyeshadow and declaring that as a matter of fact they didnt like beer a current was running through dwarf society dwarf society was not against a few wellthrown rocks in the direction of those bobbing on the current but captain carrot had put the word at least of the sort she normally wore tand just lately corporal nobbs they couldnt bring themselves to utter the word her on the street that this would be assault on an officer a subject on which the watch held views and however short the miscreants their feet really would not touch the ground cheery had retained her beard and round iron helmet of course it was one thing to declare that you were female but quite unthinkable to declare that you werent a dwarf open and shut case sir she said when she saw vimes come in they opened the window in the back room to get in a very neat job and didnt shut the front door after they left smashed the scones case theres the glass all round the stand didnt take anything else that i can see left a lot of footprints in the dust i took a few pictures but theyre scuffed up and werent much good in the first place thats about it really no dropped fagends wallets or bits of paper with an address on them said vimes no sir they were inconsiderate thieves they certainly were said carrot grimly a question that springs to mind said vimes is why does it reek even worse of cats piss now it is rather sharp isnt it said cheery with a hint of sulphur too constable ping said it was like this when he arrived but theres no cat prints vimes crouched down and looked at the broken glass how did we find out about this he said prodding a few fragments constable ping heard the tinkle sir he went round the back and saw the window was open then the crooks got out through the front door sorry about that sir said ping stepping forward and saluting he was a cautiouslooking young man who appeared permanently poised to answer a question we all make mistakes said vimes you heard glass break yessir and someone swore really what did they say er bugger sir and you went around the back and saw the broken window and you i called out is there anyone there sir really and what would you have done if a voice had said no no dont answer that what happened next er i heard a lot more glass break and when i got round to the front the door was open and they were gone so i legged it back to the yard and told captain carrot sir knowing he sets a lot of store by this place thank you ping is it yessir entirely unasked but obviously prepared to answer ping said its a dialect word meaning watermeadow sir off you go then the lanceconstable visibly sagged with relief and left vimes let his mind unfocus a little he enjoyed moments like these the little bowl of time when the crime lay before him and he believed that the world was capable of being solved this was the time you really looked to see what was there and sometimes the things that werent there were the most interesting things of all the scone had been kept on a plinth about three feet high inside a case made of five sheets of glass forming a box that was screwed down on the plinth they smashed the glass by accident he said eventually really sir look here see vimes pointed to three loose screws neatly lined up they were trying to take the box apart carefully it must have slipped but whats the point said carrot its just a replica sir even if you could find a buyer its not worth more than a few dollars if its a good one you could swap it with the real thing said vimes well yes i suppose you could try said carrot there would be a bit of a problem though what is it dwarfs arent stupid sir the replica has got a big cross carved into the underside and its only made of plaster in any case oh but it was a good idea sir carrot said encouragingly you werent to know i wonder if the thieves knew even if they didnt they wouldnt have a hope of getting away with it sir the real scone is very well guarded said cheery its very rare that most dwarfs get a chance to see it and other people would notice if you had a great lump of rock up your jumper said vimes more or less to himself so this was a stupid crime but it doesnt feel stupid i mean why go to all this trouble the lock on that door is a joke you could kick it right out of the woodwork if i was going to pinch this thing i could be in here and out again before the glass had stopped tinkling what would be the point of being quiet at this time of night the dwarf had been rummaging under a nearby display cabinet she drew her hand out drying blood glistened on the blade of a screwdriver see said vimes something slipped and someone cut their hand whats the point of all this carrot cats piss and sulphur and screwdrivers i hate it when you get too many clues it makes it so damn hard to solve anything he threw the screwdriver down by sheer luck it hit the floorboards tip first and stood there shuddering im going home he said well find out what this is all about when it starts to smell vimes spent the following morning trying to learn about two foreign countries one of them turned out to be called ankhmorpork uberwald was easy it was five or six times bigger than the whole of the sto plains and stretched all the way up to the hub it was so thickly forested so creased by little mountain ranges and beset by rivers that it was largely unmapped it was mostly unexplored too the at least by proper explorers just living there doesnt count people who lived there had other things on their minds and the people from outside who came to explore went into the forests and never came out again and for centuries no one had bothered about the place you couldnt sell things to people hidden by too many trees it was probably the coach road that had changed everything a few years back when they drove it all the way through to genua a road is built to follow mountain people had always gravitated to the plains and in recent years uberwald folk had joined them the news got back home theres money to be made in ankhmorpork bring the kids you dont need to bring the garlic though because all the vampires work down at the kosher butchers and if youre pushed in ankhmorpork youre allowed to push back no one cares enough about you to want to kill you vimes could just about tell the difference between the uberwald dwarfs and the ones from copperhead who were shorter noisier and rather more at home among humans the uberwald dwarfs were quiet tended to scuttle around corners and often didnt speak morporkian in some of the alleys off treacle mine road you could believe you were in another country but they were what every copper desires in a citizen they were no trouble they mostly had jobs working for one another they paid their taxes rather more readily than humans did although to be honest there were small piles of mouse droppings that yielded more money than most ankhmorpork citizens and generally any problems they had they sorted out amongst themselves if such people ever come to the attention of the police its usually only as a chalk outline it turned out though that within the community behind the grubby facades of all those tenements and workshops in cable street and whalebone lane there were vendettas and feuds that had their origins in two adjoining mine shafts five hundred miles away and a thousand years ago there were pubs you only drank in if you were from a particular mountain there were streets you didnt walk down if your clan mined a particular lode the way you wore your helmet the way you parted your beard spoke complicated volumes to other dwarfs they didnt even hand a piece of paper to vimes then theres the way you krazak your gardrgh said corporal littlebottom i wont even ask said vimes im afraid i cant explain in any case said cheery have i got a gaadrerghuh said vimes cheery winced at the mispronunciation yes sir everyone has but only a dwarf can krazak his properly she said or hers she added vimes sighed and looked down at the pages of scrawl in his notebook under the heading uberwald he wasntstrictly aware of it but he treated even geography as if he was investigating a crime im going to make a lot of mistakes cheery he said i shouldnt worry about that sir humans always do but most dwarfs can spot if youre trying not to make them are you sure you dont mind coming got to face it sooner or later sir vimes shook his head sadly i dont get it cheery theres all this fuss about a female dwarf trying to act like like a lady sir right and yet no one says anything about carrot being called a dwarf but hes a human no sir like he says hes a dwarf he was adopted by dwarfs hes performed the y grad he observes the jkargra insofar as thats possible in a city hes a dwarf hes six foot high hes a tall dwarf sir we dont mind if he wants to be a human as well not even the drudakak would have a problem with that im running out of throat sweets here cheery what was that look sir most of the dwarfs here are well i suppose youd call them liberal sir theyre mainly from the mountains behind copperhead you know they get along with humans some of them even acknowledge that theyve got daughters sir but some of the more oldfashioned uberwald dwarfs havent got out so much they act as if bhrian bloodaxe was still alive thats why we call them drudakak vimes had a go but he knew that to really speak dwarfish you needed a lifetimes study and if at all possible a serious throat infection above ground they negatively he faltered they do not get out in the fresh air enough cheery supplied ah right and everyone thought the new king was going to be one of these they say albrechts never seen sunlight in his life his clan never goes above ground in daylight everyone was certain itd be him and as it turned out it wasnt thought vimes some of the uberwald dwarfs hadnt supported him and the world had moved on there were plenty of dwarfs around now who had been born in ankhmorpork their kids went around with their helmets on back to front and spoke dwarfish only at home many of them wouldnt know a pickaxe if you hit them with it they werent about to be told how to run their lives by an old dwarf sitting on a stale bun under some distant mountain he tapped his pencil on his notebook thoughtfully and because of this he thought dwarfs are punching one another on my streets ive seen more of those dwarf sedan chair things around lately he said you know the ones carried by a couple of trolls they have thick leather curtains drudakak said cheery very traditional dwarfs if they have to go out in daylight they dont look at it i dont recall them a year ago at least if you hit them hard enough cheery shrugged theres lots of dwarfs here now sir the drudakak feel theyre among dwarfs now they dont have to deal with humans for anything they dont like us they wont even talk to a human theyre fairly choosy about talking to most dwarfs to tell you the truth thats daft said vimes how do they get food you cant live on fungi how do they trade ore dam streams get wood for shoring up their shafts well either other dwarfs are paid to do it or humans are employed said cheery they can afford it theyre very good miners well they own very good mines in any case sounds to me theyre a bunch of vimes stopped himself he was aware that a wise man should always respect the folkways of others to use carrots happy phrase but vimes often had difficulty with this idea for one thing there were people in the world whose folkways consisted of gutting other people like clams and this was not aprocedure that commanded in vimes any kind of respect at all im not thinking diplomatically am i he said cheery watched him with a carefully blank expression oh i dont know about that sir she said you didnt actually finish the sentence and well a lot of dwarfs respect them you know feel better for seeing them vimes looked puzzled then understanding dawned oh i get it he said i bet they say things like thank goodness people are keeping up the old ways eh thats right sir i suppose that inside every dwarf in ankhmorpork is a little part of him or her that knows real dwarfs live underground vimes doodled on his notepad back home he thought carrot had innocently talked about dwarfs back home to all dwarfs far away the mountains were back home it was funny how people were people everywhere you went even if the people concerned werent the people the people who made up the phrase people are people everywhere had traditionally thought of as people and even if you werent virtuous as you had been brought up to understand the term you did like to see virtue in other people provided it did not cost you anything why have these dr these traditional dwarfs come here though ankhmorporks full of humans they must have their work cut out avoiding humans theyre needed sir dwarf law is complicated and theres often disputes and they conduct marriages and that sort of thing you make them sound more like priests dwarfs arent religious sir of course oh well thank you corporal off you go any fallout from last night no sulphurous incontinent cats have come forward to confess no sir the campaign for equal heights has put out a pamphlet saying it was another example of the secondclass treatment of dwarfs in the city but it was the same one they always put out you know the one with blanks to fill in the details nothing changes cheery see you tomorrow morning then send detritus up why him ankhmorpork was lousy with diplomats it was practically what the upper classes were for and it was easy for them because half the foreign bigwigs theyd meet were old chums theyd played wet towel tag with back at school they tended to be on firstname terms even with people whose names were ahmed or fong they knew which forks to use they hunted shot and fished they moved in circles that more or less overlapped the circles of their foreign hosts and were a long way from the rather grubby circles that people like vimes went around in every working day they knew all the right nods and winks what chance had he got against a tie and a crest vetinari was throwing him amongst the wolves and the dwarfs and the vampires vimes shuddered and vetinari never did anything without a reason come in detritus it always amazed sergeant detritus that vimes knew he was at the door vimes had never mentioned that the office wall creaked and bent inwards as the big troll made his way along the corridor you want to see me sir yes sit down man its this uberwald business yessir how do you feel about visiting the old country detrituss face remained impassive as it always did when he was waiting patiently for things to make sense uberwald i mean vimes prompted dunno sir i was just a pebble when we left dere dad wanted a better life in der big city therell be a lot of dwarfs detritus vimes didnt bother to mention vampires and werewolves either of those who attacked a troll was making the last big mistake of its career in any case detritus carried a ooolbdraw crossbow as a hand weapon days okay sir im very modern bout dwarfs these might be a bit oldfashioned about you though dem deepdown dwarfs thats right i heard about dem theres still wars with trolls up near the hub i hear tact and diplomacy will be called for you have come to der right troll for dat sir said detritus you did push that man through that wall last week detritus it was done with tact sir quite a fin wall vimes let it go at that the man in question had just laid out three watchmen with a club which detritus had broken in one hand before selecting the suitably tactful wall see you tomorrow then best dress armour remember send angua now please shes not here sir blast put out some messages for her will you igor lurched through the castle corridors dragging one foot after the other in the approved fashion he was igor son of igor nephew of several igors brother of igors and cousin of more igors than he could remember without checking up in his diary igors did not change a winning formula and as a clan igors liked working for vampires vampires kept regular hours were generally polite to their servants and an important extra didnt require much work in the bedmaking and cookery department and tended to have cool roomy cellars where an igor could pursue his true calling this more than made up for those occasions when you had to sweep up their ashes he entered lady margolottas crypt and knocked politely on the coffin lid it moved aside a fraction yes thorry to wake you in the middle of the afternoon your ladythip but you did thay all right and its going to be vimeth ladythip a dainty hand came out of the partly opened coffin and punched the air yes especially if it was green and bubbled meth ladythip veil veil samuel vimes poor devil do the doggies know igor nodded the baronth igor wath altho collecting a methage ladythip and the dwarfs it ith an official appointment ladythip everyone knowth hith grathe the duke of ankhmorpork thir thamuel vimeth commander of the ankhmorpork thity watch then the midden has hit the windmill igor very well put ladythip no one liketh a thort thower of thit i imagine igor that hell leave them behind let us consider a castle from the point of view of its furniture this one has chairs yes but they dont look very lived in there is a huge sofa near the fire and that is ragged with use but other furnishings look as if theyre there merely for show there is a long oak table well polished and looking curiously unused for such an old piece of furniture possibly the reason for this is that on the floor around it are a large number of white earthenware bowls one of them has father written on it the baroness serafine von uberwald slammed shut twurps peerage irritably the man is a a nothing she said a paper man a man of straw an insult the name vimes goes back a long time said wolfgang von uberwald who was doing onehanded pressups in front of the fire so does the name smith what of it wolf changed to the other hand in midair he was naked he liked his muscles to get an airing they shone someone with an anatomical chart could have picked out every one they might also have remarked on the unusual way his blond hair grew not only on his head but down and across his shoulders as well he is a duke mother hah ankhmorpork hasnt even got a king nineteen twenty i hear stories about that mother oh stories sybil writes silly little letters to me every year sam this sam that of course she had to be grateful for what she could get but the man is just a thieftaker after all i shall refuse to see him you will not do that mother wolf grunted that would be twentynine thirty dangerous what do you tell lady sybil about us nothing i dont write back of course a rather sad and foolish woman and she still writes every year thirtysix thirtyseven yes four pages usually and that tells you everything about her you need to know where is your father a flap in the bottom of a nearby door swung back and a large heavyset wolf trotted in it glanced around the room and then shook itself vigorously the baroness bridled guye you know what i said its after six change when you come in from the garden the wolf gave her a look and strolled behind a massive oak screen at the far end of the room there was a noise soft and rather strange not so much an actual sound as a change in the texture of the air the baron walked around from behind the screen doing up the cord of a tattered dressing gown the baroness sniffed at least your father wears clothes she said clothes are unhealthy mother said wolf calmly nakedness is purity the baron sat down he was a large redfaced man insofar as a face could be seen under the beard hair moustache and eyebrows which were engaged in a bitter fourway war over the remaining areas of bare skin well he growled vimes the thieftaker from ankhmorpork is going to be the alleged ambassador snapped the baroness dwarfs of course theyll be told the baron sat staring at nothing with the same expression detritus used when a new thought was being assembled bad he ventured at last guye ive told you about this a thousand times said the baroness youre spending far too much time changed you know what youre like afterwards supposing we had official visitors bite em you see go on off to bed and dont come down until youre fit to be human vimes could ruin everything father said wolfgang he was now doing handstands using one hand guye down the baron stopped trying to scratch his ear with his leg do he said wolfgangs gleaming body dipped a moment as he changed hands again city life makes men weak vimes will be fun they do say he likes running though he gave a little laugh we shall have to see how fast he is his wife says hes very softhearted guye dont you dare do that if youre going to do that sort of thing do it upstairs the baron looked only moderately ashamed but readjusted his clothing anyway bandits he said yes they could be a problem at this time of year said wolfgang at least a dozen said the baroness yes that should wolf grunted upside down no mother you are being stupid his coach must get here safely you understand when he is here that is a different matter the barons massive eyebrows tangled with a thought plan king exactly the baroness sighed i dont trust that little dwarf wolf somersaulted on to his feet no but trustworthy or not hes all weve got vimes must get here with his soft heart he may even be useful perhaps we should assist matters why snapped the baroness let ankhmorpork look after their own there was a knock on the door while vimes was having breakfast willikins ushered in a small thin man in neat but threadbare black clothes whose overlarge head gave him the appearance of a lolly nearing the last suck he carried a black bowler hat the way a soldier carries his helmet and walked like a man who had something wrong with his knees i am so sorry to disturb your grace vimes laid down his knife hed been peeling an orange sybil insisted he eat fruit not your grace he said just vimes sir samuel if you must are you vetinaris man inigo skimmer sir mhmmhm i am to travel with you to uberwald ah youre the clerk whos going to do all the whispering and winking while i hand around the cucumber sandwiches are you i will try to be of service sir although im not much of a winker mhmmhm would you like some breakfast i ate already sir mhmmhm vimes looked the clerk up and down it wasnt so mush that his head was big it was simply that someone appeared to have squeezed the bottom half of it and forced everything up into the top he was going bald too and had carefully teased the remaining strands of hair across the pink dome it was hard to tell his age he could be twentyfive and a big worrier or a freshfaced forty vimes inclined to the former the man had the look of someone who had spent his life watching the world over the top of a book and there was that well was it a nervous laugh a giggle an unfortunate way of clearing his throat and that strange way he walked not even some toast a piece of fruit these oranges are fresh from klatch i really can recommend them vimes tossed one at the man it bounced off his arm and skimmer took a step backwards mildly appalled at the upper classs habit of fruithurling are you all right sir mhmmhm sorry about that said vimes i was carried away by fruit he laid aside his napkin and got up from the table putting his arm around skimmers shoulders ill just take you into the mildly yellow drawing room where you can wait he said walking him towards the door and patting him on the arm in a friendly way the coaches are loaded up sybil is regrouting the bathroom learning ancient klatchian and doing all those other little lastminute things women always do youre with us in the big coach skimmer recoiled oh i couldnt do that sir ill travel with your retinue mhmmhm mhmmhm if you mean cheery and detritus theyre in there with us said vimes noting the look of horror deepen slightly you need four for a decent game of cards and the roads as boring as hell for most of the way and er your servants willikins and the cook and sybils maid are in the other coach oh vimes smiled inwardly he remembered the saying from his childhood too poor to paint but too proud to whitewash bit of a tough choice is it he said ill tell you what you can come in our coach but well give you a hard seat and patronize you from time to time how about that i am afraid you are making a mockery of me sir samuel mhmmhm no but i may be assisting and now if youll excuse me ive got to nip down to the yard to sort out a few lastminute things a quarter of an hour later vimes walked into the charge room at the yard sergeant stronginthearm looked up saluted and then ducked to avoid the orange that was tossed at his head sir he said bewildered just testing stronginthearm did i pass sir oh yes keep the orange its full of vitamins my mother always told me those things could kill you sir carrot was waiting patiently in vimess office vimes shook his head he knew all the places to tread in the corridor and he knew he didnt make a sound and hed never oncecaught carrot reading his paperwork not even upside down just once itd be nice to catch him out at something if the man was any straighter you could use him as a plank carrot stood up and saluted yes yes we havent got a lot of time for that now said vimes sitting behind his desk anything new overnight an unattributed murder sir a tradesman called wallace sonky found in one of his own vats with his throat cut no guild seal or note or anything were treating it as suspicious yes i think that sounds fairly suspicious said vimes unless he has a record as a very careless shaver what kind of vat er rubber sir rubber comes in vats wouldnt he bounce out no sir its a liquid in the vat sir he makes rubber things hang on i remember seeing something once dont they make things by dipping them in the rubber you make sort of the right shapes and dip them in to get gloves boots that sort of thing er that er sort of thing sir something about carrots uneasy manner got through to vimes and the little file at the back of his brain eventually waved a card sonky sonky carrot were not talking about sonky as in a packet of sonkies are we now carrot was bright red with embarrassment yes sir my gods what was he dipping in the vat hed been thrown in sir apparently but hes practically a national hero sir captain the housing shortage in ankhmorpork would be a good deal worse if it wasnt for old man sonky and his pennyapacket preventatives whod want to do away with him people do have views sir said carrot coldly yes you do dont you vimes thought dwarfs dont hold with that sort of thing well put some men on it anything else a carter assaulted constable swires last night for clamping his cart assault tried to stamp on him sir vimes had a mental picture of constable swires a gnome six inches tall but a mile high in pentup aggression how is he well the man can speak but itll be a little while before he can climb back on a cart again apart from that its all runofthemill stuff nothing more about the scone theft not really lots of accusations in the dwarf community but no one really knows anything like you say sir well probably know more when it goes bad any word on the street yes sir its halt sir sergeant colon painted it at the top of lower broadway the carters are a lot more careful now of course someone has to shovel the manure off every hour or so this whole traffic thing is not making us very popular captain no sir but we arent popular anyway and at least its bringing in money for the city treasury er there is another thing sir yes have you seen sergeant angua sir me no i was expecting her to be here then vimes noticed just the very edge of concern in carrots voice something wrong she didnt turn up for duty last night it wasnt full moon so its a bit odd nobby said she was rather concerned about something when they were on duty the other day vimes nodded of course most people were concerned about something if they were on duty with nobby they tended to look at clocks a lot have you been to her lodgings her bed hadnt been slept in said carrot or her basket either he added well i cant help you there carrot shes your girlfriend shes been a bit worried about the future i think said carrot um you she the er werewolf thing vimes stopped acutely embarrassed it preys on her mind said carrot perhaps shes just gone somewhere to think about things like how on earth could she go out with a young man who magnificent though he was blushed at the idea of a packet of sonkies thats what i hope sir carrot said she does that sometimes its really quite stressful being a werewolf in a big city i know wed have heardif shed run into any trouble there was the sound of a harness outside and the rattle of a coach vimes was relieved seeing carrot worried was so unusual that it had the shock of the unfamiliar well well have to go without her he said i want to be kept in touch about everything captain a fake scone going missing a week or two before a big dwarf coronation that sounds like another shoe is about to drop and it might just hit me and while youre about it put the word out that im to be sent anything about sonky will you i dont like mysteries the clacks do a skeleton service as far as uberwald now dont they carrot brightened up its wonderful sir isnt it in a few months they say well be able to send messages all the way from ankhmorpork to genua in less than a day yes indeed i wonder if by then well have anything sensible to say to each other lord vetinari stood at his window watching the semaphore tower on the other side of the river all eight of the big shutters facing him were blinking furiously black white white black white information was flying into the air twenty miles behind him on another tower in sto lat someone was looking through a telescope and shouting out numbers how quickly the future comes upon us he thought he always suspected the poetic description of time like an everrolling stream time in his experience moved more like rocks sliding pressing building up force underground and then with one jerk that shakes the crockery a whole field of turnips mysteriously slips sideways by six feet semaphore had been around for centuries and everyone knew that knowledge had a value and everyone knew that exporting goods was a way of making money and then suddenly someone realized how much money you could make by exporting to genua by tomorrow things known in ankhmorpork today and some bright young man in the street of cunning artificers had been unusually cunning knowledge information power words flying through the air invisible and suddenly the world was tapdancing on quicksand in that case the prize went to the best dancer lord vetinari turned away took some papers from a desk drawer walked to a wall touched a certain area and stepped quickly through the hidden door that noiselessly swung open beyond was a corridor lit by borrowed light from high windows and paved with small flagstones he walked forward hesitated said no this is tuesday and moved his descending foot so that it landed on a stone that in every respect appeared to be exactly the same as its fellows except that the ones around it were not good stones to tread on if it was a tuesday anyone overhearing his progress along the passages and stairs might have caught muttered phrases on the lines of the moon is waxing and yes it is before noon a really keen listener would have heard the faint whirring and ticking inside the walls a really keen and paranoid listener would have reflected that anything lord vetinari said aloud even while he was alone might not be totally worth believing not certainly if your life depended on it eventually he reached a door which he unlocked there was a large attic room beyond suddenly airy and bright and cheerful with sunlight from the windows in the roof it seemed to be a cross between a workshop and a storeroom several bird skeletons hung from the ceiling and there were a few other bones on the worktables along with coils of wire and metal springs and tubes of paint and more tools many of them probably unique than you normally saw in any one place only a narrow bed wedged between a thing like a loom with wings and a large bronze statue suggested that someone actually lived here they were clearly someone who was obsessively interested in everything what interested lord vetinari right now was the device all by itself on a table in the middle of the room it looked like a collection of copper balls balanced on one another steam was hissing gently from a few rivets and occasionally the device went blup your lordship vetinari looked around a hand was waving desperately at him from behind an upturned bench and something made him look up as well the ceiling above him was crusted with some brownish substance which hung from it like stalactites blup with quite surprising speed the patrician was behind the bench leonard of quirm smiled at him from underneath his homemade protective helmet i do apologize he said im afraid i wasnt expecting anyone to come in im sure it will work this time however blup what is it said vetinari blup im not quite sure but i hope its a and then it was suddenly too noisy to talk leonard of quirm never dreamed that he was a prisoner if anything he was grateful to vetinari for giving him this airy work space and regular meals and laundry and protecting him from those people who for some reason always wanted to take his perfectly innocent inventions designed for the betterment of mankind and use them for despicable purposes it was amazing how many of them there were both the people and the inventions it was as if all the genius of a civilization had funnelled into one head which was therefore in a constant state of highly inventive spin vetinari often speculated upon the fate of mankind should leonard keep his mind on one thing for more than an hour or so the rushing noise died away blup leonard peered cautiously over the bench and smiled broadly ali happily we appear to have achieved coffee he said coffee leonard walked over to the table and pulled a small lever on the device a light brown foam cascaded into a waiting cup with a noise like a clogged drain different coffee he said very fast coffee i rather think you will like it im calling this the veryfastcoffee machine and thats todays invention is it said vetinari well yes it would have been a scale model of a device for reaching the moon and other celestial bodies but i was thirsty how fortunate lord vetinari carefully removed an experimental pedalpowered shoepolishing machine from a chair and sat down and ive brought you some more little messages leonard almost clapped his hands oh good and ive finished the other ones you gave me last night lord vetinari carefully removed a moustache of frothy coffee from his upper lip i beg your all of them you broke the cyphers on all those messages from uberwald oh they were quite easy after id finished the new device said leonard rummaging through the piles of paper on a bench and handing the patrician several closely written sheets but once you realize that there are only a limited number of birth dates a person can have and that people do tend to think the same way cyphers are really not very hard you mentioned a new device said the patrician oh yes the thingy its all very crude at the moment but it suffices for these simple codes leonard pulled a sheet off something vaguely rectangular it seemed to vetinari to be all wooden wheels and long thin spars which he saw when he moved closer were inscribed thickly with letters and numbers a number of the wheels were not round but oval or heartshaped or some other curious curve when leonard turned a handle the whole thing moved with a complex oiliness quite disquieting in something merely mechanical and what are you calling it oh you know me and names my lord i think of it as the engine for the neutralizing of information by the generation of miasmic alphabets but i appreciate that it does not exactly roll off the tongue er yes leonard er its not wrong is it reading other peoples messages vetinari sighed the worried man in front of him who was so considerate of life that he carefully dusted around spiders had once invented a device that fired lead pellets with tremendous speed and force he thought it would be useful against dangerous animals hed designed a thing that could destroy whole mountains he thought it would be useful in the mining industries here was a man who in his tea break would doodle an instrument for unthinkable mass destruction in the blank spaces around an exquisite drawing of the fragile beauty of the human smile with a list of numbered parts and if you taxed him with it hed say ah but such a thing would make war completely impossible you see because no one would dare use it leonard brightened up as a thought apparently struck him but on the other hand the more we know about one another the more we will learn to understand now you asked me to construct some more cyphers for you im sorry my lord but i must have misunderstood your requirements what was wrong with the first ones i did vetinari sighed im afraid they were unbreakable leonard but surely its hard to explain said vetinari aware that what to him were the lucid waters of politics were so much mud to leonard these new ones you have are merely devilishly difficult you specified fiendishly sir said leonard looking worried oh yes there does not appear to be a common standard for fiends my lord but i did some research in the more accessible occult texts and i believe these cyphers will be considered difficult by more than per cent of fiends good they may perhaps verge on the diabolically difficult in places that is not a problem i shall use them forthwith leonard still seemed to have something on his mind it would be so easy to make them archdemonically diff but these will suffice leonard said vetinari my lord leonard almost wailed i really cannot guarantee that sufficiently clever people will be unable to read your messages good but my lord they will know what you are thinking vetinari patted him on the shoulder no leonard they will merely know what is in my messages i really do not understand my lord no but on the other hand i cannot make exploding coffee what would the world be like if we were all alike leonards face clouded for a moment im not sure he said but if youd like me to work on the problem i may be able to devise a it was merely a figure of speech leonard vetinari shook his head ruefully it often seemed to him that leonard who had pushed intellect into hitherto undiscovered uplands had discovered there large and specialized pockets of stupidity what would be the point of cyphering messages that very clever enemies couldnt break youd end up not knowing what they thought you thought they were thinking there was one rather strange message from uberwald my lord said leonard yesterday morning strange it was not cyphered not at all i thought everyone used codes oh the sender and recipient are code names but the message is quite plain it was a request for information about commander vimes of whom you have often spoken lord vetinari went quite still the return message was mostly clear too a certain amount of gossip all about vimes yesterday morning before i my lord tell me said the patrician this message from uberwald it yields no clue at all to the sender sometimes like a ray of light through clouds leonard could be quite perceptive you think you might know the originator my lord oh in my younger days i spent some time in uberwald said the patrician in those days rich young men from ankhmorpork used to go on what we called the grand sneer visiting farflung countries and cities in order to see at first hand how inferior they were or so it seemed at any rate oh yes i spent some time in uberwald it was not often that leonard of quirm paid attention to what people around him were doing but he saw the faraway look in lord vetinaris eye you have fond memories my lord he ventured hmm oh she was a very unusual lady but alas rather older than me said vetinari much older i have to say but it was a long time ago life teaches us its small lessons and we move on there was that distant look again well well well and no doubt the lady is now dead said leonard he was not much good at this sort of conversation oh i very much doubt that said vetinari i have no doubt she thrives he smiled the world was becoming more interesting tell me leonard he said has it ever occurred to you that one day wars will be fought with brains leonard picked up his coffee cup oh dear wont that be rather messy he said vetinari sighed again not perhaps as messy as the other sort he said trying the coffee it really was rather good the ducal coach rolled past the last of the outlying buildings and on to the vast flat sto plains cheery and detritus had tactfully decided to ride on the top for the morning leaving the duke and duchess alone inside skimmer was indulging in some uneasy class solidarity and riding with the servants for a while angua seems to have gone into hiding said vimes watching the cabbage fields pass by poor girl said sybil the citys not really the place for her well you couldnt winkle carrot out of it with a big pin said vimes and thats the problem i suppose part of the problem said sybil vimes nodded the other part which no one talked about was children sometimes it seemed to vimes that everyone knew that carrot was the true heir to the redundant throne of the city it just so happened that he didnt want to be he wanted to be a copper and everyone went along with the idea but kingship was a bit like a grand piano you could put a cover over it but you could still see what shape it was underneath vimes wasnt sure what you got if a human and a werewolf had kids possibly you just got someone who had to shave twice a day around full moon and occasionally felt like chasing carts and when you remembered what some of the citys rulers had been like a known werewolf as ruler ought to hold no terrors it was the buggers who looked human all the time that were the problem that was just his view though other people might see things differently no wonder shed gone off to think about things he realized he was looking unseeing out of the window to take his mind off this he opened the package of papers that skimmer had handed him just as he got on the coach it was called briefing material the man seemed to be an expert on uberwald and vimes wondered how many other clerks there were in the patricians palace beavering away becoming experts he settled down glumly and began to read the first page showed the crest of the unholy empire that had once ruled most of the huge country vimes couldnt recall much about it except that one of the emperors once had a mans hat nailed to his head for a joke uberwald seemed to be a big cold depressing place so perhaps people would do anything for a laugh the crest was altogether too florid for vimess taste and was dominated by a doubleheaded bat the first document was entitled the fatbearing strata of the schmaltzberg region he knew the legend of course there had once been five elephants not four standing on the back of great atuin but one had lost its footing or had been shaken loose and had drifted off into a curved orbit before eventually crashing down a billion tons of enraged pachyderm with a force that had rocked the entire world and split it up into the continents people know today the rocks that fell back had covered and compressed the corpse and the rest after millennia of under ground cooking and rendering was fat history according to legend gold and iron and all the other metals were also part of the carcase after all an elephant big enough to support the world on its back wasnt going to have ordinary bones was it the notes in front of him were a little more believable talking about some unknown catastrophe that had killed millions of the mammoths bison and giant shrews and then covered them over pretty much like the fifth elephant in the story there were notes about old troll sagas and legends of the dwarfs possibly ice had been involved or a flood in the case of the trolls who were believed to be the first species in the world maybe theyd been there and seen the elephant trumpeting across the sky the result anyway was the same everyone well everyone except vimes knew the best fat came from the schmaltzberg wells and mines it made the whitest brightest candles the creamiest soap the hottest cleanest lamp oil the yellow tallow from ankhmorporks boilers didnt come close vimes didnt see the point gold now that was important people died for it and iron ankhmorpork needed iron timber too stone even silver now was very he flicked back to a page headed natural resources and under silver read silver has not been mined in uberwald since the diet of bugs in am and the possession of the metal is technically illegal there was no explanation he made a note to ask inigo after all where you got werewolves didnt you need silver and things must have been pretty bad if everyone had to eat insects anyway silver was useful too but fat was just fat it was like biscuits or tea or sugar it was just something that turned up in the cupboard there was no style to it no romance it was stuff in tubs a note was clipped to the next page he read the fifth elephant as a metaphor also appears in the uberwald languages depending on context it can mean a thing that does not exist a thing that is other than it seems and a thing that while unseen controls events i wouldnt thought vimes i dont use words like that constable shoe said constable shoe when the door of the bootmakers factory was opened homicide you come bout mister sonky said the troll whod opened the door warm damp air blew out into the street smelling of incontinent cats and sulphur i meant im a zombie said reg shoe i find that telling people right away saves embarrassing misunderstandings later on but coincidentally yes weve come about the alleged deceased we said the troll making no comment about regs grey skin and stitch marks doon here bigjobs the troll looked down not a usual direction in ankhmorpork where people preferred not to see what they were standing in oh he said and took a few steps backwards some people said that gnomes were no more belligerent than any other race and this was true however the belligerence was compressed down into a body six inches high and like many things when they are compressed had an inclination to explode constable swires had been on the force only for a few months but news had gone around and already he inspired respect or at least the bladdertrembling terror that can pass for respect on these occasions dont just stand there gawpin wheres yon stiff said swires striding into the factory we put him in der cellar said the troll and now we got half a ton of liquid rubber runnin to waste hed be livid bout that if he was alive ocourse whys it wasted said reg gone all thick and manky hasnt it im gonna have to dump it later on and days not easy we was supposed to be dippin a load of ribbed magical delights today too but all der ladies felt faint when i hauls him outa der vat and dey went off home reg shoe looked shocked he was not for various reasons a patron of mr sonkys wares romance not being a regular feature of the life of the dead but surely the world of the living had some standards didnt it you employ ladies here he said the troll looked surprised yeah sure its good steady work deyre good workers too always laughing and tellin jokes while deyre doin der dippin and packin specially when were doin der big boys the troll sniffed persnally i dont unnerstan der jokes them big boys are bloody good value for a penny said buggy swires reg shoe stared at his tiny partner there was just no way that he was going to ask the question but swires must have seen his expression after a bit of work wi yon scissors ye wont find a better mackintosh in the whole city said the gnome and laughed nastily constable shoe sighed he knew that mr vimes had an unofficial policy of getting ethnic minorities into the watch but he wasnt sure this was wise in the case of gnomes even though there was admittedly no ethnic group that was more minor they had an inbuilt resistance to rules this didnt just apply to the law but to all the invisible rules that most people obeyed unthinkingly like do not attempt to eat this giraffe or do not headbutt people in the ankle just because they wont give you a chip it was best to think of constable swires simply as a small independent weapon youd better show us the d the person who is currently vitally challenged he said they were led downstairs what was hanging from a beam there would have frightened the life out of anyone who wasnt already a zombie sorry bout dat said the troll pulling it down and tossing it into a corner where it coiled into a rubbery heap what dheel wazzit said constable swires we had to pull der rubber offf him said the troll sets quick see once you get it out in der air hey thats a biggest sonky i ever saw chuckled buggy a wholebody sonky reckon thats the way he wanted to go reg looked at the corpse he didnt mind being sent out on murders even messy ones the way he saw it dying was really just a career change been there done that worn the shroud and as a member of the dead community reg shoe naturally thought of himself as an ethnic majority then you got over it and got on with your life of course he knew that many people didnt for some reason but he thought of them as not prepared to make the effort there was a ragged wound in the neck any next of kin he said he got a brother in uberwald weve sent word the troll added on der clacks it cost twenty dollars dats murder can you think of any reason why someone would kill him the troll scratched his head well cos dey wanted him dead i reckon dats a good reason and why would anyone want him dead do you think reg shoe could be very very patient has there been any trouble business aint been so good i know dat really id have thought youd be coining money here oh yeah days what youd fink but not everyfing people calls a sonky is made by us see its to do wid us becomin the trolls face screwed up with cerebral effort jernairrick lots of other buggers are jumpin up and down on der bandwagon and dey got better plant and new ideas like makin em in cheeseandonion flavour an wid bells on an stuff like dat mister sonky wont have nothin to do wid dat kind of frog and days been costin us sales i can see this would worry him said reg in a keepontalking tone of voice hes been locking himself in his office a lot oh whys that said reg hes der boss you dont ask der boss but he did say dat dere was a special job comin up and data put us back on our feets really said reg making a mental note what kind of job dunno you dont ask the boss said reg right i suppose no one saw the murder did they once again the troll screwed up its enormous face in thought der murderer yeah an probly mister sonky was there a third party i dunno i never get invited to dem frogs apart from mister sonky and the murderer said shoe still as patient as the grave was there anyone else here last night dunno said the troll thank you youve been very helpful said shoe well have a look around if you dont mind sure the troll went back to his vat reg shoe hadnt expected to find anything and was not disappointed but he was thorough zombies usually are mr vimes had told him never to get too excited about clues because clues could lead you a dismal dance they could become a habit you ended up finding a wooden leg a silk slipper and a feather at the scene of a crime and constructing an elegant theory involving a onelegged ballet dancer and a production of chicken lake the door to the office was open it was hard to tell if anything had been disturbed shoe got the impression that the mess was normal a desk was awash with paperwork mr sonky having followed the usual put it down somewhere method of filing a bench was covered with samples of rubber bits of sacking large bottles of chemicals and some wooden moulds that reg refrained from looking at too closely did you hear corporal littlebottom talking about that museum theft when we came on duty today buggy he said opening a jar of yellow powder and sniffing it no i did said reg he put the lid on the sulphur again and sniffed the air of the factory it smelled of liquid rubber which is very much like the smell of incontinent cats and some things stick in the mind he said special job eh it was constable visit theinfidelwithexplanatorypamphletss week as communications officer which largely meant looking after the pigeons and keeping an eye on the clacks with of course the assistance of constable downspout constable downspout was a gargoyle when it came to staring fixedly at one thing you couldnt beat a gargoyle the gargoyles were getting a lot of employment in the clacks industry constable visit quite enjoyed the pigeons he sang them hymns they listened to short homilies cocking their heads from side to side after all he reasoned had not bishop horn preached to the molluscs of the sea and there was no record of them actually listening whereas he was certain that the pigeons were taking it in and they seemed to be interested in his pamphlets on the virtues of omnianism admittedly as nesting material at the moment but this was certainly a good start a pigeon fluttered in as he was scraping the perches ah zebedinah he said lifting her up and removing the message capsule from her leg well done this is from constable shoe and you shall have some corn provided locally by josiah frument and sons seed merchants but ultimately by the grace of om there was a whirr of wings and another pigeon settled on the perch constable visit recognized it as wilhelmina one of sergeant anguas pigeons he removed the message capsule the thin paper inside was tightly folded and on it someone had written cpt carrot personal he hesitated then put the message from reg shoe into the pneumatic tube and heard the whoosh of the suction as it headed off to the main office the other one he decided required a more careful delivery carrot was working in vimess office but visit noticed not at the commanders desk instead hed set up a folding table in the corner the tottering piles of paperwork on the desk were slightly less alpine than yesterday there were even occasional patches of desktop personal message for you captain thank you and constable shoe wants a sergeant down at sonkys boot factory did you send the message down to the office yes sir the pneumatic tube is very useful visit added dutifully commander vimes isnt very keen on it but im sure it will eventually save us time said carrot he unfolded the note visit watched him carrots lips moved slightly as he read where did the pigeon come from he said at last screwing up the note it looks pretty worn out sir not from inside the city im sure ah right thank you bad news sir visit angled just news constable dont let me detain you right sir when the disappointed visit had gone carrot went and looked out of the window there was a typical ankhmorpork street scene outside although people were trying to separate them after a few minutes he went back to his table wrote a short note put it into one of the little carriers and sent it away with a hiss of air a few minutes later sergeant colon came panting along the corridor carrot was very keen on modernizing the watch and in some strange way sending a message via the tube was so much more modern than simply opening the door and shouting which is what mr vimes did carrot gave colon a bright smile ah fred everything going well yessir said fred colon uncertainly good im off to see the patrician fred as senior sergeant you are in charge of the watch until mister vimes gets back yessir er until you get back you mean i shall not be coming back fred i am resigning the patrician looked at the badge on his desk and welltrained men carrot was saying somewhere in front of him after all a few years ago there were only four of us in the watch now its functioning just like a machine yes although bits of it do go boing occasionally said lord vetinari still staring at the badge could i invite you to reconsider captain ive reconsidered several times sir and its notcaptain sir the watch needs you mister ironfoundersson the watch is bigger than one man sir said carrot still looking straight ahead im not sure if its bigger than sergeant colon though people get mistaken about old fred sir hes a man with a solid bottom to his character hes got a solid bottom to his bottom ca mister ironfoundersson i mean he doesnt flap in an emergency sir he doesnt do anything in an emergency said the patrician except possibly hide i might go so far as to say that the man appears to consist of an emergency in his own right my mind is made up sir lord vetinari sighed sat back and stared up at the ceiling for a moment then all i can do is thank you for your services captain and wish you good luck in your future endeavour do you have enough money ive saved quite a lot sir nevertheless it is a long way to uberwald there was silence sir yes how did you know oh people measured it years ago surveyors and so forth sir vetinari sighed i think the term is deduction be that as it may captain i am choosing to believe that you are merely taking an extended leave of absence i understand that youve never taken a holiday while youve been here im sure youre owed a few weeks carrot said nothing and if i was you id begin my search for sergeant angua at the shambling gate vetinari added after a while carrot said quietly is that as a result of information received my lord vetinari smiled a thin little smile no but uberwald is going through some troubling times and of course she is from one of the aristocratic families i surmise that she has been called away beyond that i cannot be of much help you will have to follow as they say your nose no i think i can find a much more reliable nose than mine said carrot good lord vetinari went back to his desk and sat down i wish you well in your search nevertheless im sure well be seeing you again a lot of people here depend on you yes sir good day to you when carrot had gone lord vetinari got up and walked across to the other side of the room where a map of uberwald was unrolled on a table it was quite old but in recent years any mapmakers who had wandered off the beaten track in that country had spent all their time trying to find it again there were a few rivers their courses mostly guesswork and the occasional town or at least the name of a town probably put in to save the cartographer the embarrassment of filling his chart with as they said in the trade mmb u the door opened and vetinaris head clerk drumknott eased his way in with the silence of a feather falling in a cathedral a somewhat unexpected development my lord he said quietly an uncharacteristic one certainly said vetinari do you wish me to send a clacks to vimes sir he could be back in a day or so vetinari was looking intently at the blind blank map it was he felt very much like the future a few things were outlined there were some rough guesses but everything else was waiting to be created miles and miles of bloody uberwald hmm he said do you wish me to recall vimes sir good heavens no vimes in uberwald will be more amusing than an amorous armadillo in a bowling alley and who else could i send only vimes could go to uberwald but surely this is an emergency sir hmm what else are we to call it sir when a young man of such promise throws away his career for the pursuit of a girl the patrician stroked his beard and smiled at something there was a line across the map the progress of the semaphore towers it was mathematically straight a statement of intellect in the crowding darkness of miles and miles of bloody uberwald possibly a bonus he said uberwald has much to teach us fetch me the papers on the werewolf clans will you oh and although i swore i would never ever do this please prepare a message for sergeant colon too promotion alas beckons a grubby cloth cap lay on the pavement on the pavement beside the cap someone had written in damp chalk plese heip this little doggie beside it sat a small dog it was not cut out by nature to be a friendly little waggytailed dog but it was making the effort whenever someone walked by it sat up on its hind legs and whined pitifully something landed in the cap it was a washer the charitable pedestrian had gone only a few steps further along the road when he heard and i hope your legs fall off mister the man turned the dog was watching him intently woof it said he looked puzzled shrugged and then turned and walked on yeah bloody woof woof said the strange voice as he was about to turn the corner a hand reached down and picked up the dog by the scruff of its neck hello gaspode i believe ive solved a little mystery oh no the dog moaned thats not being a good dog gaspode said carrot lifting the dog so they could meet eye to eye all right all right put me down will you this hurts you know i need your help gaspode not me i dont help the watch nothing personal but it doesnt do anything for my street cred im not talking about helping the watch gaspode this is personal i need your nose carrot lowered the dog to the pavement and rubbed his hand on his shirt unfortunately this means i need the rest of you as well although of course i am aware that under that itchy exterior beats a heart of gold really said gaspode nothing good starts with i need your help its angua oh dear i want you to track her huh not many dogs could track a werewolf mister theyre cunning go to the best i always say said carrot finest nose known to man or beast said gaspode wrinkling it wheres she gone then to uberwald i think carrot moved fast gaspodes flight was hindered by the hand gripping his tail thats hundreds of miles away and dog miles is seven times longer not a chance oh all right then silly of me to suggest it said carrot letting go youre right its ridiculous gaspode turned suddenly full of suspicion no i didnt say it was ridiculous he said i just said it was hundreds of miles away yes but you said you had no chance no i said that you had no chance of getting me to do it yes but winters coming on and as you say a werewolf is very hard to track and on top of that anguas a copper shell work out that id use you so shell be covering her trail gaspode whined look mister respect is hard to earn in this dogs town if im not smelled around the lampposts for a couple of weeks my stock is definitely in the gutter right yes yes i understand ill make some other arrangements nervous nigels still around isnt he what that spaniel he couldnt smell his own bottom if you put it in front of him they say hes pretty good nasally and he widdles every time anyone looks at him snapped gaspode i heard he can smell a dead rat two miles away yeah well i can smell what colour it is carrot sighed well ive got no choice im afraid you cant do it so ill i didnt say gaspode stopped and then went on im going to do it arent i im bloody well going to do it youre going to trick me or blackmail me or whatever it takes arent you yes how do you manage to write gaspode i holds the chalk in me mouth easy youre a smart dog ive always said so the worlds only talking dog too lower your voice lower your voice said gaspode looking around here uberwalds wolf country isnt it oh yes i couldve bin a wolf you know with diffrent parents of course gaspode sniffed and looked furtively up and down the street again steak every night right sergeant colon was a picture of misery drawn on a lumpy pavement in bad crayon on a wet day he sat on a chair and occasionally glanced at the message that had just been delivered as if hoping that the words would somehow fade away bloody hell nobby he moaned there there fred said nobby currently a vision in organdie i cant be promoted im not an officer i am base common and popular ive always said that about you fred you got common off to a treat but its writ down nobby look his lordships signed it weell the way i see it youve got three choices said nobby yeah you can go and tell him youre not doing it the panic in colons face was replaced by glazed grey terror thank you very much nobby he said bitterly let me know if youve got any more suggestions like that cos ill need to go and change my underwear or you could accept it and make such a cockup of it that he takes it away from you youre doing this on purpose nobby might be worth a try fred yeah but the thing about cockups nobby is that its hard for you to be you know precise you might think youre making a little cockup and then it blows up in your face and it turns out to be in fact a big cockup and in those circumstances nobby im sort of worried that what his lordship might take away from me wouldnt just be the job i hope i dont have to draw you a picture good point fred what im saying is cockups is like well cockups is well the thing about cockups is you never know what size theyre going to be well fred the third choice is you putting up with it thats not helpful nobby itll only be for a couple of weeks then mister vimesll be back yeah but supposing he isnt nasty place uberwald i heard where its a misery wrapped in a enema that doesnt sound too good you can fall down things then im stuck right i dont know how to do officering no one knows how to do officering fred thats why theyre officers if they knew anything theyd be sergeants now colons face screwed up again in desperate thought as a lifelong uniformed man a threestriped peg that had found a threestriped hole very early in its career he subscribed automatically and unthinkingly to the belief that officers as a class could not put their own trousers on without a map he conscientiously excluded vimes and carrot from the list elevating them to the rank of honorary sergeant nobby was watching him with an expression of combined concern friendliness and predatory intent what shall i do nobby well captain said nobby and then he gave a little cough what officers mainly have to do as you know is sign things the door was knocked on and opened at the same time by a flustered constable sarge constable shoe says he really does need an officer down at sonkys factory what the rubber wally man said colon right an officer right well be along and thats captain colon said nobby quickly er er yes and thats captain colon thank you very much said colon adding as his resolve stiffened and ill thank you not to forget it the constable stared at them and then stopped trying to understand and theres a troll downstairs who insists on speaking to whoevers in charge cant stronginthearm deal with it er is sergeant stronginthearm still a sergeant said the constable yes even unconscious what hes flat on the floor right now sar captain whats the troll want right now he wants to kill someone but mainly i think he wants someone to take the clamp offf his foot gaspode ran up and down nose barely an inch from the ground carrot waited holding his horse it was a good one carrot hadnt spent a lot of his wages up until now finally the dog sat down and looked depressed so tell me about this wonderful nose the patrician has got then he said not a trace youd better get vetinari down here if hes so good said gaspode whats the point of starting here worst place in the whole city its the gate to the cattle market am i right trying not to smell stuff is the trick here is the point im makin theres groundin stink if you wanted to get on the trail of somebody this is the last place id start very good point said carrot carefully so whats the strongest smell heading hubwards dung carts ocourse yesterday always a big clearout of the pens first thing friday morning you can follow the smell gaspode rolled his eyes with my head in a bucket good lets go so said gaspode as they began to leave the gates bustle behind were chasing this girl right yes just you yes not like with dogs then where there might be twenty or thirty no so were not looking at a bucket of cold water here no constable shoe saluted but a little testily hed been waiting rather a long time afternoon sergeant thats captain said captain colon see the pip on my shoulder reg reg looked closely i thought it was bird doings barge thats captain said colon automatically its only chalk now because i aint got time to get it done properly he said so dont be cheeky whats up with nobby said reg corporal nobbs was holding a damp cloth over one eye bit of a contry tomps with an illegally parked troll said captain colon shows what kind of troll he was striking a lady muttered nobby but you aint a lady nobby youre just wearing your trafficcalming disguise he wasnt to know youd got your helmet on anyway you shouldnt have clamped him he was parked fred hed been knocked down by a cart said captain colon and thats captain well they always have excuses said nobby sullenly youd better show us the corpus reg said colon the body in the cellar was duly inspected and i remember cheery saying there was a smell of cats pee and sulphur at the dwarf bread museum said reg certainly hangs about said colon you wouldnt have blocked sinuses if you worked here for a day and i thought i wonder if someoned tried to make a mould of the replica scone sir said reg now that is clever said fred colon youd get the real one back then wouldnt you er no barge captain but youd get a copy of the replica would that be legal cant say sir i wouldnt think so it wouldnt fool a dwarf for five minutes then whod want to kill him a father of thirteen kids maybe said nobby haha nobby will you stop pinching the merchandise said colon and dont argue i just saw you put a couple of dozen in your handbag dat dont matter rumbled the troll mister sonky always said dey was free to the watch that was very civic of him said captain colon yeah he said der last frog we wanted was more bloody coppers around the city a pigeon chose that diplomatic moment to flutter into the factory and land on colons shoulder where it promoted him colon reached up removed the message capsule and unfolded the contents its from visit he said theres a clue he says what to said nobby not to anything nobby just a clue he took off his helmet and wiped his brow this was what hed hoped to avoid in his heart of battered hearts he suspected that vimes and carrot were good at putting clues next to other clues and thinking about them that was their talent he had others well he was good with people and he had a shiny breastplate and he could sergeant in his sleep all right write up your report he said well done were going back to the yard i can see this is going to get on top of me said colon as they walked away theres paperwork too you know me and paperwork nobby youre a very thorough reader thats all fred said nobby ive seen you take ages over just one page digesting it magisterially i thought colon brightened a little yes thats what i do he said even if its only the menu down at the klatchian takeaway ive seen you staring at one line for a minute at a time well obviously you cant let people put one over on you said colon sticking out his chest or at least sticking it further up what you need is an aide de camp said nobby lifting his dress to step over a puddle i do oh yes cos of you being a figurehead and setting an example to your men said nobby ah right yes said colon grasping the idea with relief a man cant be expected to do all that and read long words am i right exactly and of course were down one sergeant at the yard now said nobby good point nobby its going to be busy they walked on for a while you could promote someone nobby prompted could i what goods being the boss if you cant thats true and its sort of an emergency hmm any thoughts nobby nobby sighed inwardly a penny could drop through wet cement faster than it could drop for fred colon a name springs to mind he said ah right yes reg shoe right good at writing a keen thinker and of course hes cool headed said colon icy practically but a bit on the dead side said nobby yes i suppose that counts against him and he goes to pieces unpredictably said nobby thats true said captain colon no one likes shaking hands and ending up with more fingers than they started with so praps it might be best to consider someone who has been unreasonably overlooked said nobby going for broke someone whose face dunt fit praps someone whose experience in the watch genially and in traffic in particular could be of great service to the city if people wouldnt go on about one or two lapses which didnt happen in any case the dawn of intelligence rose across the vistas of colons face ah he said i see well why didnt you come right out with that at the start nobby well its your decision fred i mean captain said nobby earnestly but sposing mister vimes doesnt agree hell be back in a couple of weeks thatll be long enough said nobby and you dont mind me mind not me you know me fred always ready to do my bit nobby yes fred the dress yes fred i thought we werent doing the traffic calming any more yes fred but i thought id keep it on ready to swing into action just in case you decided that we should a chilly wind blew across the cabbage fields to gaspode it brought besides the overpowering fumes of the cabbage and the dark red smell of the dung carts hints of pine mountains snow sweat and stale cigar smoke the last came from the cart mens habit of smoking large cheap cigars they kept the flies off it was better than vision the world of smell stretched before gaspode my paws hurt he said theres a good dog said carrot the road forked gaspode stopped and snuffled around well heres an intresting frog he said some of the dungs jumped down offf the cart and headed away across the fields here you were right can you smell water anywhere around said carrot scanning the flat plain gaspodes mottled nose wrinkled up in effort pond he said not very big bout a mile away shell be heading towards it very meticulous about cleanliness angua thats not usual in werewolves never been one for water myself said gaspode is that a fact here no need for that i had a bath once you know its not as if i dont know what its like the pond was in a clump of windblown trees dry grass rustled in the breeze a single coot scuttled into the reeds as carrot and gaspode approached yeah here we are said gaspode a lot of muck goes in and he sniffed at the stirredup mud er yeah she comes out um is there a problem said carrot what oh no clear scent headin for the mountains just like you said um gaspode sat down and scratched himself with a hind leg theres a problem isnt there said carrot well supposin there was something really bad that you wouldnt really want to know and i knew what it was howd you feel about me tellin you i mean some peopled rather not know its a persnal thing gaspode shes not alone theres another wolf ah carrots mild uninformative smile did not change er of the male persuasion said gaspode a boy wolf er very much so thank you gaspode extremely male um in a very defnite way unmistakably yes i think i understand and this is just words in smell its a lot more well emphatic thank you for that gaspode and theyre heading still straight for the mountains boss said gaspode as kindly as he could he wasnt certain of all the details of human sexual relationships and the ones he was certain of he still couldnt quite believe but he knew that they were a lot more complicated than those enjoyed by the doggy fraternity this smell the extremely male one i was talkin about the very one yes said carrot levelly you could still smell it if you were on the horse could you i could smell it with my nose in a sack of onions good because i think we should move a little faster now yes i thought youd think that constable visit saluted when nobby and colon entered pseudopolis yard i thought you ought to know about this right away sir he said flourishing a square of paper i just got it off rodney who the imp on the bridge sir he paints pictures of carts going too fast no one had been feeding him visit added in a mildly accusing tone oh someone speeding said colon so he looked again thats one of those sedan chairs the deepdown dwarfs use isnt it them trolls mustve been moving it was just after the scone was stolen said visit rodney writes the time in the corner see a bit odd i thought like a kind of getaway vehicle sir whatd a dwarf want to steal a worthless lump of rock for said colon especially them dark dwarfs they give me the creeps in those stupid clothes they wear angry silence rang like a dropped girder in a temple there were three dwarfs in the room you two you ought to be out on patrol barked sergeant stronginthearm ive got business down at chitterling street all three dwarfs marched out somehow contriving even to walk angrily well what was that about said fred colon bit touchy arent they mister vimes says that sort of thing all the time and no one minds yes but thats because hes sam vimes said nobby oh and are you inferring im not said captain colon well yes fred youre fred colon said nobby patiently oh i am am i yes captain colon and theyd better bloody remember it colon snapped im not a soft touch me im not going to take insubordination like that ive always said vimes was a bit too soft on those dwarfs they gets the same pay as us and theyre only half the size yes yes said nobby waving his hands placatingly in a desperate attempt to calm things down but fred trolls are twice as big as us and they get paid the same so it but theyve only got a quarter of the brains so its just the same like i said the noise they heard was long and drawn out and menacing it was the sound of lanceconstable bluejohns chair being pushed back the floor creaked as he shambled past colon removed his helmet from its peg with one enormous hand and headed for the door m goin on patrol he mumbled youre not on patrol for another hour said constable visit m goin now said bluejohn the room was darkened for a moment as he eclipsed the doorway and then he was gone whys everyone so tetchy all of a sudden said colon the remaining constables tried not to catch his eye did i hear someone snigger he demanded i didnt hear anyone snigger barge said nobby oh oh you think im a sergeant do you corporal nobbs no fred i oh gawds i can see things have got pretty slack around here said captain colon an evil little gleam in his eye i bet you were all thinking oh its only fat old fred colon its all going to be gravy from now on eh oh fred no one thinks youre old oh gawds just fat eh fred glowered around the room suddenly and against all previous evidence everyone was vitally interested in their paperwork right well from now on things are going to be different said captain colon oh yes im on to all your little tricks who said that said what captain said nobby whod also heard the little whispered we learned em all from you sarge but at this moment would eat live coals rather than admit it someone said something blotto voice said captain colon im sure they didnt captain said nobby and i wont be eyeballed like that neither no ones looking at you wailed nobby aha you think i dont know that one colon shouted theres plenty of ways to eyeball someone without lookin at em corporal that man over there is earlobing me i think constable ping is just really interested in the report hes writing fre sar captain colons ruffled feathers settled a little well all right and now im going up to my office all right therell be some changes around here and someone bring rile a cup of tea they watched him go up the stairs enter the office and slam the door well the constable ping began but nobby who had a lot more experience of the colon personality waved one hand frantically for silence while he held the other one to his ear very theatrically then they all heard the door click open again quietly a change is as good as a rest i suppose said constable ping as the prophet ossory says better an ox in the potters fields of hersheba than a sandal in the wine presses of gash said constable visit yeah so ive heard said nobby well ill just make him his tea everyone feels better after a cup of tea a couple of minutes later the constables heard colon shouting even through the door what is wrong with this mug corporal nothing sa sir its yer mug you always have your tea in it ah but you see it is a sergeants mug corporal and what is it that officers drink out of well carrot and mister vimes have got their own mugs no they may choose to drink out of mugs corporal but watch regulations say officers have a cup and saucer says so right here regulation subsection c do you understand me i dont think weve got any you know where the petty cash is usually youre the only person that does youre dismissed corporal nobby came down the stairs whitefaced holding the offending receptacle the door opened again and none of you are to gob in it neither shouted colon i know that one and its to be stirred with a spoon understand i know that one too the door slammed constable visit took the mug from nobbys shaking hand and patted him on the shoulder chalky the troll does some very good seconds i understand he began the door opened bloody china too the door slammed anyone seen the petty cash lately said constable ping nobby reached mournfully into his pocket and pulled out some dollars he handed them to visit better go to that posh shop in kings way he said get one of those cups and saucers thin enough to see through you know with gold around the rim he looked around the other constables whatre you lot doing here you wont catch many criminals in here does the petty cash count nobby said ping dont you nobby me ping you just get out there and the rest of you days rolled by more accurately they rattled by it was a comfortable coach as coaches went and as coaches on this road went over continual potholes it swayed and rocked like a cradle initially the motion was soothing after a day or two it palled so did the scenery vimes stared glumly out of the window there was another clacks tower on the horizon they were putting them near the road he recalled even though that wasnt the direct route only a fool would build them across the badlands you had to remember sometimes that within a few hundred miles of ankhmorpork there were still trolls who hadnt caught on to the fact that humans werent digestible besides most of the settlements were near the road the new guild must be coining money even from here he could see the scaffolding as workers feverishly attached still more gantries and paddles to the main tower the whole thing would likely be matchsticks after the next hurricane but by then the owners would probably have earned enough to build another five or fifty it had all happened so fast whod have believed it but all the components had been there for years semaphore was ancient a century ago the watch had used a few towers to relay messages to patrolling officers and gargoyles had nothing to do all day but sit and watch things and usually were too unimaginative to make mistakes what had happened was that people thought differently about news now once upon a time theyd have used something like this to relay information about troop movements and the death of kings true those were things that people needed to know but they didnt need to know them every day no what they needed to know every day were things like how much are cattle selling for in ankhmorpork today because if they werent fetching much maybe it was better to drive them to quirm instead people needed to know these little things lots and lots of little things little things like did my ship get there safely thats why the guild was driving hellbent across the mountains on to genua four thousand miles away it took many months for a ship to round cape terror how much exactly would a trader pay to know within a day when it had arrived and how much the cargo was worth had it been sold was there credit to the traders name in ankhmorpork coining money oh yes and it had caught on as fast as every other craze did in the big city it seemed as though everybody who could put together a pole a couple of gargoyles and some secondhand windmill machinery was in on the business you couldnt go out to dinner these days without seeing people nip out of the restaurant every five minutes to check that there werent any messages for them on the nearest pole as for those who cut out the middleman and signalled directly to their friends across a crowded room causing mild contusions to those nearby vimes shook his head that was messages without meaning telepathy without brains but it had been good hadnt it last week when dont know jack had pinched that silver in sto lat and then galloped at speed to the sanctuary of the shades in ankhmorpork and sergeant edge of the sto lat watch whod trained under vimes had put a message on the clacks which arrived on vimess desk more than an hour before jack sauntered through the city gates and into the waiting embrace of sergeant detritus legally it had been a bit tricky since the offence hadnt been committed on ankhmorpork soil and a semaphore message did not strictly speaking come under the heading of hot pursuit but jack had kindly solved that one by taking a wild swing at the troll resulting in his arrest for assault on a watch officer and treatment for a broken wrist there was a gentle snore from lady sybil a marriage is always made up of two people who are prepared to swear that only the other one snores inigo skimmer was hunched in a corner reading a book vimes watched him for some time im just going up top for some air he said at last opening the door the clattering of the wheels filled the tiny hot space and dust blew in your grace inigo began standing up vimes already clambering up the side of the coach stuck his head back in youre not making any friends with that attitude he said and kicked the door shut with his foot cheery and detritus had made themselves comfortable on the roof it was a lot less stuffy and at least there was a view if vegetables were your idea of a panorama vimes worked himself into a niche between two bundles and leaned towards cheery you know about the clacks right he said well sort of sir good vimes passed her a piece of paper theres bound to be a tower near where we stop tonight cypher this and send it to the watch will you they ought to be able to turn it around in an hour if they ask the right people tell them to try washable topsy she does the laundry there or gilbert gilbert he always seems to know whats going on cheery read the message and then stared at vimes are you sure sir she said maybe make sure you send the description names dont mean much may i ask what makes you think his walk and he didnt catch an orange said vimes mhm mhm constable visit was cleaning out the old pigeon loft when the message arrived on the clacks he was spending more and more time with the pigeons these days it wasnt a popular job so no one had tried to take it away from him and at least up here the shouts and doorslammings were muffled the perches gleamed constable visit enjoyed his job he didnt have many friends in the city truth to tell he didnt have many friends in the watch either but at least there were people to talk to and he was making headway with the religious instruction of the pigeons but now there was this it was addressed to captain carrot that meant it probably ought to be delivered to captain colon now and personally because captain colon thought that people were spying on his messages sent via the suction tube constable visit had been fairly safe until now omnians were good at not questioning orders even ones that made no sense visit instinctively respected authority no matter how crazy because hed been brought up properly and he had plenty of time to keep his armour bright brightly polished armour had suddenly become very important in the watch for some reason even so going into colons office needed all the courage that the legendary bishop horn had shown when entering the city of the oolites and everyone knew what they did to strangers visit climbed down from the loft and made his nervous way to the main building taking care to walk smartly the main office was more or less empty there seemed to be fewer watchmen around these days usually people preferred to loaf indoors in this chilly weather but suddenly everyone was keen to be out of captain colons view visit went up to the office and knocked on the door he knocked again when there was no reply he pushed open the door walked carefully over to the sparkling clean desk and went to tuck the message flimsy under the ink bottle in case it blew away aha the ink soared up as visits hand jerked he had a vision of the blueblack shower passing his eye and heard the splat as it hit something behind him he turned like an automaton to see a captain colon who would have been whitefaced if it wasnt for the ink i see said colon assault on a superior officer eh it was an accident captain oh was it and why pray were you sneaking into my office i didnt think you were in here captain visit gabbled jai s orry sneaking a look at my private papers eh no captain visit rallied a little bit why were you standing behind the door captain oh im not allowed to stand behind my own door is that it it was then that constable visit made his next mistake he tried to smile well it is a bit odd sir are you suggesting there is anything odd about me constable said captain colon is there anything about me that you finds funny visit stared at the mottled face speckled with ink not a thing sir youve been working acceptably constable said colon standing slightly too close to visit and therefore i dont intend to be harsh with you no one could call me an unfair man you is demoted to lanceconstable understand your pay will be adjusted and backdated to the beginning of the month visit saluted it was probably the only way to get out of there alive one of colons eyes was twitching however you could redeem yourself said colon if you was to tell me who has been stealing i said stealing the sugar lumps sir i knows there was fortythree last night i counted em very thoroughly theres fortyone this morning constable and theyre locked in the desk can you explain that if visit had been suicidal and honest he would have said well captain while of course i think you have many worthy qualities i have known you count your fingers twice arid come up with different answers er mice he said weakly hah off you go lanceconstable and just you think about what i said when the dejected visit had gone captain colon sat down at his big clean desk the little flickering part of his brain that was still sparking coherent thought through the fog of mindnumbing terror that filled colons head was telling him that he was so far out of his depth that the fish had lights on their noses yes he did have a clean desk but that was because he was throwing all the paperwork away it wasnt that he was illiterate but fred colon did need a bit of a think and a runup to tackle anything much longer than a list and he tended to get lost in any word that had more than three syllables he was in fact functionally literate that is he thought of reading and writing like he thought about boots you needed them but they werent supposed to be fun and you got suspicious about people who got a kick out of them of course mr vimes had kept his desk piled high with paperwork but it occurred to colon that maybe vimes and carrot between them had developed a way of keeping just ahead of the piles by knowing what was important and what wasnt to colon it was all gutwrenchingly mysterious there were complaints and memos and invitations and letters requesting a few minutes of your time and forms to fill in and reports to read and sentences containing words like iniquitous and immediate action and they tottered in his mind like a great big wave poised to fall on him the sane core of colon was wondering if the purpose of officers wasnt to stand between the sergeants and all this sh this slush so that they could get on with sergeanting captain colon took a deep wobbly breath on the other hand if people were nicking the sugar lumps no wonder things werent working properly get the sugar lumps right and everything else would work out that made sense he turned and his eye caught the huge accusing heap of paperwork in the corner and the empty fireplace too that was what officering was all about wasnt it making decisions lanceconstable visit walked dejectedly back down to the main office which had filled up for a watch change everyone was clustered around one of the desks on which lay looking slightly muddy the scone of stone constable thighbiter found it in zephire street just lying there said sergeant stronginthearm the thief mustve got scared a long way from the museum though said reg shoe why lug it all the way across the city and leave it in a posh part of town where someones bound to trip over it oh woe is me for i am undone said constable visit who felt he was playing a poor second fiddle to what he would call if he had no use for his legs a pagan image could be draughty said corporal nobbs a man of little sympathy i mean i have been reduced to lanceconstable said visit what why said sergeant stronginthearm im not sure said visit that just about does it said the dwarf he sacked three of the officers up at dolly sisters yesterday well im not waiting for it to happen to me im off to sto lat theyre always looking for trained watchmen im a sergeant i could name my price but look vimesy used to say that sort of thing too i heard him said nobby yeah but that was different how that was mister vimes said stronginthearm remember that riot in easy street last year bloke came after me with a club when i was on the ground and mister vimes caught it on his arm and punched the man right in the head yeah said constable hacknee another dwarf when your backs against the wall mister vimes is right behind you but old fred you all know old fred colon boys nobby wheedled taking a kettle off the office stove and pouring the boiling water into a teapot he knows coppering inside and out his kind of coppering yeah said hacknee i mean hes been a copper longer than anyone in the watch said nobby one of the dwarfs said something in dwarfish there were a few smiles from the shorter watchmen what was that said nobby well roughly translated said stronginthearm my bum has been a bum for a very long time but i dont have to listen to anything it says he fined me half a dollar for mumping said hacknee fred colon he practically goes on patrol with a shopping bag and all i had was a free pint at the bunch of grapes and i found out that posh wally is suddenly flashing a lot of money lately thats worth knowing i remember going out on patrol with fred colon when i started and you could practically see him tucking his napkin under his chin whenever we walked past a cafe oh no sergeant colon wouldnt dream of seeing you pay they used to lay the table when they saw him turn the corner everyone does it said stronginthearm captain carrot never did said nobby captain carrot was special but what am i supposed to do with this said visit waving the inkspeckled message mister vimes wants some information urgently he says stronginthearm took the paper and read it well this shouldnt be hard he said old wussie staid in kicklebury street was a janitor there for years and he owes me a favour if were going to send a clacks to mister vimes then we ought to tell him about the scone and sonky said reg shoe you know he left a message about that ive done a report why hes hundreds of miles away id just feel happier if he knew said reg cos it worries me what good will it do sending it to him then because then itll worry him and i can stop worrying said reg corporal nobbs he listens at the door ill swear he does said stronginthearm im off coming captain shouted nobby he pulled open the bottom drawer of his battered and stained desk and took out a packet of chocolate biscuits some of which he arranged daintily on a plate does me no good at all to see you acting like this stronginthearm went on winking at the other dwarfs youve got it in you to be a really bad copper nobby breaks my heart to see you throwin it all away to become a really bad waitress ha ha ha said nobby just you wait thats all im saying he raised his voice coming right now captain there was a sharp smell of burned paper in the captains room when nobby entered nothing cheers up the day like a good fire i always say he said putting the tray on the desk but captain colon wasnt paying any attention hed removed the sugar bowl from the locked drawer of his desk and had laid the cubes out in rows do you see anything wrong with these lumps corporal he said quietly well theyre a bit manky where youve been handling them every theres thirtyseven corporal sorry about that captain visit mustve pinched them when he was in here he mustve used some fancy foreign trick they can do that you know climb ropes and disappear up the top of em that sort of thing did he have a rope said nobby are you making fun of me corporal nobby saluted nossir maybe it was a invisible one sir after all if they can disappear up a rope they can make the rope disappear too obviously good thinking corporal on the subject of thinking sir said nobby plunging in have you had time in your busy schedule to give some thought to the promotion of the new sergeant i have as a matter of fact put that very thing in hand corporal good sir ive borne in mind everything you said and the choice was starin me in the face yessir said nobby sticking out his chest and saluting i just hope it dont cause loss of morals it can do that when people are promoted so if theres any trouble like that i want the sugarstealing person reported to me right away understand yessir nobbys feet had almost left the ground and i shall rely on you corporal to let me know if sergeant flint has any trouble sergeant flint said nobby in a little voice i know hes a troll but i wont have it said im an unfair man sergeant flint i knows i can rely on you corporal sergeant flint that will be all ive got to go and see his lordship in an hour and i want some time to think thats what my job is thinking sergeant flint yes i should go and report to him if i was you white chicken feathers were scattered across the field the farmer stood at the door of his henhouse shaking his head he glanced up as a horseman approached good morrow sir are you experiencing trouble the farmer opened his mouth for a witty or at least snappy response but something stopped him perhaps it was the sword the horseman had slung across his back perhaps it was the mans faint smile the smile was somehow more frightening er somethins been at my fowls he ventured fox i reckon wolf i suspect said the rider the man opened his mouth to say dont be daft we dont get wolves down here this time of the year but again the confident smile made him hesitate got many hens did they six said the farmer and they got in by well thats the strange th here keep that dog away a small mongrel had leapt down from the saddle and was sniffing around the henhouses he wont be any trouble said the rider i shouldnt push your luck mate hes in a funny mood said a voice behind the farmer he turned around quickly the dog looked up at him innocently everyone knew that dogs didnt talk woof bark whine it said hes highly trained said the rider yeah right said the voice behind the farmer he felt an overpowering desire to see the back of the horseman the smile was getting on his nerves and now he was hearing things i cant see how they got in he said the doors latched and wolves dont usually leave payment right said the rider how the hell did you know that well several reasons sir but i couldnt help noticing that you clenched your fist tightly as soon as you heard me and i surmise therefore that you found let me see three dollars left in the chicken house three dollars would buy six fine birds in ankhmorpork the man opened his fist wordlessly the coins glinted in the sunlight but but i sells em at the gate for tenpence he wailed they only had to arsk probably didnt want to bother you said the horseman since i am here sir i would be grateful if you could sell me a chicken behind the farmer the dog said woof woof two chickens and i will not trespass further upon your time woof woof woof three chickens said the rider wearily and if you have them dressed and cooked while i tend to my horse i will gladly pay a dollar each woof woof without garlic or any seasoning on two of the chickens please said the rider the farmer nodded wordlessly a dollar a chicken wasnt chickenfeed you didnt turn up your nose at an offer like that but most importantly you didnt disobey a man with that faint little smile on his face it didnt seem to move or change as smiles went you wanted this one to go as far away as possible he hurried off to the yard that held his best fowls reached down to select the fattest and paused a man who was mad enough to pay a dollar for a good chicken might be quite content with just a reasonable chicken after all he stood up only the best mister he spun around there was no one except the little scruffy dog which had followed him and was now raising a cloud of dust as it scratched itself woof it said he threw a stone at it and it trotted off then he selected three of the very best chickens carrot was lying down under a tree trying to make his head comfortable on a saddlebag did you see where shed almost rubbed out her footprints in the dust said gaspode yes said carrot closing his eyes does she always pay for chickens yes whys carrot turned over because animals dont gaspode looked at the back of carrots head on the whole he enjoyed the unusual gift of speech but something about the reddening of carrots ears told him that this was the time to employ the even rarer gift of silence he settled down in the pose he almost unconsciously categorized as faithful companion keeping watch got bored scratched himself absentmindedly curled up in the pose known as faithful companion curled up with his nose pressed on his bottom and fell asleep he awoke shortly afterwards to the sound of voices there was also a faint smell of roast chicken coming from the direction of the farmhouse gaspode rolled over and saw the farmer talking to another man on a cart he listened for a moment and then sat up locked in a metaphysical conundrum finally he woke carrot by licking his ear one that no other creature in the world would ever adopt fzwl what you got to promise to collect the roast chicken first all right said gaspode urgently what carrot sat up get the chickens and then we gotta go right you gotta promise all right all right i promise whats happening you ever heard of a town called scant cullot i think its about ten miles from here one of mister farmers neighbours has just told him that theyve caught a wolf there killed it no no no but the wolfhunters theres wolfhunters in these parts see cos of the sheep up on the hills and they have to train their dogs first remember you promised about the chickens at precisely eleven oclock there was a smart rap on lord vetinaris door the patrician gave the woodwork a puzzled frown at last he said come fred colon entered with difficulty vetinari watched him for a few moments until pity overcame even him acting captain it is not necessary to remain to attention at all times he said kindly you are allowed to unbend enough for the satisfactory manipulation of a doorknob yes sah lord vetinari raised a hand to his ear protectively you may be seated yes sah you may be quieter too yes sah lord vetinari retreated to the protection of his desk may i commend you on the gleam of your armour acting captain spit and polish sah no substitute for it sah sweat was streaming down colons face oh good clearly you have been purchasing extra supplies of spit now then let me see lord vetinari drew a sheet of paper from one of the small stacks in front of him now then acti sah to be sure i have here another complaint of overenthusiastic clamping im sure you know to what i refer it was causing serious traffic congestion sah quite so it is well known for it but it is in fact the opera house sah the owner feels that big yellow clamps at each corner detract from what i might call the tone of the building and of course they do prevent him from driving it away sah indeed i think that this is a case where discretion might be advisable acting captain got to make an example to the others sah ah yes the patrician held another piece of paper delicately between thumb and forefinger as though it was some rare and strange creature the others being let me see if i can recall some things do stick in the mind so ah yes three other buildings six fountains three statues and the gibbet in nonesuch street oh and my own palace i fully understand youre parked on business sah lord vetinari paused he found it difficult to talk to frederick colon he dealt on a daily basis with people who treated conversation as a complex game and with colon he had to keep on adjusting his mind in case he overshot pursuing the business of your recent career with i have to admit some considerable and growing fascination i am moved to ask you why the watch now appears to have a staff of twenty sah you had around sixty a little while ago im sure colon mopped his face cutting out the dead wood sah making the watch leaner an fitter sah i see the number of internal disciplinary charges you have laid against your men and here the patrician picked up a much thicker document seems somewhat excessive i see no fewer than one hundred and seventythree offences of eyeballing earlobing and nostrilling for example sah nostrilling acting captain sah oh and i see ah yes one charge of making his arm fall off in an insubordinate way laid against constable shoe commander vimes has always given me glowing reports about this officer oles a nasty piece of work sah you cant trust the dead ones nor it would seem most of the live ones sah colon leaned forward his face twisted in a ghastly grimace of conspiratoriality between you and me sir commander vimes was a good deal too soft on them he let them get away with too much no sugar is safe sah vetinaris eyes narrowed but the telescopes on planet colon were far too unsophisticated to detect his mood i certainly recall him mentioning a couple of officers whose timekeeping demeanour and allround uselessness were a dreadful example to the rest of the men said the patrician theres my point said colon triumphantly one bad apple ruins the whole barrel i think theres only a basket now said the patrician a punnet possibly dont you worry about a thing your lordship ill turn things around ill soon get them smartened up i am sure you have it in you to surprise me even further said vetinari leaning back i shall definitely keep my eye on you as the man to watch and now acting captain do you have anything else to report all nice and quiet sah i would that it was said vetinari i was just wondering if there was anything going on involving any person in this city called he looked down at another sheet of paper sonky captain colon almost swallowed his tongue minor matter sah he managed so sonky is alive er found dead sah murdered sah dear me many people would not consider that a minor matter acting captain sonky for one well sah not everyone agrees with what he does sah are we by any chance talking about wallace sonky the manufacturer of rubber goods sah boots and gloves seem noncontroversial to me acting captain its er the other stuff sah colon coughed nervously he makes them rubber wallies sah ah the preventatives lot of people dont agree with that sort of thing sah so i understand colon drew himself up to attention again not natural in my view sah not in favour of unnatural things vetinari looked perplexed you mean you eat your meat raw and sleep in a tree sah oh nothing nothing someone in uberwald seems to be taking an interest in him lately and now hes dead i would not dream of telling the watch their job of course he watched colon carefully to see if this had sunk in i said that it is entirely up to you to choose what to investigate in this bustling city he prompted colon was lost in unfamiliar country without a map thank you sah he barked vetinari sighed and now acting captain im sure theres much that needs your attention sah ive got plans to i meant do not let me detain you oh thats all right sir ive got plenty of time goodbye acting captain colon out in the anteroom fred colon stood very still for a while until his heartbeat wound down from a whine to at least a purr it had on the whole gone quite well very well amazingly well really his lordship had practically taken him into his confidence hed called him a man to watch fred wondered why hed been so scared of officering all these years there was nothing to it really once you got the bull between your teeth if only hed started years ago of course he wouldnt hear a word said about mr vimes who should certainly be looking after himself in those dangerous foreign parts but well fred colon had been a sergeant when sam vimes was a rookie hadnt he it was only his natral deference thatd held him back all these years when sam vimes came back and with the patrician there to put in a good word for him fred colon would definitely be on the promotion ladder only to full captain of course he thought as he strutted down the stairs with great care because strutting is usually impossible while walking downwards he wouldnt want to outrank captain carrot that would be wrong this fact shows that however crazed with power someone may be a tiny instinct for selfpreservation always remains he got the chickens first thought gaspode winding his way through the legs of the crowd amazin they hadnt stopped to eat them though gaspode had been stuffed into the other saddlebag and would not like to have to go through ten miles like that again especially so close to the smell of roast chicken it looked as though there was a market going on and the wolfbaiting had been saved as a sort of closing ceremony hurdles had been arranged in a rough circle men were holding the collars of dogs big heavy unpleasantlooking dogs which were already wild with excitement and deranged stupidity there was a coop by the hurdles gaspode made his way to it and peered through the wooden bars at the heap of matted grey fur in the shadows looks like youre in a spot of strife friend he said contrary to legend and there are so many legends about wolves although mostly they are legends about the way men think about wolves a trapped wolf is more likely to whine and fawn than go wild with rage but this one must have felt it had nothing to lose foamflecked jaws snapped at the bars wheres the rest of your pack then said gaspode no pack shorty ah a lone wolf eh the worst kind gaspode thought roast chicken isnt worth this he muttered out loud he growled you seen any other wolves around here yes good you want to get out of here alive ill kill them a right right but theres dozens of em see you wont stand a chance theyll tear you to bits dogsre a lot nastier than wolves in the shade the eyes narrowed whyre you telling me dog cos im here to help you see you do what i tell you you could be out of here in half an hour otherwise youre a rug on someones floor tomorrow your choice ocourse there might not be enough of you left to make a rug the wolf listened to the baying of the dogs there was no mistaking their intent what did you have in mind it said a few minutes later the crowd was gently nudged aside as carrot edged his horse towards the pen the hubbub died a sword on a horse always commands respect the rider is often a mere courtesy detail but in this case it was not so the watch had put the final swell and polish on carrots muscles and there was that faint smile it was the sort you backed away from good day who is in charge here he said there was a certain amount of comparison of status and a man cautiously raised his hand im the deputy mayor yhonour he said and what is this event wem about to bait a wolf yhonour really i myself own a wolfhound of unusual strength and prowess may i test it against the creature there was more mumbling among the bystanders the general consensus being why not anyway there was that smile go ahead yhonour said the deputy mayor carrot stuck his fingers in his mouth and whistled the townspeople watched in astonishment as gaspode walked out from between their legs and sat down then the laughter started it died away after a while because the faint smile didnt is there a problem said carrot itll get torn limb from limb well do you care what happens to a wolf laughter broke out again the deputy mayor had a feeling he was being got at its your dog mister he said shrugging the little dog barked and to make it interesting well wager a pound of steak said carrot the dog barked again two pounds of steak carrot corrected himself oh i reckon its going to be interesting enough as it is said the deputy mayor the smile was beginning to prey on his nerves all right boys fetch the wolf the creature was dragged into the ring of hurdles slavering and snarling no dont tie it up said carrot as a man went to wrap the halter around a post itll get away if we dont it wont have a chance believe me they looked at the smile dragged the muzzle from the wolf and leapt to safety now just in case you were havin second thoughts about our agreement said gaspode to the wolf i suggest you look at the face of the bloke on the horse right the wolf glanced up it saw the wolverine smile on the face of the rider gaspode barked the wolf yelped and rolled over the crowd waited and then is that it yes thats how it normally goes said carrot its a special bark you see all the blood in the victim congeals in an instant out of sheer terror it hasnt even worried the body what said carrot would be the point of that he got down from the horse pushed his way into the ring picked up the body of the wolf and flung it across the saddle it grunted i heard it someone began that was probably air being expressed from the corpse said carrot the smile still hadnt gone and at that point it suggested very subtly that carrot had heard the last gasp of hundreds of corpses yeah thats right said a voice in the crowd everyone knows that and now what about the steak for the brave little doggie the people looked around to see who had said this none of them looked down because dogs cant talk we can forgo the steak said carrot mounting up no w no you cant said the voice a deals a deal who was risking their life here thats what id like to know come gaspode said carrot whining and grumbling the little dog emerged from the crowd and trailed after the horse it wasnt until they were at the edge of the town square that one of the people said oi what the hell happened there and the spell broke but by then both horse and dog were travelling really really fast vimes hated and despised the privileges of rank but they had this to be said for them at least they meant that you could hate and despise them in comfort willikins would arrive at an inn an hour before vimess coach and with an arrogance that vimes would never dare employ take over several rooms and install vimess own cook in the kitchen vimes complained about this to inigo but you see your grace youre not here as an individual but as ankhmorpork when people look at you they see the city mhm mhm they do should i stop washing that is very droll sir but you see sir you and the city are one mhm mhm if you are insulted ankhmorpork is insulted if you befriend ankhmorpork befriends really what happens when i go to the lavatory thats up to you sir mmhm mmph at breakfast next morning vimes sliced the top off a boiled egg thinking this is ankhmorpork slicing the top off a boiled egg if i cut my toast into soldiers were probably at war corporal littlebottom entered carefully and saluted your message came back sir she said handing him a scrap of paper from sergeant stronginthearm ive deciphered it for you er the scone from the museums been found sir well thats the other shoe dropped said vimes i was worried there for a moment er in fact constable shoe is bothered about it said cheery its a bit hard to follow what he says but he seems to think someone made a copy of it what a fake of a fake what goods that i really couldnt say sir your other surmise was correct vimes glanced at the paper hah thanks cheery well be down shortly youre humming sam said sybil after a while that means something awful is going to happen to somebody wonderful thing technology said vimes buttering a slice of toast i can see it has its uses and when you grin in that shiny sort of way it means that someones playing silly buggers and doesnt know youve just thrown a six i dont know what you mean dear its probably the country air agreeing with me lady sybil put down her teacup sam yes dear this is probably not the best time to mention it but you know i told you i went to see old mrs content well she says there was another knock at the door lady sybil sighed this time it was inigo who entered we should be leaving your grace if you dont mind i would like us to be at slake by lunchtime and through the pass at wilinus before dark mhm mhm do we have to rush so sighed sybil the pass is slightly dangerous said inigo somewhat lawless mhm mhm only somewhat said vimes i will just feel happier when it is behind us said inigo it would be a good idea if the second coach follows us closely and your men stay alert your grace they teach you tactics in lord vetinaris political office do they inigo said vimes just common sense mhm mhm sir why dont we wait until tomorrow before attempting the pass with respect your grace i suggest not for one thing the weather is worsening and im sure were being watched we must demonstrate that there is no yellow in the ankhmorpork flag mhm mhm there is said vimes its on the owl and the collars of the hippos i mean said inigo that the colours of ankhmorpork do not run only since we got the new dyes said vimes all right all right i know what you mean but look im not risking the servants if theres any danger and theres to be no arguing understand they can stay here and take the mail coach tomorrow no one attacks the mail coaches any more i suggest lady sybil remains here too sir mhm absolutely not said sybil i wouldnt hear of it if its not too dangerous for sam its not too dangerous for me i wouldnt argue with her if i was you said vimes to inigo i really wouldnt the wolf was not very happy about being tethered to a tree but as gaspode said never trust nobody theyd paused a while in a wood about five miles from the town itd be a brief stop carrot had said some of the people in the square looked the sort who treasured their lack of a sense of humour after some barking and growling gaspode said you got to understand that matey here is persnally non gratis in local wolf society being a bit of ahaha lone wolf yes carrot was taking the roast chickens out of their sack gaspodes eyes fixed on them but he hears the howlin at night ah wolves communicate basicly your wolf howl is just another way of pissin against a tree to say its your damn tree but theres always bits of news too something pastys happenin in uberwald he doesnt know what gaspode lowered his voice between you and me our friend here was well behind the door when the brains was handed out if wolves was people hed be like foul ole ron whats his name said carrot thoughtfully gaspode gave carrot a look who cared what a wolf was called wolf names is difficult he said more like a description see its not like callin yourself mr snuggles or bonzo you understand yes i know so what is his name you want to know what his name is then yes gaspode so in fact its the name of this wolf you want to know that is correct gaspode shifted uneasily arsehole he said oh to the dogs frank astonishment carrot blushed thats basicly a summary but its a pretty good translation he said i wouldnt have mentioned it but you did ask gaspode stopped and whined for a moment trying to convey the message that he was losing his voice due to lack of chicken er theres been a lot on the howl about angua he went on when carrot seemed unable to take the hint er they think shes bad news why shes travelling as a wolf after all wolves hate werewolves what that cant be right when shes wolfshaped shes just like a wolf so when shes humanshaped shes just like a human and whats that got to do with anything humans dont like werewolves wolves dont like werewolves people dont like wolves that can think like people an people dont like people who can act like wolves which just shows you that people are the same everywhere said gaspode he assessed this sentence and added even when theyre wolves i never thought of it like that and she smells wrong wolves are very sensitive to that sort of thing tell me more about the howl oh its like the clacky thing news gets spread for hundreds of miles do the howls mention her companion no if you like ill ask ars id prefer a different name if its all the same to you said carrot words like that arent clever gaspode rolled his eyes theres nothing wrong with the word among us pedestically gifted species he said were very smelloriented he sighed how about bum in the sense of er migratory worker hes a freelance chicken throttler style of frog he turned to the wolf and spoke in canine now then bum this human is insane and believe me i know a mad human when i see one hes frothing at the mouth inside and hell rip your hide off and nail it to a tree if you arent straight with us understand well they were the same right everyone knew that sooo said a treacherous inner voice maybe it wasnt exactly gaspode and carrot in trouble maybe it was only carrot yeah right on brothers let us join together in wild runs in the moonlight but first let us eat this monkey on the other paw hed got hard pad soft pad the swinge licky end scroff mange and something rather strange on the back of his neck that he couldnt quite reach gaspode somehow couldnt imagine the wolves saying hey hes one of us besides while hed begged fought tricked and stolen hed never actually been a bad dog you needed to be a moderately good theological disputant to accept this especially since a fair number of sausages and prime cuts had disappeared from butchers slabs in a blur of grey and a lingering odour of lavatory carpet but nevertheless gaspode was clear in his own mind that hed never crossed the boundary from merely being a naughty boy hed never bitten a hand that fed him hed never done it on the carpet hed never shirked a duty it was a bugger but there you were it was a dog thing he whined when the ring of dark shapes closed in eyes gleamed he whined again and then growled as unseen fanged death surrounded him after all this made it so much harder for the hand to feed you tomorrow this was clearly impressing no one not even gaspode he wagged his tail nervously just passin through he said in a strangulatedly cheerful voice no trouble to anyone there was a definite feeling that the shadows beyond the snowflakes were getting more crowded so have you had your holidays yet he squeaked this also did not appear to be well received well this was it then famous last stand plucky dog defends his master what a good dog shame thered be no one left to tell anyone he barked mine mine and leapt snarling towards the nearest shape a huge paw swatted him out of the air and then pinned him down spreadeagled in the snow he looked up past white fangs and a long muzzle into eyes that seemed familiar hmine growled the wolf it was angua the coaches slowed to a walk on a road that was rough with potholes under the unbroken snow every one a wheelbreaking trap in the dark vimes nodded to himself when he saw lights flickering beside the road a few miles into the pass on either side old landslides had formed banks of scree down which the forests had spilled he dropped quietly off the back of the coach and vanished into the shadows the leading coach stopped at a log which had been dropped across the road there was some movement and then the driver swung himself down into the mud and set off at a dead run back down the pass figures moved out of the trees one of them stopped at the door of the first coach and tried the handle for a moment the world held its breath the figures must have sensed it because the man was already leaping aside when there was a click and the whole door and its surrounding frame blew outwards in a cloud of splinters the thing about fires vimes had once observed was that only an idiot got between them and a troll holding a ooolb crossbow all hell hadnt been let loose it was merely detritus but from a few feet away you couldnt tell the difference another figure reached for the door of the second coach just before vimes fired out of the darkness and hit his shoulder with a butchers sound then inigo dived out through the window rolled with unclerklike grace as he hit the ground rose in front of one of the bandits and brought his hand around edge first on the mans neck vimes had seen this trick before usually it just made people angry occasionally it managed an incapacitating blow hed never seen it remove a head everybody stop sybil was pushed out of the coach behind her a man stepped out he was holding a crossbow your grace vimes he shouted the word bounced back and forth between the cliffs i know youre here your grace vimes and here is your lady and there are many of us come out your grace vimes flakes of snow hissed over the fires there was a whisper in the air followed by a second smack of steel into muscle one of the hooded figures collapsed into the mud clutching at its leg inigo got slowly to his feet the man holding the crossbow appeared not to notice it is like chess your grace vimes we have disarmed the troll and the dwarf and i have the queen and if you shoot at me can you be sure i wont have time to fire firelight glowed on the twisted trees bordering the road several seconds passed then the sound of vimess crossbow landing in the circle of light was very loud well done your grace vimes and now yourself if you please inigo made out the shape that appeared at the very edge of the light with both hands up are you all right sybil said vimes a bit cold sam youre not hurt no sam keep your hands where i can see them your grace vimes and are you going to promise me youll let her go said vimes a flame flickered near vimess face a bright pool in the darkness as he lit a cigar now your grace vimes whyever should i do that but i am sure ankhmorpork will pay a lot for you ah i thought so said vimes he shook the match out and the cigar end glowed for a moment sybil yes sam duck there was a second filled only with the indrawing of breath and then as lady sybil dived forward vimess hand came around from behind him in an arc there was a silken sound and the mans head was flung back inigo leapt and caught the mans crossbow as it was dropped then rolled and came up firing another figure staggered vimes was aware of a commotion elsewhere as he grabbed sybil and helped her back into the coach inigo had vanished but a scream in the dark didnt sound like anyone vimes knew and then only the hiss of snow in the fire i think theyre gone sir said cheerys voice not as fast as us detritus sir are you okay feelin very tactful sir you two take that coach ill take this and lets get the hell out of here shall we wheres mister skimmer said sybil there was another scream from the woods forget him but hes forget him the snow was falling thicker as they climbed the pass the deep snow dragged at the wheels and all vimes could see were the darker shapes of the horses against the whiteness then the clouds parted briefly and he wished they hadnt because here they revealed that the darkness on the left of him was no longer rock but a sheer drop at the top of the pass the lights of an inn glowed out on to the thickening snow vimes drove the carriage into the yard detritus sir ill watch our backs make sure this place is okay will you yessir the troll jumped down slotting a fresh bundle of arrows into the piecemaker vimes spotted his intention just in time just knock sergeant right you are sir the troll knocked and entered the buzz of sound from inside suddenly ceased vimes heard muffled by the door der duke of ankhmorpork is coming in anyone have a problem wid dis just say der word and in the background the little humming singing noise the piecemaker made under tension vimes helped sybil down from the coach how do you feel now he said she smiled faintly i think this dress will have to go for dusters she said she smiled a little more when she saw his expression i knew youd come up with something sam you go all slow and cold and that means something really dreadfuls going to happen i wasnt frightened really i was scared shi stiff said vimes what happened to mister skimmer i remember him rummaging in his case and cursing i suspect inigo skimmer is alive and well said vimes grimly which is more than can be said for those around him there was silence in the main room of the inn a man and a woman presumably the landlord and his wife were standing flat against the back of the bar the dozen or so other occupants lined the walls hands in the air beer dribbled from a couple of spilled mugs everyting normal an peaceful said detritus turning round vimes realized that everyone was staring at him he looked down his shirt was torn mud and blood caked his clothes melted snow dripped off him in his right hand unregarded he was still holding his crossbow bit of trouble on the road he said er you know how it is no one moved oh good gods detritus put that damn thing down will you right sir the troll lowered his crossbow two dozen people all began to breathe again then the skinny woman stepped around from behind the bar nodded at vimes carefully took lady sybils hand from his and pointed towards the wide wooden stairs the black look she gave vimes puzzled him only then did he realize that lady sybil was shaking tears were running down her face and er my wife is a bit shaken up he said weakly corporal littlebottom he yelled to cover his confusion cheery stepped through the doorway go with lady syb he stopped because of the rising hubbub one or two people pointed someone laughed cheery stopped looking down whats up vimes hissed er its me sir ankhmorpork dwarf fashions havent really caught on here sir said cheery the skirt said vimes yes sir vimes looked around at the faces they seemed more shocked than angry although he spotted a couple of dwarfs in one corner who were definitely unhappy go with lady sybil he repeated it might not be a very good id cheery began gods damn it shouted vimes unable to stop himself the crowd went silent a ragged bloodstained madman holding a crossbow can command a rapt audience then he shuddered what he wanted now was a bed but what he wanted before bed more than anything was a drink and he couldnt have one hed learned that long ago one drink was one too many all right tell me he said all dwarfs are men sir said cheery i mean traditionally thats how everyone thinks of it up here well stand outside the door or or shut your eyes or something okay vimes lifted lady sybils chin are you all right dear he said sorry to let you down sam she whispered it was just so awful vimes designed by nature to be one of those men unable to kiss their own wives in public patted her helplessly on the shoulder she thought shed let him down it was unbearable you just i mean cheery will and ill sort things out and be along right away he said well get a good bedroom i suspect she nodded still looking down and im just going out for some fresh air vimes stepped outside the snow had stopped for now the moon was half hidden by clouds and the air smelled of frost when the figure dropped down from the eaves it was amazed at the way vimes spun and rushed it bodily against the wall vimes looked through a red mist at the moonlit face of inigo skimmer ill damn well he began look down your grace said skimmer mhm mhm vimesrealized he could feel the faintest prick of a knife blade on his stomach look down further he said inigo looked down he swallowed vimes had a knife too you really are no gentleman then he said make a sudden move and neither are you said vimes and now it appears that we have reached what sergeant colon persists in referring to as an imp arse i assure you i will not kill you said inigo i know that said vimes but will you try no im here for your protection mhm mhm vetinari sent you did he you know we never divulge the name of thats true you people are very honourable vimes spat the word in that respect both men relaxed a little you left me alone surrounded by enemies said inigo but without much accusation in his tone why should i care what happens to a bunch of bandits said vimes youre an assassin how did you find out mmph a copper watches the way people walk the klatchians say a mans leg is his second face did you know that and that little clerky imsoharmless walk of yours is too good to be true you mean that just from my walk you no you didnt catch the orange said vimes come now no people either catch or flinch you saw it wasnt a danger and when i took your arm i felt metal under your clothes then i just sent a clacks back with your description he let go of inigo and walked over to the coach leaving his back exposed he took something down from the box and came back and waved it at the man i know this is yours he said i pinched it out of your luggage if i ever catch anyone with one of these in ankhmorpork i will make their life a complete misery as only a copper knows how is that understood if you ever catch anyone with one of these in ankhmorpork your grace mhm they will still be lucky that the assassins guild didnt find them first mmph they are on our forbidden list within the city but were a long way from ankhmorpork now mmph mmph vimes turned the thing over and over in his hands it looked vaguely like a longhandled hammer or perhaps a strangely made telescope what it was basically was a spring thats all a crossbow was after all its a devil to load he said i nearly ruptured myself cocking it against a rock youd only get one shot but its the shot no one expects mhm mhm vimes nodded you could even conceal this thing down your pants although the thought of all that coiled power so close would require nerves of steel and other parts of steel too if it came to it this is not a weapon this is for killing people he said uh most weapons are said inigo no theyre not theyre so you dont have to kill people theyre for for having for being seen for warning this isnt one of those its for hiding away until you bring it out and kill people in the dark and wheres that other thing your grace the palm dagger dont try to lie to me inigo shrugged the movement shot something silver out of his sleeve it was a carefully shaped blade padded on one side which slid along the edge of his hand there was a click from somewhere inside his jacket good gods breathed vimes do you know how often people have tried to assassinate me man yes your grace nine times the guild has set your fee at the last time an approach was made no guild member volunteered mhm mhm hah incidentally and very informally of course we would appreciate knowing the whereabouts of the body of the honourable eustace bassinglygore mhm mhm vimes scratched his nose was he the one who tried to poison my shaving cream yes your grace well unless his body is an extremely strong swimmer its still on a ship bound for ghat via cape terror said vimes i paid the captain a thousand dollars not to take the chains off before zambingo too thatll give it a nice long walk home through the jungles of klatch where im sure its knowledge of rare poisons will come in very handy although not as handy perhaps as a knowledge of antidotes a thousand dollars well he had twelve hundred dollars on him i donated the rest to the sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons i got a receipt by the way you chaps are keen on receipts i think you stole his money mhm mhm vimes took a deep breath his voice when it emerged was flat calm i wasnt going to waste any of my own and he had just tried to kill me think of it as an investment for the good of his health of course if in due course he cares to come and see me i shall make sure he gets whats coming to him im astounded your grace mhm mhm bassinglygore was an extremely competent swordsman really i generally never wait to find out about that sort of thing inigo smiled his thin little smile and two months ago sir richard liddleley was found tied to a fountain in sator square painted pink and with a flag stuck i was feeling generous said vimes im sorry i dont play your games assassination is not a game your grace it is the way you people play it there have to be rules otherwise there would just be anarchy mhm mhm you have your code and we have ours and youve been sent here to protect me i have other skills but yes what makes you think ill need you well your grace here they dont have rules mhm mhm ive spent most of my life dealing with people who dont have rules yes of course but when you kill them they dont get up again ive never killed anyone said vimes you shot that bandit in the throat i was aiming for the shoulder yes the thing does pull to the left said inigo you mean that you have never tried to kill anyone i have on the other hand and here hesitation may not be an option mmph i didnt hesitate inigo sighed in the guild your grace we dont grandstand grandstand that business with the cigar you mean when i shut my eyes and they had to look at a flame in the darkness ah inigo hesitated but they might have shot you there and then no i wasnt a threat and you heard his voice i hear that sort of voice a lot hes not going to shoot people too soon and spoil the fun i can assume that you have not got a contract on me that is correct and youd still swear to that on my honour as an assassin yes said vimes thats where i hit a difficulty of course and i dont know how to put this inigo but you dont act like a typical assassin lord this sir that the guild is the school for gentlemen but you and gods know i dont mean any offence here are not exactly inigo touched his forelock scholarship boy sir he said my gods yes thought vimes you can find your average amateur killers on every street theyre mostly deranged or drunk or some poor woman whos had a hard day and the husband has raised his hand once too often and suddenly twenty years of frustration takes over killing a stranger without malice or satisfaction other than the craftsmans pride in a job well done is such a rare talent that armies spend months trying to instil it into their young soldiers most people will shy away from killing people they havent been introduced to the guild had to have one or two people like inigo didnt some philosophical bastard once say that a government needed butchers as well as shepherds he indicated the little crossbow all right take it he said but you can put the word about that if i ever ever see one on the street the owner will find it put where the sun does not shine ah said inigo thats the amusingly named place in lancre isnt it its only about fifty miles from here i believe mhm mhm rest assured that i can find a shortcut gaspode tried blowing in carrots ear again time to wake up he growled carrot opened his eyes blinked the snow out of them and then tried to move you just lie still right said gaspode if it helps try thinking of them as a very heavy eiderdown carrot struggled feebly the wolves piled on top of him shifted position warming you up a treat said gaspode grinning nervously a wolf blanket see ocourse youre going to be a bit whiffy for a while but better to be itchy than dead eh he scratched an ear industriously with a hind leg one of the wolves growled at him sorry grubll be up in a moment food muttered carrot angua appeared in carrots vision dressed in a leather shirt and leggings she stood looking down at him hands on her hips to gaspodes amazement carrot actually managed to push himself up on his elbows dislodging several wolves you were tracking us he said no they were said angua they thought you were a bloody fool i heard it on the howl and they were right you havent eaten anything for three days and up here winter doesnt drop a few hints over a month or so it turns up in one night why were you so stupid gaspode looked around the clearing angua had rekindled the fire gaspode wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it but actual wolves had dragged in actual fallen wood for her and then another had turned up with a small deer still fat after the autumn he dribbled at the smell of it roasting something human and complicated was going on between carrot and angua it sounded like an argument but it didnt smell like one anyway recent events all made perfect sense to gaspode the female ran away and the male chased her thats how it went actually it was usually about twenty males of all sizes but obviously gaspode conceded things were a bit different for humans pretty soon he reckoned carrot would notice the big male wolf sitting by the fire and then the fur would fly humans eh gaspode wasnt sure of his own ancestry there was some terrier and a touch of spaniel and probably someones leg and an awful lot of mongrel but he took it as an article of faith that there was in all dogs a tiny bit of wolf and his was urgently sending messages that the wolf by the fire was one you didnt even stare directly at it wasnt that the wolf was obviously vicious he didnt need to be even sitting still he radiated the assurance of competent power gaspode was if not the victor then at least the survivor of many a street fight and as such would not have gone against this animal even if backed up by a couple of lions and a man with an axe instead he sidled over to a female wolf who was watching the fire haughtily yo bitch he said vot vas zat gaspode reconsidered his strategy hi foxy er wolf lady he tried a certain lowering of the temperature suggested that this one hadnt worked either ullo miss he said hopefully her muzzle turned to point at him her eyes narrowed vot har you ice slithered off every syllable gaspodes the name barked gaspode with insane cheerfulness m a dog thats a kind of wolf sort of thing so whats your name then go avay no offence meant ere i heard tell wolves mate for life right vell wish could gaspode froze as the shewolfs muzzle snapped an inch from his nose ver i come from ve eat things like you she said fair enough fair enough muttered gaspode backing away i dont know you try to be friendly and this is what you get nearer the fire the humans were getting complicated gaspode slunk back and lay down you could have told me carrot was saying it wouldve taken too long you always want to understand things anyway its none of your business this is family carrot waved a hand towards the wolf hes a relative he said no hes a friend gaspodes ears waggled he thought whoops hes very big for a wolf said carrot slowly as if filing new information hes a very big wolf said angua shrugging another werewolf no just a wolf yes said angua sarcastically just a wolf and his name is he would not object to being called gavin gavin he once ate someone called gavin what all of him of course not just enough to make certain that the man set no more wolf traps angua smiled gavin is quite unusual carrot looked at the wolf and smiled he picked up a piece of wood and tossed it gently towards him the wolf snapped it doglike out of the air im sure well be friends he said angua sighed wait gaspode the unheeded spectator watched as gavin without taking his eyes off carrot very slowly bit the wood in two carrot said angua sweetly dont do that again gavin isnt even in the same clan as these wolves and he took over the pack without anyone even whining hes not a dog and hes a killer carrot oh dont look like that i dont mean he pounces on wandering kids or eats up the odd grandmother i mean that if he thinks a human ought to die that human is dead he will always always fight hes very uncomplicated like that hes an old friend said carrot yes a friend yes angua rolled her eyes and said in a voice of singsong sarcasm i was out in the woods one day and i fell into some old pit trap under the snow and some wolves found me and would have killed me but gavin turned up and faced them down dont ask me why people do things sometimes so do wolves end of story gaspode said wolves and werewolves dont get on said carrot patiently hes right if gavin wasnt here theyd have torn me to pieces i can look like a wolf but im not a wolf im a werewolf im not a human either im a werewolf get it you know some of the remarks people make well wolves dont make remarks they go for the throat wolves have got a very good sense of smell you cant fool it i can pass for human but i cant pass for wolf i never thought of it like that i mean you would just think that wolves and werewolves thats how it is sighed angua you said this was family said carrot as if working down a mental checklist i meant its personal gavin came all the way into ankhmorpork to warn me he even slept on the timber wagons during the day so that hed keep moving can you imagine how much nerve that took its got nothing to do with the watch its got nothing to do with you carrot looked around the snow was falling again turning into rain above the fire im here now go away please i can sort this out and then youll come back to ankhmorpork afterwards i angua hesitated i think i should stay said carrot look the city needs you said angua you know vimes relies on ive resigned for a moment gaspode thought he could hear the sound of every settling snowflake not really yes and what did old stoneface say er nothing hed already left for uberwald vimes is coming to uberwald yes for the coronation hes got mixed up in this said angua mixed up in what oh my familys been stupid im not quite sure i know everything but the wolves are worried when werewolves make trouble its the real wolves that always suffer peoplell kill anything with fur angua stared at the fire for a moment and then said with forced brightness so whos been left in charge i dont know fred colons got seniority ha yes in his nightmares angua hesitated you really left yes oh gaspode listened to some more snowflakes well you wont get far by yourselves now said angua standing up rest for another hour and then well be going through the deep forest not too much snow there yet weve got a lot of ground to cover i hope you can keep up at breakfast early next morning vimes noticed that the other guests were keeping so far away from him that they were holding on to the walls the men who went out came back around midnight sir said cheery quietly did they catch anyone um sort of sir they found seven dead bodies seven they think some others might have got away where theres a path up the rocks but seven detritus got one and i got one and a couple were wounded and inigo got one vimess voice tailed off he stared at inigo skimmer who was sitting on the other side of the room at a crowded public table the places around vimes and lady sybil were deserted sybil had put it down to deference the little man was eating soup in a little neat selfcontained world among the waving arms and intrusive elbows hed even tucked a napkin under his chin they were very dead sir cheery whispered well that was interesting said sybil wiping her mouth delicately ive never had soup with sausages in it for breakfast before what is it called cheery fatsup your ladyship said cheery it means fat soup were close to the schmaltzberg fat layers now and well its nourishing and keeps out the cold how very interesting lady sybil looked at her husband he hadnt taken his eyes off inigo the door opened and detritus ducked inside banging snow off his knuckles its not too bad he said dey say itd be a good idea to make an early start sir i bet they do said vimes and thought they dont want someone like me hanging around theres no knowing wholl die next several faces he vaguely recalled from last night were missing now presumably some travellers had started off even earlier which meant that the news was probably running ahead of him hed staggered in covered in blood and mud carrying a crossbow and dyou know when they went back to look there were seven dead men by the time that sort of story had gone ten miles hed be carrying an axe as well and make that thirty dead men and a dog the diplomatic career had certainly got off to a good start eh as they got into the coach he saw the little dart stuck in the door jamb it was metallic with metal fins and overall had a look of speed as if when you touched it youd burn your fingers he walked around to the back of the coach there was another much larger arrow high in the woodwork they tried to catch up with you on the upgrade said inigo behind him you killed them some got away im surprised ive only got one pair of hands your grace vimes glanced up at the inn sign crudely painted on the boards was a large red head complete with trunk and tusks this is the inn of the fifth elephant said inigo you left the law behind when we passed lancre your grace here its the lore what you keep is what you can whats yours is what you fight for the fittest survive ankhmorpork is pretty lawless too mister skimmer ankhmorpork has many laws its just that people dont obey them and that your grace is quite a different bowl of fat mmhm mmph they set off in convoy detritus sat on the roof of the leading coach which lacked a door and most of one side the view was flat and white a featureless expanse of snow after a while they passed a clacks tower burn marks on one side of the stone base suggested that someone had thought that no news was good news but the semaphore shutters were clacking and twinkling in the light the whole world is watching said vimes but its never cared said skimmer up until now and now it wants to rip the top off the country and take whats underneath mmph mmhm ah thought vimes our killer clerk does have more than one emotion ankhmorpork has always tried to get on well with other nations said sybil well these days at least i dont think we exactly try dear said vimes its just that we found that whyre we stopping he pulled down the window whats happening sergeant waiting for dese dwarfs sir the troll called down several hundred dwarfs four abreast were trotting across the white plain towards them there was vimes thought something very determined about them detritus yessir try not to look too trolllike will you tryin like hell sir the column was abreast of them before someone barked the command to halt a dwarf detached himself from the rest and walked over to the coach ta grdzk he bellowed would you like me to take care of this your grace said inigo im the damn ambassador said vimes he stepped down good morning dwarf am overseer vimes of the look lady sybil heard inigo give a little groan krz grdazak yad hang on hang on i know this one am sure you are a dwarf of no convictions let us shake our business dwarf yes that will just about do it i think said inigo mmph mmhm the senior dwarf had gone red in those areas of his face that could be seen behind the hair the rest of the squad were taking a renewed interest in the coach the leader took a deep breath dkraha cheery dropped down from the coach her leather skirt flapped in the wind as one dwarf the column swivelled to stare at her their leader went popeyed bdan kraa dkraga kaak vimes saw the expression that appeared on cheerys small round face above him there was a clunk as detritus rested the loaded piecemaker on the edge of the coach i know dat word he said to her he announced to the world it is not a good word i do not want to hear dat word again well this is all very jolly mmph mmhm said inigo getting down and now if everyone will just relax for a moment we might get out of here alive mmph vimes reached up and carefully pushed the end of detrituss crossbow towards a less threatening direction inigo talked very fast in what seemed to vimes to be a torrent of perfect dwarfish although he was sure he heard the occasional mmph he opened his leather case and produced a couple of documents fixed with big waxy seals these were inspected with considerable suspicion the dwarf pointed at cheery and detritus inigo flapped a hand impatiently the universal symbol for dismissing that which was not important more papers were examined eventually with more universal body language meaning i could do something bad to you but right now its just too much bother the dwarf waved inigo away gave vimes a look that suggested that against all physical evidence vimes was beneath him and strode back to his troops an order was barked the dwarfs set off again leaving the road and heading off towards the forest well that all seems sorted out said inigo getting back into the coach miss littlebottom was a bit of a sticking point but a dwarf does respect very complicated documents somethings up he wouldnt say what it was he wanted to search the coach the hell with that what for who knows i persuaded him that we have diplomatic immunity and what did you tell him about me i tried to convince him that you were a bloody idiot your grace mmph mmhm oh really vimes heard lady sybil repress a laugh it was necessary believe me street dwarfish wasnt a good idea your grace but when i pointed out that you were an aristocrat he i am not an well im not really a yes your grace but if youll be advised by me a lot of diplomacy lies in appearing to be a lot more stupid than you are youve made a good start your grace and now i think wed better be moving mmhm im glad to see youre being less deferential inigo said vimes as they got under way again oh well your grace ive got to know you better now gaspode had confused recollections of the rest of that night the pack moved fast and he realized that most of them were running ahead of carrot to flatten down the snow it wasnt flat enough for gaspode eventually a wolf picked him up by the scruff of the neck and carried him bodily while making muffled comments about the foul taste the snow stopped after a while and there was a slip of moonlight behind the clouds and all around near and far was the howl occasionally the pack would stop in a clearing or on the crisp white brow of a hill and join in gaspode limped to angua while the cries went up around them whats this for he said polities said angua negotiation were crossing territories gaspode glanced at gavin he hadnt joined in the howl but sat a little way off regally dividing his attention between carrot and the pack he has to ask permission he said he has to make sure theyll let me through oh thats giving him problems none that he cant bite through oh er is the howl saying anything about me small horrible smelly dog ah right they set off again a few minutes later down a long snowcrusted slope in the moonlight towards the forest and gaspode saw shadows angling fast across the snowfield towards them for a moment he was flanked by two packs the old and the new and then their original escort dropped away so weve got a new honour guard he thought as he ran in the centre of a wall of blurred grey legs wolves we havent met before i just hope the howl added doesnt taste nice then carrot fell over in the snow it was a moment before he pushed himself up again the wolves circled uncertainly occasionally glancing at gavin gaspode caught up with carrot jumping awkwardly through the snow you all right hard to run i dont want to you know worry you or anything whined gaspode but were not exactly among friends here know what i mean our gavin isnt going to win the prize for the wolf with the waggiest tail anywhere when did he last sleep angua demanded pushing her way through the wolves dunno really said gaspode weve been moving pretty fast the last few days no sleep no food and no proper clothing snarled angua idiot there was growling and whining from some of the wolves around gavin gaspode sat down by carrots head and watched as angua argued he couldnt speak pure wolf and besides gesture and body language played a far greater part than it did in canine but you didnt have to be bright to see that things werent going well there was defnitely a lot of atmosphere in the atmosphere and gaspode had a feeling that if things went all pearshaped in a hurry one small dog had all the survival chances of a chocolate kettle on a very hot stove there was a lot of whining and growling one wolf gaspode mentally named him awkward was not happy it looked as though a number of wolves were agreeing with him one of them bared its teeth at angua then gavin stood up he shook some snowflakes off his coat looked around in an offhand fashion and padded towards awkward gaspode felt every hair on his body stand on end the other wolves crouched back gavin ignored them when he was a few feet away from awkward he put his head on one side and said hrurrrm it was almost a pleasant noise but right down inside gaspodes bones it bounced a harmonic which said at this point we could go two ways there is the easy way and that is very easy youll never know about the hard way awkward held eyecontact for a while and then looked down gavin snarled something half a dozen of the wolves led by angua loped off towards the forest they returned twenty minutes later angua was human again at least gaspode corrected himself human shaped and the wolves were harnessed to a big dog sled borrowed it from a man in the village over the hill she said as it slid to a halt by carrot nice of him said gaspode and decided not to pursue the subject im surprised to see wolves in harness though well this was the easy way said angua its odd gaspode mused as he lay in the sled alongside the slumbering carrot he was so intrested when bum talked about the howl and how it could send messages right up into the mountains if i was a suspicious dog id wonder if he knew that shed come back for him if he was really in trouble if he decided to gamble everything on it he poked his head out from under the blanket snow stung his eyes running alongside the sled only a few feet away from carrot and glowing silver in the moonlight was gavin this is me thought gaspode stuck between the humans and the wolves its a dogs life this is the life thought acting captain colon hardly any paperwork was coming up here now and by dint of much effort hed entirely cleared the backlog it was a lot quieter too when vimes was here and fred colon suddenly found himself thinking the word vimes without prefixing it with mister the main office was full of so much noise and bustle you could hardly hear yourself speak completely inefficient that was how could anyone hope to get anything done he counted the sugar again twentynine but hed had two in his tea so that was all right toughness was paying off colon went and opened his door a fraction so that he could just see down into the office it was amazing how you could catch them out that way quiet and neat too every desk was clear much better than the mess you used to get he went back to the desk and counted the sugar lumps there were twentyseven ahha someone was trying to drive him mad well two could play at that game he counted the lumps again there were twentysix and there was a knock at the door this caused it to swing inwards and colon to jump up in evil triumph ah ha burst in on me eh oh the oh was because the knocker was constable dorfl the golem he was taller than the doorway and strong enough to tear a troll in half hed never done this since he was an intensely moral being but not even colon was going to pick an argument with someone who had glowing red holes where his eyes should be ordinary golems would riot harm a human because they had magic words in their head that ordered them not to dorfl had no magic words but he didnt harm people because hed decided that it wasnt moral this left the worrying possibility that given enough provocation he might think again beside the golem was constable shoe saluting smartly weve come to pick up the wages chitty sir he said the what the wages chitty sir the monthly chitty sir and then we take it to the palace and bring back the wages sir i dont know anything about that i put it on your desk yesterday sir signed by lord vetinari sir colon couldnt hide the flicker in his eyes the black ash in the fireplace was by now overflowing shoe followed his gaze i havent seen any such thing said colon while the colour drained from his face like a sucked icelolly im sure i did sir said constable shoe i wouldnt forget a thing like that sir in fact i distinctly remember saying to constable visit washpot im just going to take this look you can see im a busy man snapped colon get one of the sergeants to sort it out theres no sergeants left except sergeant flint sir and he spends all his time going round asking people what he should be doing said constable shoe anyway sir its the senior officer who must sign the chitty colon stood up leaning on his knuckles and shouted oh i must must i thats a nerve and no mistake must eh most of you lot are lucky anyone even gives you a job bunch of zombies and loonies and lawn ornaments and rocks ive had it up to here with you shoe leaned back out of range of the spittle then im afraid i must take this up with the guild of watchmen sir he said guild of watchmen hah and since when has there been a guild of watchmen dunno whats the time now said corporal nobbs ambling into the room got to be a couple of hours at least morning captain what are you doing here nobby thats mister nobbs to you captain and im president of the guild of watchmen since you ask theres no such bloody thing all legit captain registered at the palace and everything amazin how people rushed to join too he pulled out his grubby notebook got a few matters to take up with you if you have a moment well i say a few im not putting up with this bellowed colon his face crimson this is high treason youre all sacked youre all were all on strike said nobby calmly you cant go on strike while im sacking you our strike headquarters are in the back room of the bucket in gleam street said nobby here thats my boozer i forbid you to go on strike in my own pub well be there when you wish to talk terms come brothers we are now officially in a dispute situation they marched out dont bother to come back colon shouted after them bonk wasnt what vimes had expected in fact hed find it hard to say what he had expected except that this wasnt it it occupied a narrow valley with a whitewater river winding through it there were city walls they were not like those of ankhmorpork which had become at first a barrier to expansion and then a source of masonry for it these had an inside and an outside there were castles on the hills there were castles on most hills in these parts and there were high gates across the road detritus thumped on the side of the coach vimes stuck his head out deres guys in der road said the troll dey got halibuts vimes looked out of the windows there were half a dozen guards and they did indeed have halberds what are they after he said i expect theyll also want to see our papers and make a search of the coaches said inigo papers are one thing said vimes getting out of the coach but no one is rummaging in our stuff i know that trick theyre not looking for anything they just want to show us whos boss you come along and do the translating he added dont worry ill be diplomatic the two men barring the way did have helmets and they were holding weapons but their uniforms did not conform to normal uniformity no guards vimes thought should be dressed in red blue and yellow people would be able to see them coming vimes liked a uniform you could lurk in he pulled out his badge and held it up advancing with an ingratiating smile just repeat this mister skimmer vimes raised his voice hello fellow officer as you can see i am commander v a blade swung around if vimes hadnt stopped hed have walked into it inigo stepped forward leather case already open one hand holding several impressive pieces of paper mouth already framing some suitable sentences a guard took one of the pieces of paper and stared at it this is a studied insult said inigo contriving to speak out of the corner of his mouth while maintaining a smile someone wishes tosee how you react mmph mmhm them no were being watched the paper was handed back there was a terse conversation the captain of the guard says there are special circumstances and he will search the coaches said inigo no said vimes taking in the expression on the captains white face i know when people are playing silly buggers cos ive done it myself he pointed to the door of his coach see this he said tell him this is an ankhmorpork crest and this is an ankhmorpork coach property of ankhmorpork if they lay hands on it that will constitute an act of war against ankhmorpork tell him that he saw the man lick his lips nervously as inigo translated poor sod he thought he didnt ask for this he was probably expecting a quiet day on the gate but someone gave him some orders inigo said he says hes very sorry but those are his instructions and he quite understands if his grace wishes to make a complaint at the highest level mmph mmhm a guard turned the handle of the coach door vimes slammed it shut tell him the war will start right now he said and then itll work its way up your grace the guards looked at detritus it was quite hard to hold the piecemaker nonchalantly and he wasnt even making the attempt vimes maintained eyecontact with the captain of the guard if the man had any sense hed realize that if detritus fired the thing itd kill them all besides sending the coach backwards at high speed please just let him have the sense to know when to fold he prayed in the corner of his ear he could hear the guards whispering to one another he caught the word wilinus the captain stepped back and saluted he apologizes for any inconvenience and hopes you will enjoy your stay in his beautiful city said inigo he particularly hopes you will visit the chocolate museum in prince vodorny square where his sister works vimes saluted tell him i think he is an officer with a great future he said a future which i trust is going to very soon include opening the damn gates the captain had nodded to the men before inigo was halfway through the translation aha and ask him his name he said the man was bright enough not to respond until this had been translated captain tantony inigo said i shall remember it said vimes oh and tell him he has a fly on his nose tantony won a prize his eyes barely flickered vimes grinned as for the town itself it was just a town roofs were steeper than in ankhmorpork some maniac with a fretsaw had been allowed to amuse himself on the wooden architecture and there was more paint than you saw back home not that this told you anything many a rich man had become rich by metaphorically not painting his house the coaches bowled over the cobbles not the right sort of cobbles of course vimes knew that the coach stopped again vimes stuck his head out of the window two rather scruffier guards had barred the road this time ah i recognize this one said vimes grimly i reckon that this time weve just met colonesque and nobbski he stepped out and walked up to them well the fatter of the two hesitated and then held out his hand pisspot he said inigo said vimes quietly without turning his head ah said inigo after some muttered exchanges now the problem seems to be sergeant detritus no trolls are allowed in this part of town during the hours of daylight apparently without a passport signed by their owner uh in bonk the only trolls allowed are prisoners of war they have to carry identification detritus is a citizen of ankhmorpork and my sergeant said vimes however he is a troll perhaps in the interests of diplomacy you could write a short do need a pisspot a passport no your grace then he doesnt either nevertheless your grace there is no nevertheless but it may be advisable to theres no advisable either a few other guards had drifted over vimes was aware of watching eyes he could be ejected by force said inigo now theres an experiment i wouldnt want to miss said vimes detritus made a rumbling noise i dont mind goin back if shut up sergeant youre a free troll thats an order vimes permitted himself another brief scan of the growing silent crowd and he saw the fear in the eyes of the men with the halberds they did not want to be doing this any more than the captain had ill tell you what inigo he said tell the guards that the ambassador from ankhmorpork commends them for their diligence congratulates them on their dress sense and will see that their instruction is obeyed forthwith that should do it shouldnt it certainly your grace and now turn the coach around detritus coming inigo inigos expression changed rapidly we passed an inn about ten miles back vimes went on ought to make it by dark do you think but you cant go your grace vimes turned very slowly would you repeat that mister skimmer i mean we are leaving mister skimmer what you do of course is up to you he sat down inside the coach opposite him sybil made a fist and said well done sorry dear said vimes as the coach turned it didnt look a very good inn serves them right the little bullies said sybil you showed them vimes glanced out and saw at the edge of the crowd a black coach with dark windows he could make out a figure in the gloom within the luckless guards were looking at it as if for instructions it waved a gloved hand languidly he started counting under his breath after eleven seconds inigo trotted alongside the coach and jumped on to the running board your grace apparently the guards acted quite without authority and will be punished no they didnt i was looking at em theyd been given an order said vimes nevertheless diplomatically it would be a good idea to accept the explan so that the poor buggers can be hung up by their thumbs said vimes no just you go back and tell whoevers giving the orders that all our people can go anywhere they like in this city dyou see whatever shape they are i dont think you can actually demand that sir those lads had old burleigh fr stronginthearm weapons mister skimmer made in ankhmorpork so did the men on the gate trade mister skimmer isnt that part of what diplomacy is all about you go back and talk to whoevers in the black carriage and then youd better get them to lend you a horse because i reckon well have gone a little way by then you could perhaps wait wouldnt dream of it in fact the coach was outside the gates of the town before skimmer caught up with it again there will not be a problem with either of your requests he panted and for a moment there appeared to be a touch of admiration in his expression good man tell detritus to turn round again will you youre grinning sam said sybil as vimes sat back i was just thinking that i could take to the diplomatic life said vimes there is something else said inigo getting into the coach theres some historical artefact owned by the dwarfs and theres a rumour how long ago was the scone of stone stolen inigos mouth stayed open then he shut it and his eyes narrowed how in the world did you know that your grace mmph by the pricking of my thumbs said vimes his face carefully blank ive got very odd thumbs when it comes to pricking really oh yes dogs had a much easier sex life than humans gaspode decided that was something to look forward to if he ever managed to have one it wasnt going to start here that was definite the female wolves snapped at him if he came too close and they werent just warnings either he was having to be very careful where he trod the really odd thing about human sex though was the way it went on even when people were fully clothed and sitting on opposite sides of a fire it was in the things they said and did not say the way they looked at one another and looked away the packs had changed again overnight the mountains were higher the snow was crisper most of the wolves were sitting at some distance from the fire carrot had made just enough distance in fact to establish that they were proud wild creatures who didnt have to rely on this sort of thing but close enough to get the benefit and then there was gavin sitting a little way off turning to look from one to the other gavins people hate my family angua was saying i told you its always wolves who suffer when werewolves get too powerful werewolves are smarter at escaping from hunters thats why wolves much prefer vampires vampires leave them alone werewolves sometimes hunt wolves im surprised said carrot angua shrugged why they hunt humans dont they were not nice people carrot were all pretty dreadful but my brother wolfgang is something special fathers frightened of him and sos mother if shed only admit it but she thinks hell make the clan powerful so she indulges him he drove my other brother away and he killed my sister how he said it was an accident poor little elsa she was a yennork just like andrei thats a werewolf that doesnt change you know im sure ive mentioned it our family throws them up from time to time wolfgang and i were the only classic bimorphs in the litter elsa looked human all the time even at full moon andrei was always a wolf you mean you had a human sister and a wolf brother no carrot they were both werewolves but the well the little switch inside them didnt work do you understand they stayed the same shape in the old days the clan would kill off a yennork quickly and wolfgang is a traditionalist when it comes to nastiness he says they made the blood impure you see a yennork would go off and be a human or be a wolf but theyd still be carrying the werewolf blood and then theyd marry and have children or pups and well thats where the fairytale monsters come from people with a bit of wolf and wolves with that extra capacity for violence that is so very human she sighed and glanced momentarily at gavin but elsa was harmless after that andrei didnt wait for it to happen to him hes a sheepdog over in borogravia now doing well i hear wins championships she added sourly she poked the fire aimlessly wolfgangs got to be stopped hes plotting something with some of the dwarfs they meet in the forest gavin says he sounds very well informed for a wolf said carrot angua almost snarled at him hes not stupid you know he can understand more than eight hundred words a lot of humans get by on less and hes got a sense of smell thats almost as good as mine the wolves see everything the werewolves are out all the time now theyre chasing people down the game we call it the wolves get the blame it looks like theyre breaking the arrangement and theres been these meetings right out in the forest where they think no one will see them some dwarfs have got some sort of nasty scheme by the sound of it they asked wolfgang for help thats like asking a vulture to pick your teeth what can you do said carrot if even your parents cant control him we used to fight when we were younger rough and tumble hed call it but i could send him off howling wolfgang hates to think theres anyone who can beat him so i dont think hell relish the thought of me turning up hes got plans this part of uberwald has always well worked because no one was too powerful but if the dwarfs start squabbling amongst themselves then wolfgangs the lad to take advantage with his stupid uniforms and his stupid flag i dont think i want to see you fighting though then you can look the other way i didnt ask you to follow me do you think im proud of this ive got a brother whos a sheepdog a champion sheepdog said carrot earnestly gaspode watched anguas expression it was one youd never get on a dog you mean that she said at last you actually mean that dont you you really do and if youd met him it wouldnt worry you would it to you everyones a person i have to sleep in a dog basket seven nights a month and that doesnt worry you either does it no you know it doesnt it should do dont ask me why but it should do youre so unthinkingly nice about it and sooner or later a girl can have too much nice i dont try to be nice i know i know i just wish youd oh i dont know complain a bit well not exactly complain just sigh or something why because because itd make me feel better oh its too hard to explain its probably a werewolf thing im sorry and dont be sorry all the time either gaspode curled up so close to the fire that he steamed dogs had it a lot better he decided the building that was to be the embassy was set back from the road in a quiet side street they rattled under an arch into a small rear courtyard containing some stables it reminded vimes of a large coaching inn its really only a consulate at the moment said inigo leafing through his papers we should be met by ah yes wando sleeps been here for several years mhm behind the coaches a pair of gates swung shut there was the sound of heavy bolts shooting home vimes stared at the apparition that came limping back towards the coach door he looks it he said oh i dont think this is good evening marthterth mithtreth said the figure welcome to ankhmorpork im igor igor who said inigo jutht igor thur alwayth jutht igor said igor calmly unfolding the step im the oddjob man you dont say said vimes mesmerized have you had a terrible accident said lady sybil i did thpill tea down my thirt thith morning said igor kind of you to notith wheres mister sleeps said inigo im afraid marthter thleepth ith nowhere to be found i wath rather hoping you would know whatd happened to him us said inigo mmhm mmph we assumed he was here he left rather urgently two weekth ago said igor he did not vouchthafe to me where he wath going do go inthide and i will thee to the baggage vimes glanced up a little bit of snow was falling now but there was enough light to see that above them across the whole courtyard was an iron mesh with the bolted doors and the walls of the building all around they were in a cage jutht a little leftover from the old dayth said igor cheerfully nothing to worry about thur what a fine figure of a man said sybil weakly as they stepped inside more than one man by the look of him sam sorry im sure his hearts in the right place good or someones heart anyway sam really all right all right but you must admit he does look a bit odd none of us can help the way were made sam he looks as if he tried good grief oh dear said lady sybil vimes was not against hunting if only because ankhmorpork seldom offered any better game than the large rats you got along the waterfront but the sight of the walls of the new embassy might have been enough to make the keenest hunter take a step back and cry oh i say hold on the previous occupant had been keen on hunting shooting and fishing and to have covered every single wall with the resultant trophies he must have been doing all three at the same time hundreds of glass eyes obscenely alive in the light of the fire in the huge hearth stared down at vimes its just like my grandfathers study said lady sybil there was a stags head in there that used to frighten the life out of me theres just about everything here oh no my gods whispered lady sybil vimes looked around desperately detritus was just entering carrying some of the trunks stand in front of it vimes hissed im not that tall sam or that wide the troll looked up at them then at the trophies and then grinned its colder up here vimes thought hes quicker on the uptake even nobby wont play poker with him in the winter damn something wrong said detritus vimes sighed what was the point hed spot it sooner or later im sorry about this detritus he said standing aside detritus looked at the horrible trophy and nodded yeah dere used to be a lot of dat sort of fing in der old days he said calmly putting down the luggage dey wouldnt be de real diamond teef ocourse deyd take dem out and put bigger glass ones in you dont mind said lady sybil its a trolls head someone actually mounted a trolls head and put it on the wall aint mine said detritus but its so horrible detritus stood in thought for a moment and then opened the stained wooden box that contained all he had felt it necessary to bring detrituss siliconbased brain was as with most trolls highly sensitive to changes in temperature when the thermometer was very low he could be dangerously intellectual dis is der old country after all he said so if itd make you feel better he pulled out a smaller box and rummaged among what appeared to be bits of rock and cloth until he found something yellowybrown and round like a shallow cup shouldve bunged it away he said but its all i got to remember my old granny by she kept fings in it its a bit of human skull isnt it said vimes at last yep whose anyone ask dat troll dere his name said detritus and the glint in his voice had a brittle edge to it for a moment then he carefully put the bowl away tings were diffrent in dem days now you dont chop our heads off an we dont make drums outa your skin everyting is hunkydory dats all we have to know he picked up the boxes again and followed lady sybil towards the staircase vimes took another look at the trophy head the teeth were longer far longer than theyd be on a real troll a hunterd have to be very brave and very lucky to go up against a fighting troll and survive itd be so much easier to go after an old one and later replace the grounddown stumps with sparkly fangs my gods the things we do igor he said as the oddjob man lurched past under the weight of two more bags meth your exthellenthy im an excellency said vimes to inigo yes your grace and still my grace as well yes your grace you are his grace his excellency the duke of ankh commander sir samuel vimes your grace hang on hang on his grace cancels out the sir i know that its like having an ace in poker strictly speaking this is true your grace but great store is set by titles here and it is best to play with a full deck mmph i was once blackboard monitor at school said vimes sharply for a whole term would that help dame venting said no one could clean a blackboard like me a useful fact your grace which may possibly be helpful in the event of a tiebreak mmph mmhm said inigo his face carefully blank we igorth have alwayth preferred marthter said igor what wath it you were requiring vimes gestured towards the heads that covered every wall i want them taken down as soon as possible i can do this cant i mister skimmer you are the ambassador sir mmph mmhm well theyre coming down all of them igor gave the camphorsmelling multitude a worried look even the thordfith even the swordfish said vimes firmly and the thnow leopardth both of them yes what about the troll especially the troll see to it igor could have been said to have looked as if his world had fallen down around his ears were it not for the fact that he already looked as if this had happened what do you want to do with them marthter thats up to you throw them in the river maybe ask detritus about the troll maybe it should be buried or something is there any supper thereth fresh walago noggit thclott thwinefleth and thauthageth said igor still clearly upset about the trophies ill thop tomorrow if her ladythip giveth me inthtructionth is swineflesh the same as pork said vimes people in droughtstricken areas would have paid good money to have igor pronounce sausages yes said inigo and whats in the sausages er meat said igor looking as though he was ready to run good well give them a try vimes went upstairs and followed the sound of conversation until he reached a bedroom where sybil was laying clothes on a bed the size of a small country cheery was assisting her the walls were carved panels of wood the bed was carved panels of wood and the mad fretworker had been hard at work here too only a kind of pastry made from curtains buckwheat dumplings stuffed with stuff bpread made from parsnips and widely considered to be much tastier than the dull wheat kind the floors werent wood they were stone and radiated cold its a bit like the inside of a cuckoo clock isnt it said sybil cheery has volunteered to be my ladys maid for now cheery saluted why not said vimes after a day like this a ladys maid with a long flowing beard seemed perfectly normal the floors are a bit chilly though tomorrow ill measure up for some carpets said sybil firmly i know we wont be here long but we ought to leave something for the next people yes dear that would be a good idea theres a bathroom through there said sybil nodding theres hot springs near here apparently they pipe them in youll feel better for a hot bath ten minutes later vimes was happy to agree the water was a funny colour and smelled a little of what he would politely call bad eggs but it was good and hot and he could feel it drawing the tension out of his muscles the distressing scent of secondhand baked beans sloshed around him as he lay back at the other end of the huge bath the lump of pumice stone that hed been using to rasp the dead skin off his feet banged against the side vimes watched it unseeing while he filed the thoughts of the day things were starting to smell just like the bathwater the scone of stone had been stolen had it now there was a coincidence it had been a complete shot in the dark but lately he was on the lucky side when it came to nocturnal targets someone had pinched the replica scone and now the real one had gone missing and someone in ankhmorpork who was good at making rubber moulds had been found dead you didnt need the brains of detritus in a snowdrift to suspect a connection a recollection nagged at him someone had said something and hed thought it odd at the time but then something else had happened and it had gone out of his mind something about a welcome to bonk only well he was here no doubt about that absolute confirmation of the fact was brought forth half an hour later at supper vimes cut into a sausage and stared what is in these all this pink stuff he demanded er thats meat your grace said inigo on the other side of the table well wheres the texture wheres the white bits and the yellow bits and those green bits you always hope are herbs to a connoisseur here your grace an ankhmorpork sausage would not be considered a sausage mmph mmhm oh really so what would he call it a loaf your grace or possibly a log here a butcher can be hanged if his sausages are not all meat and at that it must be from a named domesticated animal and i perhaps should add that by named i do not mean that it should have been called spot or ginger mmm mmhm im sure that if your grace would prefer the more genuine ankhmorpork taste igor could make up some side dishes of stale bread and sawdust thank you for that patriotic comment said vimes however these are okay i suppose they just came as a bit of a shock thats all no he put his hand over his mug to prevent igor from filling it with beer ith there thomething wrong marthter just water please said vimes no beer the marthter doth not drink beer no and perhaps in a mug without a face on it he took another look at the stein whys it got a lid by the way are you afraid of the rain getting in ive never been quite certain of that one said inigo as igor shuffled off from observation though i believe the purpose of the stein is to stop the beer being spilled while using the mug to conduct the singing mmm mhm ah the old quaffing problem said vimes what a clever idea sybil patted him on the knee youre not in ankhmorpork any more dear she said now were alone your grace said inigo leaning closer im very worried about mister sleeps the acting consul you remember he seems to have vanished mmm mhm some of his personal items have gone too holiday not at a time like this sir and there was a thud of wood against wood as igor reentered pointedly carrying a stepladder inigo sat back vimes found that he was yawning wed better talk about that in the morning he said as the ladder was dragged towards the horrible hunting trophies its been a long day what with one thing and another of course your grace the beds mattress was so soft that vimes sank into it nervously afraid it might close over the top of his head that was just as well because the pillow was well everyone knew a pillow was a sack full of feathers didnt they not an apprentice eiderdown like this thing just fold it up sam said sybil from the depths of the mattress gnight gnight sam there was a snore from sam vimes sybil sighed and turned over vimes awoke a few times to the sound of thuds from downstairs snow leopards he muttered and drifted away again there was a louder crash moose murmured lady sybil elk mumbled vimes defnitely moose some time later there was a muffled scream a thud and a sound very much like the sound made when a huge wooden ruler is held against a desk and twanged swordfish said sam and sybil together and went back to sleep you should present your credentials to the rulers of bonk said inigo in the morning vimes was looking out of the window two guards in the rainbowcoloured uniforms were standing stiffly to attention outside the embassy whatre they doing here he said guarding said inigo guarding who from what just generally guarding mmph i suppose its thought that guards give such a finished look to an important building what was that you said about credentials theyre just formal letters from lord vetinari confirming your appointment mmph mmm the lore is a little complex but at the moment the order of precedence is the future low king the lady margolotta and the baron von uberwald each of course will pretend that you are not calling on the other two its called the arrangement its an awkward system but it keeps the peace if i understood your briefing said vimes still watching the guards in the days of imperial uberwald the whole bloody show was run by the werewolves and the vampires and everyone else was lunch somewhat simplistic but broadly true mhm said inigo brushing some dust off vimess shoulder and then it all broke up and the dwarfs became powerful because theres dwarfs from one end of uberwald to the other and they all keep in touch their system certainly survives political upheaval yes and then what was it a diet of beetles the diet of bugs mmm diet being an uberwaldean word for meeting and bugs being an important town further upriver famous for its pastries made from flax everyone came to an arrangement no one would wage war on any of the others and everyone could live in peace no garlic to be grown no silver to be mined and the werewolves and vampires promised that those things wouldnt be needed mmm mmm seems a bit trusting said vimes it appears to have worked mhm what did the humans think about it all well humans have always been a bit of background noise in the history of uberwald your grace it must be a bit dull for the undead though oh the bright ones know the old days cant come back ah well thats always the trick isnt it finding the bright ones vimes put on his helmet and whatre the dwarfs like the future low king is considered pretty clever your grace mhm how does he stand on ankhmorpork he can take ankhmorpork or leave it alone your grace on balance i believe he doesnt much like us i thought it was albrecht who didnt like us no your grace albrecht is the one who would be happy to see ankhmorpork burned to the ground rhys merely wishes we didnt exist i thought he was one of the good guys your grace i did hear you express some negative sentiments about ankhmorpork on the way here mhm mhm yes but i live there im allowed to thats patriotic across the whole of the world your grace there inexplicably appear to be definitions of mmph mmhm good guy which do not automatically mean likes ankhmorpork you will find out i daresay the other two are a lot easier todeal with it may have been the lady margolotta who tried the little trick with the guards last night she was the one who got me to bring you back anyway she has invited you for drinks oh shes a vampire mmm mmm what inigo sighed your grace i thought you understood vampires are simply part of uberwald this is where they belong im afraid this is something you will have to come to terms with i understand that now they obtain blood by arrangement some people are impressed by a title your grace good grief quite so in any case you will be safe remember your diplomatic immunity mmm mhm i didnt quite see that working in the wilinus pass the other day oh they were common bandits really has your man sleeps turned up havent you taken this to the watch here theres no watch here as you understand the term you saw them theyre gate guards enforcers for the city rulers mhm mmm not officers of the law but enquiries are being made does sybil come with me for this bit said vimes and thought we were guards like that not so long ago it is usually done by the new ambassador and his guards well detritus is staying here to keep an eye on her all right she said this morning she really thinks this place would be better for some decent carpet and theres no stopping her when shes in a tapemeasure mood ill take cheery and one of the lads from outside for the look of the thing i assume youre coming i wont be required sir mmm the new coachman knows the way morporkian is the diplomatic language after all and i shall be making enquiries delicate ones indeed your grace if hes been killed wont that be an act of war yes and no your grace what sleeps was is our man inigo looked awkward it would depend on exactly where he was and what he was doing vimes gave him a blank look and then the penny dropped and operated his brain spying acquiring information everyone does it mmm mhm yes but if you find a diplomat going too far you just send him home with a sharp note dont you around the circle sea your grace that is the case here they may have a different approach something rather sharper than a note exactly mmm one of the guards was captain tantony there was some minor difficulty but the argument that since he was guarding vimes he might as well be where vimes was eventually carried some weight tantony had the look of an agonizingly logical man he kept giving vimes curious looks as the coach rattled out of the town beside him sat cheery with her legs dangling vimes noticed although it was not the kind of thing he generally made a habit of noticing that the shape of her breastplate had been subtly altered probably by the same armourer that angua went to to indicate that the chest underneath it was not quite the same shape of chest that you got under the armour of say corporal nobbs although of course probably no one had a chest the same shape as that of corporal nobbs she was wearing her highheeled iron boots too look you dont have to come he said out loud yes i do i mean i could go and get detritus instead although i suppose thered be even more upshot if i took a troll into a dwarf mine i mean rather than a a girl said cheery helpfully er yes vimes felt the coach slow to a halt even though they hadnt left the town yet and he looked out in front of them across a small square was a fort of sorts but with much larger gates than youd expect for its size as vimes stared at them they were swung open from within inside was a slope all the fort consisted of were four walls around a large sloping tunnel the dwarfs live underneath the town he said as the light from outside was gradually replaced by the infrequent glow of torches but they clearly showed the coach was rattling past a long long line of stationary carts the pools of light revealed horses and drivers talking in groups under quite a lot of uberwald said cheery this is just the nearest entrance sir well probably have to stop in a minute because the horses dont like ah the coach stopped again and the coachman banged on the side to indicate that this was the end of the line the queue of carts wound off down another tunnel but the coach had stopped in a small cave with a big door a couple of dwarfs were waiting there they had axes slung across their backs although by dwarf standards this counted merely as politely dressed rather than heavily armed their attitude however was in the international language of people guarding gates everywhere commander sam vimes ankhmorpork ci ambassador from ankhmorpork said vimes handing one of them his papers at least it was not hard to assume a lofty air with dwarfs to his surprise the document was read thoroughly one dwarf looking over the other ones shoulder and pointing out interesting sub clauses the official seal was carefully examined one guard pointed to cheery krak my official guard said vimes included in associated members of staff on page two he added helpfully mhust searhch thy coash said the guard no diplomatic immunity said vimes tell em cheery they listened to cheerys urgent dwarfish then the other guard whose face had indicated that there was something on his mind and it was jumping up and down nudged his companion and pulled him aside there was a torrent of whispers vimes couldnt understand but he caught the word wilinus and shortly afterwards the word hr grag dwarfish for thirty oh gods he said and a dog good guess sir said cheery the document was handed back hurriedly vimes could read the body language even written smaller than usual there was probably an expensive problem here so the guards were inclined to leave it to someone who earned more money than them one of them pulled a bellrope by the door after some time the door slid open revealing a small room we have to go in sir said cheery but theres no other doors its all right sir vimes stepped inside the dwarfs slid the door back leaving them in the room which was lit by a single candle some kind of waiting room said vimes somewhere far off something went clonk the floor trembled for a moment and then vimes had an uneasy sensation of movement the room moves he said yes sir several hundred feet down probably i think its all done by counterweights they stood silently unsure of what to say as walls around them creaked and groaned then there was a rattle a passing sensation of weight and the room stopped moving wherever were headed keep your ears open said vimes somethings going on i can feel it the door slid back vimes looked out on to the night sky underground the stars were all around him below him i think we went down too far he said and then his brain made sense of what his eyes had seen the moving room had brought them out somewhere on the side of a huge cave he was looking at a thousand points of candlelight spread out on the cavern floor and in other galleries now that he could grasp the scale of things he realized that many of them were moving the air was full of one huge sound made up of thousands of voices echoed and reechoed occasionally a shout or a laugh would stand out but mostly it was just an endless sea of sound beating on the shores of the eardrum i thought you people lived in little mines said vimes well thought humans lived in little cottages sir said cheery taking a candle from a large rack beside the door and lighting it and then i saw ankhmorpork there was something recognizable about the way the lights were moving a whole constellation of them was heading in towards one invisible wall where reflected light now indicated very faintly the mouth of a large tunnel in front of it was a row of lights think of it as a lot of people heading for something that one row of people was guarding people down there arent happy said vimes that looks like a mob to me look you can tell by the way they move commander vimes he turned in the gloom he could make out several dwarfs each with a candle fixed to his helmet in front of them was presumably another dwarf hed seen dwarfs like this in ankhmorpork but always scurrying away this was a deepdown dwarf the robe it was wearing was made of overlapping leather plates instead of the small round iron helmet which vimes had always thought dwarfs were born with it had a pointed leather hat with more leather flaps all round it the one at the front had been tied up to allow the wearer to look out at the world or at least that part of it that was underground the general effect was of a mobile cone er yes thats me said vimes welcome to schmaltzberg your excellency i am the kings jarahkhaga which in your language you would call but vimess lips had been moving fast as he tried to translate ideas taster he said hah that would be a way of putting it yes my name is dee would you care to follow me this should not take long the figure swept away one of the other dwarfs prodded vimes very gently indicating that he should follow the sound from far below redoubled someone was yelling is there a problem said vimes catching up with the fastmoving dee we have no problems ah hes already lied to me thought vimes were being diplomatic vimes trailed after the dwarf through more caves or tunnels it was hard to tell because in the darkness vimes could only rely on a sense of the space around him occasionally they passed the lighted entrance to another cave or tunnel several guards with candles on their helmets stood at each one the wellhoned coppers radar was beeping at him continuously something bad was going on he could smell the tension the sense of quiet panic the air was thick with it occasionally other dwarfs scuttled past distracted on some mission something very bad people didnt know what to do next so they were trying to do everything and in the middle of this important officers had to stop what they were doing because some idiot from some distant city had to hand over a piece of paper eventually a door opened in the darkness it led into a large roughly oblong cave that with its booklined walls and paperstrewn tables had the look of an office about it do be seated commander a match burst into life one candle was lit all lost and alone in the dark we try to make guests feel welcome said dee scuttling behind his desk he pulled off his pointed hat and to vimess amazement put on a pair of thick smoked glasses you had papers he said vimes handed them over it says here his grace the dwarf said after reading them for a while yes thats me and theres a sir thats me too and an excellency fraid so vimes narrowed his eyes i was blackboard monitor for a while too there was the sound of angry voices from behind a door at the far end of the room what does a blackboard monitor do said dee raising his voice what er i had to clean the blackboard after lessons the dwarf nodded the voices grew louder more intense dwarfish was such a good language to be annoyed in erasing the teachings when they were learned said dee shouting to be heard er yes a task given only to the trustworthy could be yes dee folded up the letter and handed it back glancing briefly at cheery well these seem to be in order he said would you care for a drink before you go sorry i thought i had to present myself to your king the swearing from the other side of the door was threatening to burn through the woodwork oh that wont be necessary said dee at the moment he should not be bothered with trivial matters said vimes i thought it was how the thing ought to be done i thought dwarfs always did the thing that ought to be done at the moment it would not be advisable said dee raising his voice again over the noise im sure you understand lets assume im very stupid said vimes i assure you your excellency that what i see the king sees and what i hear the king hears thats certainly true at the moment isnt it dee drummed his fingers on his desk your excellency i have spent only long enough in your city to gain a general insight into your ways but i might feel you are making fun of me may i speak freely from what i have heard of you your monitorship you usually do have you found the scone of stone yet the expression on dees face told vimes that he had scored and that almost certainly the next thing the dwarf said would be another lie what a strange and untruthful thing to say there is no possibility that the scone could have been stolen this has been firmly declared this is not a lie we wish to hear repeated you told me i vimes tried by the sound of it there was a fight going on behind the door now the scone will be seen by all at the coronation this is not a matter for ankhmorpork or anyone else i protest at this intrusion into our private affairs i merely nor do we have to show the scone to any prying troublemaker it is a sacred trust and well guarded vimes kept quiet dee was better than done it duncan every person leaving the scone cave is carefully watched the scone cannot be removed it is perfectly safe dee was shouting now ah i understand said vimes quietly good so you havent found it yet then dee opened his mouth shut it again and then slumped back in his seat i think your grace that you had better the door at the other end of the room rolled back another dwarf coneshaped in his robes stamped out stopped glared around him went back through the door again shouted some afterthoughts to whoever was beyond and then made to head out of the room he was brought up short when he almost walked into vimes the dwarf tilted its head to look up at him there was no real face there just the suggestion of the glint of angry eyes between the leather flaps arnakmorporak yes vimes didnt understand the words that followed but the nasty tone was unmistakable the important thing was to keep smiling that was the diplomatic way why thank you he said and may i say it there was a grunt from the dwarf hed seen cheery haak he shouted vimes heard a gasp there were other dwarfs clustered around the doorway then he glanced down at cheery her eyes were shut she was trembling who is this dwarf he said to dee this is albrecht albrechtson said the ideas taster the runnerup yes said dee hoarsely then can you tell the creature that if he uses that word again in the presence of myself or any of my staff there will be as we diplomats say repercussions wrap that up in diplomacy and give it to him will you the corners of vimess ears picked up a suggestion that not every dwarf listening was ignorant of the language a couple of dwarfs were already heading purposefully towards them dee babbled a stream of hysterical dwarfish just as the other dwarfs caught up with the gaping albrecht and led him quietly but firmly away but not before one of them had whispered something to the ideas taster the er the king wishes to see you he mumbled vimes looked towards the doorway more dwarfs were hurrying through it now some of them were dressed in what vimes thought of as normal dwarf clothing others in the heavy black leathers of the deepdown clans all of them glared at him as they went past then there was just empty floor all the way to the door do you come too he said not unless he asks for me said dee i wish you luck your monitorship beyond the door was a room of bookshelves stretching up stretching away here and there a candle merely changed the density of the darkness there were lots of them though punctuating the distance vimes wondered how big this room must be in here is a record of every marriage every birth every death every movement of a dwarf from one mine to another the succession of the king of each mine every dwarfs progress through kzakra mining claims the history of famous axes and other matters of note said a voice behind him and perhaps most importantly every decision made under dwarf law for fifteen hundred years is written down in this room look you vimes turned a dwarf short even by dwarf standards was standing behind him he seemed to be expecting a reply er every decision oh yes er were they all good said vimes the important thing is that they were all made said the king thank you young dwarf you may straighten up cheery was bowing sorry should i be doing that said vimes youre not the king are you not yet i im im sorry i was expecting someone more er do go on someone more kingly the low king sighed i meant i mean you look just like an ordinary dwarf said vimes weakly this time the king smiled he was slightly shorter than average for dwarfs and dressed in the usual almostuniform of leather and homeforged chainmail he looked old but dwarfs started looking old around the age of five years and were still looking old three hundred years later and he had that musical cadence to his speech that vimes associated with llamedos if hed asked vimes to pass the ketchup in gimlets whole food delicatessen vimes wouldnt have given him a second look this diplomacy business said the king are you getting the hang of it do you think it doesnt come easy i must admit er your majesty i believe you have been until now a watchman in ankhmorpork er yes and you had a famous ancestor i believe who was a regicide here it comes thought vimes yers stoneface vimes he said as levelly as possible ive always thought that was a bit unfair though it was only one king it wasnt as if it was a hobby but you dont like kings said the dwarf i dont meet many sir said vimes hoping that this would pass for a diplomatic answer it seemed to satisfy the king i went to ankhmorpork once when i was a young dwarf he said walking towards a long table piled high with scrolls er really lawn ornament they called me and what was it ah yes shortarse some children threw stones at me im sorry i expect youll tell me that sort of thing doesnt happen any more it doesnt happen as much but you always get idiots who dont move with the times the king gave vimes a piercing glance indeed the times but now theyre always ankhmorporks times see im sorry when people say we must move with the times they really mean you must do it my way and there are some who would say that ankhmorpork is a kind of vampire it bites and what it bites it turns into copies of itself it sucks too it seems all our best go to ankhmorpork where they live in squalor you leave us dry vimes was at a loss it was clear that the little figure now sitting at the long table was a lot brighter than he was although right now he felt as dim as a penny candle in any case it was also clear that the king hadnt slept for quite some time he decided to go for honesty cant really answer that sir he said adopting a variant on his talkingto vetinari approach but yes id wonder you know if i was a king id wonder why people were happier living in squalor in ankhmorpork than staying back home sir ah youre telling me how i should think now no sir just how i think theres dwarf bars all over ankhmorpork and theyve got mining tools wired to the wall and theres dwarfs in em every night quaffing beer and singing sad songs about how they wish they were back in the mountains digging for gold but if you said to them fine the gates open off you go and send us a postcard theyd say oh well yeah id love to but weve just got the new workshop finished maybe next year well go to uberwald they come back to the mountains to die said the king they live in ankhmorpork why is this do you think i couldnt say because no one tells them how to i suppose and now you want our gold and iron said the king is there nothing we can keep dont know about that either sir i wasnt trained for this job the king muttered something under his breath then much louder he said i can offer you no favours your excellency these are difficult times see but my real job is finding things out said vimes if there is anything that i could do to the king thrust the papers at vimes your letters of accreditation your excellency their contents have been noted and that shuts me up vimes thought i would ask you one thing though the king went on yes sir really thirty men and a dog no there were only seven men i killed one of them because i had to how did the others die er victims of circumstance sir well then your secret is safe with me good morning miss littlebottom cheery looked stunned the king gave her a brief smile ah the rights of the individual a famous ankhmorpork invention or so they say thank you dee his excellency was just leaving you may send in the copperhead delegation as vimes was ushered out he saw another party of dwarfs assembled in the anteroom one or two of them nodded at him as they were herded in dee turned back to vimes i hope you didnt tire his majesty someone else has already been doing that by the look of it these are sleepless times said the ideas taster scone turned up yet said vimes innocently your excellency if you persist in this attitude a complaint will go to your lord vetinari he does so look forward to them was it this way out it was the last word said until vimes and his guards were back in the coach and the doors to daylight were opening ahead of them out of the corner of his eye vimes saw that cheery was shaking certainly hits you doesnt it the cold air after the warmth underground he ventured cheery grinned in relief yes it does she said seemed quite a decent sort said vimes what was that he muttered when i said i hadnt been trained he said who has sir it sounded like it all that arguing its not a case of sitting on the throne and saying do this do that then dwarfs are very argumentative sir of course many wouldnt agree but none of the big dwarf clans are happy about this you know how it is the copperheads didnt want albrecht and the schmaltzbergers wouldnt support anyone called glodson the ankhmorpork dwarfs were split both ways and rhys comes from a little coalmining clan near llamedos that isnt important enough to be on anyones side you mean he didnt get to be king because everyone liked him but because no one disliked him enough thats right sir vimes glanced at the crumpled letters that the king had thrust into his hand by daylight he could see the faint scribble on one corner there were just two words midnight see humming to himself he tore the piece of paper off and rolled it into a ball and now for the damn vampire he said dont worry sir said cheery whats the worst she can do bite your head off thank you for that corporal tell me those robes some of the dwarfs were wearing i know they wear them on the surface so theyre not polluted by the nasty sunlight but why wear them down there its traditional sir er they were worn by the well its what youd call the knockermen sir what did they do well you know about firedamp its a gas you get in mines sometimes it explodes vimes saw the images in his mind as cheery explained the miners would clear the area if they were lucky and the knockerman would go in wearing layer after layer of chainmail and leather carrying his sack of wicker globes stuffed with rags and oil and his long pole and his slingshot down in the mines all alone hed hear the knockers agi hammerthief and all the other things that made noises deep under the earth there could be no light because light would mean sudden roaring death the knockerman would feel his way through the utter dark far below the surface there was a type of cricket that lived in the mines it chirruped loudly in the presence of firedamp the knockerman would have one in a box tied to his hat when it sang a knockerman who was either very confident or extremely suicidal would step back light the torch on the end of his pole and thrust it ahead of him the more careful knockerman would step back rather more and slingshot a ball of burning rags into the unseen death either way hed trust in his thick leather clothes to protect him from the worst of the blast initially the dangerous trade did not run in families because whod marry a knockerman they were dead dwarfs walking but sometimes a young dwarf would ask to become one his family would be proud wave him goodbye and then speak of him as if he was dead because that made it easier sometimes though knockermen came back and the ones that survived went on to survive again because surviving is a matter of practice and sometimes they would talk a little of what they heard all alone in the deep mines the taptapping of dead dwarfs trying to get back into the world the distant laughter of agi hammerthief the heartbeat of the turtle that carried the world knockermen became kings vimes listening with his mouth open wondered why the hell it was that dwarfs believed that they had no religion and no priests being a dwarf was a religion people went into the dark for the good of the clan and heard things and were changed and came back to tell and then fifty years ago a dwarf tinkering in ankhmorpork had found that if you put a simplefine mesh over your lantern flame itd burn blue in the presence of the gas but wouldnt explode it was a discovery of immense value to the good of dwarfkind and as so often happens with such discoveries almost immediately led to a war and afterwards there were two kinds of dwarf said cheery sadly theres the copperheads who all use the lamp and the patent gas exploder and the schmaltzbergers who stick to the old ways of course were all dwarfs she said but relations are rather strained i bet they are oh no all dwarfs recognize the need for the low king its just that they dont quite see why knockermen are still so powerful its all very sad said cheery did i tell you my brother snorey went off to be a knockerman i dont think so he died in an explosion somewhere under borogravia but he was doing what he wanted to do after a moment she added conscientiously well up to the moment when the blast hit him after that i dont think so now the coach was rumbling up the mountain on one side of the town vimes looked down at the little round helmet beside him funny how you think you know about people he thought the wheels clattered over the wood of a drawbridge as castles went this one looked as though it could be taken by a small squad of not very efficient soldiers its builder had not been thinking about fortifications hed been influenced by fairytales and possibly by some of the more ornamental sorts of cake it was a castle for looking at for defence putting a blanket over your head might be marginally safer the coach stopped in the courtyard to vimess amazement a familiar figure in a shabby black coat came shuffling up to open the door igor yeth marthter what the hell are you doing here er im opening thith here door marthter said igor but why arent you then it stole over vimes that igor was different this igor had both eyes the same colour and some of his scars were in different places sorry he mumbled i thought you were igor oh you mean my couthin igor said igor he workth down at the embathy howth he getting on er hes looking well said vimes pretty well yes did he mention how igorth getting on thur said igor shambling away so fast that vimes had to run to keep up only none of uth have heard from him not even igor whoth alwayth been very clothe im sorry is your whole family called igor oh yeth thur it avoidth confuthion it does yeth thur anyone who ith anyone in uberwald wouldnt dream of employing any other thervant but an igor ah here we are thur the mithtreth ith exthpecting you theyd walked under an arch and igor was opening a door with far more studs in it than was respectable this led to a hallway are you sure you want to come said vimes to cheery she is a vampire vampires dont worry me sir lucky for you said vimes he glanced at the silent tantony the man was looking strained tell our friend here he wont be needed and hes to wait for us in the coach the lucky devil he said but dont translate that last bit igor opened an inner door as tantony almost ran out of the hall hith grathe hith exthellenthy ah sir samuel said lady margolotta do come in i know you dont like being your grace isnt this tiresome but it has to be done doesnt it it wasnt what hed expected vampires werent supposed to wear pearls or jumpers in pink in vimess world they didnt wear sensible flat shoes either or have a sitting room in which every conceivable piece of furniture was upholstered in chintz lady margolotta looked like someones mother although possibly someone whod had an expensive education and a pony called fidget she moved like someone who had grown used to her body and in general looked like what vimes had heard described as a woman of a certain age hed never been quite certain what age that was but things werent quite right there were bats embroidered on the pink jumper and the pattern on the furniture had a sort of bat look the little dog with a bow round its neck lying curled on a cushion looked more like a rat than a dog vimes was less certain about that one though dogs of that nature tended to look a bit ratlike in any case the effect was as if someone had read the music but had never heard it played he realized she was politely waiting for him and bowed stiffly oh dont bother with that please said lady margolotta do take a seat she walked over to a cabinet and opened it do you fancy a bulls blood is that the drink with the vodka because no said lady margolotta quietly this i am afraid is the other kind still ve have that in common dont ve neither of us drinks alcohol i believe you ver an alcoholic sir samuel no said vimes completely taken aback i was a drunk you have to be richer than i was to be an alcoholic ah vell said i have lemonade if you vish and miss littlebottom ve dont have beer youll be pleased to hear cheery looked at vimes in amazement er perhaps a sherry she said certainly you may leave us igor isnt he a treasure she added as igor retired he certainly looks as though hes just been dug up said vimes this was not going according to his mental script oh all igors look like that hes been in the family for almost two hundred years most of him anyway really extremely popular vith the young ladies for some reason all igors are ive found it best not to speculate vhy lady margolotta gave vimes a bright smile yell heres to your stay sir samuel youknow a lot about me said vimes weakly most of it good i assure you she said although youre inclined to forget your papervork you get exasperated easily you are far too sentimental you regret your own lack of education and distrust erudition in others you are immensely proud of your city and you vonder if you may be a class traitor my friends in ankhmorpork were unable to find out anything very bad and believe me they are pretty good at that sort of thing and you loathe vampires quite understandable vere dreadful people by and large but you i try to look on the bright side said lady margolotta but anyvay how did you like the king hes very quiet said vimes the diplomat try cunning he vill have found out a lot more about you than you did about him im sure vould you like a biscuit i dont eat them myself of course but theres a little man down in the town who does vonderful chocolate igor yeth mithtreth said igor vimes nearly sprayed his lemonade across the room he was out of the room he said i saw him go i heard the door shut igor has strange vays do give sir samuel a napkin igor you said the king was cunning said vimes mopping lemonade off his breeches igor put down a plate of biscuits and shuffled out of the room did i no i dont think i could possibly have said that its not the diplomatic thing to say said lady margolotta smoothly im sure ve all support the new low king the choice of dvarfdom in general even if they thought they ver getting a traditionalist and got an unknown quantity did you just say that last bit said vimes awash on a sea of diplomacy and damp trousers absolutely not you know their scone of stone has been stolen they say it hasnt said vimes do you believe them no the coronation cannot go ahead vithout it did you know that well have to wait until they bake another one said vimes no there vill be no more low kings said lady margolotta legitimacy you see the scone represents continuity all the vay to bhrian bloodaxe they say he sat on it while it is still soft and left his impression as it were you mean kingship has passed from bubackside to backside humans believe in crowns dont they yes but at least theyre at the other end thrones then lady margolotta sighed people set such store by strange things crowns relics garlic anyway there vill be a civil var over the leadership which albrecht will surely vin and hell cease all trading with ankhmorpork did you know that he thinks the place is evil i know it is said vimes and i live there ive heard that he plans to declare all dwarfs there dhrarak the vampire went on vimes heard cheery gasp it means not dwarfs thats very big of him said vimes i shouldnt think our ladsll worry about that um said cheery quite so the young lady looks vorried and youd do vell to listen to her sir samuel excuse me said vimes but what is all this to you you really dont drink at all sir samuel no not even vun no said vimes more sharply youd know that if you knew anything about yet you keep half a bottle in your bottom drawer as a sort of permanent test said lady margolotta now that sir samuel suggests a man who vears his hair shirts on the inside i want to know whos been saying all this lady margolotta sighed vimes got the impression that hed failed another test i am rich sir samuel vampires tend to be didnt you know lord vetinari i know believes that information is currency but everyvun knows that currency has alvays been information money doesnt need to talk it merely has to listen she stopped and sat watching vimes as if shed suddenly decided to listen vimes moved uncomfortably under the steady gaze how is havelock vetinari she said the patrician oh fine he must be quite old now ive never really been certain how old he is said vimes about my age i suppose then she stood up suddenly this has been an interesting meeting sir samuel i trust lady sybil is vell er yes good i am so glad ve vill meet again i am sure igor vill see you out my regards to the baron vhen you see him pat him on the head for me what the hell was that all about cheery said vimes as the coach set off down the hill again which bit sir practically all of it really why should ankhmorpork dwarfs object if someone says theyre not dwarfs they know theyre dwarfs they wont be subject to dwarf law sir i didnt know they were i mean its like how you live your life sir marriages burials that sort of thing marriages wont be legal old dwarfs wont be allowed to be buried back home and thatd be terrible every dwarf dreams of going back home when hes old and starting up a little mine every dwarf even the ones who were born in ankhmorpork home can mean all sorts of things sir said cheery theres other things too contracts wont be valid dwarfs like good solid rules sir weve got laws in ankhmorpork too more or less between themselves dwarfs prefer to use their own sir i bet the copperhead dwarfs wont like it if that happens yes sir therell be a split and another war she sighed but why was she going on about drink i dont know sir i dont like em never have done never will yes sir did you see that rat yes sir i think she was laughing at me the coach rolled through the streets of bonk once more how big a war a worse one than the one fifty years ago i expect said cheery i dont recall people talking about that one said vimes most humans didnt know about it said cheery it mostly took place underground undermining passages and digging invasion tunnels and so on perhaps a few houses fell into mysterious holes and people didnt get their coal but that was about it you mean dwarfs just try to collapse mines on other dwarfs oh yes i thought you were all lawabiding oh yes sir very lawabiding just not very merciful ye gods thought vimes as the coach rolled over the bridge in the centre of the town i havent been sent to a coronation ive been sent to a war that hasnt started yet he glanced up tantony was watching him intently but looked away quickly lady margolotta watched the coach until it reached the gates of the town she stood back a little from the window there was a slight overcast but habits of preservation died hard vhat a very angry man igor yeth mithtreth you can see it piling up behind his patience i vonder how far he can be pushed ive brought the hearthe around mithtreth oh is it that late wed better be going then everyvun feels despondent if i miss a meeting you know the castle on the other side of the valley was much more rugged than lady margolottas confectionery item even so the gates were wide open and didnt look as though they were often closed the main door was tall and heavylooking the only thing that suggested it hadnt been ordered from the standard castle catalogue was the smaller narrow door a few feet high set into it whats that for said vimes even a dwarf would bump their head i suppose it depends on what shape you are when you go in said cheery darkly the main door opened as soon as vimes had laid his hand on the wolfshead knocker but he was ready this time good morning igor he said good day your exthellenthy said igor bowing igor and igor send their regards igor thank you your exthellenthy thinthe you mention it could i put a parthel on your coach for igor you mean the igor at the embassy thatth who i thaid thur said igor patiently he athked me if i could lend him a hand yes no problem there good itth well wrapped up and the ithe will keep it nithe and freth would you thtep thith way the marthter ith changing at the moment igor shambled into a wide hall one side of which was mostly fireplace and bowed out did he say what i thought he said said vimes about the hand and ice its not what it sounds like sir said cheery i hope so my gods look at that damned thing a huge red flag hung from the rafters in the middle of it was a black wolfs head its mouth full of stylized flashes of lightning their new flag i think said cheery i thought it was just a crest with the doubledheaded bat perhaps they thought it was time for a change sir ah your excellency isnt sybil with you the woman who had entered was angua but padded somewhat with years she was wearing a long loose green gown very old fashioned by ankhmorpork standards although there are some styles that never go out of date on the right figure she was brushing her hair as she walked across the floor er shes staying at the embassy today we had rather a difficult journey you would be the baroness serafine von uberwald and youre sam vimes sybils letters are all about you the baron wont be long we were out hunting and lost track of time i expect its a lot of work seeing to the horses said vimes politely serafines smile went strange for a moment hah yes she said can i get igor to fetch you a drink no thank you she sat down on one of the overstuffed chairs and beamed at him youve met the new king your excellency this morning i believe hes having trouble what makes you think that said vimes serafine looked startled i thought everyone knew well ive hardly been here five minutes said vimes i probably dont count as everyone now he was pleased to note she looked puzzled we just heard there was some problem she said oh well a new king a coronation to organize a few problems are bound to occur he said well he thought so this is diplomacy its like lying only to a better class of people yes of course angua is well said vimes are you sure you wont have a drink said serafine quickly standing up ah here is my husband the baron entered the room like a whirlwind that had swept up several dogs they bounded ahead of him and danced around him hello hello he boomed vimes looked at an enormous man not fat not tall just built to perhaps onetenth over scale he didnt so much have a face with a beard as a beard with peeking over the top in that narrow gap between the moustache and the eyebrows small remnants of face he bore down on vimes in a cloud of leaping bodies hair and a smell of old carpets vimes was ready for the handshake when it came but even so had to grimace as his bones were ground together good of you to come hey heard so much about you but not enough vimes thought he wondered if hed ever have the use of his hand again it was still being gripped the dogs had transferred their attention to him he was being sniffed greatest respect for ankhmorpork hey said the baron er good said vimes blood was getting no further than his wrist have seat the baron barked vimes had been trying to avoid the word but that was exactly how the man spoke in short sharp sentences every one an exclamation he was herded towards a chair then the baron let go of his hand and flung himself on to the huge carpet the excited dogs piling on top of him serafine made a noise somewhere between a growl and the tch of wifely disapproval obediently the baron pushed the dogs aside and flung himself into a chair youll have to take us as you find us said serafine smiling with her mouth alone this has always been a very informal household its a very nice place said vimes weakly staring around the enormous room trophy heads lined the walls but at least there were no trolls no weapons either there were no spears no rusty old swords not even a broken bow which was practically against the law of castle furnishing he stared at the wall again and then at the carving over the fireplace and then his gaze travelled down one of the dogs and vimes had to be clear about this he was using the term dogs merely because they were indoors and that was a place where the word wolf was not usually encountered was watching him hed never seen such an appraising look on a creatures face it was weighing him up there was something familiar about the pale gold hair that was a sort of mane in fact it looked quite like angua but heavier set and there was another difference which was small yet horribly significant like angua it had this sense of movement stilled but whereas angua always looked as if she was poised to flee this one looked poised to leap the embassy is to your liking we owned it you know before we sold it to lord v ve vetinari said vimes reluctantly taking his eyes off the wolf of course your people made a lot of changes she went on weve made a few more said vimes recalling all those patches of shiny woodwork where the hunting trophies had been removed i must say i was really impressed with the bathroo im sorry there had been almost a yelp from the baron serafine was glaring at her husband yes she said sharply i gather interesting things have been done youre so lucky to have the thermal springs said vimes and this was diplomacy too he thought when you let your mouth chatter away while you watched peoples eyes its just like being a copper sybil wants to go to take the waters at bad heisses bad behind him he heard a faint growl from the baron and saw the look of annoyance flash across serafines face im saying the wrong thing he said innocently myhusband is a little unwell at the moment said serafine in the special wife voice which vimes recognized as meaning he thinks hes fine right now but just you wait until i get him alone i suppose id better present my credentials said vimes pulling out the letter serafine reached across quickly and took it from his hand i shall read it she said smiling sweetly of course its a mere formality everyones heard of commander vimes i mean no offence of course but we were a little surprised when the patrician lord vetinari said vimes helpfully putting a slight stress on the first syllable and hearing the growl on cue yes indeed said that you would be coming we were expecting one of the more experienced diplomats oh i can hand around the thin cucumber sandwiches like anything said vimes and if you want little golden balls of chocolate piled up in a heap im your man she gave him a slow blank stare your pardon your excellency she said morporkian is not my firstlanguage and i fear we may have inadvertently misled one another i gather that you are in real life a policeman in real life yes said vimes weve always been against a police force in bonk said the baroness we feel it interferes with the liberties of the individual well i have certainly heard that argument advanced said vimes of course it depends on whether the individual you are thinking of is yourself or the one climbing out of the bathroom he noted the grimace window with the family silver in a sack happily security has never been a problem for us said serafine im not surprised said vimes i mean because of all the walls and gates and things i do hope you will bring sybil to the reception this evening but i see that we are keeping you and i know you must have much to do igor will show you out yeth mithtreth said igor behind vimes vimes could feel the river of fury building up behind the levees of his mind ill tell sergeant angua you asked after her he said standing up indeed said serafine but right now im looking forward to a really relaxing bath said vimes and watched with satisfaction as both the baron and his wife flinched good day to you cheery marched along beside him across the hallway dont say a word until were out of here hissed vimes sir because i want to get out of here said vimes several of the dogs had followed them out they werent growling they hadnt bared their teeth but they were carrying themselves with rather more purpose than vimes had come to associate with groinsniffers in general ive put the parthel in the coach your exthellenthy said igor opening the coach door and knuckling his forehead ill be sure to give it to igor said vimes oh not to igor thur thith ith for igor oh right vimes looked out of the windows as the horses trotted away the goldenhaired wolf had come to the steps and was watching him leave he sat back as the coach rumbled out of the castle and closed his eyes cheery was wise enough to remain silent no weapons on the walls did you notice he said after a while his eyes were still shut as if he was looking at a picture on the back of them most castles like that have the things hanging all over the place well they are werewolves sir does angua ever talk about her parents no sir they didnt want to talk about her thats certain vimes opened his eyes dwarfs he said ive always got on with dwarfs and werewolves well never had a problem with werewolves so why is the only person who hasnt tried to blow me out this morning the bloodsucking vampire i dont know sir big fireplace they had werewolves like to sleep in front of the fire at night sir said cheery the baron certainly didnt seem comfortable in a chair i spotted that and what was the motto carved into that great big mantelpiece homini homo homini lupus sir said cheery it means every man is a wolf to another man hah why havent i promoted you cheery because i get embarrassed about shouting at other people sir sir did you notice the strange thing about the trophies they had on the wall vimes shut his eyes again stag bears some kind of mountain lion whatre you asking me corporal and did you notice something just below them lets see i think there was just space below them yes sir with three hooks in it you could just make them out vimes hesitated do you mean he said carefully three hooks that might have had trophies hanging from them until they were removed very much that sort of hook sir yes only perhaps the heads havent been hung up yet trolls heads who knows sir the coach entered the town cheery have you still got that silver chainmail vest you used to have er no sir i stopped wearing it because it seemed a bit disloyal to angua sir why just a passing thought oh ye gods is that igors parcel under the seat i think so sir but look i know about igors if thats a real hand the original owner hasnt got a use for it believe me what he cuts bits off dead people better than live people sir you know what i mean sir its considered good manners if one of the igors has helped you to put it in your will that they can help themselves to any parts that might help someone else they never ask for any money people just carry little cards theyre very respected in uberwald very good men with a scalpel and a needle its a kind of vocation really but theyre covered in scars and stitches they wont do to anyone else what theyre not prepared to try on themselves vimes decided to explore the full horror of this it took his mind off the missing trophies are there any igorinas igorettes well any igor is considered a good catch for a young lady he is and their daughters tend to be very attractive eyes at the same height that sort of thing oh yes but the door when it was finally opened in response to impatient knocking revealed not the switchback features of igor but the business end of detrituss crossbow which was marginally worse its us sergeant said vimes the crossbow was removed and the door opened further sorry sir but you said i was to be on guard said detritus theres no need to igors been hurt sir igor was sitting in the huge kitchen a bandage round his head lady sybil was fussing over him i went to look for him a couple of hours ago and there he was flat on the snow she said she leaned closer to sam vimes he doesnt remember very much can you recall what you were doing old chap said vimes sitting down igor gave him a bleary look well thur i went out to unpack the foodthtuffth from the other coach and id jutht got hold of thomething and then all the lightth went out thur i reckon i muthtve thlipped or someone hit you igor shrugged for a moment both of his shoulders were at the same level theres nothing on the coach worth stealing said lady sybil not unless someone was dying for a knuckle sandwich said vimes was anything taken i checked everyting against der list her ladyship gave me sir said detritus meeting vimess gaze dere wasnt anyfing missing sir ill just go and take a look for myself said vimes when they were outside he walked over to the coach and looked at the snow around it the cobbles were visible here and there then he looked up at the grating all right detritus he said talk to me just a feelin sir rumbled the troll i know fick is my middle name i didnt know you had a first name sergeant i dont fink dis was one of dem accidents dat happens by accident he might have fallen off the coach when he was unloading it said vimes an i might be the fairy clinkerbell sir vimes was impressed this was lowtemperature thinking from detritus der street doors is open said detritus i reckon igor disturbed someone who was pinchin stuff but you said nothing was missing maybe der thief took fright sir what at seeing igor could be vimes looked at the bags and boxes then he looked again things had been thrown down any old how that wasnt how you unpacked a coach unless you were looking for something in a real hurry whod go to these lengths to steal food nothing was missing he rubbed his chin who packed the coach detritus dunno sir i fink her ladyship just ordered a lot of stuff and we left in a bit of a rush too vimes stopped best to leave it there he had an idea but well where was the evidence you could say nothing that should have been there was missing so what must have been taken was something that shouldnt have been there no for now it was just something to remember they walked into the hall and vimess eye fell on a pile of cards on a table by the door ders been a lot of visitors said detritus vimes took a handful of cards some of them had gold edging dem diplomatics all want you to come for drinkypoos an stories about chickens the troll added helpfully cocktails i think youll find said vimes reading through the pasteboards hmm klatch muntab genua lancre lancre its a kingdom you could spit across theyve got an embassy here no sir mostly deyve got a letterbox will we all fit in deyve rented a house for der coronation sir vimes dropped the invitations back on to the table i dont think i can face any of this stuff he said a man can only drink so much fruit juice and listen to so many bad jokes wheres the nearest clacks tower detritus about fifteen miles hubwards sir id like to find out whats going on back home i think that this afternoon lady sybil and i will have a nice quiet ride in the country itll take her mind off things and then he thought ill wait until midnight see and its still only lunchtime in the end vimes took igor as driver and guide and the guards tantony and the one he would forever think of as colonesque skimmer still hadnt returned from whatever nefarious expedition was occupying his time and vimes was damned if hed leave the embassy unguarded yet another word for diplomat vimes mused was spy the only difference was that the host government knew who you were the game was to outwit them presumably the sun was warm the breeze was cold the mountain air made every peak look as if vimes could reach out and touch it outside the town snowcovered vineyards and farms clung to slopes that in ankhmorpork would be called walls but after a while the pine forests closed in here and there at a curve in the road the river was visible far below up on the box igor was crooning a lament he told me igors heal very fast said lady sybil theyd have to mister skimmer said theyre very gifted surgeons sam except cosmetically perhaps the coach slowed do you come up here a lot igor said vimes mithter thleep uthed to have me drive over onthe a week to collect methageth marthter id have thought itd be easier to have a pickup tower in bonk the counthil are dead againtht it thur and you i am very modern in my outlook thur the tower loomed quite close now the first twenty feet or so were of stone with narrow barred windows then there was a broad platform from which the main tower grew it was a sensible arrangement an enemy would find it hard to break in or set fire to it there was enough storage room inside to see out a siege and the enemy would be aware that the lads inside would have signalled for help thirty seconds after the attack began the company had money they were like the coaching agents in that respect if a tower went out of action someone would be along to ask expensive questions there was no law here the kind of people whod turn up would be inclined to leave a message to the world that towers were not to be touched everyone should know this and therefore it was odd to see that the big signal arms were stationary the hairs rose on vimess neck stay in the carriage sybil he said is there something wrong im not sure said vimes who was sure he stepped down and nodded to igor im going to have a look inside he said if there is any trouble youre to get lady sybil back to the embassy all right vimes leaned back into the coach and trying not to look at sybil lifted up one of the seats and pulled out the sword he had hidden there sam she said accusingly sorry dear i thought i ought to carry a spare there was a bellpull by the door of the tower vimes tugged at it and heard a clang somewhere above when nothing else happened he tried the door it swung open hello there was silence this is the wa vimes stopped it wasnt the watch was it not out here the badge didnt work he was just an inquisitive trespassing bastard anyone there the room was piled high with sacks boxes and barrels a wooden stairway led up to the next floor vimes climbed up into a combined bedroom and mess room there were only two bunks their covers pulled back a chair was on the floor a meal was on the table knife and fork laid down carefully on the stove something had boiled dry in an iron pot vimes opened the firebox door and there was a whoomph as the inrushing air rekindled the charred wood and from above the chink of metal he looked at the ladder and trapdoor to the next floor anyone climbing it would be presenting their head at a convenient height for a blade or a boot tricky isnt it your grace said someone above him youd better come up mmm mmhm inigo its safe enough your grace theres only me here mmm that counts as safe does it vimes climbed the ladder inigo was sitting at a table leafing through a stack of papers wheres the crew that your grace said inigo is one of the mysteries mmm mmm and the others are inigo nodded towards the steps leading upwards see for yourself the controls for the arms had been comprehensively smashed laths and bits of wire dangled forlornly from their complex framework several hours of repair work for skilled men id say said inigo as vimes returned what happened here inigo i would say the men who lived here were forced to leave mmph mmhm in some disorder but its a fortified tower so they have to cut firewood oh the company has rules and then they put three young men in some lonely tower for weeks at a time and they expect them to act like clockwork people see the trapdoor up to the controls that should be locked at all times now you your grace and myself as well because we are are bastards vimes supplied well yes mmm wed have devised a system that meant the clacks couldnt even be operated unless the trapdoor was shut wouldnt we something like that yes and wed have written into the rules that the presence of any visitor in the tower would mmhm be automatically transmitted to the neighbouring towers too probably thatd be a start as it is i suspect that any harmlesslooking visitor with a nice fresh apple pie for the lads would be warmly welcomed sighed inigo they do twomonth shifts nothing to look at but trees mmm no blood not much sign of a struggle said vimes have you checked outside there should be a horse in the stable its gone were more or less on rock here theres wolf tracks but theres wolf tracks everywhere around here and the winds blown the snow theyve gone your grace are you sure the men let someone in through the door vimes said anyone who could land on the platform could be in one of these windows in an instant a vampire mmm its a thought isnt it theres no blood around its a shame to waste good food said vimes think of those poor starving children in muntab what are these he pulled a box from under the lower bunk inside it were several tubes about a foot long open at one end badger normal ankhmorpork he read aloud mortar flare light fuse do not place in mouth its a firework mister skimmer ive seen them on ships ah there was something inigo leafed through the book on the table they could send up an emergency flare if there was a big problem yes the tower nearest ankhmorpork will send out a couple of men and a bigger squad comes up from the depot down on the plains they take a downed tower very seriously yes well it could cost them money said vimes peering into the mouth of the mortar we need this tower working inigo i dont like being stuck out here the roads arent too bad yet they could be here by tomorrow evening im sure you shouldnt do that sir vimes had pulled the mortar out of its tube he looked at inigo quizzically they wont go off until you light the charge in the base he said theyre safe and theyd make a stupid weapon cos you cant aim them worth a damn and theyre only made of cardboard in any case come on lets get it on to the roof not until dark your grace mmm that way two or three towers on each side will see it not just the closest but if the closest towers are watching theyll certainly see we dont know that there is anyone there to watch sir perhaps what happened here has happened there too mmm good grief you dont think no i dont think sir im a civil servant i advise other people mmm mmph then they think my advice is that an hour or two wont hurt sir my advice is that you return with lady sybil now sir i will send up a flare as soon as its dark and make my way back to the embassy hold on i am commander in not here your grace remember here you are a civilian in the way mmhm mmm ill be safe enough the crew werent they werent me mmhm mmhm for the sake of lady sybil your grace i advise you to leave now vimes hesitated hating the fact that inigo was not only right but was despite his claim to mindlessness doing the thinking that he should be doing he was supposed to be out for an afternoons drive with his wife for heavens sake well all right just one thing though why are you here the last time sleeps was seen he was on his way up here with a message ah and am i right in thinking that your mister sleeps was not exactly the kind of diplomat that hands around the cucumber sandwiches inigo smiled thinly thats right sir he was the other sort mmm your sort mmm and now go your grace the sun will be setting soon mmm mmm corporal nobbs president and convenor of the guild of watchmen surveyed his troops all right one more time he said whadda we want the strike meeting had been going on for some time and it had been going on in a bar the watchmen were already a little forgetful constable ping raised his hand er a proper grievance procedure a complaints committee an overhaul of the promotion procedures er better crockery in the canteen someone supplied freedom from unwarranted accusations of sucrose theft said someone else no more than seven days straight on nights an increase in the boots allowance at least three afternoons off for grandmothers funerals per year not having to pay for our own pigeon feed another drink this last demand met with general approval constable shoe got to his feet he was still in his spare time organizer of the campaign for dead rights and he knew how this sort of thing went no no no no no he said youve got to get it a lot simpler than that its got to have bounce and rhythm like whadda we want dumdeedumdee when do we want it now see you need one simple demand lets try it again whadda we want the watchmen looked at one another no one quite wanting to be the first another drink someone volunteered yeah said someone at the back when do we want it now well that one seems to have worked said nobby as the policemen crowded round the bar what else are we going to need reg signs for the picket said constable shoe weve got to picket oh yes in that case said nobby firmly weve got to have a big metal drum to burn old scrap wood in while were pickin at it why said reg you got to stand around warmin your hands over a big drum said nobby thats how people know youre an official picket and not a bunch of bums but we are a bunch of bums nobby people think we are anyway all right but lets be warm ones the sun was a fingers width above the rim when vimess coach set off from the tower igor whipped the horses up vimes looked out of the window at the roads edge a few feet away and several hundred feet above the river why so fast he shouted got to be home by thunthet igor shouted itth tradithional the big red sun was moving through bars of cloud oh let him dear if it gives the poor soul pleasure said lady sybil shutting the window now sam what happened at the tower i dont really want to worry you sybil well now that youve got me really worried you may as well tell me all right vimes gave in and explained the little that he knew someones killed them possibly the same people that ambushed us back in that gorge i dont think so this isnt turning out to be much of a holiday sam its being unable to do anything that makes me sick said vimes back in ankhmorpork well id have leads contacts some kind of a map everyone here is well hiding something i think the new king thinks im a fool the werewolves treated me as if i was something the cat dragged in the only person whos been halfway civil was a vampire not the cat said sybil what said vimes mystified werewolves hate cats said sybil i distinctly remember that definitely not cat people hah no dog people they dont like words like bath or vet either i reckon if you threw a stick at the baron hed leap out of his chair to catch it i suppose i ought to tell you about the carpets said sybil as the coach rocked around a corner what isnt he housetrained i meant the carpets in the embassy you know i said id measure up for them well the measurements arent right on the first floor i dont want to sound impatient dear but is this a carpet moment sam yes dear just stop thinking like a husband and start listening like a a copper will you vimes marched into the embassy and summoned detritus and cheery you two are coming with us to the ball tonight he said itll be posh have you got anything to wear apart from your uniform sergeant no sir well go and see igor theres a good man with a needle if i ever saw one how about you cheery i do er have a gown said cheery looking down shyly you do yes sir oh well good im putting the two of you on the embassy staff too cheery youre youre military attache oh said detritus disappointed and detritus youre cultural attache the troll brightened up considerably you will not regret dis sir im sure i wont said vimes right now id like you to come with me is dis a cultural matter sir broadly perhaps vimes led the troll and sybil up the stairs and into the office where he stopped in front of a wall this one he said yes said his wife its hard to notice until you measure the rooms but that wall really is rather thick vimes ran his hands along the panelling looking for anything that might go click then he stood back give me your crossbow sergeant here we are sir vimes staggered under its weight but managed to get it pointed at the wall is this wise sam said sybil vimes stood back to take aim and the floorboard moved under his heel a panel in the wall swung gently you scared der hell out of it sir said detritus loyally vimes carefully handed the crossbow back and tried to look as though hed meant things to happen this way hed expected a secret passage but this was a tiny workroom there were jars on shelves labelled new suet strata area grade a fat the big hole there were lumps of crumbling rock with neat cardboard tags attached to them saying things like level shaft doublepick mine there was a set of drawers one of them was full of makeup including a selection of moustaches wordlessly vimes opened one of a stack of notebooks the first pages had a pencildrawn streetmap of bonk with red lines threading through it good grief look at this he breathed flicking onwards maps drawings theres pages of stuff about the assaying of fat deposits huh says here the new suets while initially promising are now suspected of having high levels of bcbs and are likely to be soon exhausted and here it says a werewolf putsch is clearly planned in the chaos following the loss of the scone k reports that many of the younger werewolves now follow w who has changed the nature of the game this stuff this stuff is spying wondered how vetinari always seems to know so much did you think it came to him in dreams dear but theres loads of details here notes about people lots of figures about dwarf mining production political rumours i didnt know we did this sort of thing you use spies all the time dear said sybil i do not well what about people like foul ole ron and no way jose and cumbling michael that is not spying that is not spying thats just information received we couldnt do the job if we didnt know whats happening on the street well perhaps havelock just thinks in terms of a bigger street dear theres loads more of this muck look sketches more bits of ore what the hells this it was oblong and about the size of a cigarette packet there was a round glass disc on one face and a couple of levers on one side vimes pushed one of them a tiny hatch opened and the smallest head that hed ever seen that could speak said s i know dat said detritus days a nanoimp dey cost over a hundred dollars deyre really small no ones bloody fed me for a fortnight the imp squeaked its an iconograph small enough to fit in a pocket said vimes something for a spy its as bad as inigos damn oneshot crossbow and look steps led downwards he took them carefully and swung open the little door at the end wet heat slapped into him pass me down a candle will you dear he said and by its light he looked out into a long dank tunnel crusted pipes leaking steam at every joint lined the far wall a way in and out where no one will see him too he said what a dirty world we live in the clouds had covered the sky and the wind was whipping thick snowflakes around the tower when inigo finished setting up the red mortar on the platform below the big square shutters he lit a couple of matches but the wind streamed them out before he could even cup his hands around them damn mhm mmm he slid down the ladder and into the warmth of the tower itd be better to spend the night here he thought as he rummaged in drawers the night didnt hold many terrors for him but this storm had the feel of another big snow and the mountain roads would soon be treacherous finally an idea struck him and he opened the door of the stove and pulled out a smouldering log with the tongs it burst into flame when he carried it out at the top of the tower and he directed it into the touch hole at the base of the tube the mortar fired with a phut that was lost in the wind the flare itself tumbled invisibly up into the snow and then a few seconds later exploded a hundred feet overhead casting a brief red glare over the forests inigo had just got back into the room when there was a knock at the door down on the ground he paused there was a window and hatch at this level the designers of the tower had at least known that it would be a good idea to be able to look down and see who was aknocking there was no one there when hed climbed back into the room the knock came again he hadnt locked the door after vimes went a bit late to regret that now he realized but inigo skimmer had trained in an academy that made the school of hard knocks look like a sandpit he lit a candle and crept down the ladder in the darkness shadows fleeing and dancing among the stacks of provisions with the candle set down on a box he pulled the oneshot crossbow from inside his coat and with an effort cocked it against the wall then he flexed his left arm and felt the palm dagger ease itself into position he clicked his heels in a certain way and sensed the tiny blades slide out from the toes and inigo settled down to wait behind him something blew the candle out as he turned and the crossbows one bolt whirred into darkness and the palm dagger scythed at nothing it occurred to inigo skimmer that you could knock on either side of a door they really were very clever mhm m cheery twirled or at least attempted to it was not a movement that came naturally to dwarfs you look very nice said lady sybil it goes all the way to the ground too i dont think anyone could possibly complain unless they were remotely fashion conscious she had to admit the problem was that the well she had to think of them as the new dwarf women hadnt quite settled on a look lady sybil herself usually wore ballgowns of a light blue a colour often chosen by ladies of a certain age and girth to combine the maximum of quiet style with the minimum of visibility but dwarf girls had heard about sequins they seemed to have decided in their bones that if they were going to overturn thousands of years of subterranean tradition they werent going to go through all that for no damn twinset and pearls and red is good said lady sybil sincerely red is a very nice colour its a nice red dress er and the feathers er the bag to carry your axe er not glittery enough said cheery no no if i was going to carry a large axe on my back to a diplomatic function i think id want it glittery too er it is such a very large axe of course she finished lamely you think perhaps a smaller one might be better for evening wear that would be a start yes perhaps with a few rubies set in the handle yes said lady sybil weakly why not after all what about me ladyship detritus rumbled igor had certainly risen to the occasion applying to a number of suits found in the embassy wardrobes the same pioneering surgical skills that he used on unfortunate loggers and other people who may have strayed too close to a bandsaw it had taken him just ninety minutes to construct something around detritus it was definitely evening dress you couldnt get away with it in daylight the troll looked like a wall with a bow tie how does it all feel said lady sybil playing for safety it are rather tight around der whats dis bit called i really have no idea said lady sybil it makes me lurch a bit said detritus but i feel very diplomatic not the crossbow however said lady sybil she got her axe said detritus accusingly dwarf axes are accepted as a cultural weapon said lady sybil i dont know the etiquette here but i suppose you could get away with a club after all she added to herself its not as though anyone would try to take it off you der crossbow aint cultural im afraid not i could put like glitter on it not enough im afraid oh sam yes dear said vimes coming down the stairs thats just your watch dress uniforml what about your ducal regalia cant find it anywhere said vimes innocently i think the bag must have fallen off the coach in the pass dear but ive got a helmet with feathers in it and igors buffed up the breastplate until he could see his face in it although im not sure why he quailed at her expression duke is a military term dear no soldier would ever go to war in tights not if he thought he might be taken prisoner i find this highly suspicious sam detritus will back me up on this said vimes days right sir the troll rumbled you distinctly said to say dat anyway wed better be goi good grief is that cheery yes sir said cheery nervously well thought vimes she comes from a family where people go off in strange clothes to face explosions far away from the sun very nice he said lamps were lit all along the tunnel to what vimes had come to think of as downtown bonk dwarf guards waved the coach through after a mere glance at the ankhmorpork crest the ones around the giant elevator were more uncertain but sam vimes had learned a lot from watching lady sybil she didnt mean to act like that but shed been born to it into a class that had always behaved this way you went through the world as if there was no possibility that anyone would stop you or question you and most of the time thats exactly what didnt happen there were others in the elevator as it rumbled downwards mostly they were diplomats that vimes didnt recognize but there was also now in a ropedoff corner a quartet of dwarf musicians playing pleasant yet slightly annoying music that ate its way into vimess head as the interminable descent went on when the doors opened he heard sybil gasp i thought you said it was like a starry night down here sam er theyve certainly turned the wick up candles by the thousand burned in brackets all around the walls of the huge cavern but it was the chandeliers that caught the eye there were scores of them each at least four storeys high vimes always ready to look for the wires behind the smoke and mirrors made out the dwarfs working inside the gantries and the baskets of fresh candles being lowered through holes in the ceiling if the fifth elephant wasnt a myth at least one whole toe must be being burned tonight your grace dee was advancing through the crowds ah ideas taster said vimes as the dwarf approached do allow me to introduce you to the duchess of ankh lady sybil uh er yes indeed so delighted to make your acquaintance dee murmured caught off guard by the charm offensive but er sybil had picked up the code vimes loathed the word duchess so if he was using it then he wanted her to outdutch everyone she enveloped dees pointy head in delighted duchessness mister dee sam has told me so much about you she trilled i understand youre quite the righthand man dwarf hissed vimes dwarf to his majesty please you must tell me how you have achieved such a delightful lighting effect here er lots of candles dee muttered glaring at vimes i think dee wishes to discuss some political matters with me dear said vimes smoothly putting his hand on the dwarfs shoulder if youll just take the others down ill join you shortly im sure and he knew that no power in the world was going to prevent sybil sweeping on down to the reception that woman could sweep things stayed swept after shed gone past you brought a troll you brought a troll muttered dee and hes an ankhmorpork citizen remember said vimes covered by diplomatic immunity and a rather bad suit even so there is no even so said vimes we are at war with the trolls well thats what diplomacy is all about isnt it said vimes a way to stop being at war anyway i understand its been going on for five hundred years so obviously no one is trying very hard there will be complaints at the very highest level vimes sighed more he said some are saying ankhmorpork is deliberately flaunting its wickedness before the king the king said vimes pleasantly hes not exactly king yet is he not until the coronation which involves a certain object yes but of course that is a mere formality vimes moved closer but it isnt is it he said quietly it is the thing and the whole of the thing without the magic there is no king just someone like you unaccountably giving orders someone called vimes teaches me about royalty said dee miserably and without the thing all the bets are off said vimes there will be a war explosions underground there was a tinny little sound as he took out his watch and opened it my word its midnight he said follow me dee muttered am i being taken to see something said vimes no your excellency you are being taken to see where something is not ah then i want to bring corporal littlebottom that absolutely not that would be a desecration of no it wouldnt said vimes and the reason is she wont come with us because were not going are we youre certainly not taking the representative of a potentially hostile power into your confidence and revealing that your house of cards is missing a card on the bottom layer are you of course not we are not having this conversation for the next hour or so well be nibbling titbits in this room i havent even just said this and you didnt hear me but corporal littlebottom is the best sceneofcrime officer ive got and so i want her to come along with us youve made your point your excellency graphically as always fetch her then vimes found cheery standing back to back or at least back to knees with detritus they were surrounded by a ring of the curious whenever detritus raised his hand to sip his drink the nearby dwarfs jumped back hurriedly where are we going sir nowhere ah that sort of place but things are looking up said vimes dee has discovered a new pronoun even if he does spit it sam said lady sybil advancing through the throng theyre going to perform bloodaxe and ironhammer isnt that wonderful er its an opera sir cheery whispered part of the koboldean cycle its history every dwarf knows it by heart its about how we got laws and kings and the scone sir i sang the part of ironhammer when we did it at finishing school said lady sybil not the full fiveweek version of course itll be marvellous to see it done here its really one of the great romances of history romances said vimes like a love story yes of course bloodaxe and ironhammer were both er werent both vimes began they were both dwarfs sir said cheery ah of course vimes gave up all dwarfs were dwarfs if you tried to understand their world from a human point of view it all went wrong do er enjoy it dear ive got to the king wants me to ill just be somewhere else for a while politics he hurried away with cheery trailing behind him dee led the way through dark tunnels when the opera began it was a whisper far away like the sea in an ancient shell eventually they stopped at the edge of a canal its waters lapping at the darkness a small boat was tethered there with a waiting guard dee urged them into it it is important that you understand what you are seeing your grace said dee practically nothing said vimes and i thought i had good night vision there was a clink in the gloom and then a lamp was lit the guard was punting the boat under an arch and into a small lake apart from the tunnel entrance the walls rose up sheer are we at the bottom of a well said vimes that is quite a good way of describing it dee fished under his seat he produced a curved metal horn and blew one note which echoed up the rock walls after a few seconds another note floated down from the top there was a clanking as of heavy ancient chains this is quite a short lift compared to some up in the mountains said dee as an iron plate ground across the entrance sealing it theres one half a mile high that will take a string of barges water boiled beside the boat vimes saw the walls begin to sink this is the only way to the scone said dee behind him now the boat was rocking in the bubbling water and the walls were blurred water is diverted into reservoirs up near the peaks then it is simply a matter of opening and closing sluices you see yes mumbled vimes experiencing vertigo and seasickness in one tight green package the walls slowed the boat stopped shaking the water lifted them smoothly over the lip of the well and into a little channel where there was a dock any guards below vimes managed stepping out on to the blessedly solid stone there are usually four said dee for tonight i arranged matters the guards understand no one is proud of this i must tell you i disapprove most strongly of this enterprise vimes looked around the new cave a couple of dwarfs were standing on a lip of stone that overlooked what was now a placid pool by the look of it they were the ones who operated the machinery shall we proceed said the dwarf there was a passage leading off the cave which rapidly narrowed vimes had to bend almost double along one length at one point metal plates clanked under his feet and he felt them shift slightly then he was standing almost upright again passing under another arch and there either the dwarfs had cut into a huge geode or they had with great care lined this small cave with quartz crystals until every surface reflected the light of the two small candles that stood on pillars in the middle of the sandy floor the effect dazzled even vimes after the darkness of the tunnels behold said dee gloomily where the scone should be a round flat stone midway between the candles and only a few inches high clearly held nothing behind it water bubbled up in a natural basin and split into two streams that flowed around the stone and disappeared again into another stone funnel all right said vimes tell me everything it was reported missing three days ago said dee dozy longfinger found it gone when he went in to replace the candles and his job is captain of the candles ah its a very responsible position ive seen the chandeliers and how often does he go in there he went in there every day went he no longer holds the position because hes a prime suspect said vimes because hes dead and how did that happen said vimes slowly and deliberately he took his own life were certain of this because we had to break down the door of his cave hed been captain of the candles for sixty years i think he couldnt bear the thought of suspicion falling on him to me he does sound a likely suspect he did not steal the scone we know that much but the robes you people wear could hide practically anything was he searched certainly not but ill demonstrate said dee he walked off along the narrow metalfloored corridor can you see me your excellency yes of course the floor rattled as dee came back now this time ill carry something your helmet if you please just for the demonstration vimes handed it to him the ideas taster walked back down the corridor when he was halfway a gong boomed and two metal grilles dropped down out of the ceiling a few seconds after that guards appeared at the far grille peering in suspiciously dee said a few words to them the faces vanished after a while the grilles rose slowly the mechanism is complex and quite old but we keep it in good working order he said handing vimes his helmet if you weigh more going out than going in the guards will want to know why its unavoidable it is still accurate to within a few ounces and does not violate privacy the only way to beat it would be to fly can thieves fly your excellency depends on which sort said vimes absently who else goes in there once every six days the chamber is inspected by myself and two guards the last inspection was five days ago does anyone else go in there said vimes he noticed that cheery had picked up a handful of the offwhite sand that formed the floor of the scone cave and was letting it run between her fingers not lately when the new king is crowned of course the scone will often be brought forth for ceremonial purposes do you only get that white sand in here yes is that important vimes saw cheery nod im not sure he said tell me what intrinsic value has the scone intrinsic its priceless i know its valuable as a symbol but what is its value in itself priceless im trying to work out why a thief might want to steal it said vimes as patiently as he could cheery had lifted up the flat round stone and was looking underneath it vimes pursed his lips what is she doing said dee the pronoun dripped with distaste corporal littlebottom is looking for clues said vimes they are what we call signs which may help us its a skill would this letter speed your search said dee it has writing on it that is what we call signs which may help you vimes looked at the proffered paper it was brown and quite stiff and covered in runes i er cant read those he said its a skill said dee solemnly i can sir said cheery allow me she took the paper and read it er it appears to be a ransom note sir from the sons of agi hammerthief they say they have the scone and will they say theyll destroy it sir wheres the money said vimes they say rhys must renounce all claim to be low king said deethere are no other conditions the note turned up on my desk but everyone puts paperwork on my desk these days who are the sons of agi hammerthief said vimes looking at dee and why didnt you tell me about this before we dont know its just a madeup name some malcontents we assume and i was told you would ask me questions but this isnt a real crime any more is it said vimes this is politics why cant the king just renounce all claim get the scone back and then say he had his fingers crossed if its done under duress we take our ceremonies seriously your excellency if rhys renounces the throne he cannot change his mind next day if he allows the scone to be destroyed then the kingship has no legitimacy and there will be trouble said vimes and itll spread to ankhmorpork he added to himself at the moment its only riots wholl become king if he abdicates albrecht albrechtson as everyone knows and that will be trouble too said vimes civil war from what i hear the king says said dee quietly that he is minded to step down nevertheless better any king than chaos dwarfs do not like chaos its going to be chaos either way though said vimes thereve been rebellions against kings before dwarfdom survives the crown continues the lore abides the scone remains there is a sanity to come back to oh my gods thought vimes thousands of dwarfs die but thats all right if a lump of rock survives im not a policeman here what can i do this hasnt happened shrieked dee his nerve cracking but everyone knows that foreigners from ankhmorpork do not mind their own business ah you mean given that you dont want people to know about this it would look bad if you appeared to be too excited but you cant be blamed if a stupid flatfoot pokes his nose into things dee waved his hands in the air this wasnt my idea look the security youve got here would disgrace a childrens piggybank i can think of two or three ways of getting the scone out of here what about the secret passage into this room i know of no secret passage into this room oh good at least weve ruled out something go and wait by the boat corporal littlebottom and i have to talk about some things dee left reluctantly vimes waited until the dwarf was visible in the glow of the candles beyond the weighbridge what a mess he said lockedroom mysteries are even worse when they leave the room unlocked youre thinking that dozy might have worn bags of sand under his robes arent you sir said cheery no thought vimes i wasnt but now i know how a dwarf would solve this possibly he said aloud grubby white sand cant be uncommon youd add a bit of sand every day yes just enough not to trigger the scales finally youve got how much does the scone weigh about sixteen pounds sir all right dump the sand on the floor shove the scone under your robes and it might just work risky sir but no one thinks anyone is really going to try to steal the scone would you try to tell me that four guards sitting in that little guardhouse on a twelvehour shift will be alert all the time thats enough for a hand of poker i suppose they rely on the fact that they know when a boat comes up sir right big mistake and you know what i bet that when a boats just gone down thats the time theyre least alert cheery if a human could get in here they could get into the scone cave theyd have to be nimble and a good swimmer but they could do it the guards on the gates were pretty keen sir well yes guards always are just after a theft smart as foxes and sharp as knives just in case anyone wonders if it was them who dropped off to sleep at the wrong time im a copper cheery i know how dull guarding can be especially when you know that no one is ever going to steal what youre guarding he scuffed the sand with his boot they were looking hard at every cart that went in or out this morning but that was because the scone had been stolen its at times like this you get very official very efficient and very pointless activity dont try to tell me that last week they opened every barrel and prodded every load of hay even the stuff coming in can you see dee is he looking at me cheery peered around vimes no sir good vimes walked over to the tunnel pressed his back against a wall took a deep breath and walked his legs up the opposite wall then he eased his way out over the plates of the weighbridge inched along with feet and shoulderblades and wincing at every protest from his knees eventually dropped down he walked across to dee who was talking to the guards how did never mind said vimes lets just say im longer than a dwarf shall we have you solved it no but i have an idea really already said dee and what is that im still working it out said vimes but its lucky the king told you to ask me dee one thing i have found out is that no dwarf will give you the right answer the opera was near the end as vimes slipped into the seat beside sybil have i missed anything he said its very good where have you been you wouldnt believe me he stared unseeing at the stage a couple of dwarfs were engaged in a very careful mock battle all right then if it was politics it was well politics there was nothing he could do about politics so think about it as a crime what was the simple solution best to start with the first rule of policing suspect the victim vimes wasnt quite sure who the victim was here though so suspect the witness that was another good rule that meant the late dozy he could have walked out with the scone days before he discovered the loss he could have done just about anything the way the thing was guarded was a joke nobby and colon could have done it better much better he corrected himself because they had devious little minds and that was what made them coppers the guards of the scone were honourable dwarfs the last people you wanted to entrust with anything you wanted sneaky people for a job like this but it made no sense hed be the prime suspect vimes wasnt well up on dwarf law but he figured there was not a huge friendly future in store for a prime suspect especially if no other solution was forthcoming maybe hed snapped after sixty years of changing candles that didnt sound right anyone who could put up with a job like that for ten years would probably run in their groove for the rest of eternity anyway dozy had now gone to the great big goldmine in the sky or deep underground or whatever it was dwarfs believed in he wasnt going to be answering any questions he could solve this vimes told himself everything he needed was there if only he asked the right questions and thought the right way but his vimish instincts were trying to tell him something else this was a crime if holding a piece of property to ransom was technically a crime but it wasnt the crime there was another crime here he knew it in the same way that a fisherman spots the shoal by the ripple on the water the fight on stage continued it was slowed by the need to stop after every gingerly exchanged axe blow for a song probably about gold er whats this all about he said its nearly over whispered sybil theyve only performed the bit concerning the baking of the scone really but at least theyve included the ransom aria ironhammer escapes from prison with the help of skalt steals the truth that agi has hidden conceals it by baking it into the scone and persuades the guards around bloodaxes camp to let him pass the dwarfs believe that truth was once a a thing a sort of ultimate rare metal really and the last bit of it is inside the scone and theguards cant resist because of the sheer power of it the song is about how love like truth will always reveal itself just as the grain of truth inside the scone makes the whole thing true its actually one of the finest pieces of music in the world gold is hardly mentioned at all vimes stared he got lost in any song more complex than the sort with titles like where has all the custard gone bloodaxe and ironhammer he muttered aware that dwarfs around them were giving him annoyed looks which one was cheery told you they were both dwarfs said sybil sharply ah said vimes glumly he was always a little out of his depth in these matters there were men and there were women he was clear on that sam vimes was an uncomplicated man when it came to what poets called the lists of love in some parts of the shades he knew people adopted a more pickandmix approach vimes looked upon this as he looked upon a distant country hed never been there and it wasnt his problem it amazed him what people got up to when they had time on their hands he just found it hard to imagine a world without a map it wasnt that the dwarfs ignored sex it really didnt seem important to them if humans thought the same way his job would be a lot simpler there seemed to be a deathbed scene now it was a little hard for vimes with his shaky command of ankhmorpork street dwarfish to follow what was going on someone was dying and someone else was very sorry about it both the main singers had beards you could hide a chicken in they werent bothering to act apart from infrequently waving an arm in the direction of the other singer but there were sobs all around him and occasionally the trumpeting of a blown nose even sybils lower lip was trembling its just a song he wanted to say its not real crime and streets and chases theyre real a song wont get you out of a tight corner try hed noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery it fascinated people they sometimes bought books full of complicated recipes and interesting pictures and sometimes when they were really hungry they created vast banquets in their imagination but at the end of the day theyd settle quite happily for egg and chips if it was well done and maybe had a slice of tomato waving a large bun at an armed guard in ankhmorpork and see how far it gets you he shouldered his way through the throng after the performance which from the humans present had received the usual warm reception that such things always got from people who hadnt really understood what was going on but rather felt that they should have done dee was talking to a blackclad heavily built young man who looked vaguely familiar to vimes vimes must have looked familiar to him as well because he gave him a nod just short of offensiveness ah your grace vimes he said and did you enjoy the opera especially the bit about the gold said vimes and you are the man clicked his heels wolf von uberwald something went bing in vimess head and his eyes picked up details the slight lengthening of the incisors the way the blond hair was so thick around the collar anguas brother he said yes your grace wolf the wolf eh thank you your grace said wolf solemnly that is very funny indeed yes it is quite some time since i heard that one your ankhmorpork sense of humour but youre wearing silver on your uniform those insignias wolf heads biting the lightning wolf shrugged ah the kind of thing a policeman would notice but they are nickel i dont recognize the regiment we are more of a movement said wolf the stance was anguas too it was the poised fightorflight look as if the whole body was a spring eager to unwind and flight wasnt an option people in the presence of angua when she was in a bad mood tended to turn up their collars without quite knowing why but the eyes were different they werent like anguas they werent even like the eyes of a wolf no animal had eyes like that but vimes saw them occasionally in some of ankhmorporks less salubrious drinking establishments where if you were lucky youd get out the door before the drink turned you blind colon called that sort of person a bottle covey nobby preferred soddin nutter but whatever the name vimes recognized a headbutting eyegouging downanddirty bastard when he saw one in a fight youd have no alternative but to lay him out or cut him down because otherwise hed do his very best to kill you most bar fighters wouldnt usually go that far because killing a copper was known to be bad news for the murderer and anyone else who knew him but your true nutter wouldnt worry about that because while he was fighting his brain was somewhere else wolf smiled there is a problem your grace what no just thinking i feel ive met you before you called on my father this morning ah yes we dont always change for visitors your grace said wolf there was an orange light in his eyes now until then vimes had thought that glowing eyes was just a figure of speech if youll excuse me i do need to talk to the ideas taster for a moment said vimes politics dee followed him into a quiet spot yes did dozy go to the scone cave at the same time every day i believe so it depended on his other duties so he didnt go in at the same time every day right when does the guard change at each three oclock did he go in before the guards change or afterwards that would depend on oh dear dont the guards write anything down dee stared at vimes are you saying he could have gone in twice in one day very good but im saying someone might have a dwarf comes up in a boat alone carrying a couple of candles would the guards take that much interest and if another dwarf carrying a couple of candles came up an hour or so later when the new guards were there well is there any real risk even if our faker was noticed hed just have to mutter something about oh bad candles or something damp wicks anything dee looked distant its still a great risk he said at last if our thief was keeping an eye on the guard changes and knew where the real dozy was itd be worth it wouldnt it for the scone dee shuddered and then nodded in the morning the guards will be closely questioned he said by me why because i know what kind of questions get answers well set up an office here well find out the movements of everyone and talk to all the guards okay even the ones on the gates well find out who went in and out you already think you know something lets say some ideas are forming shall we i will see to matters vimes straightened up and walked back to lady sybil who stood like an island in a sea of dwarfs she was talking animatedly to several of them who vimes vaguely recognized as performers in the opera what have you been up to sam she said politics im afraid said vimes and trusting my instincts can you tell me whos watching us oh its that game is it said sybil she smiled happily and in the tones of someone chatting about inconsequential things said practically everyone but if i was handing out prizes id choose the rather sad lady in the little group just off to your left shes got fangs sam and pearls too they dont exactly accessorize can you see wolfgang er no not now you come to mention it thats odd he was around a moment ago have you been upsetting people i think i may let people upset themselves said vimes good for you you do that so well vimes half turned like someone just taking in the view in amongst the human guests the dwarfs moved and clustered five or six would come together and talk animatedly then one would drift away and join another group he might be replaced and sometimes an entire group would spread out like the debris of an explosion each member heading towards another group vimes got the impression that there was a kind of structure behind all this some slow purposeful dance of information mineshaft meetings he thought small groups because there wouldnt be room for more and you dont talk too loudly and then when the group decides every member is an ambassador for that decision the word spreads out in circles its like running a society on formal gossip it occurred to him that it was also a way in which two plus two could be debated and weighed and considered and discussed until it became fourandabit or possibly an egg occasionally a dwarf would stop and stare before hurrying away were supposed to go in for supper dear said sybil indicating the general drift towards a brightly lit cave vimes had once discussed the ephebian idea of democracy with carrot and had been rather interested in the idea that everyonet had a vote until he found out that while he vimes would have a vote there was no way in the rules that anyone could prevent nobby nobbs from having one as well vimes could see the flaw there straight away apart from the women children slaves idiots and people who werent really our kind of people oh dear quaffing do you think rats on sticks wheres detritus over there talking to the cultural attache from genua thats the man with the glazed expression as they got closer vimes heard detrituss voice in full expansive explanation and den ders dis big room wid all seats in it wid red walls and dem big gold babies climbin up der pillar only dont worry cos deyre not real gold babies deyre only made of plaster or somethin there was a pause as detritus considered matters an also i dont reckon its real gold neither cos some buggerd have pinched it if it was and in front of der stage ders dis big pit where all der musicians sits and days about it for dat room in der next room ders all dese marble pillars an on der floor dey got red carpeting detritus said lady sybil i do hope youre not monopolizing this gentleman no i bin tellin him all about der culture we got in ankhmorpork said detritus airily i know just about every inch of der opra house yes said the cultural attache in a stunned voice and i must say im particularly interested in visiting the art gallery and seeing he shuddered der picture of dis woman i dont reckon der artist knew how to do a smile proply but der frames got to be worth a bob or two it sounds like the experience of a lifetime good evening to you you know i dont fink he knows a lot of culture said detritus as the man strode away do you think people will miss us if we slip away said vimes looking around its been a long day and i want to think about things sam you are the ambassador and ankhmorpork is a world power said sybil we cant just sneak off people will comment vimes groaned so inigo was right when vimes sneezes ankhmorpork blows its nose your excellency he looked down at two dwarfs the low king will see you now said one of them er we will have to be officiallypresented lady sybil hissed what even detritus yes but hes a troll it had seemed amusing at the time vimes was aware of a drift in the crowds across the floor of the huge cave there was a certain movement to them a flow in the current of people towards one end of the cave there was really no option but to join it the low king was on a small throne under one of the chandeliers there was a metal canopy over it already encrusted with marvellous stalactites of wax around him watching the crowd were four dwarfs tall for dwarfs and looking rather menacing in their dark glasses each one was holding an axe they spent all their time staring hard at people the king was talking to the genuan ambassador vimes looked sideways at cheery and detritus suddenly bringing them here wasnt such a good idea in his official robes the king looked a lot more distant and a lot harder to please hang on he told himself they are ankhmorpork citizens theyre not doing anything wrong and then he argued theyre not doing anything wrong in ankhmorpork the line moved along their party was almost in the presence the armed dwarfs were all watching detritus now and holding their axes in a slightly less relaxed way detritus appeared not to notice dis place is even more cultral than the opra house he said gazing around respectfully dem chandeliers must weigh a ton he reached up and rubbed his head and then inspected his fingers vimes glanced up something warm like a buttered raindrop hit his cheek as he brushed it away he saw the shadows move things happened with treacle slowness he saw it as if he was watching himself from a little way away he saw himself push cheery and sybil roughly heard himself shout something and watched himself dive towards the king snatching the dwarf up as an axe clanged into his backplate then he was rolling with the angry dwarf in his arms and the chandelier was halfway through its fall candle flames streaming and there was detritus raising his hands with a calculating look on his face there was a moment of stillness and silence as the troll caught the descending mountain of light and then physics returned in an exploding cloud of dwarfs debris molten wax and tumbling flaring candles vimes woke up in darkness he blinked and touched his eyes to make sure that they were open then he sat up and his head thumped against stone and then there was light vicious yellow and purple lights filling his life very suddenly he lay back until they went away he took a personal itinerary his cloak helmet sword and armour had all gone he was left in his shirt and breeches and while this place was not freezing it had a clamminess that was already working its way through to his bones right he wasnt sure how long it took him to get a feel for the cell but a feel it was he moved by inches waving his arms ahead of him like a man practising a very slow martial art against the darkness even then the senses became unreliable in the total black he followed the wall carefully followed another wall followed a wall which yielded under his fingertips the outline of a small door with a handle and found the wall which had the stone slab against it on which hed awoken what made this all the harder was having to do it with his head sunk against his chest vimes wasnt a very tall man if he had been hed probably have cracked his skull when he woke up without any other aids to rely on he walked the length of the walls using his coppers pace he knew exactly how long it took him swinging his legs easily to walk across the brass bridge back home a little bit of muzzy mental arithmetic was needed but eventually he decided that the room was ten feet square one thing that vimes did not do was shout help help he was in a cell someone had put him in a cell it was reasonable to assume therefore that whoever had done this wasnt interested in his opinions he groped his way to the stone slab again and lay down as he did so something rattled his patted his pockets and brought out what felt and sounded very much like a box of matches there were only three left so resources the clothes he stood up in and a few matches now to work out what the hell was going on he remembered seeing the chandelier he thought he remembered seeing detritus actually catch the thing and there had been a lot of screaming and shouting and running around while in his arms the king had sworn at vimes as only a dwarf could swear then someone had hit him there was also an ache across his back where an axe had been turned aside by his armour he felt a twitch of national pride at that thought ankhmorpork armour had stood up to the blow admittedly it was probably made in ankhmorpork by dwarfs from uberwald using steel smelted from uberwald iron but it damn well was ankhmorpork armour just the same there was a pillow on the slab made in uberwald as vimes turned his head the pillow went very faintly clink this was a sound he didnt associate with feathers in the darkness he picked up the sack and after resorting to his teeth managed to rip a hole in the heavy material if what he drew out had ever been part of a bird it wasnt one vimes would like to meet it felt very much like inigos oneshot a finger inserted very gingerly into the end told vimes that it was loaded too just one shot he remembered but it was one people didnt know you had on the other hand the tooth fairy probably wasnt responsible for putting it in the pillow unless shed been having to face some particularly difficult children lately he slipped it back into the bag when he became aware of a light it was the faintest glow showing that the door contained a barred window and that there were shadowy figures on the other side of it are you awake your grace this is very unfortunate dee yes and youve come to tell me this has all been some terrible mistake alas no i am convinced of your innocence of course really me too growled vimes in fact im so convinced of my innocence i dont even know what it is im innocent of let me out or or you will stay in i am afraid said dee it is a very strong door you are not in ankhmorpork your grace i will of course communicate your predicament to your lord vetinari as soon as possible but i understand that the message tower has been badly damaged my predicament is that youve locked me up why i saved your king didnt i there is conflict someone let that chandelier down yes indeed a member of your staff it appears you know that cant be true detritus and littlebottom were with me when mister skimmer was on your staff he yes but i he wouldnt i believe you have such a thing in ankhmorpork as the guild of assassins said dee calmly correct me if i am wrong he was up at the tower the damaged tower it was damaged before he vimes stopped why would he smash up one of the towers i did not say he would said dee the flat calm was still there and then your grace it has been suggested that you gave a signal just before the thing came down what a hand to the cheek or something it has been suggested that you anticipated the event the thing was swaying look let me talk to skimmer do you have supernatural powers your grace vimes hesitated hes dead we believe he became entangled in the winch mechanism in the process of releasing the chandelier three dwarfs were dead around him he wouldnt vimes stopped again of course he wouldnt its just that hes a member of this guild we have and you certainly know that dont you dee must have seen his expression quite so quite so everything will be investigated thoroughly the innocent have nothing to fear the news that they have nothing to fear is guaranteed to strike terror into the hearts of innocents everywhere what have you done with sybil done your grace why nothing we are not barbarians we have heard nothing but good reports of your wife she is upset of course vimes groaned and detritus and littlebottom well of course they were under your command your grace and one is a troll and the other is dangerously different and that is why and precisely for that reason they are under house arrest in your own embassy we do respect the traditions of diplomacy and we will not have it said that we have acted out of malice dee sighed and then of course there is the other matter are you going to accuse me of stealing the scone too you laid hands on the king vimes stared huh a ton of candlestick was about to fall on him this has been pointed out and im imprisoned for saving him from an assassination attempt i planned are you no look the thing was coming down what else should i have done tugged at the carpet and tried to drag him away yes yes i understand but precedent in this area is very clear in when the king at the time fell into a lake not one member of his staff dared touch him because of the ruling and the subsequent finding was that they had acted correctly it is forbidden to touch the king i have of course explained to the conclave that this is not the ankhmorpork way but this is not ankhmorpork i dont need everyone reminding me about that you will remain our guest while investigations continue food and drink will be brought to you and light of course excuse our lack of consideration stand back from the door please the guards with me are armed and they are uncomplicated people the grille on the door was swung back a glowing cage was put on the ledge whats this a sick glowworm it is a kind of beetle yes youll find that it will very soon seem quite bright we are very accustomed to darkness look said vimes as the grille was shut again you know this is ridiculous i dont know what the position is with mister skimmer but i damn well intend to find out and theres the scone theft im pretty certain im close to working that out too if you let me return to the embassy where else could i go we would not wish to find out you may just feel that life would be more pleasant in ankhmorpork really and how would we get there you may have friends in unexpected places vimes thought of the evil little weapon in the pillow you will not be badly treated this is our way said dee i will return when i have news hey but dee was a retreating shape in the crepuscular almostnotthere light in vimess cell the glow beetle was doing its best all it managed to achieve though was to turn the darkness into a variety of green shadows you could find your way around without walking into walls but that was about the extent of it one shot which they didnt know you had thatd probably get him out of the door into a corridor underground full of dwarfs on the other hand it was amazing how the evidence could stack up against you when people wanted it to anyway vimes was an ambassador what had happened to diplomatic immunity but that was hard to argue when you were faced with uncomplicated people with weaponry there was a risk that theyd experiment to see if it was true one shot they didnt expect some time later there was a rattling of keys and the door was pulled open vimes could make out the shape of two dwarfs one was holding an axe the other was bearing a tray the dwarf with the axe motioned vimes to step back an axe wasnt a good idea vimes considered it was always the weapon of choice amongst dwarfs but it wasnt sensible in a confined space he raised his hands and as the other dwarf walked cautiously over to the stone slab let them move towards the back of his neck these dwarfs were nervous of him perhaps they didnt see humans very often theyd remember this one want to see a trick said vimes grzdak watch this said vimes and brought his hands around and shut his eyes just before the match flared he heard the axe drop as its owner tried to cover his face that was an unexpected bonus but there wasnt time to thank the god of desperate men vimes plunged forward kicked as hard as he could and heard an oof of expelled breath then he leapt into the patch of darkness that contained the other dwarf found a head spun around and rammed it into an unseen wall the first dwarf was trying to get to his feet vimes fumbled for him in the gloom pulled him up by his jerkin and rasped someone left me a weapon they wanted me to kill you remember that i could have killed you he punched the dwarf in the stomach this was no time to play by the marquis of fantailler rules then he turned snatched the little cage containing the light beetle and headed for the door there was a feeling of passageway stretching off in both directions vimes paused for just long enough to sense the draught on his face and headed that way another glow beetle was hanging in a cage a little distance off it illuminated if such a bright word could be used for a light that merely made the darkness less black a huge circular opening in which a fan turned lazily the blades were so slow that vimes was able to step between them into the velvet cavern beyond someone really wants me dead he thought as he inched his way along the nearest invisible wall with his face to the draught one shot they werent expecting but someone was expecting it werent they the marquis of fantailler got into many fights in his youth most of them as a result of being known as the marquis of fantailler and wrote a set of rules for what he termed the noble art of fisticuffs which mostly consisted of a list of places where people werent allowed to hit him many people were impressed with his work and later stood with noble chest outthrust and fists balled in a spirit of manly aggression against people who hadnt read the marquiss book but did know how to knock people senseless with a chair the last words of a surprisingly large number of people were stuff the bloody marquis of fantailler if you want to get a prisoner out of the clink then you give him a key or a file you dont give him a weapon a key might get him out a weapon would get him killed he stopped one foot over emptiness the glow beetle revealed a hole in the floor it had the huge suckingness of depth then he gripped the beetles cage between his teeth took a few steps back and completely misjudged the distance he hit the other side of the hole with every rib both arms flat on the floor beyond a bit of ankhmorpork sense of humour hissed between his teeth he scrabbled his way on to the cave floor and got his breath back then he took the oneshot out of his pocket fired it into the floor tossed it into the hole it clattered and echoed for some time and moved on keeping his face towards the cold air this wasnt a tunnel any more it was the bottom of a shaft but the green glow lit up something heaped in the middle vimes picked up a handful of snow and when he looked up a flake melted on his face he grinned in the dark the beetle light just caught the edge of the spiral stairs fixed to the rock stairs turned out to be a generous description when the shaft had been cut the dwarfs had made holes in the stone and hammered thick baulks of timber into them he tried one or two they seemed sturdy enough with care hed be able to scramble he was a long way up before one log snapped he flung out his hands and caught the next one his grip slipping on the wet wood the glow beetle disappeared downwards and vimes swinging back and forth from his precarious handhold watched the circle of dim green light dwindle to a dot and vanish then the realization crept over him that there was no way he would be able to pull himself up his fingers were numb but the rest of his entire life consisted of the amount of time they could maintain a grip on the clammy step above him call it a minute perhaps there were a lot of things that could profitably be done in a minute but most of them couldnt be done with no hands while hanging in darkness over a long drop he lost his grip a moment later he smacked into the spiral of logs one turn below which parted company with the wall man and timber fell one more turn vimes landed with a ribbending thump across one step while those around it gave way rocking gently on the one tough log he listened to the thuds and booms as the fallen timber continued to the bottom of the shaft vimes had intended to swear but the fall had knocked the breath out of him he hung like a folded pair of old trousers it had been a long time since hed slept whatever hed been doing on the slab it hadnt been sleep normal sleep didnt leave your mouth feeling as though glue had been poured into it and only this morning the new ambassador for ankhmorpork had strolled out to present his credentials only this evening ankhmorporks commander of police had set out to solve a simple little theft and now he was dangling halfway up a freezing shaft with a few inches of old and unreliable wood between him and a brief trip to the next world all he could hope for was that his whole life wasnt going to pass before his eyes there were some bits of it he didnt want to remember ah sir samuel bad luck you vere doing so vell he opened his eyes a faint purple light just above him illuminated the form of the lady margolotta she was sitting on empty space can i give you a lift she said vimes shook his head muzzily if it makes you feel any better i really dont like doing this said the vampire its so expected of vun oh dear that rotten old log doesnt look very the log snapped vimes landed spreadeagled on the turn below but only for a moment several stairs broke and dropped him a further flight this time he caught hold of one and was once again dangling lady margolotta descended regally far below the broken wood boomed now in theory this might be an almost survivable vay of getting back down said the vampire unfortunately i fear that the descending logs have smashed many of the vuns below vimes shifted his handhold seemed secure it might just be possible to pull himself up i knew you were behind this he muttered trying to will some life into his shoulder muscles no you didnt you knew that the scone wasnt stolen though vimes stared at the serenely floating shape the dwarfs wouldnt think that he began the log under him gave the little nasty movement that announces to any luckless passengers that it is about to land lady margolotta drifted closer i know you hate vampires she said its quite usual for your personality type its the penetrative aspect but if i vas you right now id ask myself do i hate them with all my life she held out a hand just one bitell end all my troubles eh vimes snarled vun bite vould be vun too many sam vimes the wood cracked she grabbed his wrist if hed thought about it at all vimes would have expected to be dangling from a vampire now instead he was simply floating dont think of letting go said margolotta as they rose gently up the shaft one bite would be one too many said vimes he recognized the mangled mantra youre a a teetotaller almost four years now no blood at all oh yes animal its rather kinder to them than slaughter dont you think of course it makes them docile but frankly a cow is unlikely ever to vin the thinker of the year avard im on a vagon mister vimes the wagon we call it the wagon said vimes weakly and that replaces human blood like lemonade replaces whisky believe me however the intelligent mind can find a substitute the sides of the shaft dropped away and they were in clear freezing air which knifed through vimess shirt they drifted sideways a little and then vimes was dropped into kneedeep snow vun of the better things about our dwarfs is that they dont often try something new and they never let go of anything old said the vampire hovering over the snow you werent hard to find where am i vimes looked around at rocks and trees mounded in snow in the mountains quite a long way viddershins of the town mister vimes goodbye youre going to leave me here im sorry you were the one who escaped i am certainly not here me a vampire interfering in the affairs of the dwarfs unthinkable but let us just say i like people to have an even chance its freezing i havent even got a coat what is it you want you have freedom mister vimes isnt that what everyvun wants isnt it supposed to give you a lovely warm glow lady margolotta disappeared into the snow vimes shivered he hadnt realized how warm it had been underground or what time it was there was a dim a very dim light was this just after sunset was it almost dawn the flakes were piling up on his damp clothes driven by the wind freedom could get you killed shelter that was essential the time of day and a precise location were no use to the dead they always knew what time it was and where they were he moved away from the open shaft and staggered into the trees where the snow was less deep it gave off a light fainter than a sick beetle as if snow somehow absorbed it from the air as it fell vimes wasnt good at forests they were things you saw on the horizon if hed thought about them at all hed imagined a lot of trees standing like poles brown at the bottom bushy and green at the top here there were humps and bumps and dark branches weighted and creaking under the snow it fell around him with a hiss occasionally lumps of the stuff would slide from somewhere above and there would be another shower of frigid crystals as a branch sprang back there was a track of sorts or at least a wider smoother expanse of snow vimes followed it on the basis that there was no more sensible choice the warm glow of freedom lasted only so long vimes had city eyes hed watched coppers develop them a trainee copper who glanced once at a street was just learning and if he didnt learn quicker hed become highly experienced at dying one whod been on the streets for a while paid attention took in details noted shadows saw background and foreground and the people who were trying not to be in either angua looked at streets like that she worked at it the longterm coppers like even nobby when he was on a good day glanced once at a street and that was enough because theyd seen everything maybe there were country eyes forest eyes vimes saw trees mounds snow and not much else the wind was getting up it began to howl among the trees now the snow stung trees branches snow vimes kicked a mound beside the track snow slid off dark pine needles he dropped to his hands and knees and pushed forward ah it was still cold and there was some snow on the dead needles but the weighted branches had spread around the trunk like a tent he pulled himself in congratulating himself it was windless here and contrary to all common sense the blanket of snow above him seemed to make it warmer it even smelled warm sort of animal three wolves lying lazily around the trunk of the tree were watching him with interest vimes added metaphorical freezing to the other sort the animals didnt seem frightened wolves l and that was about it it made as much sense to say snow or wind right now those were more certain killers he had heard somewhere that wolves wouldnt attack you if you faced them down the trouble was that he was going to sleep soon he could feel it creeping over him he wasnt thinking right and every muscle ached outside the wind moaned and his grace the duke of ankh fell asleep he awoke with a snort and to his surprise all his arms and legs as well a drop of chilled water melted from the roof just above by the heat of his body ran down his neck his muscles didnt hurt any more he couldnt feel most of them and the wolves had gone there was trampled snow at the far end of the makeshift lair and light so bright that he groaned it turned out to be daylight from a bright sky bluer than any vimes had seen so blue that it seemed to shade into purple at the zenith he stepped out into a sugarfrosted world crunchy and glittering wolf tracks led away between the trees it occurred to vimes that following them would not be a lifeenhancing move perhaps last night had been understood as time out but today was a new day and probably the search was on for breakfast the sun felt warm the air was cold his breath hung in front of him there should be people around shouldnt there vimes was hazy on rural issues but werent there supposed to be charcoal burners woodcutters and he tried to think little girls taking goodies to granny the stories vimes had learned as a kid suggested that all forests were full of bustle activity and the occasional scream but this place was silent he set off in a direction that appeared to head downwards on general principles food was the important thing hed still got a couple of matches and he could probably make a fire if he had to be out here mother night but it was a long time since the canapes at the reception this is ankhmorpork trudging over and through the snow after half an hour he reached the bottom of a shallow valley where a stream splashed between encroaching banks of ice it steamed the water was warm to the touch he followed the banks for some way they were crisscrossed with animal tracks here and there the water pooled in deep hollows that smelled of rotten eggs around them the leafless bushes were heavy with ice where the steam had frozen food could wait vimes stripped off his clothes and stepped into one of the deeper pools yelping at the heat and then lay back didnt they do something like this up in nothingfjord hed heard stories they had hot steamy baths and then ran around in the snow hitting one another with birch logs didnt they or something there was nothing really daft that some foreigner wouldnt do somewhere gods it felt good hot water was civilization vimes could feel the stiffness in his muscles melting away in the warmth after a moment or two he splashed over to the bank and rummaged through his clothes until he found a flattened cigar packet containing a couple of things that after the events of the past twentyfour hours looked like fossilized twigs he had two matches well the hell with it anyone could light a fire with one match he lay back in the water that was a good decision he could feel himself coming back together again pulled into shape by the heat within and without ah your grace wolf von uberwald was sitting on the opposite bank he was stark naked a little vapour rose off him as if hed just been exerting himself muscles gleamed as though theyd been oiled they probably had been a run in the snow is such a thing is it not said wolf pleasantly you are certainly learning the ways of uberwald your grace lady sybil is alive and well and free to go back to your city when the passes are cleared i know you would wish to hear that other figures were approaching through the trees men and women all of them as unselfconsciously naked as wolf vimes realized he was a dead man bathing he could see it in wolfs eyes nothing like a hot dip before breakfast he said ah yes we also have not as yet breakfasted said wolf he stood up stretched and cleared the pool from a standing start vimess breeches were picked up and examined i threw inigos damn thing away said vimes i dont think a friend put it there it is all a great game your grace said wolf do not reproach yourself the strongest survive which is as it should be dee planned this did he wolf laughed the dear little dee oh he had a plan it was a good little plan although a touch insane happily it will no longer be required you want the dwarfs to go to war strength is good said wolf folding vimess clothes neatly but like some other good things it only remains good if it is not possessed by too many people he tossed the clothes as far as he could what is it you want me to say your grace wolf continued something like you are going to die anyway so i might as well tell you perhaps well itd be a help said vimes you are going to die anyway wolf smiled why dont you tell me talking gained time maybe those woodcutters and charcoal burners would be along at any minute if they hadnt brought their axes everyone was going to be in big trouble im pretty sure why the replica scone was stolen in ankhmorpork said vimes ive just got the inkling of an idea that a copy was made of it which was smuggled here on one of our coaches diplomats dont get searched well done shame igor came to unload when one of your boys was there wasnt it oh its hard to hurt an igor you dont care do you said vimes a bunch of dwarfs want albrecht on the thro the scone because they want to hang on to that oldtime certainty and you just want dwarfs fighting and old albrecht wouldnt even get the right scone back let us say that just now we find our interests converge shall we said wolf out of the corner of his eye vimes saw the other werewolves spreading out around the pool and now youve set me up he said pretty amateurishly id say but impressive because dee couldnt have had much time after he thought i was getting close it would have worked too people arent good eyewitnesses i know they believe what they want to see and what people told them they saw it was a nice touch giving me that damn oneshot he really must have hoped id kill to escape is it not time you got out of that pool said wolfgang you mean bath said vimes yes there was a wince vimes registered it oh youre walking upright and talking my lad and you look strong as an ox but something between a human and a wolf has a bit of dog in them doesnt it we have an ancient custom here said wolf looking away and it is a good one anyone can challenge us its a little chase the great game a competition if you like if they outrun us they win four hundred crowns that is a very good sum a man may start a small business with it of course as i can see you realize if they dont outrun us the question of money does not arise does anyone ever win said vimes come on woodcutters the people need wood sometimes if they train well and know the country many a successful man in bonk owes his start in life to our little custom in your case well give you oh an hours lead for the sport of it he pointed bonk is five miles in that direction the lore says that you must not enter a dwelling until you get there and if i dont run then it will be a really short event we do not like ankhmorpork we do not want you here thats odd said vimes wolfs broad brow wrinkled your meaning oh its just that everywhere i go in ankhmorpork i seem to bump into people who come from uberwald you see dwarfs trolls humans all beavering away quite happily and writing letters home saying come on its great here they dont eat you alive for a dollar wolfs lip curled revealing a glint of incisor vimes had seen that look on anguas face it meant she was having a bad hair day and a werewolf can have a bad hair day all over he pushed his luck it was clearly too weak to move by itself anguas getting on well vimes mister civilized ankhmorpork you will run hoping that his legs would support him vimes climbed out on the snow of the bank as slowly as he dared there was laughter from the werewolves you go into the water wearing clothes vimes looked down at his streaming legs youve never seen drawers before he said wolfs lip curled again he glanced triumphantly at the others behold civilization he said vimes puffed life into his cigar and looked around the frozen woodland with as much hauteur as he could muster four hundred crowns did you say he said yes vimes sneered at the forest again what is that in ankhmorpork dollars do you know about a dollar fifty the question will not arise wolf bellowed well i dont want to have to spend it all here run in the circumstances then i wont ask if you have the money on you vimes walked away from the werewolves glad that they couldnt see his face and very much aware that the skin on his back wanted to crawl around to his front he kept moving calmly his wet drawers beginning to crackle in the frosty air until he was certain he was out of sight of the pack so lets see theyve got better strength than you they know the country and if theyre as good as angua they could track a fart through a skunks breakfast and your legs hurt already so what are the pluses here well youve made wolf really angry vimes broke into a run not much of a plus there then all things considered vimes broke into a faster run off in the distance wolves began to howl there is a saying it wont get better if you picket corporal nobbs or rather guild president c w st j nobbs reflected on this a little early snow was fizzling in the air over the metal drum which in approved strike fashion was glowing redhot in front of the watch house a main problem as he saw it was that there was something philosophically wrong with picketing a building that no one except a watchman wanted to enter in any case it is impossible to keep people out of something that they dont want to go into it cant be done the chant hadnt worked an old lady had given him a penny colon colon colon out out out shouted reg shoe happily waving his placard that doesnt sound right reg said nobby sounds like surgery he looked at the other placards dorfl was holding a large closely worded text detailing their grievances in full with references to watch procedures and citing a number of philosophical texts constable visits sandwichboard on the other hand proclaimed what profiteth it a kingdom if the oxen be deflated riddles v somehow these cogent arguments did not seem to be bringing the city to its knees he turned at the sound of a coach pulling up and looked up at a door which had a crest consisting mainly ofa black shield and above that looking out of the window was the face of lord vetinari ah none other than corporal nobbs said lord vetinari at this point nobby would have given quite a lot to be anyone other than corporal nobbs he wasnt sure whether as a striker he should salute he saluted anyway on the basis that a salute was seldom out of place i gather you have withdrawn your labour lord vetinari went on in your case i am sure this presented a good deal of difficulty nobby wasnt certain about that sentence but the patrician seemed quite amiable cant stand by when the security of the citys concerned sir he said oozing affronted loyalty from every unblocked pore lord vetinari paused long enough for the peaceful everyday sounds of a city apparently on the brink of catastrophe to filter into nobbys consciousness well of course i wouldnt dream of interfering he said at last this is guild business im sure his grace will understand fully when he returns he banged on the side of the coach drive on and the coach was gone a thought that had been nudging nobby for some time chose this moment to besiege him once again mister vimes is going to go spare hes going to go mental lord vetinari sat back in his seat smiling to himself er did you mean that sir said the clerk drumknott who was sitting opposite certainly make a note to have the kitchen send them down cocoa and buns around three oclock anonymously of course its been a crimefree day drurnknott very unusual even the thieves guild is lying low yes my lord i cant imagine why when the cats away yes drumknott but mice are happily unencumbered by apprehensions of the future humans on the other hand are and they know that vimes is going to be back in a week or so drumknott and vimes will not be happy indeed he will not and when a commander of the watch is unhappy he tends to spread it around with a big shovel he smiled again this is the time for sensible men to be honest drumknott i only hope colon is stupid enough to let it continue the snow fell faster how beautiful the snow is sisters three women sat at the window of their lonely house looking out at the white uberwald winter and how cold the vind is said the second sister the third sister who was the youngest sighed why do we always talk about the weather what else is there well its either freezing cold or baking i mean thats it really that is how things are in mother uberwald said the oldest sister slowly and sternly the vind and the snow and the boiling heat of summer you know i bet if we cut down the cherry orchard we could put in a rollerskating rink no how about a conservatory we could grow pineapples no if we moved to bonk we could get a big apartment for the cost of this place this is our home irina said the oldest sister ah a home of lost illusions and thwarted hopes we could go out dancing and everything i remember when we lived in bonk said the middle sister dreamily things vere better then things vere alvays better then said the oldest sister the youngest sister sighed and looked out of the window she gasped theres a man running through the cherry orchard a man vot could he possibly vant the youngest sister strained to see it looks like he wants a pair of trousers ah said the middle sister dreamily trousers ver better then the hurrying pack stopped in a chilly blue valley when the howling filled the air angua loped back to the sledge lifted out her bag of clothes with her jaws glanced at carrot and disappeared among the drifts a few moments later she walked back again doing up her shirt wolfgangs got somepoor devil playing the game she said im going to put a stop to it it was bad enough that father kept the tradition going but at least he played fair wolfgang cheats they never win is this the game you told me about thats right but father played by the rules if the runner was bright and nimble he got four hundred crowns and father had him to dinner at the castle if he lost then your father had him for dinner out in the woods thank you for reminding me i was trying not to be nice you may have an undiscovered natural talent said angua but no one had to run is my point i wont apologize ive been a copper in ankhmorpork remember city motto you may not get killed actually its carrot i know and our family motto is homo homini lupus a man is a wolf to other men how stupid do you think they mean that men are shy and retiring and loyal and kill only to eat of course not they mean that men act like men towards other men and the worse they are the more they think theyd really like being wolves humans hate werewolves because they see the wolf in us but wolves hate us because they see the human inside and i dont blame them vimes veered away from the farmhouse and sprinted towards the nearby barn there had to be something in there even a couple of sacks would do the chafing qualities of frozen underwear can be seriously underestimated hed been running for half an hour well for twentyfive minutes really the other five had been spent limping wheezing clutching at his chest and wondering how you knew if you were having a heart attack the inside of the barn was barnlike there were stacks of hay dusty farm implements and a couple of threadbare sacks hanging on a nail he snatched one gratefully behind him the door creaked open he spun round clutching the sack to him and saw three very sombrely dressed women watching him carefully one of them was holding a kitchen knife in a trembling hand have you come here to ravish us she said madam im being pursued by werewolves the three looked at one another to vimes the sack suddenly seemed far too small er vill that take you all day said one of the women vimes held the sack more tightly ladies please i need trousers ve can see that and a weapon and boots if youve got them please they went into another huddle we have the gloomy and purposeless trousers of uncle vanya said one doubtfully he seldom wore them said another and i have an axe in my linen cupboard said the youngest she looked guiltily at the other two look just in case i ever needed it all right i wasnt going to chop anything down i would be so grateful said vimes he took in the good but old clothes the faded gentility and played the only card in his hand i am his grace the duke of ankh although i appreciate this fact is not evident at the there was a threefold sigh ankhmorpork you haf a magnificent opera house and many fine galleries such vonderful avenues a veritable heaven of culture and sophistication and unattached men of quality er i said ankhmorpork said vimes with an a and an m ve have always dreamed of going there ill have three coach tickets sent along immediately i get home said vimes his minds ear hearing the crunch of speeding paws over snow but dear ladies if you could fetch me those things they hurried away but the youngest lingered by the door do you have long cold winters in ankhmorpork she said just muck and slush usually any cherry orchards i dont think we have any im afraid she punched the air yesss a few minutes later vimes was alone in the barn wearing a pair of ancient black trousers that hed tied at the waist with rope and holding an axe that was surprisingly sharp he had five minutes perhaps wolves probably didnt stop to worry about heart attacks there was no point in simply running they could run faster he needed to stay near civilization and its hallmarks like trousers maybe time was on vimess side angua was never very talkative about her world but she had said that in either shape a werewolf slowly lost some of the skills of the other shape after several hours on two legs her sense of smell dropped from uncanny to merely good and after too long as a wolf it was like being drunk as far as vimes understood it a little inner part of you was still trying to give instructions but the rest of you was acting stupid the human part started to lose control he looked around the barn again there was a ladder to an upper gallery he climbed it and looked out of a glassless window across a snowy meadow there was a river in the distance and what looked very much like a boathouse now how would a werewolf think the werewolves slowed as they reached the building their leader glanced at a lieutenant and nodded it loped off in the direction of the boathouse the others followed wolf inside the last became human for a moment to pull the doors shut and drop the bar across wolf stopped near the centre of the barn hay had been scattered over the floor in great fluffy piles he scraped gently with a paw and wisps fell away from a rope that was stretched taut wolf took a deep breath the other werewolves sensing what was going to happen looked away there was a moment of struggling shapelessness and then he was rising slowly on two feet blinking in the dawn of humanity thats interesting thought vimes up on the gallery for a second or two after changing theyre not entirely up on current events oh your grace said wolf looking around a trap how very civilized he caught sight of vimes who was standing on the higher floor by the window what was it supposed to do your grace vimes reached down to the oil lamp it was supposed to be a decoy he said he hurled the lamp down on to the dry hay and flicked his cigar after it then he grabbed the axe and climbed through the window just as the spilled oil went whump vimes dropped into the deep snow and ran towards the boathouse there were other tracks leading to it not human when he reached the door he swung wildly at the darkness just inside and his reward was a cutoff yelp the skiff that was housed in the tumbledown shed was a quarter full of dark water but he didnt darethink about bailing yet he grabbed the dusty oars and rowed with considerable effort and not much speed out on to the river he groaned wolf was trotting across the snow with the rest of the pack behind him they all seemed to be there wolf cupped his hands very civilized your grace but you see when you set fire to a barn full of wolves they panic your grace but when theyre werewolves one of them just opens the door you cannot kill werewolves mister vimes tell that to the one in the boathouse vimes shouted as the current took the boat wolf looked into the shadows for a moment and then cupped his hands again he will recover mister vimes vimes swore under his breath because despite all his hopes a couple of werewolves had plunged into the water upstream and were swimming strongly towards the opposite bank but that was a doggy thing wasnt it leap joyfully into the water outdoors but fight like hell against a tub wolfgang had started to trot along the bank the ones in the water emerged on the far bank now they were keeping pace with the boat on both sides but the current was carrying it along faster now vimes started to bail with both hands you cant outrun the river wolf he shouted we don have to mister vimes that is not the question the question is can you outswim the waterfall see you later civilized vimes looked around in the distance the river had a foreshortened look when he concentrated the inner ear of terror could hear a distant roaring he snatched the oars again and tried to row upstream and yes it was possible to make headway against the current but he couldnt keep rowing faster than wolves could run and taking on two at once on the shore when they were ready and waiting for him was not an option if he went over the falls now he might get to the bottom before they did that wasnt a good sentence however he tried it he took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope if i make a couple of loops he thought i can strap the axe on to my back he had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body good morning vimes blinked a tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat are you death its the scythe isnt it people always notice the scythe im going to die possibly possibly you turn up when people are possibly going to die oh yes its quite the new thing its because of the uncertainty principle whats that im not sure thats very helpful i think it means people may or may not die i have to say its playing hob with my schedule but i try to keep up with modern thought the roar was a lot louder now vimes lay back in the boat and gripped the sides im talking to death he thought to take my mind off things didnt i see you last month i was chasing biggerthansmalldave dave along peach pie street and i fell off that ledge that is correct but i landed on that cart i didnt die but you might have done but i thought we all had some kind of hourglass thing that said when were going to die now the roar was almost physical vimes redoubled his grip on the boat oh yes you do said death but we might not no you will there is no doubt about that but you said yes it is a bit hard to understand isnt it apparently theres this thing called the trousers of time which is quite odd because time certainly doesnt the boat went over the waterfall vimes had a thunderous sensation of pounding thudding water followed by the echoing ringing in his ears as he hit the pool below he fought his way to what passed for the surface and felt the current take him slam him into a rock and then roll him away in the white water he flailed blindly and caught another rock his body swinging around into a pool of comparative calm as he fought for breath he saw a grey shape leaping from stone to stone and then another dose of hell was unleashed as it landed snarling beside him he grabbed it desperately and hung on as it struggled to bite him a paw flailed to gain purchase on the slippery stone and then in sudden difficulties responding automatically it changed it was as if the wolf shape became small and a man shape became bigger in the same space at the same time with a moment of horrible distortion as the two forms passed through one another and then there was that moment hed noticed before a second of confusion it was just long enough to ram the mans head against the rock with every ounce of strength he could scrape together vimes thought he heard a crack then he pushed himself back out into the current and let it carry him on while he simply struggled to stay near the surface there was blood in the water hed never killed someone with his bare hands before truth to tell hed never deliberately killed at all there had been deaths because when people are rolling down a roof and trying to strangle one another its sheer luck who is on top when they hit the ground but that was different he went to bed every night believing that his teeth were chattering and the bright sun made his eyes ache but he felt good he wanted to beat his chest and scream in fact theyd been trying to kill him make them stay wolves said a little inner voice the more time they spent on four legs the less bright theyd become a deeper voice red and raw from much much further inside said kill em all the rage was boiling up now fighting against the chill his feet touched bottom the river was broadening here into something wide enough to be called a lake a wide ledge of ice had crept out from the bank covered here and there with blown snow fog drifted across it fog with a sulphurous smell there were still cliffs on the far side of the river a solitary werewolf companion to the one now drifting on the current was watching him from the nearest bank clouds were sliding across the sun and snow was falling again in large raggedy flakes vimes waded to the rim of ice and tried to pull himself up out of the water but it creaked ominously under his weight and cracks zigzagged across its surface the wolf came closer moving with caution vimes made another desperate attempt a slab of ice came free and tipped up and he disappeared under the water the creature waited a few moments and then inched further out over the ice growling as fine cracks spread out like stars under its paws a shadow moved in the shallow water below it there was an explosion of water and breath as vimes broke through the ice under the werewolf grabbed it around the waist and fell back a claw ripped along vimess side but he gripped as hard as he could with arms and legs as they rolled under the ice it was a desperate test of lung capacity he knew but he wasnt the one whod just had the air squeezed out of him he held on while the water clanged in his ears and the thing scrabbled and scratched at him and then when there was nothing else left but to let go or drown he punched his way up to the air nothing lashed at him he cracked his way through the ice to the bank dropped on his hands and knees and threw up howling started all around the mountains vimes looked up blood was coursing down his arms the air stank of rotten eggs and there high on a hill a mile or so off was the clacks tower with its stone walls and door that could be bolted he stumbled forward the snow underfoot was already giving way to coarse grass and moss the air was hotter now but it was the clammy heat of a fever and he looked around and realized where he was there was bare dirt and rock in front of him but here and there parts of it were moving and going blup everywhere he looked there were fat geysers rings of ancient congealed yellow fat so old and rancid that even sam vimes wouldnt dip his toast in it unless he was really hungry encircled sizzling little pools there were even black floating bits which on second glance turned out to be insects that were slow learners in a hot fat situation vimes recalled something igor had said sometimes dwarfs working the high strata where the fat had congealed into a kind of tallow millennia ago found strange ancient animals perfectly preserved but fried to a crisp probably vimes found himself laughing out of sheer exhaustion probably battered to death mwahahaa the snow was falling heavily now making the fat pools spit he sagged to his knees he ached all over it wasnt just that his brain was writing cheques that his body couldnt cash it had gone beyond that now his feet were borrowing money that his legs hadnt got and his back muscles were looking for loose change under the sofa cushions and still nothing was coming up behind him surely they mustve crossed the river by now then he saw one he could have sworn it hadnt been there a moment ago another one trotted out from behind a nearby snowdrift they sat watching him come on then vimes yelled what are you waiting for the pools of fat hissed and bubbled around vimes it was warm here though if they werent going to move then neither was he he focused on a tree on the edge of the fat geysers it looked barely alive with greasy splashes on the end of the longer branches but it also looked climbable he concentrated on it tried to estimate the distance and the speed he might be capable of the werewolves turned to look at it too another one had entered the clearing at a different point there were three watching him now they werent going to run until he did he realized otherwise it wouldnt be fun he shrugged turned away from the tree and then turned back and ran by the time he was halfway there he was afraid his heart was going to climb up his throat but he ran on jumped awkwardly caught a low branch slipped struggled gasping to his feet grabbed the branch again and managed to pull himself up expecting at every second the first tiny puncture as teeth broke his skin he rocked on the greasy wood the werewolves hadnt moved but they were watching him with interest you bastards vimes growled they got up and picked their way carefully towards the tree without hurrying vimes climbed a little further up ankhmorpork mister civilized where are your weapons now ankhmorpork it was wolfgangs voice vimes peered around the snowdrifts which were already filling up with violet shadows as the afternoon died i got two of you he shouted yes they will have big headaches later on we are werewolves ankhmorpork quite hard to stop you said that you your mister sleeps could run much faster than you ankhmorpork fast enough no and the man with the little black hat could fight better than you too well enough no shouted wolfgang cheerfully vimes growled even assassins didnt deserve that kind of death itll be sunset soon he shouted yes i lied about the sunset well wake me up at dawn then i could do with the sleep you will freeze to death civilized man good vimes looked around at the other trees even if he could jump to one they were all conifers painful to land in and easy to fall out of ah this must be the famous ankhmorpork sense of humour yes no that was just irony vimes shouted still looking for an arboreal escape route youll know when weve got on to the famous ankhmorpork sense of humour when i start talking about breasts and farting you smug bastard so what were his options well he could stay in the tree and die or run for it and die of the two dying in one piece seemed better youre doing very well for a man of your age death was sitting on a higher branch of the tree are you following me or what are you familiar with the words death was his constant companion but i dont usually see you possibly you are in a state of heightened awareness caused by lack of food sleep and blood are you going to help me well yes when er when the pain is too much to bear death hesitated and then went on even as i say it i realize that this isnt the answer you were looking for however the sun was near the horizon now getting big and red racing the sun that was another uberwald sport wasnt it be home safe before the sun sets half a mile or more through deep snow on rising ground someone was climbing up the tree he felt it shake he looked down in the cold blue gloom a naked man was quietly pulling himself from branch to branch vimes was enraged they werent supposed to do this there was a grunt from below as the climber slipped and recovered on the greasy wood how are you feeling in yourself shut up even if you are a hallucination there must be something about werewolves he could use you have a seconds grace when they are changing shape but they knew he knew that no weapons thats what hed noticed in the castle you always got weapons in castles spears battleaxes ridiculous suits of armour huge old swords even the vampires had a few rapiers on the walls that was because sometimes even vampires had to use a weapon werewolves didnt even angua hesitated before reaching for a sword to a werewolf a physical weapon would always be the second choice vimes locked his legs together and swung around the branch as the werewolf came up he caught it a blow on the ear and as it looked up managed another blow right on the nose it gave him a ringing slap and that would have ended it except that it also pulled itself a little further up the tree and brought itself within the range of the vimes elbow it justified the capital letter it had triumphed in a number of street fights vimes had learned early on in his career that the graveyards were full of people whod read the marquis of fantailler the whole idea of fighting was to stop the other bloke hitting you as soon as possible it wasnt to earn marks vimes had often fought in circumstances where being able to use the hands freely was a luxury but it was amazing how a wellplaced elbow could make a point possibly assisted by a knee he drove it into the werewolfs throat and was rewarded with a horrible noise then he grabbed a handful of hair and pulled let go and slammed the palm of his hand into its face in a mad attempt to prevent it having a second to think he couldnt allow that he could see the size of the mans muscles the werewolf reacted instead there was that sudden moment of morphological inexactitude a nose turned into a muzzle while vimess fist was en route but when the wolf opened its mouth to lunge at him two things occurred to it one was that it was high in a tree not a tenable position for a shape designed for fastpaced living on the ground the other was gravity down there its the lore vimes panted as its paws scrabbled for purchase on the greasy branch but up here its me he reached up grabbed the branch above him and kicked down with his feet there was yelp and another yelp as the wolf slid and hit the next branch down about halfway towards the ground it tried to change back again combining in one falling shape all the qualities of something not good at staying in trees with something not good at landing on the ground gotcha screamed vimes in the forest all around a howling went up the branch he was clinging to snapped for a moment he hung by the gloomy trousers of uncle vanya caught on a snag and then their ancient fabric ripped off him and he dropped his progress was a little faster since the falling werewolf had removed a lot of branches on the way down but the landing was softer because the werewolf was just getting to its feet vimess flailing hand grabbed a broken branch a weapon thought more or less stopped when his fingers closed whatever replaced it in the pathways of his brain was gushing up from somewhere else thousands of years old the werewolf struggled up and turned on him the branch caught it across the side of the head steam rose off sir samuel vimes as he lurched forward snarling incoherently he smacked the club down again he roared there were no words there it was a sound from before words if there was any meaning in it at all it was a lament that he couldnt cause enough pain the wolf whined stumbled rolled over and changed the human extended a bleeding hand towards him in supplication pleease vimes hesitated club raised the red rage drained away he was on a freezing hillside against a cold sunset and theyd left him alone and he might just make it to the tower in one movement changing from man to wolf as it moved the werewolf sprang vimes went backwards into the snow he could feel the breath and the blood but not the pain no talons ripped no teeth tore and the weight was lifted hands pulled the body off him bit of a close one there sir said a voice cheerfully best not to give them any quarter really there was a spear right through the werewolf carrot well get a fire going its easy if you dip the wood in the fat springs first carrot i shouldnt think youve eaten theres not much game this close to the town but weve still got some carrot er yes sir what the hell are you doing here its all a bit complicated sir here let me help you up vimes shook him off as he tried to help him to his feet i got this far thank you i think im capable of standing up he said and forced his legs to support him you seem to have lost your trousers sir yes its the famous ankhmorpork sense of humour growled vimes only angua will be back soon and and sergeant anguas family captain are in the habit of running around the woods in the snow stark bol stark naked yes sir but i mean you know its not really ill give you five minutes to find a clothes shop shall i otherwise look where the hell are all the werewolves eh i was expecting to drop into a heap of snarling jaws and now youre here thank you very much and theres no werewolves gavins people chased them away sir you mustve heard the howl go up gavins people eh well thats good thats very good im pleased about that well done gavin now who the hell is gavin a howl went up from a distant hill thats gavin said carrot a wolf gavins a wolf ive been saved from werewolves by wolves its all right sir when you think about it its not really any different from being saved from werewolves by people when i think about it i think perhaps i was better off lying down said vimes weakly lets get to the sleigh sir i was trying to say we have got your clothes thats how angua tracked you ten minutes later vimes was sitting in front of a fire with a blanket around him and the world seemed to make a little more sense a slice of venison was going down well and vimes was far too hungry to bother much that the butcher appeared to have used his teeth the wolves spy on the werewolves he said sort of sir gavin keeps an eye on things for angua theyre old friends the moment of silence went on just slightly too long he sounds like a very bright wolf said vimes in the absence of anything more diplomatic to say more than that angua thinks he might be part werewolf from way back can that happen she says so did i tell you that he came all the way into ankhmorpork a big city can you imagine what that must have been like vimes turned at a faint sound behind him a large wolf was standing at the edge of the firelight it was looking at him intently it wasnt just the look of an animal sizing him up on the level of foodthreatthing behind that stare wheels were turning and there was a small but rather proud mongrel at his side scratching furiously is that gaspode said vimes the dog thats always hanging around the watch house yes he helped me get here said carrot i just dont want to ask said vimes any minute now a doors going to open in a tree and fred and nobby are going to step out am i right i hope not sir gavin lay down a short distance from the fire and started watching carrot captain said vimes yes sir youll notice i havent pressed you on why youre here as well as angua yes sir well said vimes and now he thought he recognized the look on gavins face even though it was on a face of an unusual shape it was the look you got on the face of a gentleman lounging on a corner by a bank watching the comings and goings seeing how the place worked i was admiring your diplomacy sir hmm what said vimes still staring at the wolf i appreciated the way you were avoiding asking questions sir angua walked into the firelight vimes saw her glance around the circle and squat down on the snow exactly halfway between carrot and gavin theyre miles away now oh hello mister vimes there was some more silence is anyone going to tell me something said vimes my family are trying to upset the coronation said angua theyre working with some dwarfs that dont want that want to keep uberwald separate i think ive worked that one out running for your life through a freezing cold forest gives you a bit of an insight i have to tell you sir my brother killed the clacks signallers his scents all over the place up there gavin made a noise in his throat and another man that gavin didnt recognize except that he spent a lot of time hiding in the forest and watching our castle i think that might have been a man called sleeps one of our agents said vimes he did well he managed to get to a boat a few miles downriver unfortunately there was a werewolf waiting in it it was a waterfall that did for me said vimes permission to speak honestly sir said angua dont you always they could have got you any time they liked sir really they could they wanted you to get as far as the tower before they really attacked i expect wolfgang thought thatd be nicely symbolic or something i got three of them yes sir but you wouldnt have been able to get three of them all at once wolfgang was having some fun thats how hes always played the game hes good at thinking ahead he likes ambushes he likes some poor soul to get within a few yards of the finish before he leaps out on them angua sighed look sir i dont want there to be trouble hes been killing people yes sir but my mothers just a rather ignorant snob and my fathers halfgone now he spends so much time as a wolf he hardly knows how to act human any more they dont live in the real world they really think uberwald can stay the same there isnt a lot up here really but its ours wolfgangs a murderous idiot who thinks that werewolves were born to rule the trouble is sir he hasnt broken the lore oh ye gods i bet he could find plenty of witnesses to say that he gave everyone the start the lore requires thats the rules of the game and meddling with the dwarfs affairs hes stolen the scone or swapped it or something i havent worked it all out yet but one poor dwarfs already dead because of it cheery and detritus are under arrest inigo is dead sybils locked up somewhere and youre saying its all okay things are different here sir said carrot it wasnt until ten years ago that they replaced trial by ordeal here with trial by lawyer and that was only because they found that lawyers were nastier ive got to get back to bonk if theyve harmed sybil i dont care what the damn lore is mister vimes you look done in as it is said carrot ill keep going come on get some of the wolves to pull the sleigh you dont get them to sir you ask gavin if they will said carrot oh er can you explain the situation to him im standing in the cold in the middle of a forest thought vimes a moment later watching a quite handsome young woman growling a conversation with a wolf who is watching her this does not often happen not in ankhmorpork anyway its probably a daily occurrence up here eventually six wolves allowed themselves to be harnessed and vimes was carried up the hill to the road stop sir said carrot i want a weapon theres got to be something in the tower i can use sir you can use my sword and theres the hunting spears you know what you can do with the hunting spears vimes kicked the door at the base of the tower fresh snow had blown in smoothing the edges of wolf and human tracks he felt drunk bits of his brain were going on and off his eyeballs felt as though they were lined with towelling his legs seemed only vaguely under his control surely the signallers mustve had something even the sacks and barrels had gone well there were plenty of peasants in the hills and winter was coming on and the men whod been here certainly had no further use for the food even vimes wouldnt call that theft he climbed up to the next floor the thrifty people of the forest had been up here too but they hadnt taken the bloodstains off the floor or inigos little round hat which inexplicably was wedged into the wooden wall he pulled it out and saw where the thin felt on the brim had been pushed back to reveal the razorsharp edge an assassins hat he thought and then no not an assassins hat he remembered the street fights hed seen when he was a kid among the harddrinking men who thought that even bareknuckle fighting was posh some of them would sew a razorblade into the brim of their cap for a bit of help in a melee this was the hat of a man who was always looking for that extra edge it hadnt worked here he dropped it on the floor and his eye caught in the gloom the box of mortars even that had been ransacked but the tubes had simply been scattered across the floor the gods alone knew what the scavengers thought they were he put them back in their box inigo was right about them at least a weapon so inaccurate that it probably couldnt hit a barn wall from inside the barn was no good as a weapon but other things had been scattered around too the men whod been living rough here had left a few personal items pictures had been thumbtacked to the wall there was a diary a pipe someones shaving gear boxes had been tipped out on the floor wed better be getting on sir said carrot from the ladder theyd been killed theyd been sent racing off into the dark with monsters at their heels and then some blankfaced peasants whod done nothing to help had come in here and picked over the little things theyd left behind damn it vimes growled and swept everything into a box and dragged it over to the ladder well drop this lot off at the embassy he said im not leaving anything here for scavengers dont think about arguing with me wouldnt dream of it sir wouldnt dream of it vimes paused carrot that wolf and angua he stopped how the hell did you continue a sentence like that theyre old friends sir they are there was nothing but the usual completely open honesty anywhere in carrots expression oh we thats good then vimes finished a minute later they were on their way again angua was running as a wolf far ahead of the sleigh alongside gavin gaspode had curled up under the blankets and here i am again thought vimes racing the sunset heavens know why im in the company of a werewolf and a wolf that looks worse and sitting in a sleigh drawn by wolves which i cant steer try looking that one up in the manual he dozed among the blankets halfopen eyes watching the disc of the sun flickering between pine trees how could you steal the scone from its cave hed said there were dozens of ways and there were but they were all risky they all depended too much on luck and sleepy guards and this didnt feel like a crime that was going to rely on luck it had to work the scone wasnt important it was important that the dwarfs ended in disarray no king violent arguments and fighting in the dark and it would stay dark in uberwald too and it seemed to be important that the king was blamed after all he was the one whod lost the scone whatever the plan was it had to be done quickly well the clacks would have been useful what had wolfgang said those clever men in ankhmorpork not dwarfs but men rubber sonky floating in his vat you dipped in a wooden hand and out of the vat you got a glove hand in glove it isnt where you put it its where people think it is thats what matters thats the magic he remembered the very first thought hed had when hed seen cheery staring at the floor of the scones cave and the little policemen in vimess head started to clamour what sir said carrot hmm vimes forced open his eyes you just shouted sir what did i shout you shouted the bloody thing was never bloody stolen sir the bastards i knew i nearly had it it all fits together if you dont think like a dwarf lets make sure sybil is all right and then captain were going to prod buttock sir right only one thing sir what you are an escaped criminal arent you for a moment there was only the sound of the runners skimming over the snow weell said vimes this isnt ankhmorpork i know everyone keeps telling me but captain wherever you are wherever you go watchmen are always watchmen a solitary light burned in the window captain colon sat by the candle staring at nothing regulations called for the watch house to be manned at all hours and thats what he was doing the floorboards in the room below creaked into a new position for many months now theyd been walked on around the clock because the main office never had fewer than half a dozen people in it chairs too accustomed to being warmed continuously by a relay of bottoms groaned gently as they cooled there was only one thought buzzing around fred colons head mister vimes is going to go completely bursar hes going to go totally librarianpoo his hand went down to the desk and came back automatically while he looked straight ahead there was the crunch of a sugar lump being eaten snow was falling again the watchman that vimes had named colonesque was leaning in his box by the hubward gate of bonk hed perfected the art and it was an art form of going to sleep upright with his eyes open it was one of the things you learned on endless nights a female voice by his ear said now there are two ways this could go his position didnt change he continued to stare straight ahead you havent seen anything thats the truth isnt it just nod he nodded once good man you didnt hear me arrive did you just nod nod so you wont know when ive gone am i right just nod nod you dont want any trouble just nod nod they dont pay you enough for this just nod this time the nod was quite emphatic you get more than your fair share of night watches as it is anyway colonesques jaw dropped whoever was standing in the shadows was clearly reading his mind good man you just stand here then and make sure no one steals the gate colonesque took care to continue to stare straight ahead he heard the thud and creak of the gate being opened and closed it occurred to him that the speaker had not in fact mentioned what the other way was and he was quite relieved about that what was the other way said vimes as they hurried through the snow wed go and look for another way in said angua there were few people on the streets which were whitening with the new snow again except where wisps of steam escaped from the occasional grating in uberwald it seemed sunset made its own curfew this was just as well because gavin was growling continuously under his breath carrot came back from the next corner theres dwarfs on guard all round the embassy he said they dont look open to negotiation sir vimes looked down they were standing on a grating captain tantony of the bonk watch was not happy with this duty hed been at the opera last night and later on hed thought he saw things happening in a way which the burgomaster had instructed him hadnt happened of course the thing to do was obey orders you were safe if you obeyed orders everyone in the watch knew that but these didnt feel like safe orders hed heard they did things differently in ankhmorpork milord vimes would arrest anyone they said tantony had set up a desk in the embassys hall so that he could keep an eye on the main doors hed taken some pains to position his men around the inside of the building he didnt trust the dwarfs on guard outside theyd said theyd got orders to kill vimes on sight and that didnt make any sense there had to be some sort of a trial didnt there there was a faint noise from upstairs he stood up carefully and reached for his crossbow corporal svetlz there was another little sound tantony went to the bottom of the stairs vimes appeared at the top of them there was blood on his shirt and crusted on the side of his face to the captains horror he began to walk down the steps i will shoot you thats the order is it said vimes yes stop there but if im going to be shot anyway theres no point in stopping is there said vimes i dont think youre the kind to do that captain youve got a brain vimes steadied himself on the banister rail shouldnt you have called for the rest of the guards by now by the way i tell you to stop you know who i am if youre going to fire that damn thing do it now but first i suggest it would be a really good career move to tug the bellpull over there whats the worst that would happen youve still got the bow pointed at me theres something you really ought to know tantony gave him a suspicious look but took a few steps sideways and tugged the rope igor stepped out from behind a pillar yeth marthter tell this young man where he is will you heth in ankhmorpork marthter said igor calmly see said vimes and dont glare at igor like that i missed it when he welcomed me here but its true this is an embassy my son he went on walking forwards again and that means its officially on the soil of the home country welcome to ankhmorpork theres thousands of uberwald people living in our city you dont want to go starting a war do you but but they said my orders you are a criminal the word is accused captain we dont kill people in ankhmorpork just because theyre accused well not on purpose and not because someone tells us to vimes took the crossbow out of tantonys unresisting hands and fired it into the ceiling now send your men away he said im in ankhmorpork said the captain even in his current state vimes thought he recognized the harmonics thats right he said putting an arm around him a city which incidentally always has a job in the watch for a young man of ability tantonys body stiffened he pushed vimess arm away you insult me milord this is my country ah vimes was aware of carrot and angua watching from the landing but i will not see it dishonoured either said the captain this isnt right i saw what happened last night you swept up the king and your troll caught the chandelier and then they said youd tried to kill the king and youd killed dwarfs when you escaped are you in charge of the watch here no thats the job of the burgomaster and who gives him his orders everyone said tantony bitterly vimes nodded been there he thought been there done that bought the doublet are you going to stop me taking my people out of here how can you do that the dwarfs surround us were going to use diplomatic channels just show me where everyone is and well be off if its any help i can hit you over the head and tie you up that will not be required the dwarf and the troll are in the cellar her ladyship is i assume shes wherever the baron took her vimes felt the little trickle of superheated ice down his spine took her he said hoarsely well yes tantony stepped back from vimess expression she knew the baroness sir she said they were old friends she said they could sort it all out and then tantonys voice became a mumble seared into silence by the look on vimess face when vimes spoke it was in a monotone as threatening as a spear you are standing there in your shiny breastplate and your silly helmet and your sword without a single notch in the blade and your stupid trousers and you are telling me that you let my wife be taken away by werewolves tantony took a step backwards it was the baron and you dont argue with barons right you dont argue with anyone do you know what im ashamed ashamed to think that something like you is called a watchman now give me those keys the man had gone red youve obeyed any orders said vimes dont even think about disobeying that one carrot reached the bottom of the stairs and put a hand on vimess shoulder steady mister vimes tantony looked from one to the other and made a life decision i hope you find your lady milord he produced a bunch of keys and handed them over i really do vimes still fighting for breath wordlessly passed the keys to carrot let them out he said are you going to the werewolves castle tantony panted yes you wont stand a chance milord they do as they please then theyve got to be stopped you cant the old one understood the rules but wolfgang he doesnt obey anything all the more reason to stop him then ah detritus the troll saluted youve got your bow i see treated you well did they dey called me a ficko troll said detritus darkly one of dem kicked me inna rocks was it this one no but he is their captain said vimes stepping away from tantony sergeant i order you shoot him down in one movement the troll had the crossbow balanced on his shoulder and was sighting along the massive package of arrows tantony went pale well go on said vimes it was an order sergeant detritus lowered the bow i aint dat fick sir i gave you an order den you can do wid dat order what boulder der lintel did wid his bag of gravel sir wid respect ocourse vimes walked across and patted the shaking tantony on his shoulder just making a point he said however saiddetritus if you can find der man dat kicked me inna rocks i should be happy to give him a flick around der earhole i know which one it was hes der one walkin wid der limp lady sybil drank her wine carefully it didnt taste very nice in fact quite a lot of things werent very nice she wasnt a good cook shed never been taught proper cookery at her school it had always been assumed that other people would be doing the cooking and that in any case it would be for fifty people using at least four types of fork such dishes as she had mastered were dainty things on doilies but she cooked for sam because she vaguely felt that a wife ought to and besides he was an eater who entirely matched her kitchen skills he liked burnt sausages and fried eggs that went boing when you tried to stick a fork in them if you gave him caviare hed want it in batter he was an easy man to feed if you always kept some lard in the house but the food here tasted as though it had been cooked by someone who had never even tried before shed seen the kitchens when serafine had given her the little tour and theyd just about do for a cottage the game larders on the other hand were the size of barns shed never seen so many dead things hanging up it was just that she was certain that venison shouldnt be served boiled with potatoes that were crunchy if they were potatoes of course potatoes werent usually grey even sam who liked the black lumpy bits you got in some mashed potatoes would have commented but sybil had been brought up properly if you cant find something nice to say about the food find something else to be nice about these are really very interesting plates she said dutifully er are you sure theres been no more news she tried to avoid watching the baron he was ignoring sybil and his wife and was prodding the meat around on his plate as if hed forgotten what a knife and fork were for wolfgang and his friends are still out searching said serafine but this is terrible weather for a man to be on the run he is not on the run snapped sybil sam is not guilty of anything of course of course all the evidence is circumstantial of course said the baroness soothingly now i suggest that as soon as they have the passes clear you and the er the staff get back to the safety of ankhmorpork before the real winter hits we know the country my dear if your husband is alive we can soon do something about it i will not have him shamed like this you saw him save the king im sure he did sybil im afraid i was talking to my husband at the time but i dont disbelieve you for a minute is it true that he killed all those men in the wilinus pass what but they were bandits at the other end of the table the baron had picked up a lump of meat and was trying to tear it apart with his teeth well of course yes of course sybil pinched the bridge of her nose most of her would not have considered sam vimes guilty of murder actual murder even on the evidence of three gods and a message written on the sky but stories did get back to her in a roundabout way sam got wound up about things sometimes he unwound all at once thered been that bad business with that little girl and those men over at dolly sisters and when sam had broken into the mens lodging he found one of them had stolen one of her shoes and shed heard detritus say that if he hadnt been there only sam would have walked out of the room alive she shook her head i really would like a bath she said there was a clatter from the other end of the table dear you will have to eat your dinner in the changing room said the baroness without looking round she flashed lady sybil a brief brittle smile we do not in fact have a have such a a device in the castle a thought occurred to her we use the hot springs so much more hygienic out in the forest oh its quite close and a quick run around in the snow really tones up the body i think perhaps ill have a liedown instead said lady sybil firmly but thank you all the same she made her way to the musty bedroom fuming in a ladylike way she couldntbring herself to like serafine and this was shocking because lady sybil even liked nobby nobbs and that took breeding but the werewolf scraped across her nerves like a file she remembered that shed never liked her at school either among the other unwanted baggage that had been heaped on the young sybil to hamper her progress through life was the injunction to be pleasant to people and say helpful things people took this to mean that she didnt think shed hated the way serafine had talked about dwarfs shed called them subhuman well obviously most of them lived underground but sybil rather liked dwarfs and serafine spoke of trolls as if they were things sybil hadnt met many trolls but the ones she knew seemed to spend their lives raising their children and looking for the next dollar just like everyone else worst of all serafine simply assumed that sybil would naturally agree with her stupid opinions because she was a lady sybil ramkin had not had an education in these things moral philosophy not having featured much in a curriculum that was heavy on flowerarranging but she had a shrewd idea that in any possible debate the right side was where serafine wasnt shed only ever written all those letters to her because it was what you did you always wrote letters to old friends even if you werent very friendly with them she sat on the bed and stared at the wall until the shouting started and when the shouting started she knew sam was alive and well because only sam made people that angry she heard the key click in the lock sybil rebelled she was large and she was kind she hadnt enjoyed school much a society of girls is not a good one in which to be large and kind because people are inclined to interpret that as stupid and worse deaf lady sybil looked out of the window she was two floors up there were bars across it but theyd been designed to keep something out from the inside they could be lifted out of their slots and there were musty but heavy sheets and blankets on the bed none of this might have suggested very much to the average person but life in a rather strict school for well broughtup young ladies can give someone a real insight into the tricks of escapology five minutes after the key had turned there was only one bar in the window and it was jerking and creaking in the stonework suggesting that quite a heavy weight was on the sheets that had been neatly knotted around it torches streamed along the castle walls the ghastly red and black flag snapped in the wind vimes looked over the side of the badge the water was a long way down and pure white even before it reached the waterfall forward and back were the only possible directions here he reviewed his troops unfortunately this did not take long even a policeman could count up to five then there was gavin and his wolves who were lurking in the trees and finally very definitely finally there was gaspode the corporal nobbs of the canine world whod attached himself to the group uninvited what else was on his side well the enemy preferred not to use weapons this bonus evaporated somewhat when you remembered that they had at will some very nasty teeth and claws he sighed and turned to angua i know this is your family he said i wont blame you if you hang back well see sir shall we how are we going to get in sir said carrot how would you go about it carrot well id start by knocking sir really sergeant detritus forward please sir blow the bloody doors off yessir vines turned back to carrot as the troll gazed thoughtfully at the door and began making extra turns on his crossbows winch grunting as the springs fought back their fight was unsuccessful this isnt ankhmorpork see said vines detritus hoisted the bow on to his shoulders and took a step forward there was a thunk vines didnt see the bundle of arrows leave the bow they were probably already fragments by the time theyd gone a few feet halfway towards the doors the expanding cloud of splinters exploded into flame from the air friction what hit the doors was a fireball as angry and unstoppable as the fifth elephant and travelling at an appreciable fraction of local lightspeed my gods detritus muttered vines as the thunder died away thats not a crossbow thats a national emergency a few bits of charred door crashed on to the cobbles the wolves wont come in mister vines said angua gavin will follow me but they wont come not even for him why not because theyre wolves sir they dont feel at home in houses the only sound was the squeaksqueak of detritus winding up his bow again the hell with it said vines drawing his sword and stepping forward lady sybil untucked her dress from her underwear and stepped carefully across the little courtyard she was somewhere around the rear of the castle as far as she could make out she flattened herself as best she could against the wall when she heard a sound and tightened her grip on one of the iron bars that had formerly graced the window a large wolf came around the corner holding a bone in its mouth it did not look as if it was expecting her and it certainly wasnt expecting the iron bar oh im terribly sorry said sybil automatically as it folded up on to the cobbles there was an explosion on the other side of the castle that sounded like sam do you think they heard us sir said carrot captain people in ankhmorpork probably heard us so where are all the werewolves angua pushed forward this way she said she led them up a flight of low steps and tried one of the doors to the keep it swung back slowly there were torches in the hall too theyll leave us somewhere to run she said we always leave people somewhere to run a pair of smaller doors at the far end of the hall were pushed open no handles vines noted paws cant use handles wolfgang stepped in a couple of dozen werewolves escorted him fanning out around the room and sitting down sprawling down and then watching the intruders with keen interest ah civilized said wolfgang cheerfully you won the game would you like another go when people have a second game we give them a handicap we bite one of their legs off good joke hey i think i prefer the ankhmorpork sense of humour said vimes wheres my wife you bastard he could still hear the sound of detritus winding that was the trouble with the big bow it was only a quickfire weapon by geological standards and delphine look at what the dog dragged in said wolfgang ignoring vimes he stepped forward vimes heard a growl begin in anguas throat a sound which would cause instant obedience in many of ankhmorporks criminal population when they encountered it in a dark alley there was a deeper rumble from gavin wolfgang stopped you havent got the brains for this wolfie said angua and you couldnt plot your way out of a wet paper bag wheres mother she looked around at the lolling werewolves hello uncle ulf aunt hilda magweri nancy unity the packs all here then except for father who i expect is off rolling in something what a family i want these disgusting people out of here right away said the baroness stepping into the hall she glared at detritus how dare you bring a troll into this house okay its all wound up said detritus cheerfully hoisting the humming bow on to his shoulder where should i fire it mister vimes good grief not in here this is an enclosed building only until i pull dis trigger sir how very civilized said the baroness how very ankhmorpork you think you merely have to threaten and the lesser races back down eh have you seen your gates lately said vimes were werewolves snapped the baroness and it was a snap the words sharp and clipped as though they were barked stupid toys like that dont frighten us but itll slow you down for a while now bring out lady sybil lady sybil is resting you are in no position to make demands mister vimes we are not the criminals here as vimess mouth dropped open she went on the game is not against the lore it has been played for a thousand years and what else is it that you think we have done stolen the dwarfs pet rock we you know it wasnt stolen said vimes and i know you know nothing you suspect everything you have that kind of mind your son said my son unfortunately has honed to perfection every muscle in his body except the ones for thinking with said the baroness in civilized ankhmorpork i daresay you can barge into peoples houses and stamp around but here in our barbaric backwater the lore requires something beyond mere assertion i can smell the fear said angua its pouring off you mother sam they looked up lady sybil was standing at the top of some stone stairs leading to a lower floor looking bewildered and angry she was holding an iron bar with a bend in it sybil she told me you were on the run and they were all trying to save you but that wasnt right was it its a terrible thing to admit to yourself but when the shoulderblades are pressed firmly against the brickwork then any weapon will do and right now vimes saw sybil loaded and ready to fire she got on with people practically from the moment shed been able to talk shed been taught how to listen and when sybil listened to people she made them feel good about themselves it was probably something to do with being a a big girl she tried to make herself seem small and by default that made those around her feel bigger she got on with people almost as well as carrot did no wonder even the dwarfs liked her she had pages to herself in twurps peerage huge ancestral anchors biting into the past and dwarfs also respected someone who knew their greatgreatgreatgrandfathers full name and sybil couldnt lie you could see her redden when she tried it sybil was a rock she made detritus look like a sponge weve been having a lovely run in the woods dear he said now please come here because i think were going to see the king and im going to tell him everything ive worked it out at last the dwarfs will kill you said the baroness i can probably outrun a dwarf said vimes and now were leaving angua angua hadnt moved her eyes were still fixed on her mother and she was still growling vimes recognized the signs you spotted them in the bars of ankhmorpork every saturday night hackles rose and people climbed up them and then all that was needed was for someone to break a bottle or blink we are leaving angua he repeated the other werewolves were standing up and stretching carrot reached out and took her arm she turned snarling it was over in a fraction of a second and in reality her head had hardly moved before she got a grip on herself sor thiz iz the boy said the baroness her voice slurring you betrrray yourrr people for thizz her ears were lengthening vimes was sure the muscles in her face were moving strangely too and what else hass ankhmorrporrk taught you angua shuddered selfcontrol she muttered lets go mister vimes the werewolves closed in as they backed towards the steps dont turn your back said angua levelly dont run dont need telling said vimes he was watching wolfgang who was moving obliquely across the floor his eyes fixed on the retreating party theyll have to bunch up to follow us through the doorway he thought he glanced at detritus the giant crossbow was weaving back and forth as the troll tried to keep all the wolves in the field of fire fire it said angua but theyre your family said sybil theyll heal soon enough believe me detritus dont shoot unless you have to vimes ordered as they headed towards the drawbridge he has to now said angua sooner or later wolfgang will leap and the others will take theres something you ought to know sir said cheery you really ought to know it sir its really important vimes looked across the drawbridge figures massed in the dark torchlight glinted off armour and weaponry blocking the way well things couldnt get any worse he said oh they could if there were snakes on here with us said lady sybil carrot turned at the sound of vimess snort of laughter sir oh nothing captain keep your eyes on the bastards will you we can deal with the soldiers later just say the word sir said detritus you arrre trrapped now snarled the baroness watchman do yourr duty a figure was walking across the bridge carrying a torch captain tantony reached vimes and glared at him stand aside sir he said stand aside or by gods ambassador or not ill arrest you their eyes met then vimes looked away lets let him through he said the mans decided hes got a duty to do tantony nodded slightly and then marched on across the bridge until he was a few feet from the baroness he saluted take these people away she said lady serafine von uberwald said tantony woodenly you know who i am man i wish to talk to you concerning certain charges made in my presence vimes closed his eyes oh you poor dumb idiot i didnt mean you to actually you what said the baroness it has been alleged my lady that a member or members of your family have been involved in a conspiracy to how darrre you screamed serafine and wolfgang leapt and the future became a series of flickering images in midair he changed into a wolf vimes grabbed the bottom of detrituss bow and forced it upwards at the same time as the troll pulled the trigger carrot was running before wolfgang landed on captain tantonys chest the sound of the bow echoed around the castle above the noise of a thousand whirring fragments scything through the sky carrot reached wolfgang in a flat dive he hit the wolf with his shoulder and the two of them were bowled over then like some moving magic lantern show coming back up to speed the scene exploded carrot got to his feet and it must be because were abroad thought vimes hes trying to do things properly hed squared up to the werewolf fists balled a stance taken straight from fig l of the noble art of fisticuffs which looked impressive right up to the point when your opponent broke your nose with a quart mug carrot had a punch like an iron bar and he landed a couple of heavy blows on wolfgang as he got up the werewolf seemed more puzzled than hurt then he changed shape caught a fist in both hands and gripped it hard to vimess horror he stepped forward without apparent effort forcing carrot back dont try anything angua said wolf grinning happily or else ill break his arm oh perhaps ill break his arm anyway yes vimes even heard the crack carrot went white someone holding a broken arm has all the control they need another idiot thought vimes when theyre down you dont let them get back up damn the marquis of fantailler policing by consent was a good theory but you had to get your opponent to lie still first ah and he has other bones said wolfgang pushing carrot away he glanced towards angua get back get back or ill hurt him some more no i shall hurt him some more anyway then carrot kicked him in the stomach wolfgang went over backwards but turned this into a backflip and a midair spin he landed lightly leapt back at the astonished carrot and punched him twice in the chest the blows sounded like shovels hitting wet concrete wolfgang grabbed the falling man lifted him over his head with one hand and hurled him down on to the bridge in front of angua civilized man he shouted here he is sister vimes heard a sound down beside him gavin was watching intently making urgent little noises in his throat a tiny part of vimes the little rockhard core of cynicism thought all right for you then steam was rising off wolfgang he shone in the torchlight the blond hair across his shoulders gleamed like a slipped halo angua knelt down by the body face impassive vimes had been expecting a scream of rage he heard her crying beside vimes gavin whined vimes stared down at the wolf he looked at angua trying to lift carrot and then he looked at wolfgang and then back again anyone else said wolfgang dancing back and forth on the boards how about you civilized sam hissed sybil you cant vimes drew his sword it wouldnt make any difference now wolfgang wasnt playing now he wasnt punching and running away those arms could push a fist through vimess ribcage and out the other side a blur went past at shoulder height gavin struck wolfgang in the throat knocking him over they rolled across the bridge wolfgang changing back to wolf shape to lock jaw against jaw they broke circled and went for one another again dreamlike vimes heard a small voice say he wouldnt last five minutes back home fightin like that the silly buggers gonna get creamed fightin like that stuff the marquis of flamin fantailler gaspode was sitting bolt upright stubby tail vibrating the daftie this is how you win a dogfight as the wolves rolled over and over wolfgang tearing at gavins belly gaspode arrived growling and yapping and launched himself in the general direction of the werewolfs hindquarters there was a yip gaspodes growls became somewhat muffled wolfgang leapt vertically gavin sprang the three hit the parapet of the bridge together knocked the crumbling stones aside hung for a moment in a snarling ball and then dropped down into the roaring whiteness of the river the whole of it from the moment tantony had crossed the bridge had taken much less than a minute the baroness was staring down into the gorge keeping his eye on her vimes spoke to detritus are you sure youre werewolfproof sergeant pretty much sir anyway i got the bow wound up again go into the castle and fetch the resident igor then said vimes calmly if anyone even tries to stop you shoot them and shoot anyone standing near them no problem about dat sir were not at home to mister reasonable sergeant i do not hear him knockin sir go to it then sergeant angua she did not look up sergeant angua now she looked up how can you be so so cool she snarled hes hurt i know go and talk to those watchmen hanging around on the other end of the bridge they look scared i dont want any accidents were going to need them cheery cover carrot and the lad with something keep them warm i wish there was something to keep me warm he thought the thoughts came slowly like drips of freezing water he felt that ice would crackle off him if he moved that frost would sparkle in his footsteps that his mind was full of crisp snow and now madam he said turning back to the baroness you will give me the scone of stone hell be back hissed the baroness that fall was nothing and hell find you for the last time the stone of the dwarfs the wolves are waiting out there the dwarfs are waiting down in the city give me the stone and we all might survive this is diplomacy dont let me try anything else i have only to say the word angua began to growl sybil strode towards the baroness and grabbed her you never answered a single letter all those years i wrote to you the baroness stared at her in amazement as people so often did when struck with sybils sharp non sequiturs if you know weve got the scone she said to vimes then you know its not the real one and much good may it do the dwarfs yes you had it made in ankhmorpork made in ankhmorpork they should have stamped it on the bottom but someone killed the man who did it thats murder its against the law vimes nodded at the baroness its a thing we have gaspode dragged himself out of the water and stood shivering on the shingle every single part of him felt bruised there was a nasty ringing noise in his ears blood dripped down one leg the last few minutes had been a little hazy but he did recall theyd involved a lot of water that had hit him like hammers he shook himself his coat jangled where the water was already freezing out of habit he walked over to the nearest tree and wincing raised a leg excuse me a busy reflective silence followed that was not a good thing you just did said gaspode im sorry perhaps this is not the right moment not for me no you may have caused some physical damage here its hard to know what to say trees dont normally talk back is my point gaspode sighed so what happens now i beg your pardon im dead right no no one is more surprised than me i may say but your time does not appear to be now death pulled out an hourglass held it up against the cold stars for a moment and stalked away along the riverbank scuse me theres no chance of a lift is there said gaspode struggling after him none whatsoever only being a short dog in deep snow is not good for the of wossnames if you get my death had stopped at a little bay an indistinct shape lay in a few inches of water oh said gaspode death leaned down there was a flash of blue and then he vanished gaspode shivered he paddled into the water and nudged gavins sodden fur with his nose shouldnt be like this he whined if you was a human theyd put you in a big boat on the tide and set fire to it an everyoned see shouldnt just be you an me down here in the cold there was something that had to be done too he knew it in his bones he crawled back to the bank and pulled himself up on to the trunk of a fallen willow he cleared his throat then he howled it started badly hesitantly but it picked up and got stronger richer and when he paused for breath the howl went on and on passing from throat to throat across the forest the sound wrapped him as he slid off the log and struggled on towards higher ground it lifted him over the deeper snow it wound around the trees a plaiting of many voices becoming something with a life of its own he remembered thinking maybe itll even get as far as ankhmorpork maybe itll get much further than that vimes was impressed by the baroness she fought back in a corner i know nothing about any deaths a howl came up from the forest how many wolves were there you never saw them and then when they cried out it sounded as though there was one behind every tree this one went on and on it sounded like a cry thrown into a lake of air the ripples spreading out across the mountains angua threw her head back and screamed then breath hissing between her teeth she advanced on the baroness fingers flexing give him the damn stone she hissed will any of you face me now then give him the stone what theemth to be the trouble igor lurched through the stricken gates trailed by detritus he caught sight of the two bodies and hurried over like a very large spider fetch the stone growled angua and then we will leave i can smell it or do you want me to take it serafine glared at her then turned on her heel and ran back into the ruins of the castle the other werewolves shrank back from angua as if her stare was a whip if you cant help these men said vimes to the kneeling igor your future does not look good igor nodded thith one he said indicating tantony fleth woundth i can thtitch him up a treat no problem thith one he tapped carrot nasty break on the arm he glanced up marthter wolfgang been playing again can you make him well snapped vimes no itth hith lucky day said igor i can make him better ive got thome kidneyth jutht in a lovely little pair belonged to young mithter crapanthy hardly touched a drop of thtrong licker thame about the avalanche does he need them said angua no but you thould never mith an opportunity to improve yourthelf i alwayth thay igor grinned it was a strange sight the scars crawled around his face like caterpillars just see to the arm said vimes firmly the baroness reappeared flanked by several werewolves they also backed away as angua spun around take it said serafine take the wretched thing its a fake no crime has been committed im a policeman said vimes i can always find a crime the sleigh slid under its own weight down the track towards bonk the towns watchmen running alongside it and giving it the occasional push with their captain down they were lost and bewildered and in no mood to take orders from vimes but they did what angua commanded because angua was of the class that traditionally gave them orders the two casualties were bedded down on blankets angua said vimes yes sir theres wolves keeping pace with us i can see them running between the trees i know are they on our side lets just say theyre not on anyone elses side yet shall we they dont like me much but they know gavin did and right now thats whats important some of them are out looking for my brother would he have survived that it was a long way down well it wasnt fire or silver theres nothing but white water for miles it probably hurt a lot but we heal amazingly well sir look im sorry that no mister vimes youre not you shouldnt be carrot just didnt understand what wolfgang is like you cant beat something like him in a fair fight i know hes family but personal is not the same as important carrot always said that says that said lady sybil sharply yes carrot opened his eyes what happened back there he said wolfgang hit you said angua she wiped his brow what with carrot tried to push himself upwards winced and fell back what have i always told you about the marquis of fantailler said vimes sorry sir something bright rose from the distant forests it vanished and then a green light expanded into existence a moment later came the pop of the flare the signallers have got to the tower said vimes cant this damn thing go any faster said angua i mean we can contact ankhmorpork said vimes after everything he felt curiously cheered by this it was as if a special human howl had gone up he wasnt floundering around loose now he was floundering on the end of a very long line that made all the difference it was a small public room over a shop in bonk and since it belonged to everybody it looked as though it didnt belong to anyone there was dust in the corners and the chairs that were currently arranged in a ragged circle had been chosen for their ability to be stacked neatly rather than sat on comfortably lady margolotta smiled at the assembled vampires she liked these meetings the rest of the group were a pretty mixed bunch and she wondered what their motives were but perhaps they at least shared one conviction that what you were made as wasnt what you had to be or what you might become and the trick was to start small suck but dont impale little steps and then you found that what you really wanted was power and there were much politer ways of getting it and then you realized that power was a bauble any thug had power the true prize was control lord vetinari knew that when heavy weights were balanced on the scales the trick was to know where to place your thumb and all control started with the self she stood up they watched her with slightly worried yet friendly faces my name in the short form is lady margolotta amaya katerina assumpta crassina von uberwald and i am a vampire they chorused hello lady margolotta amaya katerina assumpta crassina von uberwald it has been almost four years now said lady margolotta and i am still taking vun night at a time vun neck would always be vun too many but there are compensations there were no guards on the gate of bonk but there was a cluster of dwarfs outside the embassy as the sleigh slid to a halt the wolves in the traces jerked nervously and whined at angua ill have to let them go she said getting out theyve only come this far because theyre frightened of me vimes wasnt surprised at the moment anything would be frightened of angua even so a squad of dwarfs was hurrying to the sledge itd take them a few seconds to get a grip on things vimes realized there were uptown guards here and an igor and a werewolf theyd be puzzled as well as suspicious that should give him a tiny crack to lever open and ashamed as he was to say it an arrogant bastard always had the edge he glared at the lead dwarf what is your name he demanded you are under you know the scone of stone was stolen you what vimes reached round and pulled a sack out of the sleigh bring those torches closer he shouted and because he delivered the command in a tone that said there was no doubt that itd be obeyed it was obeyed ive got twenty seconds he thought and then the magic goes away now look at this he said lifting the thing out of the sack several dwarfs fell to their knees the murmuring spread out another howl another rumour in his current state he could see in his minds bloodshot eye the towers in the night clicking and clacking delivering to genua exactly the message that had been sent from ankhmorpork i want to take this to the king he said in the hushed silence we will take it the dwarf began moving forward vimes stepped aside good evenin boys said detritus standing up in the sleigh the tortured noises the bows springs were making under their preternatural stress sounded like some metal animal in extreme pain the dwarf was a couple of feet away from several dozen arrow points on the other hand said vimes we could continue talking you look like a dwarf who likes to talk the dwarf nodded first of all is there any reason why the two wounded men i have here couldnt be taken inside before they die of their wounds the bow twitched in detrituss hands the dwarf nodded they can go inside and be treated said vimes the dwarf nodded again still looking into a bundle of arrows bigger than his head capital see how we get on when we simply talk and now i suggest that you arrest me you want me to arrest you yes and lady sybil we place ourselves under your personal jurisdiction thats right said sybil i demand to be arrested she drew herself up and out righteous indignation radiating like a bonfire causing the dwarfs to back away from what was clearly an unexploded bosom and since the arrest of its ambassador will certainly cause difficulties with ankhmorpork vimes went on i strongly suggest you take us directly to the king by blessed chance the distant tower sent up another flare green light illuminated the snows for a moment whats that mean said the dwarf captain it means that ankhmorpork knows whats going on said vimes praying that it did and i dont reckon you want to be the dwarf who started the war the dwarf spoke to the dwarf beside him a third dwarf joined them vimes couldnt follow the hurried conversation but right behind him cheery whispered its a bit beyond him he doesnt want anything to happen to the scone good the dwarf turned back to vimes what about the troll oh detritus will stay in the embassy said vimes this seemed to lighten the tone of the debate somewhat but it still appeared to be heavy going whats happening now whispered vimes theres no precedent for anything like this muttered cheery youre supposed to be an assassin but youve come back to see the king and youve got the scone no precedent said sybil yes there bloody well is pardon my klatchian she took a deep breath and began to sing oh said cheery shocked what said vimes the dwarfs were staring at lady sybil as she changed up through the gears into full operatic voice for an amateur soprano she had an impressive delivery and range a touch too wobbly for the professional stage but exactly the kind of high coloratura to impress the dwarfs snow slid off roofs icicles vibrated good grief thought vimes impressed with a spiky corset and a hat with wings on it she could be ferrying dead warriors off a battlefield its ironhammers ransom song said cheery every dwarf knows it er it doesnt translate well but i come now to ransom my love i bring a gift of great wealth none but the king can have power over me now standing in my way is against all the laws of the world the value of truth is greater than gold er theres always been some debate about that last line sir but its generally considered acceptable if its a really big truth vimes looked at the dwarfs they were fascinated and one or two of them were mouthing along to the words is it going to work he whispered its hard to think of a bigger precedent than this sir i mean its the song of songs the ultimate appeal its built into dwarf law almost they cant refuse itd be not being a dwarf sir as vimes watched one dwarf pulled a fine chainmail handkerchief out of his pocket and blew his nose with a wet jingling noise several others were in tears when the last note died away there was silence and then the sudden thunder of axes banging on shields its all right said cheery theyre clapping sybil panting with the effort turned to her husband she gleamed in the torchlight do you think that was all right she said by the sound of it youre an honorary dwarf said vimes he held out his arm shall we go news was going on ahead dwarfs were pouring out of the entrance to downtown when the duke and duchess arrived there were dwarfs behind them now they were being swept along and all the time hands reached out to touch the scone as it passed dwarfs crowded into the elevator with them down below the roar of conversation stopped abruptly as vimes stepped out and raised the scone above his head then the rock echoed and reechoed to one enormous cheer they cant even see it thought vimes to most of them its a tiny white dot and that was what the plotters had known wasnt it you dont have to steal something to hold it hostage they are to be arrested dee was hurrying forward with more guards behind him again said vimes he kept the scone aloft you attempted to kill the king you escaped from your cell thats something about which we could hear more evidence said vimes as calmly as he could the scone was heavy you cant keep people in the dark all the time dee you shall certainly not see the king then i will drop the scone do so it wont vimes heard the gasp of the dwarfs behind him it wont what he said quietly it wont matter but this is the scone one of the dwarfs that had accompanied them from the embassy shouted something and several others took it up precedent is on your side cheery translated they say they can always kill you after youve seen the king well not exactly what i was hoping but itll have to do vimes looked at dee again you said you wanted me to find the thing didnt you and now how fitting that i return it to its rightful owner you the king is you may give it to me said dee pulling himself up to the height of vimess chest absolutely not snapped lady sybil when ironhammer returned the scone to bloodaxe would he have given it to slogram there was a general chorus of dissent of course not said dee slogram was a trait he stopped i think said vimes that we had better see the king dont you you cant demand that vimes indicated the press of dwarfs behind them youre going to be amazed at how difficult its going to be for you explaining that to them he said it took half an hour to see the king he had to be roused he had to dress kings dont hurry in the meantime vimes and sybil sat in an anteroom on chairs too small for them surrounded by dwarfs who werent themselves sure if they were a prisoner escort or an honour guard other dwarfs were peering around the doorway vimes could hear the buzz of excited conversation they werent wasting much time looking at him their gaze always fell on the scone that he held in his lap it was clear that most of them hadnt even seen it before you poor little sods he thought this is what you all believe in and before the days out youre going to be told its just a bad fake youll see its a forgery and that about wraps it up for your little world doesnt it i set out to solve a crime and im going to end up committing a bigger one im going to be lucky to get out of here alive arent i a door was rolled open a couple of what vimes thought of as the heavy dwarfs stepped through and gave everyone the official professional look which said that for your comfort and convenience we have decided not to kill you right at this very moment the king entered rubbing his hands ah your excellency he said pronouncing the word as a statement of fact rather than a welcome i see you have something that belongs to us dee detached himself from the crowd at the door i must make a serious accusation sire he said really bring these people into the law room under guard of course he swept away vimes looked at sybil and shrugged they followed the king leaving the hubbub of the main cavern behind once again vimes was in the room with too many shelves and too few candles the king sat down is the scone heavy your excellency yes it is weighted with history see put it down on the table with extreme care please and dee that thing said dee pointing a finger that thing is a fake a copy a forgery made in ankhmorpork part of a plot which i am sure can be proven involves milord vimes it is not the scone the king lifted a candle a little closer to the scone and gave it a critical look from several angles i have seen the scone many times before he said at last and i would say that this appears to be the true thing and the whole of the thing sire i demand that is i advise you to demand a closer inspection sire really said the king mildly well i am not an expert see but we are fortunate are we not that albrecht albrechtson is here for the coronation all of dwarfdom knows i think that he is the authority on the scone and its history have him summoned i daresay he is close at hand i should think just about everyone is on the other side of that door now indeed sire the look of triumph on dees face as he swept past vimes was almost obscene i think were going to need another song to get us out of this one dear murmured vimes im afraid i can only remember that one sam the others were mainly about gold dee returned with albrecht and a following of other senior and somewhat magisterial dwarfs ah albrecht said the king do you see this on the table it is claimed that this is not the true thing and the whole of the thing your opinion is sought please the king nodded at vimes my friend understands morporkian your excellency he just chooses not to pollute the air by speaking it just his way see albrecht glared at vimes and then stepped up to the table he looked at the scone from several angles he moved the candles and leaned down so that he could inspect the crust closely he took a knife from his belt tapped the scone with it and listened with ferocious care to the note produced he turned the scone over he sniffed at it he stood back his face screwed up in a scowl and then said h gradz the dwarfs muttered among themselves and then one by one nodded to vimess horror albrecht chipped a tiny piece from the scone and put it in his mouth plaster thought vimes fresh plaster from ankhmorpork and dee will talk his way out of it albrecht spat the piece out into his hand and looked up at the ceiling for a moment while he chewed then he and the king exchanged a long thoughtful stare pakga said albrecht at last a pakagaad behind the outbreak of murmuring vimes heard cheery translate it is the thing and the whole of yes yes said vimes and he thought by gods were good ankhmorpork im proud of you when we make a forgery its better than the real damn thing unless unless ive missed something thank you gentlemen said the king he waved a hand the dwarfs filed out reluctantly with many backward glances at vimes dee please fetch my axe from my chamber will you the king said yourself please i dont want anyone else to handle it your excellency you and your lady will remain here your dwarf must leave however the guards are to be posted on the door dee the ideas taster hadnt moved dee wh yes sire you do what i tell you sire this mans ancestor once killed a king i daresay the family have got it out of their system now do as i say the dwarf hurried away turning to stare at vimes for a moment as he left the cave the king sat back sit down your monitorship and your lady too he put one elbow on the arm of the chair and cupped his chin on his hand and now mister vimes tell me the truth tell me everything tell me the truth that is more valuable than small amounts of gold im not sure i know it any more said vimes ah a good start said the king tell me what you suspect then sire id swear that thing is as fake as a tin shilling oh really the real scone wasnt stolen it was destroyed i reckon it was smashed and ground up and mixed with the sand in its cave you see sire if people see that somethings gone and then you turn up with something that looks like it theyll think this must be it it must be because it isnt where we thought it was people are like that something disappears and something very much like it turns up somewhere else and they think it must somehow have got from one place to the other vimes pinched his nose im sorry i havent had much sleep you are doing very well for a sleepwalking man the thief was working with the werewolves i think they were behind the sons of agi hammerthief business they were going to blackmail you off the throne well you know that to keep uberwald in the dark if you didnt step down thered be a war and if you did albrecht would get the fake scone what else do you think you know well the fake was made in ankhmorpork were good at making things i think someone had the maker killed but i cant find out more until i get back i will find out you make things very well in your city then to fool albrecht how do you think that was done you want the truth sire by all means is it possible that albrecht was involved find out where the money is my old sergeant used to say hah who was it said where there are policemen you find crimes er me sir but let us find out dee should have had time to think ah the door opened the ideas taster stepped through carrying a dwarfish axe it was a mining axe with a pick point on one side in order to go prospecting and a real axe blade on the other in case anyone tried to stop you call the guards in dee said the king and his excellencys young dwarf these things should be seen see oh good grief thought vimes watching dees face as the others shuffled in there must be a manual every copper knows how this goes you let em know you know theyve done something wrong but you dont tell em what it is and you certainly dont tell em how much you know and you keep em off balance and you just talk quietly and place your hands upon the scone dee dee spun around sire place your hands upon the scone do as i say do it now you keep the threat in view but you never refer to it oh no because theres nothing you can do to them that their imagination isnt already doing to themselves and you keep it up until they break or in the case of my old dame school until they feel their boots get damp and it doesnt even leave a mark tell me about the death of lorigfinger the candle captain said the king after dee with a look of hollow apprehension had touched the scone the words rushed out oh as i told you sire he if you do not keep your hands pressed upon the scone dee i will see to it that they are fixed there tell me again i he took his own life sire out of shame the king picked up his axe and turned it so that the long point faced outwards tell me again now vimes could hear dees breathing short and fast he took his own life sire the king smiled at vimes theres an old superstition your excellency that since the scone contains a grain of truth it will glow red hot if a lie is told by anyone touching it of course in these more modern times i shouldnt think anyone believes it he turned to dee tell me again he whispered as the axe moved slightly the reflected light of the candles flashed along the blade he took his own life he did oh yes you said thank you said the king and do you recall dee when slogram sent false word of bloodaxes death in battle to ironhammer causing ironhammer to take his own life in grief where was the guilt it was slograms sir said dee promptly vimes suspected the answer had come straight from some roteremembered teaching yes the king let the word hang in the air for a while and then went on and who gave the order to kill the craftsman in ankhmorpork sire said dee who gave the order to kill the craftsman in ankhmorpork the kings tone did not change it was the same comfortable singsong voice he sounded as though he would carry on asking the question for ever i know nothing about guards press his hands firmly against the scone they stepped forward each one took an arm again dee who gave the order dee writhed as if his hands were burning i i vimes could see the skin whiten on the dwarfs hands as he strained to lift them from the stone but its a fake id swear he destroyed the real one so he knows its a fake surely its just a lump of plaster probably still damp in the middle vimes tried to think the original scone had been in the cave hadnt it was it if it wasnt where had it been the werewolves thought they had a fake and it certainly hadnt left his sight since he tried to think through the fog of fatigue hed half wondered once whether the original scone had been the one in the dwarf bread museum that would have been the way to keep it safe no one would try to steal something that everyone knew was a fake the whole thug was the fifth elephant nothing was what it seemed it was all a fog which one was real who gave the order dee said the king not me i said they must take all necessary steps to preserve secrecy to whom did you say this i can give you names later you will i promise you boyo said the king and the werewolves the baroness suggested it that is true uberwald for the werewolves ah yes joy through strength i expect they promised you all sorts of things you may take your hands off the scone i do not wish to distress you further but why my predecessors spoke highly of you you are a dwarf of power and influence and then you let yourself become a paw of the werewolves why why should they be allowed to get away with it dee snapped his voice breaking with the strain the king looked across at vimes oh i suspect the werewolves will regret that they he began not them the ones in ankhmorpork wearing makeup and dresses and and abominable things dee pointed a finger at cheery haak how can you even look at it you let her and vimes had seldom heard a word sprayed with so much venom her flaunt herself here and its happening everywhere because people have not been firm not obeyed have let the old ways slide everywhere there are reports theyre eating away at everything dwarfish with their their soft clothes and paint and beastly ways how can you be king and allow this everywhere they are doing it and you do nothing why should they be allowed to do this now dee was sobbing cant vimes saw that cheery to his amazement was blinking back tears i see said the king well i suppose that is an explanation he nodded to the guards take her away some things must wait a day or two cheery saluted suddenly permission to go with her sire what on earth for young young dwarf i expect shed like someone to talk to sire i know i would indeed i see your commander has no objection off you go then the king leaned back when the guards had left with their prisoner and the prisoners new counsellor well your excellency this is the real scone you are not certain dee was dee is in a difficult state of mind the king looked at the ceiling i think i will tell you this because your excellency i really do not want you going through the rest of your time here asking silly questions yes this is the true scone but how could wait so was the one that is yes ground to dust in the cave by dee in her madness the king went on so were the let me see five before that still untouched by time after fifteen hundred years what romantics we dwarfs are even the very best dwarf bread crumbles after a few hundred fakes said vimes they were all fakes suddenly the king was holding his mining axe again this milord is my familys axe we have owned it for almost nine hundred years see of course sometimes it needed a new blade and sometimes it has required a new handle new designs on the metalwork a little refreshing of the ornamentation but is this not the ninehundredyearold axe of my family and because it has changed gently over time it is still a pretty good axe yknow pretty good will you tell me this is a fake too he sat back again vimes remembered the look on albrechts face he knew oh yes a number of more senior dwarfs know the knowledge runs in families the first scone crumbled after three hundred years when the king of the time touched it my ancestor was a guard who witnessed it see he got accelerated promotion you could say im sure you understand me after that we were a little more prepared we would have been looking for a new one in fifty years or so in any case im glad one was made in the large dwarf city of ankhmorpork and i wouldnt be at all surprised if it turns out to be an excellent keeper look theyve even got the currants right see but albrecht could have exposed you exposed what he is not king but i will be very surprised if one of his family is not king again in the fullness of time what goes around comes around as the igors say the king leaned forward you have been labouring under a misapprehension i reckon you think that because albrecht dislikes ankhmorpork and has oldfashioned ideas he is a bad dwarf but i have known him for two hundred years he is honest and honourable more so than me that im sure of five hundred years ago he would have made a fine king today perhaps not perhaps hah the axe of my ancestors needs a different handle but now i am king and he accepts that with all his heart because if he did not hed think he wasnt a dwarf see of course he will now oppose me at every turn being low king was never an easy job but to use one of your metaphors we are all floating in the same boat we may certainly try to push one another over the side but only a maniac like dee would make a hole in the bottom corporal littlebottom thought thered be a war said vimes weakly well there are always hotheads but while we argue about who steers the boat we dont deny that its an important voyage i see you are tired let your good lady take you home but as a nightcap what is it your excellency that ankhmorpork wants ankhmorpork wants the names of the murderers mumbled vimes no that is what commander vimes wants what is it that ankhmorpork wants gold so often it is gold or iron perhaps you use a lot of iron vimes blinked his brain had finally given up there was nothing left any more he wasnt certain he could even stand up he remembered a word fat he said blankly aha the fifth elephant are you sure theres some good iron now iron makes you strong fat only makes you slippery fat parroted vimes feeling the darkness closing in lots of fat well certainly the price is ten ankhmorpork cents a barrel but your excellency since i have come to know you i feel that perhaps five cents a barrel for gradeone highrendered three cents for grade two ten cents per barrel for heavy tallow safe and delivered to ankhmorpork said sybil and all from the schmaltzberg bend levels and measured on the ironcrust scale i have some doubt about the longterm quality of the big tusk wells vimes tried to focus on his wife she seemed inexplicably a long way away wha er i caught up with some reading when i was in the embassy sam those notebooks sorry would you beggar us madam said the king throwing up his hands we may be flexible on delivery said lady sybil klatch would pay at least nine for grade one said the king but the klatchian ambassador isnt sitting here said sybil the king smiled or married to you my lady much to his loss six five and fifteen six dropping to five after twenty thousand three and half across the board for grade two i can give you thirteen on tallow acceptable but give me fourteen on white tallow and ill allow seven on the new pale suets were finding theyre making an acceptable candle look you six im afraid you havent plumbed the full extent of those deposits and i think it may be reasonable to expect high levels of scrattle and bcbs in the lower layers besides i think your forecasts about the amount of those deposits are erring on the optimistic side wha bcbs murmured vimes burnt crunchy bits said sybil mostly unbelievably huge and ancient animals deep fried you astonish me lady sybil said the king i did not know you were trained in fat extraction cooking sams breakfasts is an education in itself your majesty oh well far be it for a mere king to argue six then price to remain stable for two years the king saw sybils mouth open all right all right three years im not an unreasonable king prices on the dock how can i refuse agreed then the paperwork will be with you in the morning and now we really must go our separate ways said the king i can see his excellency has had a long day ankhmorpork will be swimming in fat i cant imagine what youll use it all for make light said vimes and as darkness fell at last fell forward gently into the welcoming arms of sleep sam vimes awoke to the smell of hot fat softness enveloped him it practically imprisoned him for a moment he thought it was snow except that snow wasnt usually this warm finally he identified it as the cloudlike softness of the mattress on the ambassadorial bed he let his attention drift back to the fat smell it had overtones there was a definite burnt component since sam vimess spectrum of gastronomic delight mainly ranged from well fried to caramelized it was decidedly promising he shifted position and regretted it immediately every muscle in his body squealed in protest he lay still and waited for the fire in his back to die down bits and pieces of the previous two days assembled themselves in his head once or twice he winced had he really gone through the ice like that was it sam vimes whod stepped up to fight the werewolf despite the fact that the thing was strong enough to bend a sword in a circle and had sybil won a lot of fat off the king and well here he was in a nice warm bed and by the smell of it there was breakfast on the way another piece of recollection floated into place vimes groaned and forced his legs out of the bed no wolfgang couldnt have survived that surely naked he staggered into the bathroom and spun the huge taps hot pungent water gushed out a minute later he was lying full length again it was rather too hot but he could remember the snows and maybe from now on he could never be hot enough some of the pain washed away someone rapped on the door its me sam sybil she came in carrying a couple of very large towels and some fresh clothes good to see you up again igors frying sausages he doesnt like doing it he thinks they should be boiled and hes doing slumpie and fikkun haddock and distressed pudding i didnt want the food to go to waste you see i dont think i want to stay for the rest of the celebrations i know what you mean hows carrot well he says he doesnt want sausages what hes al hes up sitting up at least igors a marvel angua said it was a bad break but hes just got some sort of device that well carrots not even got a sling on now sounds a useful man to have around said vimes pulling on his civilized trousers angua says igors got an icehouse in the cellars and theres frozen jars of of well lets just say he suggested that you might like liver and onions for breakfast and i said no i like liver and onions said vimes he thought about it up until now anyway i think the king wants us to go as well in a polite way a lot of very respectful dwarfs came round here with paperwork first thing this morning vimes nodded grimly it made sense if he was king hed want vimes out of here too heres some grateful thanks a nice trading agreement terribly sorry to see you go do call again only not too soon breakfast was everything hed dreamed of then he went to see the invalid carrot was pale grey under the eyes but smiling he was sitting up in bed drinking fatsup hello mister vimes we won then didnt angua tell you she went off with the wolves when i was asleep lady sybil said vimes recounted the events of the night as best he could afterwards carrot said gavin was a very noble creature im sorry hes dead im sure wed have got on well you mean every word of it vimes thought i know you do but it works out all right for you doesnt it it always does if it had been the other way about if it had been gavin that attacked wolf first then i know it would have been you that went over the falls with the bastard but it wasnt you was it if you were dice youd always roll sixes and the dice dont roll themselves if it wasnt against everything he wanted to be true about the world vimes might just then have believed in destiny controlling people and gods help the other people who were around when a big destiny was alive in the world bending every poor bugger around itself out loud he said poor old gaspode went over too how what was he doing er you could say he had our lads full attention a real streetfighter poor little soul he was a good dog at heart and once again words that would have sounded trite and wrong on anyone elses lips were redeemed by the way carrot said them and what about tantony said vimes left this morning lady sybil said good grief and wolfgang played noughts and crosses on his chest igors a dab hand with a needle sir afterwards a thoughtful sam vimes stepped out into the coach yard an igor was already loading the luggage er which one are you said vimes igor marthter ah right and er are you happy here igor we could do with a man of your talents in the watch and no mistake igor looked down from the top of the coach in ankhmorpork marthter my word everyone wantth to go to ankhmorpork marthter itth a very tempting offer but i know where my duty lieth your exthellenthy i mutht get the plathe ready for the next exthellenthy oh surely however fortuitouthly my nephew igor ith looking for a pothition marthter he thould do well in ankhmorpork heth rather too modern for uberwald thatth for thure good lad is he hith heartth in the right plathe i know that for thertain thur er good well get a message to him then were leaving as soon as we can he will be tho exthited thur ive heard that in ankhmorpork bodieth jutht lie around in the thtreetth for anyone to take away its not quite as bad as that igor ithnt it oh well you cant have everything ill tell him directly igor lurched off in a sort of highspeed totter i wonder why they all walk like that thought vimes they must have one leg shorter than the other either that or theyre not good at choosing boots he sat down on the steps to the house and fished out a cigar so that was it then bloody politics again it was always bloody politics or bloody diplomatics bloody lies in smart clothing once you got off the streets criminals just flowed through your fingers the king and lady margolotta and vetinari they always looked at some sort of big picture vimes knew he was and always would be a little picture man dee was useful so shed probably get oh a few days breaking bread or whatever it was they gave you here for being naughty after all all shed destroyed was a fake wasnt it was it but shed thought she was committing a much bigger crime that ought to mean something in sam vimess personal gallery of little pictures and the baroness was as guilty as hell people had died as for wolfgang well some people were just built guilty it was as simple as that anything they did became a crime simply because it was them doing it he blew out a stream of smoke people like that shouldnt be allowed to simply die their way out of things but he hadnt had he the wolves had gone a long way down the river sybil had said on both banks there wasnt a sniff of him further down was a mass of rapids and another fall what couldnt kill him would certainly make him wish it could if hed gone downstream but upstream there was nothing but wild water too right up to the town no he couldnt surely no one could swim up a waterfall a chilly little feeling began at the back of vimess neck but any sensible person would get right out of the country wouldnt they the wolves were looking for him tantony wouldnt remember him fondly and if vimes judged the king correctly then the dwarfs would have some dark little revenge in store too the trouble was that if you formed a picture in your mind of a sensible person and tried to superimpose it on a picture of wolfgang you couldnt get them to meet anywhere there was an old saying wasnt there as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly well that got wolfgang coming and going vimes stood up and turned around carefully there was no one there sounds came in from the street gateway people laughing the sound of a harness the clank of a shovel clearing up last nights snow he sidled into the embassy his back to the wall and groped his way towards the stairs peering into every doorway he ran across the expanse of the hallway did a tumbling roll and ended up against the far wall is there anything wrong sir said cheery she was watching him from the top of the stairs er have you seen anything odd said vimes dusting himself off selfconsciously and i realize that were talking about a house with igor in it could you give me a hint sir wolfgang godsdammit but hes dead sir isnt he not dead enough er what do you want me to do wheres detritus polishing his helmet sir said cheery on the point of panic what the hell is he wasting time with that for er er because were supposed to leave for the coronation in ten minutes sir oh yes lady sybil told me to come and find you in a very distinct tone of voice sir at that point lady sybils voice boomed along the corridor sam vimes you come here that one sir cheery added helpfully vimes trailed into the bedroom sybil was wearing another blue dress a tiara and a firm expression is it a posh do said vimes i thought if i put on a clean shirt your official dress uniform is in the dressing room said sybil it was rather a long day yesterday this is a coronation samuel vimes it is not a comeasyouare go and get dressed quickly including and i dont want to have to say this twice the helmet with the feathers but not the red tights said vimes hoping against hope please the red tights sam go without saying they go at the knees said vimes but it was the grumble of the defeated ill ring for igor to come and help you things will have come to a pretty pass when i cant put my own tights on dear thank you vimes dressed hurriedly listening for anything some creak in the wrong place perhaps at least this was a watch uniform even if it did have buckled shoes it included a sword the duking outfit didnt allow for one which had always struck vimes as amazingly stupid you got made a duke for being a fighter and then they gave you nothing to fight with there was a tinkle of glass back in the bedroom and lady sybil was astonished to see her husband enter at a run with his sword raised i dropped the top of a scent bottle sam whats up with you even angua says hes probably miles away and in no shape to cause trouble whyre you so nervy vimes put down the sword and tried to relax because our wolfgangs a damn bottle covey dear i know the sort any normal person they crawl off if they get a beating or they have the sense to stay down at least but sometimes you get one who just wont let go eightstone weaklings wholl try to headbutt detritus evil little bantamweight bastards wholl bust a bottle on the bar and try to attack five watchmen all at once you know what i mean idiots wholl go on fighting long after they should stop the only way to put em down is to put em out i think i recognize the type yes said lady sybil with an irony that failed to register with sam vimes until some days later she picked some lint off his cloak hes going to be back i can feel it in my water mumbled vimes sam yes can i have your attention for a couple of minutes wolfgang is anguas problem not yours i really need to talk to you very quietly for a little while without you running off after werewolves she said it as if this was a minor character flaw like a tendency to leave his boots where people could trip over them er they run after me he pointed out but theres always people being found dead or trying to kill you i dont ask them to dear sam im going to have a baby vimess head was full of werewolves and his automatic husbandly circuitry cut in ready to respond with yes dear or choose any colour you like or ill get someone to sort it out fortunately his brain itself had its own sense of selfpreservation and not wishing to be inside a skull that was stowed in by a bedside lamp rewrote sybils words in whitehot fire across his inner eyeball and then went and hid thats why the response came out as a weak what how the normal way i hope vimes sat down on the bed and not right now i very much doubt it but mrs content says its definite and shes been a midwife for fifty years oh some more brain functions crept back good thats good itll probably take a while to sink in yes another neuron lit up er everything will be all right will it what do you mean er youre rather youre not as you sam my family have been bred for breeding its an aristocratic tradition of course everything will be all right oh good vimes sat and stared his head felt like some vast sea that had just been parted by a prophet where there should have been activity there was just bare sand and the occasional floundering fish but huge steep waves were tottering on either side and in a minute they would crash down and cause cities to flood a hundred miles away more glass tinkled somewhere downstairs sam igors probably just dropped something said sybil seeing his expression thats all probably just knocked over a glass there was a snarl and a scream abruptly cut off vimes leapt off the bed lock the door after me and push the bed against it he paused for a moment in the doorway without straining yourself he added and ran for the stairs wolfgang was trotting across the hall he was different this time wolf ears sprouted from a head that was still human his hair had grown around him like a mane patches of fur were tufted on his skin and were mostly streaked with blood the rest of him was having trouble deciding what it was one arm was trying to be a paw vimes reached for his sword and remembered that it was back on the bed he rummaged in his pockets he knew the other thing was here he remembered picking it up off the dressing table his fingers closed on his badge he held it out stop in the name of the law wolfgang looked up at him one eye glowing yellow the other was a mess hello civilized he growled you wait for me hey he ducked into the corridor that led to the room where carrot lay vimes tried to catch him up saw clawtipped fingers curl around the door and haul it out of its frame carrot was reaching for his sword and then wolfgang was flying backwards under the full weight of angua they landed back in the hall a rolling ball of fur claws and teeth when werewolf fights werewolf there are advantages to either shape its an eternal struggle to get a position where hands beat claws and body shapes have lives of their own a dangerous attribute if it is allowed to act unchecked a cats instinct is to jump on something that moves but this is not a correct action if what is moving has a fizzing fuse the mind has to fight its own body for control and the other body for survival mix this together and the noise suggests that there are four creatures in the whirling ball of rage and each one of them has brought several friends and none of them like any of the others a shadow made vimes spin around detritus in shining armour was aiming the piecemaker over the banister sergeant no youll hit angua too not a problem sir said detritus cos it wont kill em so all we have to do see is sort out der bits dat are wolfgang an belt him over der head when he gets himself back together if you fire that in here his bits will be mixed up with our bits and there wont be big bits put the damn thing down wolfgang couldnt control his shape well vimes saw he couldnt quite manage to be full wolf or full human and angua was making the most of that she was ducking weaving biting but even if you put him down you couldnt put him out mister vimes now it was cheery beckoning urgently from the passage that led to the kitchen you ought to come here right now she was whitefaced vimes nudged detritus if they separate just grab him right just try to hold him still igor was lying in the kitchen surrounded by broken glass wolfgang must have landed on him and taken out his perpetual anger on a soft target the patchwork man was bleeding heavily and lay like a doll that had been flung hard against a wall marthter he groaned can you do anything for him cheery i wouldnt know where to start sir marthter you got to remember thith right igor groaned er yes what you got to get me into the ithehouthe downthtairth and let igor know underthtand which igor said vimes desperately any igor igor clutched at vimess sleeve me heartth had it but me liverth right ath ninepenthe tell him nothing wrong with my brain that a good bolt of lightnin wont thort out igor can have me right hand heth got a cuthtomer waiting thereth yearth of good thervithe left in my lower intethtine left eye not up to much but i darethay thome poor thoul can find a uthe for it the right knee ith nearly new old mth prodzky down the road would value my hip jointth tell him got all that yes yes i think so right remember what goeth around cometh around igor sank down hes gone sir said cheery but hell soon be up and on someone elses feet vimes thought he didnt say it aloud cheery was soft hearted instead he said can you get him into his icehouse by the sound of it anguas winning he ran back into the hall it was a wreck as he arrived angua managed to get a headlock on wolfgang and ran him into a wooden pillar he staggered and she spun and scythed his legs from under him with a kick i taught her that vimes thought as her brother landed heavily some of that dirty fighting thats ankhmorpork fighting that is but wolfgang was up again like a rubber ball and somersaulting over her head that brought him to the front door he smashed it open with a blow and leapt out into the street and that was it a room full of debris snowflakes blowing in and angua sobbing on the floor he picked her up she was bleeding in a dozen places that was as much of a diagnosis as sam vimes not used these days to surveying naked young women at close quarters thought he could decently attempt its all right hes gone he said because he had to say something its not all right hell lie low for a while and then hell be back i know him it wont matter where we go youve seen him hell just track us down and follow us and then hell kill carrot why because carrots mine sybil advanced down the stairs carrying vimess crossbow oh you poor thing she said come here lets find something to cover you up sam isnt there something you can do vimes stared at her built into sybils expression was the unquestioning assumption that he could do something an hour ago hed been having breakfast ten minutes ago hed been putting on this stupid uniform in a real room with his wife and it had been a real world with a real future and suddenly the dark was back spattered with red rage and if he gave in to it hed lose that was the beast screaming inside and wolfgang was a better beast vimes knew he didnt have the knack the mindless driving nastiness sooner or later his brain would start operating and kill him perhaps said his brain you start by using me yees he said yes i think there is something i can do fire and silver thought vimes well silvers in pretty short supply in uberwald you want i should come said detritus who could pick up signals no i think i think i want to make an arrest i dont want to start a war anyway you need to wait here in case he doubles back but you could lend me your penknife vimes found a sheet in one of the broken boxes and tore off a long strip then he took his crossbow from his wife you see now hes committed a crime in ankhmorpork he said that makes him mine sam were not you know everyone kept telling me i wasnt in ankhmorpork so often that i believed it but this embassy is ankhmorpork and right now he hefted the bow i am the law sam yes dear i know that look dont hurt anyone else will you dont worry dear im going to be civilized about it there was a cluster of dwarfs in the street outside surrounding one lying on the snow in a pool of blood which way said vimes and if they didnt understand his words they understood the question several of them pointed along the street as he walked vimes cradled the crossbow and lit a thin cigar now this he understood he was never at ease with politics where good and bad were just apparently two ways of looking at the same thing or at least were described like that by the people who were on the side vimes thought of as bad it was all too complicated and where it was complicated it meant that someone was trying to fool you but on the street in hot pursuit it was all so clear someone was going to be still standing at the end of the chase and all you had to concentrate on was making sure it was you on a street corner a cart had overturned and its driver was kneeling by a horse that had been ripped open which way the man pointed the new street was wider busier and there were a number of elegant coaches moving slowly through the crowds of course the coronation but that belonged to the world of the duke of ankh and right now he wasnt here there was only sam vimes who didnt much like coronations there were screams up ahead and the flow of people was suddenly against vimes so that he appeared to be heading upstream like a salmon the street opened into a large square people were running now which suggested to vimes that he was still moving in the right direction it was pretty clear that youd find wolfgang somewhere no one else wanted to be there was a flurry of movement on one side of him and a squad of the town guard trotted past they halted one of them walked back it was tantony he looked vimes up and down i have you to thank for last night he said there were fresh scars on his face but they were already healing weve got to get an igor vimes reminded himself yes said vimes the good bits and the bad bits and you see what happens when you stand up to a werewolf vimes opened his mouth to say is that a uniform youre wearing captain or is it fancy dress but stopped himself in time no its what happens when youre fool enough to stand up to a werewolf with no backup and no firepower he said im sorry but we all have to learn that lesson integrity makes very poor armour the man reddened what is your business here he said our hairy friend just murdered someone in the embassy which is yes yes ankhmorpork territory but this isnt i am the watchman here im in hot pursuit captain ah i see you know the term i i that doesnt apply really every copper knows about the rule of hot pursuit you can chase the suspect over your legal boundary if youre in hot pursuit of course there may be a bit of legal argybargy once hes cauyht but we can save that for later i intend to arrest him myself for crimes committed today youre too young to die besides i saw him first tell you what after hes killed me you can have a go fair enough he looked tantony in the eye now get out of the way you know i could have you arrested probably but until now id got you down as an intelligent man tantony nodded and proved vimes right all right how may we be of assistance by keeping out of the way oh and scraping up my remains if this doesnt work vimes felt the mans stare on the back of his neck as he set off again there was a statue in the middle of the square it was of the fifth elephant some ancient craftsman had tried to achieve in bronze and stone the moment when the allegorical animal had thundered down out of the sky and gifted the country its incredible mineral wealth around it were idealized and rather heavyset figures of dwarfs and men holding hammers and swords and striking noble attitudes they probably represented truth industry justice and mothers homemade fat pancakes for all vimes knew but he felt truly far from home in a country where apparently no one wrote graffiti on public statues a man was sprawled on the cobbles with a woman kneeling beside him she looked tearfully at vimes and said something in uberwaldean all he could do was nod wolfgang jumped down from a perch on top of the statue to bad sculpting and landed a few yards away grinning mister civilized you want another game you see this badge im holding up said vimes its a very small one but you see it yes i see your little badge wolfgang started to move sideways arms hanging loosely by his sides and im armed did you hear me tell you im armed with that silly bow but you just heard me say im armed yes said vimes loudly turning to face the moving werewolf he puffed on his cigar letting a glow build up yes is this what you call civilized vimes grinned yes this is how we do it my way is better and now youre under arrest said vimes come along and make no fuss and well tie you securely and hand you over to whatever passes for justice around here i realize this may be difficult hah your ankhmorpork sense of humour yes any minute now ill drop my trousers so youre resisting arrest why these stupid questions now wolfgang was almost dancing are you resisting arrest yes indeed oh yes good joke look at me laughing vimes tossed the crossbow aside and swung a tube out from under his cloak it was made of cardboard and a red cone protruded from one end a stupid silly firework shouted wolfgang and charged could be said vimes he didnt bother to aim these things were never designed for accuracy or speed he simply removed his cigar from his mouth and as wolfgang ran towards him pressed it into the fuse hole the mortar jerked as the charge went off and its payload came tumbling out slowly and trailing smoke in a lazy spiral it looked like the stupidest weapon since the toffee spear wolfgang danced back and forth under it grinning and as it passed several feet over his head he leapt up gracefully and caught it in his mouth and then it exploded the flares were made to be seen twenty miles away even with his eyes tightly shut vimes saw the glare through his lids when the body had stopped rolling vimes looked around the square people were watching from the coaches the crowds were silent there were a lot of things he could say son of a bitch would have been a good one or he could say welcome to civilization he could have said laugh this one off he might have said fetch but he didnt because if he had said any of those things then hed have known that what he had just done was murder he turned away tossed the empty mortar over his shoulder and muttered the hell with it at times like this teetotalism bit down hard tantony was watching dont say a word out of place said vimes without altering his stride just dont i thought those things shot very fast i cut down the charge said vimes tossing detrituss penknife in the air and catching it again i didnt want to hurt anyone i heard you warn him that you were armed i heard him twice resist arrest i heard everything i heard everything you wanted me to hear yes of course he might not have known that law oh really well i didnt know it was legal in these parts to chase some poor sod across the country and maul him to death and do you know that didnt stop anyone vimes shook his head and dont give me that pained look oh yes now you can say i did it wrong you can say i ought to have handled it differently that sort of thing is easy to say afterwards ill say it myself maybe in the middle of every night he added to himself after ive woken up seeing those mad eyes but you wanted him stopped as much as i did oh yes you did but you couldnt because you didnt have the means and i did because i could and youve got the luxury of judging me because youre still alive and thats the truth of it all wrapped up lucky one for you eh the crowds parted ahead of vimes he could hear whispers around him on the other hand said tantony distantly as if he hadnt heard what vimes had just said you did only fire that thing to warn him huh clearly you were not to know that he would automatically try to catch the explosive said tantony and it seemed to vimes that he was rehearsing the line the doglike qualities of a werewolf would hardly have occurred to a man from the big city vimes held his gaze for a moment and then patted him on the shoulder hold on to that thought he said a coach pulled to a halt beside him as he continued on his way it slid to a stop so silently not a jingle of harness not a clop of horseshoe that vimes jumped sideways out of shock the horses were black with black plumes on their heads the coach was a hearse the traditional long glass windows now filled with smoked black glass there was no driver the reins were simply loosely knotted on a brass railing a door swung open a veiled figure leaned out your excellency do let me give you a lift back to the embassy you look so tired no thank you said vimes grimly i apologize for the emphasis on black said lady margolotta it is rather expected of one on these occasions im afraid vimes swung himself up and into the carriage with furious speed you tell me he growled waving a finger under her nose how anyone can swim up a vertical waterfall i was prepared to believe anything about that bastard but even he couldnt have managed that certainly that is a puzzle said the vampire calmly as the driverless coach moved on superhuman strength possibly and now hes gone and thats one up for the vampires eh i vould like to think that its going to be a blessing for the whole country lady margolotta leaned back her rat with the bow round its neck watched vimes suspiciously from its pink cushion wolfgang vas a sadistic murderer a throwback who frightened even his own family delphine sorry angua vill have some peace of mind an intelligent young lady ive alvays thought leaving here vas the best thing she ever did the darkness vill be a little less frightening the vorld will be a better place and ive handed you uberwald said vimes dont be stupid uberwald is huge this is one small part of it and now its going to change you have been a breath of fresh air lady margolotta drew a long holder from her bag and inserted a black cigarette it lit itself like you i have found consolation in a different vice she said black scopani they grow the tobacco in total darkness do try some you could waterproof roofs with it i believe igor makes cigars by rolling the leaves between his thighs she blew out a stream of smoke or someones thighs anyvay of course i am sorry for the baroness it must be so hard for a verevolf realizing that shes raised a monster as for the baron give him a bone and hes happy for hours another stream of smoke do look after angua happy families is not a popular game among the undead you helped him come back just like you did for me oh hed have come back anyvay in time some time when you werent expecting him hed track angua like a wolverine best that things ended today she gave him an appraising look through the smoke youre good at anger your grace you save it up for when you need it you couldnt have known id beat him you left me in the snow i wasnt even armed havelock vetinari would not have sent a fool to uberwald more smoke which writhed in the air at least not a stupid fool vimess eyes narrowed youve met him havent you yes and taught him all he knows right she blew smoke down her nostrils and gave him a radiant smile im sorry you think taught him my dear sir as for vhat ive got out of all this vell a little breathing space a little influence politics is more interesting than blood your grace and much more fun beware the reformed vampire sir the craving for blood is only a craving and with care it can be diverted along different channels uberwald is going to need politicians ah i believe ve are here she added although vimes couldhave sworn that she hadnt so much as glanced out of the window the door opened if my igors still there do tell him i vill see him downtown so nice to have met you im sure ve shall meet again and do please present my fondest regards to lord vetinari the door shut behind vimes the coach moved off he swore under his breath the hall of the embassy was full of igors several of them touched their forelocks or at least the line of stitch marks when they saw him they were carrying heavy metal containers of varying sizes on which frost crystals were forming whats this he said igors funeral then it sank in oh my gods with party loot bags everyone gets something to take home you could thay that thur you could call it that said an igor but we think that putting bodieth in the ground ith rather gruethome all thothe wormth and thingth he tapped the tin box under his arm thith way hell be mothtly up and about again in no time he added brightly reincarnation on the instalment plan eh said vimes weakly motht amuthing thur said the igor gravely but itth amathing what people need heartth liverth handth we keep a litht thur of detherving catheth by tonight there will be thome very lucky people in thethe partly and these parts in some very lucky people well done thur i can thee you are a wit and one day thome poor thoul will have a really nathty brain injury and he tapped the chilly box again what goeth around cometh around he nodded at cheery and at vimes i mutht be going now thur tho much to do you know how it ith i can imagine said vimes he thought the axe of my grandfather you change the bits around but therell always be an igor theyre really rather selfless people sir said cheery when the last igor had lurched off they do a lot of good work er they even took his suit and his boots because theyll be useful to someone i know i know but i know what you mean sir everyones in the drawing room lady sybil said youd be back she said anyone with that look in their eye comes back were all going to the coronation might as well see this through is that what youll be wearing cheery yes sir but its just ordinary dwarf clothes trousers and everything yes sir but sybil said youd got a fetching little green number and a helmet with a feather in it yes sir youre free to wear whatever you want you know that yes sir and then i thought about dee and i watched the king when he was talking to you and well i can wear what i like sir thats the point i dont have to wear that dress and i shouldnt wear it just because other people dont want me to besides it made me look like a rather stupid lettuce thats all a bit complicated for me cheery its probably a dwarf thing sir vimes pushed open the doors to the drawing room its over he said did you hurt anyone else said sybil only wolfgang hell be back said angua no you killed him no i put him down i see youre up captain carrot got to his feet awkwardly and saluted sorry i havent been much use sir you just chose the wrong time to fight fair are you well enough to come er angua and i want to stay here if its all right with you sir weve got things to talk about and er do it was the first coronation vimes had attended hed expected it to be stranger touched somehow by glory instead it was dull but at least it was big dull dullness distilled and cultivated over thousands of years until it had developed an impressive shine as even grime will if you polish it long enough it was dull hammered into the shape and form of ceremony it had also been timed to test the capacity of the average bladder a number of dwarfs read passages from ancient scrolls there were what sounded like excerpts from the koboldean saga and vimes wondered desperately if they were in for another opera but they were over after a mere hour there were more readings from different dwarfs at one point the king who had been standing alone in the centre of a circle of candlelight was presented with a leather bag a small mining axe and a ruby vimes didnt catch the meaning of any of this but by the sounds it was clear that each item was of huge and satisfying significance to the thousands who were standing behind him thousands no there must be tens of thousands he thought the bowl of the cavern was full of tier upon tier of dwarfs maybe a hundred thousand and he was in the front row no one had said anything the four of them had simply been led there and left although the murmurings suggested that the presence of detritus was causing considerable attention senior longbearded and richly clothed dwarfs were all around them someone was being taught something vimes wondered who the lesson was directed at finally the scone was brought in small and dull and yet carried by twentyfour dwarfs on a large bier it was laid reverentially on a stool he could sense the change in the air of the huge cavern and once again he thought theres no magic you poor devils theres no history ill bet my wages the damn thing was moulded with rubber from a vat that had last been used in the preparation of sonkys eversure dependables and theres your holy relic for you there were more readings much shorter this time then the dwarfs who had been participating in the endless and baffling hours withdrew from the centre of the cavern leaving the king looking as small and alone as the scone itself he stared around him and although it was surely impossible for him to have seen vimes among the thousands in the gloom it did seem that his gaze rested on the ankhmorpork party for a fraction of a second the king sat down a sigh began it grew louder and louder a hurricane made up of the breath of a nation it echoed back and forth among the rocks until it drowned out all other sounds vimes had half expected the scone to explode or crumble or flash redhot which was stupid said a dwindling part of himself it was a fake a nonsense something made in ankhmorpork for money something that had already cost lives it was not it could not be real but in the roaring air he knew that it was for all who needed to believe and in a belief so strong that truth was not the same as fact he knew that for now and yesterday and tomorrow both the thing and the whole of the thing angua noticed that carrot was walking better even as they reached the forest below the falls and the shovel over his shoulder hardly burdened him at all there were wolf prints all over the snow they wont have stayed she said as they walked between the trees they felt things keenly when he died but wolves look to the future they dont try to remember things theyre lucky said carrot theyre realistic its just that the future contains the next meal and the next danger is your arm all right it feels as good as new they found the freezing mass of fur lying at the waters edge carrot pulled it out of the water scraped off the snow higher up the shingle and started to dig after a while he took off his shirt the bruises were already fading angua sat and looked over the water listening to the thud of the spade and the occasional grunt when carrot hit a tree root then she heard the soft slither of something being pulled over snow a pause and then the sound of sand and stones being shovelled into a hole do you want to say a few words said carrot you heard the howl last night thats how wolves do it said angua still looking out across the water there arent any other words perhaps just a moments silence then she spun round carrot dont you remember last night didnt you wonder what i might become didnt you worry about the future no why the hell not it hasnt happened yet shall we get back itll be dark soon and tomorrow id like you to come back to ankhmorpork why theres nothing for me there carrot patted the soil over the grave is there anything left for you here he said besides i dont you dare say the words angua thought not at a time like this and then they both became aware of the wolves they were creeping through the trees darker shadows in the evening light theyre hunting said angua grabbing carrots arm oh dont worry they dont attack human beings for no reason carrot yes the wolves were closing in m not human but last night that was different they remembered gavin now im just a werewolf to them she watched him turn to look at the advancing wolves the hairs were up on their backs they were growling they moved with the strange sidle of those whose hatred could just manage to overcome their fear and at any moment that balance in one of them was going to tip all the way and then it would be all over there was a leap and it was carrot who made it he grabbed the lead wolf by its neck and tail and held on as it struggled and snapped its frantic efforts to escape resulted only in it running in a circle with carrot in the middle the other wolves backing away from the whirl of grey then as it stumbled he bit it on the back of the neck it screamed carrot let go and stood up he looked at the circle of wolves they shied away from his gaze hmmm he said the wolf on the ground whined and got to its feet awkwardly hmmm it tucked its tail between its legs and backed off but it still seemed to be attached to carrot by an invisible lead angua said carrot still watching it carefully yes can you speak wolf i mean in this shape a bit look how did you know what to do oh ive watched animals said carrot as if that was an explanation please tell them tell them if they go away now i wont harm them she managed to bark out the words it had all changed in such a tiny handful of seconds now carrot wrote the script and now tell them that although im going away i may be back whats the name of this one he nodded at the cowering wolf thats eats wrong meat angua whispered he was hes the leader now gavins gone then tell them that im quite happy that he should go on leading tell them all that they watched her intently she knew what they were thinking hed beaten the leader it was all sorted out wolves did not have a lot of mental space for uncertainty doubt was a luxury for species that did not live one meal away from starvation they still had a gavinshaped hole in their minds and carrot had stepped into it of course it wouldnt last long but it didnt need to he always always finds a way in she thought he doesnt think about it he doesnt plot he simply slides in i saved him because he couldnt save himself and gavin saved him because because because he had some reason and im almost almost certain that carrot doesnt know how he manages to wrap the world around him almost certain hes good and kind and born to be a king of the ancient sort that wore oak leaves and ruled from a seat under a tree and though he tries hard he never had a cynical thought im almost certain lets go now said carrot the coronation will be over soon and i dont want mister vimes to worry carrot ive got to know something yes that might happen to me have you ever thought about that he was my brother after all being two things at the same time and never quite being one were not the most stable of creatures gold and muck come out of the same shaft said carrot thats just a dwarf saying its true though youre not him well if it happened if it did would you do what vimes did carrot would it be you who picked up a weapon and came after me i know you wont lie ive got to know would it be you a little snow slid down from the trees the wolves watched carrot looked up for a moment at the grey sky and then nodded yes she sighed promise she said vimes was surprised at how quickly the coronation became a working day there was a flourish of echoing horns a general flow of the crowd and gradually a queue in front of the king they havent even given him time to get comfy said lady sybil as they headed towards the exit our kings are working kings said cheery and vimes detected the pride in her voice but now is the time when the king awards favours a dwarf caught up with vimes and tugged his cloak respectfully the king wishes to see you now your excellency he said theres an almighty queue nevertheless the dwarf gave a polite cough the king wishes to see you now all of you they were led to the front of the queue vimes felt many eyes boring into the small of his back the king dismissed the previous supplicant with a regal nod as the ankhmorpork party was deftly inserted at the top of the line supplanting a dwarf whose beard went down to his knees the king looked at them for a moment and then the internal filing system threw up a card ah its yourselves good as new he said now what was it i was going to do oh i remember lady sybil she curtsied classically we give rings at this time said the king between ourselves many dwarfs consider this a bit well bath salts see but i believe they are still welcome and so this lady sybil is perhaps a token of things to come it was a thin silver ring vimes was taken aback at this parsimony but sybil could accept a bunch of dead rats graciously oh how wond we normally give gold the king went on very popular and of course you can sing about it but this has rarity value see it is the first silver that has been mined in uberwald in hundreds of years i thought there was a rule that vimes began i ordered the mines reopened last night said the king pleasantly it seemed an auspicious time we shall soon have ore for sale your excellency but if lady sybil doesnt get involved in the negotiations and bankrupt us i for one shall be very grateful the king added miss littlebottom i see has not graced us with a sartorial extravaganza today cheery stared youre not wearing a dress said the king no sire although i do note a few unobtrusive touches of mascara and lipstick yes sire squeaked cheery on the point of death through shock theres nice do be sure to let me know the name of your dressmaker the king went on i may have some custom for her in the fullness of time ive thought long and hard vimes blinked cheery had gone pale had anyone else heard that had he sybil nudged him in the ribs your mouths open sam she whispered so he had heard it he heard the kings voice again and a bag of gold is always acceptable cheery was still staring vimes shook her gently by the shoulder ththank you sire the king held out his hand vimes wobbled cheery again completely hypnotized she extended her hand the king took it and shook it shocked whispers were spreading behind vimes the king had shaken the hand of a selfdeclared female and that leaves detritus said the king what a dwarf should give a troll is of course a bit of a puzzle but it occurs to me that what i should give you is what i would give a dwarf a bag of gold then for whatever purpose you choose to use it and he stood up he held out his hand dwarfs and trolls were still fighting in the further regions of uberwald vimes knew elsewhere there was at best the sort of peace you got when both sides were busy rearming the whispering stopped silence spread out in a widening circle all across the floor of the cave detritus blinked then he took the hand very carefully trying not to crush it the whispering started again and this time vimes knew itd go for miles it occurred to him that in two handshakes the whitebearded elderly dwarf had done more than a dozen devious plots could have achieved by the time those ripples reached the edge of uberwald they would be tidal waves thirty men and a dog would be nothing by comparison hmm i said what can a king give a vimes said the king er nothing i think said vimes absently two handshakes and very quietly smiling the king had turned the customs of the dwarfs upside down and so gently too that theyd spend years arguing about it sam snapped sybil well then i shall give something to your descendants said the king apparently unperturbed a long flat box was brought to him he opened it to reveal a dwarf axe the new metal glinting on its nest of black cloth this will become in time the axe of someones grandfather said the king and no doubt over the years it will need a new handle or a new blade and over the centuries the shape will change in line with fashion but it will always be in every detail and respect the axe i give you today and because itll change with the times itll always be sharp theres a grain of truth in that see so nice to have met you do enjoy your journey home your excellency the four were silent in the coach back to the embassy then cheery said the king said i heard said vimes that was as good as saying that he is a sh things are going to change said lady sybil thats what the king was saying i never shook hands wid no king before said detritus no dwarf either come to dat you shook hands with me once said cheery watchmen dont count said detritus firmly watchmen is watchmen i wonder if itll change anything said lady sybil vimes stared out of the window itd probably make people feel good he thought but trolls and dwarfs had been fighting for centuries ending that sort of thing took more than a handshake it was just a symbol on the other hand the world wasnt moved by heroes or villains or even by policemen it might as well be moved by symbols all he knew was that you couldnt hope to try for the big stuff like world peace and happiness but you might just about be able to achieve some tiny deed thatdmake the world in a small way a better place like shooting someone i forgot to say that i thought it was very kind of you cheery said lady sybil yesterday when you comforted dee she would have had me killed by the werewolves said vimes he felt this was a point worth making yes of course but it was kind anyway said sybil cheery looked at her feet avoiding lady sybils gaze then she coughed nervously and pulled a small piece of paper out of her sleeve which she handed wordlessly to vimes he unfolded it she gave you these names he said some of these are very senior dwarfs in ankhmorpork yes sir said cheery she coughed again i knew she wanted someone to talk to and er i suggested a few things she might like to talk about sorry lady sybil its very hard to stop being a copper i worked that one out a long time ago said sybil you know said vimes to break the silence if we leave at first light tomorrow we could be through the pass before sundown and it was a comfortable night somewhere in the depths of the feather mattress vimes awoke a couple of times and thought he could hear voices then he sank back into the softness and dreamt of warm snow he was shaken awake by detritus its gettin light sir mm and deres a igor an a a young man out in der hall said detritus he got a big jar full of noses and a rabbit covered in ears vimes tried to get back to sleep then he sat bolt upright what its all covered in ears sir you mean one of those rabbits with big floppy ears you better come and see dis rabbit sniffed the troll vimes left sybil wallowing in sleep pulled on his dressing gown and pattered barefoot down to the freezing hall an igor was waiting anxiously in the middle of the floor vimes was getting the hang of igorrecognition and this was a new one he was with a much younger er man probably barely out of his teens at least in places but already the scars and stitching indicated that relentless urge towards selfimprovement that was the hallmark of a good igor they just never seemed to be able to get the eyes level your exthellenthy youre igor right amathing gueth thur we havent met before but i work for doctor thaumic on the other thide of the mountain and thith ith my thon igor he smacked the young man around the back of his head thay hello to hith grathe igor i dont believe in the peerage said young igor sulkily nor shall i call any man marthter thee said his father thorry about thith your grathe but thith ith the younger generation for you i hope you can find a job for him in the big thity coth heth totally unemployable in uberwald but heth a very good thurgeon even if he doeth have funny ideath heth got hith grandfatherth handth you know i can see the scars said vimes lucky little devil they thould have been mine the key was in the pattern of scars by rightth but he wath old enough to go into the lottery you want to join the watch igor said vimes yes sir i believe ankhmorpork is where the future lies thur his father leaned closer to vimes we dont menthion hith thlight thpeech impediment marthter he whispered of courthe it countth againtht him here you know in the igor buthineth but im thure people will be kind to him in ankhmorpork yes indeed said vimes removing his handkerchief and absentmindedly dabbing his ear and er this rabbit hes eerie thur said young igor good name good name is that why hes got human ears all over his back early experiment thur and er the noses there were about a dozen of them in a large screwtop pickle jar and they were just noses not cut off anyone as far as vimes could see they had little legs and were jumping hopefully up and down against the glass like puppies in a pet shop window he thought he could hear faint wheel noises the wave of the future thur said young igor i grow them in special vats i can do eyes and fingers too but theyve got little legs oh they wither off in a few hours after theyre attached thur and they want to be useful my little noses bioartificing for the next century thur none of that outmoded cutting up of old bodies his father smacked his head again you thee you thee whereth the point in that wathtrel i hope you can do thomething with him marthter becauthe ive jutht about given up not worth breaking down for thpareth ath we thay vimes sighed still losing small extremities was a daily hazard in the watch and the lad was after all an igor it wasnt as if there were any normal people in the watch he could afford to put up with a nosebreeder in exchange for surgery that didnt involve screaming and buckets of boiling pitch he indicated a box beside the young man it was growling and rocking from side to side you havent got a dog too have you he said trying to make it sound like a joke thats my tomatoes said young igor a triumph of modern igoring they grow enormously only becauthe they vithiouthly attack all other vegetableth said his father but ill thay thith for the lad marthter ive never known anyone like him for really tiny thtitching all right all right he sounds the man im looking for said vimes or close at least take a seat young man i just hope theres going to be room in the coaches the door to the yard swung open blowing in a few snowflakes and carrot who stamped his feet a bit of snow overnight but the road looks open he said they say theres a really big one due tonight though so we oh good morning sir youre fit enough to travel said vimes we both are said angua she crossed the hall and stood next to carrot once again vimes was aware of a lot of words that he hadnt heard a wise man didnt make enquiries at a time like this besides vimes could feel the cold coming up through his feet he reached a decision give me your notebook captain he said they watched him scribble a few lines stop at the clacks tower and send a message on to the yard he said handing it back to carrot tell them youre on the way take young igor here with you and get him settled in okay and make a report to his lordship er youre not coming said carrot her ladyship and i will take the other coach said vimes or buy a sleigh very comfy things sleighs and well well just take it a little easier well see the sights well dawdle along the way understand he saw angua smile and wondered if sybil had confided in her absolutely sir said carrot oh and er go along to burleigh fr stronginthearms order a couple of dozen of everything off the top of their small arms catalogue and get them on to the next mail coach due to bonk for the personal attention of captain tantony the mail coach rate will be very expensive sir carrot began i didnt want you to tell me that captain i wanted you to say yes sir yes sir and ask at the gate about three gloomy biddies who live in a big house near here its got a cherry orchard find out the address and when you get back send them three coach tickets to ankhmorpork right sir well done travel safely ill see you in a week or two three at the outside all right a few minutes later he stood shivering on the steps watching the coach disappear into the crisp morning he felt a pang of guilt but it was only a little pang he gave every day to the watch and it was time he thought for it to give him a week or two three at the outside in fact he realized as pangs went it was barely a ping which was he recalled a dialect word for watermeadow right now he could see a future which was more than hed ever had before he locked the door and went back to bed on a clear day from the right vantage point on the ramtops a watcher could see a very long way across the plains the dwarfs had harnessed mountain streams and built a staircase of locks that rose a mile up from the rolling grasslands for the use of which they charged not just a pretty penny but a very handsome dollar barges were always ascending or descending making their way down to the river smarl and the cities of the plain they carried coal iron fireclay pig treacle and fat the dull ingredients of the pudding of civilization in the sharp thin air they took several days to get out of sight on a clear day you could see next wednesday the captain of one of the barges waiting for the top lock went to tip the dregs of his teapot over the side and saw a small dog sitting on the snowy bank it sat up and begged hopefully he turned to go back into the cabin when he thought what a nice little doggie it was such a clear thought that it almost seemed to him that he had heard it but he looked around and there was no one else near him and dogs certainly couldnt talk he heard himself think this little doggie would be very useful keepin down rats that might attack the cargo sort of frog it must have been his thought he decided there was no one else nearby and everyone knew dogs didnt talk he said aloud but rats dont eat coal do they he thought clear as day ah well you never know when they might try right anyway its such a sweetlooking little doggie thats been strugglin for days through deep snow huh not that anyone cares the treacle mines below ankhmorpork had long been exhausted leaving only a street name to remember them by but the collision with the fifth elephant had buried thousands of acres of prehistoric sugarcane around the borders of uberwald and the resulting dense crystalline sugar was the foundation of a large mining confectionery and dentistry industry the bargeman gave up theres only so long you can argue with yourself ten minutes later the barge was on the long drop to the plains with a small dog sitting at the prow enjoying the breeze on the whole thought gaspode it was always best to look to the future nobby nobbs had made himself a shelter up against the wall of the watch house and was gloomily warming his hands when a shadow loomed over him what are you doing nobby said carrot huh captain theres no one on the gates theres no one on patrol didnt anyone get my message whats happening nobby licked his lips weell he said there isnt well there isnt a watch at the moment not per say he flinched he saw angua behind carrot er mister vimes with you at all what is happening nobby well you see fred kind of and then he got all sort of then next thing you know he was setting for to and then we and then he wouldnt come out and then we and he nailed up the door and mrs fred came and shouted at him through the letterbox and most of the lads have gone off and got other jobs and now theres just me and dorfl and reg and washpot and we come here turn and turn about and we shove food through the letterbox for him and thats it reelly can we have that again with the gaps filled in said carrot this took considerably longer there were still gaps carrot forced them open i see he said at last mister vimes is going to go spare isnt he said nobby miserably i wouldnt worry about mister vimes said angua not at the moment carrot was looking up at the front door it was thick oak there were bars at all the windows go and fetch constable dorfl nobby he said ten minutes later the watch house had a new doorway carrot stepped over the wreckage and led the way upstairs fred colon was hunched in the chair staring fixedly at one solitary sugar lump be careful whispered angua he might be in a rather fragile mental state thats very likely said carrot he leaned down and whispered fred mm murmured colon on your feet sergeant am urtin you ought to be im standin on your beard youve got five minutes to wash and shave and be back here with shinin mornin face on your feet to the washroom abouut turn at the double onetwoonetwo it seemed to angua that no part of fred colon above the neck except maybe for his ears was involved in what happened next fred colon rose at attention executed a thudding aboutturn and doubled out of the door carrot spun around towards nobby you too corporal nobby trembling with shock saluted with both hands at once and ran after colon carrot went over to the fireplace and poked at the ashes oh dear he said all burnt said angua im afraid so some of those heaps were like old friends well well find out if weve missed anything important when it starts to smell said carrot nobby and colon appeared again breathless and pink there were a few bits of tissue stuck on colons face where the shaving had been too enthusiastic but he was nevertheless looking better he was a sergeant again someone was giving him orders his brain was moving the world was the right side up once more fred said carrot yessir youve got a bit of bird doings on your shoulder ill see to that right now sir said nobby leaping sideways he dragged a handkerchief from his pocket spat on it and rubbed hurriedly at colons temporary pip all gone now fred he said well done said carrot he got up and went over to the window it did not in fact offer much in the way of a view but he looked out of it as if he could see to the end of the world colon and nobby shifted uneasily right now they did not like the sound of silence when carrot did speak they blinked as if struck in the face by a cold flannel what i believe there has been here he said is a confused situation thats right thats right said nobby quickly we was very confused fred he jabbed fred colon with his elbow waking him from a reverie of terror uh oh right oh yeah confusion he mumbled and im afraid i know where the blame ultimately lies carrot went on still apparently engrossed in the spectacle of a man sweeping the opera house steps in the silence nobbys lips moved in prayer only the whites of fred colons eyes could be seen it was my fault said carrot i blame myself mister vimes left me in charge and i rushed off with no thought of my duty and put everyone in an impossible position fred and nobby were both wearing the same expression it was the face of a man who has seen the light at the end of the tunnel and it has turned out to be the twinkle of the fairy of hope i feel almost embarrassed to ask you two to get me out of this pit i have dug for myself said carrot i cant imagine what mister vimes is going to say the light at the end of the tunnel winked out for fred and nobby they could imagine what mister vimes would say however said carrot he returned to the desk and pulled open the bottom drawer extracting a few grubby pages that were clipped together they waited however each of these men took the kings shilling and swore an oath to defend the kings peace said carrot tapping the paper an oath in fact to the king yeah but that was only aargh said fred colon sorry sir said nobby i inadvertently trod heavily on freds toe while standing to attention there was a longdrawnout silken sound carrot was drawing his sword from its sheath he laid it on the desk nobby and colon leaned away from its accusatory point they are all good lads said carrot softly im sure if the two of you call on each and every one of them and explain the situation they will see where their duty lies tell them tell them there is always an easy way if you know where to look and then we can get on with our jobs and when mister vimes returns from his wellearned holiday the somewhat confused events of the past will be merely confusin suggested nobby hopefully exactly said carrot but im glad to see you made so much headway with the paperwork fred colon stood nailed to the spot until nobby saluting desperately with the other hand dragged him out of the office angua could hear them arguing all the way down the stairs carrot stood up dusted off the chair and placed it carefully under the desk well were home he said yes said angua and she thought you do know how to do nasty dont you but you use it like a claw it slides out when you need it and when you dont theres no sign that its there he reached over and took her hand wolves never look back
