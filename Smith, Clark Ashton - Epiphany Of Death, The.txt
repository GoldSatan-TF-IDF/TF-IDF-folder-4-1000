the epiphany of death clark ashton smith i find it peculiarly difficult to express the exact nature of the sentiment which tomeron had always evoked in me however i am sure that the feeling never partook at any time of what is ordinarily known as friendship it was a compound of unusual esthetic and intellectual elements and was somehow closely allied in my thoughts with the same fascination that has drawn me ever since childhood toward all things that are remote in space and time or which have about them the irresolvable twilight of antiquity somehow tomeron seemed never to belong to the present but one could readily have imagined him as living in some bygone age about him there was nothing whatever of the lineaments of our own period and he even went so far as to affect in his costume an approximation to the garments worn several centuries ago his complexion was extremely pale and cadaverous and he stooped heavily from poring over ancient tomes and no less ancient maps he moved always with the slow meditative pace of one who dwells among faroff memories and reveries and he spoke often of people and events and ideas that have long since been forgotten for the most part he was apparently unheedful of present things and i felt that for him the huge city of ptolemides in which we both dwelt with all its manifold clamor and tumult was little more than a labyrinth of painted vapors there was a like vagueness in the attitude of others toward tomeron and though he had always been accepted without question as a representative of the noble and otherwise extinct family from whom he claimed descent nothing appeared to be known about his actual birth and antecedents with two servants who were both deafmutes who were very old and who likewise wore the raiment of a former age he lived in the semiruinous mansion of his ancestors where it was said none of the family had dwelt for many generations there he pursued the occult and recondite studies that were so congenial to his mind and there at certain intervals i was wont to visit him i cannot recall the precise date and circumstances of the be ginning of my acquaintance with tomeron though i come of a hardy line that is noted for the sanity of its constitution my faculties had been woefully shaken by the horror of the happening with which that acquaintance ended my memory is not what it was and there are certain lacunae for which my readers must contrive to forgive me the only wonder is that my powers of recollection have survived at all beneath the hideous burden they have had to bear for in a more than metaphoric sense i have been as one condemned to carry with him at all times and in all places the loathsome incubi of things long dead and corrupt i can readily recall however the studies to which tomeron had devoted himself the lost demonian volumes from hyperborea and mu and atlantis with which his library shelves were heaped to the ceiling and the queer charts not of any land that lies above the surface of the earth on which he pored by perpetual candlelight i shall not speak of these studies for they would seem too fantastic and too macabre for credibility and that which i have to relate is incredible enough in itself i shall speak however of certain strange ideas with which tomeron was much preoccupied and concerning which he so often discoursed to me in that deep guttural and monotonous voice of his that had the reverberation of unsounded caverns in its tones and cadences he maintained that life and death were not the fixed conditions that people commonly believed them to be that the two realms were often intermingled in ways not readily discerned and had penumbral borderlands that the dead were not always the dead nor the living the living as such terms are habitually understood but the manner in which he spoke of these ideas was extremely vague and general and i could never induce him to specify his meaning or to profer some concrete illustration that would render it more intelligible to a mentality such as mine that unused to dealing in the cobwebs of abstraction behind his words there hovered or seemed to hover a legion of dark amorphous images that i couid never formulate or depict to myself in any way until the final denouement of our descent into the catacombs of ptolemides i have already said that my feeling for tomeron was never anything that could be classified as friendship but even from the first i was well aware that tomeron had a curious fondness for me a fondness whose nature i could not comprehend and with which i could hardly even sympathize though he fascinated me at all times there were occasions when my interest was not unalloyed with an actual sense of repulsion at whiles his pallor was too cadaverous too suggestive of fungi that have grown in the dark or of leprous bones by moonlight and the stoop of his shoulders conveyed to my brain the idea that they bore a burden of centuries through which no man could conceivably have lived he aroused al ways a certain awe in me and the awe was sometimes mingled with an indeterminate fear i do not remember how long our acquaintance had continued but i do remember that he spoke with increasing frequency toward the end of those bizarre ideas at which i have hinted always i felt that he was troubled about something for he often looked at me with a mournful gleam in his hollow eyes and sometimes he would speak with peculiar stress of the great regard that he had for me and one night he said theolus the time is coming when you must kmow the truth must know me as i am and not as i have been permitted to seem there is a term to all things and all things are obedient to inexorable laws i would that it were otherwise but neither i nor any man among the living or among the dead can lengthen at will the term of any state or condition of being or alter the laws that decree such conditions perhaps it was well that i did not understand him and that i was unable to attach much importance to his words or to the singular intentness of his bearing as he uttered them for a few more days i was spared the knowledge which i now carry then one evening tomeron spoke thus i am now compelled to ask an odd favor of you which i hope you will grant in consideration of our long friendship the favor is that you accompany me this very night to those vaults of my family which lie in the catacombs of ptolemides though much surprised by the request and not altogether pleased i was nevertheless unable to deny him i could not imagine the purpose of such a visit as the one proposed but as was my wont i forbore to interrogate tomeron and merely told him that i would accompany him to the vaults if such where his desire i thank you theolus for this proof of friendship he replied earnestly believe me i am loath to ask it but there has been a certain deception an odd misunderstanding which cannot go on any longer tonight you will learn the truth carrying torches we left the mansion of tameron and sought the ancient catacombs of ptolemides which lie beyond the walls and have long been disused for there is now a fine necropolis in the very heart of the city the moon had gone down beyond the desert that encroaches toward the catacombs and we were forced to light our torches long before we came to the subterranean adits for the rays of mars and jupiter in a sodden and funereal sky were not enough to illumine the perilous path we followed among mounds and fallen obelisks and broken graves at length we discovered the dark ang weedchoked entrance of the charnels and here tomeron led the way with a swiftness and surety of footing that bespoke long familiarity with the place entering we found ourselves in a crumbling passage where the bones of dilapidated skeletons were scattered amid the rubble that had fallen from the sides and roof a choking stench of stagnant air and ageold corruption made me pause for an instant but tomeron scarcely appeared to perceive it for he strode onward lifting his torch and beckoning me to follow we traversed many vaults in which mouldy bones verdigris eaten sarcophagi were piled about the walls or strewn where desecrating thieves had left them in bygone years the air was increasingly dank chill and miasmal and mephitic shadows crouched or swayed before our torches in every niche and corner also as we went onward the walls became more ruinous and the bones we saw on every hand were greener with the mould of time at length we rounded a sudden angle of the low cavern we were following here we came to vaults that evidently belonged to some noble family for they were quite spacious and there was but one sarcophagus in each vault my ancestors and my family lie here announced tomeron we reached the caverns end and were confronted by a blank wall at one side was the final vault in which an empty sarcophagus stood open the sarcophagus was wrought of the finest bronze and was richly carven tomeron paused before the vault and turned to me by the flickering uncertain light i thought that i saw a look of strange and unaccountable distress on his features i must beg you to withdraw for a moment he said in a low and sorrowful voice afterward you can return surprised and puzzled i obeyed his request and went slowly back along the passage for some distance then i returned to the place where i had left him my surprise was heightened when i found that he had extinguished his torch and had dropped it on the threshold of the final vault and tomeron himself was not visible anywhere entering the vault since there was seemingly no other place where he could have hidden himself i looked about for him but the room was empty at least i thought it empty till i looked again at the richiy carven sarcophagus and saw that it was now tenanted for a cadaver lay within shrouded in a windingsheet of a sort that has not been used for centuries in ptolemides i drew near to the sarcophagus and peering into the face of the cadaver i saw that it bore a fearful and strange re semblance to the face of tomeron though it was bloated and puffed with the adipocere of death and was purple with the shadows of decay and looking again i saw that it was indeed tomeron i would have screamed aloud with the horror that came upon me but my lips were benumbed and frozen and i could only whisper tomerons name but as i whispered it the lips of the cadaver seemed to part and the tip of its tongue protruded between them and i thought that the tip trembled as if tomeron were about to speak and answer me but gazing more closely i saw that the trembling was merely the movement of worms as they twisted up and down and to and fro and sought to crowd each other from tomerons tongue
