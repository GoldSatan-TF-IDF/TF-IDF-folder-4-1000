what is the soul bertrand russell one of the most painful circumstances of recent advances in science is that each one makes us know less than we thought we did when i was young we all knew or thought we knew that a man consists of a soul and a body that the body is in time and space but the soul is in time only whether the soul survives death was a matter as to which opinions might differ but that there is a soul was thought to be indubitable as for the body the plain man of course considered its existence selfevident and so did the man of science but the philosopher was apt to analyse it away after one fashion or another reducing it usually to ideas in the mind of the man who had the body and anybody else who happened to notice him the philosopher however was not taken seriously and science remained comfortably materialistic even in the hands of quite orthodox scientists nowadays these fine old simplicities are lost physicists assure us that there is no such thing as matter and psychologists assure us that there is no such thing as mind this is an unprecedented occurrence who ever heard of a cobbler saying that there was no such thing as boots or a tailor maintaining that all men are really naked yet that would have been no odder than what physicists and certain psychologists have been doing to begin with the latter some of them attempt to reduce everything that seems to be mental activity to an activity of the body there are however various difficulties in the way of reducing mental activity to physical activity i do not think we can yet say with any assurance whether these difficulties are or are not insuperable what we can say on the basis of physics itself is that what we have hitherto called our body is really an elaborate scientific construction not corresponding to any physical reality the modern wouldbe materialist thus finds himself in a curious position for while he may with a certain degree of success reduce the activities of the mind to those of the body he cannot explain away the fact that the body itself is merely a convenient concept invented by the mind we find ourselves thus going round and round in a circle mind is an emanation of body and body is an invention of mind evidently this cannot be quite right and we have to look for something that is neither mind nor body out which both can spring let us begin with the body the plain man thinks that material objects must certainly exist since they are evident to the senses whatever else may be doubted it is certain that anything you can bump into must be real this is the plain mans metaphysic this is all very well but the physicist comes along and shows that you never bump into anything even when you run your hand along a stone wall you do not really touch it when you think you touch a thing there are certain electrons and protons forming part of your body which are attracted and repelled by certain electrons and protons in the thing you think you are touching but there is no actual contact the electrons and protons in your body becoming agitated by nearness to the other electrons and protons are disturbed and transmit a disturbance along your nerves to the brain the effect in the brain is what is necessary to your sensation of contact and by suitable experiments this sensation can be made quite deceptive the electrons and protons themselves however are only crude first approximations a way of collecting into a bundle either trains of waves or the statistical probabilities of various different kinds of events thus matter has become altogether too ghostly to be used as an adequate stick with which to beat the mind matter in motion which used to seem so unquestionable turns out to be a concept quite inadequate for the needs of physics nevertheless modern science gives no indication whatever of the existence of the soul or mind as an entity indeed the reasons for disbelieving in it are very much of the same kind as the reasons for disbelieving in matter mind and matter were something like the lion and the unicorn fighting for the crown the end of the battle is not the victory of one or the other but the discovery that both are only heraldic inventions the world consists of events not of things that endure for a long time and have changing properties events can be collected into groups by their causal relations if the causal relations are of one sort the resulting group of events may be called a physical object and if the causal relations are of another sort the resulting group may be called a mind any event that occurs inside a mans head will belong to groups of both kinds well maybe not any event to take drastic example being shot in the head considered as belonging to a group of one kind it is a constituent of his brain and considered as belonging to a group of the other kind it is a constituent of his mind thus both mind and matter are merely convenient ways of organizing events there can be no reason for supposing that either a piece of mind or a piece of matter is immortal the sun is supposed to be losing matter at the rate of millions of tons a minute the most essential characteristic of mind is memory and there is no reason whatever to suppose that the memory associated with a given person survives that persons death indeed there is every reason to think the opposite for memory is clearly connected with a certain kind of brain structure and since this structure decays at death there is every reason to suppose that memory also must cease although metaphysical materialism cannot be considered true yet emotionally the world is pretty much the same as it would be if the materialists were in the right i think the opponents of materialism have always been actuated by two main desires the first to prove that the mind is immortal and the second to prove that the ultimate power in the universe is mental rather than physical in both these respects i think the materialists were in the right our desires it is true have considerable power on the earths surface the greater part of the land on this planet has a quite different aspect from that which it would have if men had not utilized it to extract food and wealth but our power is very strictly limited we cannot at present do anything whatever to the sun or moon or even to the interior of the earth and there is not the faintest reason to suppose that what happens in regions to which our power does not extend has any mental causes that is to say to put the matter in a nutshell there is no reason to think that except on the earths surface anything happens because somebody wishes it to happen and since our power on the earths surface is entirely dependent upon the sun we could hardly realize any of our wishes if the sun grew could it is of course rash to dogmatize as to what science may achieve in the future we may learn to prolong human existence longer than now seems possible but if there is any truth in modern physics more particularly in the second law of thermodynamics we cannot hope that the human race will continue for ever some people may find this conclusion gloomy but if we are honest with ourselves we shall have to admit that what is going to happen many millions of years hence has no very great emotional interest for us here and now and science while it diminishes our cosmic pretensions enormously increases our terrestrial comfort that is why in spite of the horror of the theologians science has on the whole been tolerated
