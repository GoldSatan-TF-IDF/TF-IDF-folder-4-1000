princes street and one man is killed assistant chief constable bob skinner head of cid soon learns this was no accident for a few hours later a threatening letter is delivered to the secretary of state supposedly from a freedom group demanding political separation from england skinner quickly assembles his team with sas backup and organises a news blackout to avoid widespread panic yet despite a huge security check on the following afternoon an american opera singer becomes the second victim as the atrocities escalate skinner realises this is no gang of bloodthirsty fanatics but a highly professional international team with access to the most sophisticated armaments available and behind the nightmare scenario lies a hidden agenda which threatens the ancient honour of scotland praise

unicyle even through the happy smile makeup it registered as he struggled to regain his balance rocking frantically backwards and forwards on his unsteady perch his arms flailed and for a second it seemed certain that he was gone but with a violent lastditch heave he pulled himself back to the vertical straightening quickly in the saddle and resuming his compromise with gravity the real life smile returned behind the rictus he swerved suddenly towards skinner and sarah under bobs arm sarahs shoulders still shook with laughter from the sight of this silent struggle she leaned against her husband as the clown drew closer fully in command of his steed once more the unicyclist thrust out his right hand offering them a leaflet sarah reached up and took it from him waving him goodbye as he wobbled on towards his next target she studied the handbill le cirque mobile leith links performances and nightly hmm hope the rest are a bloody sight more mobile than him skinner said dryly lets find out some night my treat put like that doctor sarah grace skinner youre on his wife hugged him tight with her left arm as they made their way slowly and haphazardly through the crowds which thronged the open area at the foot of the mound around the greypillared royal scottish academy and its yellow stone neighbour the national gallery of scotland the classical formality of the buildings was in strange contrast to the garish makeup and dress of the fringe performers who were muling around the pedestrian area promoting the opening nights of their various shows skinners sweater was slung over his left shoulder hanging from his thumb by its label as the sun had climbed higher in the sky in the late august morning its heat had caught him by surprise he was a tall strongly built man greymaned but still looking younger than his fortyfour years he walked straight backed and broadchested with a mass of curly hair filling the v of his opennecked shirt sarahs lean and sinuous body seemed to fit perfectly against his held by the tanned right arm which spanned her shoulders her auburn hair sparkled in the sun and an easy smile played around the corners of her mouth as she relaxed against her chosen mate enjoying the beauty of the morning summer tends to bypass scotland in july the month in which most of its families normally take their annual holidays those who can afford it make for the airports en route for the mediterranean the canary islands or the aegean those with no spending power or no stomach for flying either stay at home adults in the pub offspring watching satellite tv movies or cling to windswept lochsides in caravans as the bleak season runs its course then in august the penance is over as the factories reopen and builders buttocks peek out anew from jeans on construction sites across the country the skies clear and the sun resumes its daily journey from edinburgh to glasgow this turn in the weather coincides with the opening of the edinburgh international festival the festival is a misnomer in reality for the season of the arts in scotlands capital is a gathering of gatherings from all over the world performers and audiences come for the official plays and concerts in the grandest venues for the connoisseurs film event for the conference of the mighty in television for the jazz and blues concerts around the pubs and hotels for the military tattoo in its steel arena on the sloping esplanade of the great castle and chaotically for the fringe that magnet for hundreds of theatre groups ranging from the most professional to the rankest amateur as is the case with many who have migrated from west to east in scotland there was a part of skinner which relished the time of the festivals they gave his adopted city an atmosphere which he could not imagine being matched anywhere in the world for the best part of a month the capital buzzed with excitement her streets filled with freak shows her pubs hotels and shops filled with visitors on the other hand as assistant chief constable skinner head of edinburghs criminal investigation department there was a ambivalent tinge to his appreciation of this unique ambience for the festival month brought with it an invasion of pickpockets conmen shoplifters and still the occasional drugdealer although the ranks of the pushers had been decimated by skinners own heavy hand and by the severity of the scottish courts still despite that downside this years festivals made skinner even happier than the contented man he had become since his marriage already he and sarah had spent days plotting their course through the hundreds of shows on offer to them and had worked out a rough running order however there were still some slots to be filled and for those in doubt mid day window shopping at the mound had become yet another fringe tradition surrounded by the jangle of competing musicians and the traffic noise from princes street one hundred yards away sarah did not react at all to the sound of the explosion but skinner tensed at once first sarah felt the bunching of the muscles of his arm then he took it from her shoulders his hand reaching subconsciously towards his left side he seemed to stretch to stand to his full height with eyebrows raised he looked around first to his left towards the west end of princes street then right towards waverley station and the balmoral hotel he turned his back on the street as his gaze swept up the jagged skyline as it rose to the bank of scotland head office past the assembly rooms and on towards the castleon its rock sarah tugged his arm what is it bob whats wrong didnt you hear it the sharpness of his tone stung her and she fired back hear what for christs sake all i can hear are guitars and fairground barkers what am i supposed to have heard a bang an explosion a fucking bomb thats what but i cant figure out where it went off are you sure bob couldnt it just have been some stunt here when he looked down at her his eyes were hard but they softened at once at seeing the hurt on her face im sorry love i didnt mean to snap at you no it wasnt as close as that i reckon it was somewhere between two and four hundred yards away but i cant pin down the exact location it was a bomb though for sure ive spent too long on antiterrorist training courses not to recognise that sound he looked back towards princes street the traffic was still flowing freely from west to east but closer to them on the streets south side it seemed to have dwindled to a trickle only a public service bus and two cars could now be seen slowing as the lights changed to red skinner flicked open the button which secured the left breast pocket of his shirt and took out a small mobile telephone he switched it on and keyed in a shortcoded number the headquarters switchboard answered within three seconds this is acc skinner give me the duty inspector in communications control fast yes sir he heard the buzz as the call was rerouted once again it was picked up quickly central control inspector good skinner knew the man and was pleased to hear his voice he had him marked down as experienced and unflappable acc skinner here henry have you had anything through from the princes street area within the last halfminute or so princes street sir not that ive heard hold on a minute lads anyone picked up suddenly skinner heard an excited voice in the background then louder he heard good issue orders to his officers get our nearest units there at once make sure all the other emergency services are on the way then get on to the bomb squad skinner heard the control room burst into activity as the inspector turned his attention back to him that was something just then sir a shout from waverley market from that big entertainment tent they stick on top of it for the festival a report of an explosion it came in on all services required the caller said it looked as if there were casualties where are you just now sir dr grace and i are only about two hundred and fifty yards away we are on our way right now you get hold of dci martin and tell him to get there pronto he pushed the end button folded the telephone and replaced it in his pocket sarah looked at him wideeyed questioning but calm so see that big tent along there the one with the flag in front thats where it happened youre needed as well so lets leg it along there breaking into a trot he set off out of the impromptu showground its cacophony and its tumult still unaffected by the drama nearby sarah gripping his hand ran alongside him keeping pace with his loping stride faced with a throng of pedestrians in princes street skinner pulled her behind him into its treelined gardens they ran across the grass skirted the towering grey neogothic scott monument and reached the exit which faced waverley market the deckedover centre which provides the only shopping on the south side of princes street without compromising its famous skyline they were confronted by a scene of panic and confusion around the big marquee the entrance which faced them looked undamaged but they could see that towards the rear of the huge tent a main support pillar had collapsed people stood around some simply looking stunned others in tears somewhere in the crowd a man was screaming hysterically a few held handkerchiefs to head wounds as bob and sarah took in the scene from across the street a girl stumbled from the tents wide entrance above which the sponsors name was emblazoned skinner guessed that she had been wearing a tartan uniform shreds of her skirt hung from her waist and a piece of fabric still clung to her left arm as it dangled broken at her side her face was a mask of blood her blonde hair looked singed in places if the girl was aware of being virtually naked it concerned her not at all as she felt her way blindly forward with her uninjured right arm the crowd around them was growing thicker as people emerged from the shopping centre beneath the tent shock replacing curiosity on their faces as they were gathered into the chaos again skinner took sarah by the arm and pulled her after him stopping the traffic with an upraised hand they crossed the street together jogged up the short slope back into princes street and made their way towards the damaged marquee just as they arrived a panda car drew up and skinner saw a traffic vehicle approaching also he waited for its arrival then called all of the four uniformed officers to him whats your name skinner asked the one sergeant among the four feeling the inevitable pang of guilt which struck him every time he failed to recall the name of any police officer of promoted rank sergeant holland sir right sergeant take charge outside here till a senior uniform arrives use your three constables to divert traffic eastbound at the traffic lights past the balmoral westbound at jenners corner and southbound up in st andrew square he pointed for emphasis in each direction as he issued his orders for now you place yourself at the entrance to ithe tent and keep the public out as more officers arrive use them to clear the immediate area completely to make room for the emergency services meantime sarah had gone to the assistance of the naked blinded victim she had taken off her own light cotton jacket and had draped it around the girls shoulders comforting her as best she could while quickly assessing her injuries skinner called over to her as she worked love i want you to round up the walking casualties and take them across the street into the gardens as far away as the scott monument and behind it for safety the sergeant here will route the ambulances to you as they arrive sarah nodded acknowledgement but to the back of his head for skinner was already striding off towards the tent she turned towards the crowd which had gathered in princes street hey are there any doctors or nurses here she shouted a middleaged man and two young women raised their hands well why the hell are you standing there gawping come over here and help me with these people the two girls ran forward at once but the man though closest of the three merely shook his head slowly mouthing sorry i sarah stared at him astonished youre a doctor yes so help here for christs sake the man shook his balding head again im sorry but i cant i work in a hospital my indemnity cover doesnt extend to situations like these in that case said sergeant holland who had overheard the exchange on your bike or ill do you for obstruction the neon striplights were still working as skinner stepped into the big marquee it was sectioned off by a canvas divider which stretched almost its full width with only a short gap on the right acting as a doorway this partition was torn in two places but that was the only damage apparent in that part of the tent a small stage fringed by a blue velvet pelmet and edged by potted greenery had been set up against the perimeter canvas on the left the paved deck of the waverley centre had been covered with green hessian flooring and goldpainted blueupholstered seats were arranged on it theatrestyle around the small stage two long rectangular tables stood against the tent wall opposite the stage each was covered by a white cloth ruffled by the force of the blast but still held in place by boxes of wineglasses presumably there in readiness for the marquees first festival party skinner did not notice the young man at first it was a faint whimper that made him look across the rows of seats to catch sight of the figure sitting on the floor his face buried in his hands his shoulders shaking skinner spoke softly not wanting to startle the boy son are you all right son the youth turned his head slowly to look up him his face was chalkwhite in awful contrast with the drying blood across his forehead then he stood up unsteadily and skinner saw the rest of it smeared across the front of his blue and black striped heart of midlothian replica football shirt spread also on his black denim jeans and matting in his hair go and see danny mister go and see him go and see danny look at him hes all over me he began to cry softly at first then louder he slumped to his knees again and skinner went closer but he could think of nothing to do but put his hands on the boys shoulders for silent seconds he stood over the kneeling sobbing young man in a strange attitude of blessing well see to the lad sir the voice came from behind him he looked round to see an ambulance crew a man and a woman in uniform nodding but without a word the big detective took a step back then turned and walked towards the opening in the canvas wall as once it was clear to skinner that the explosion had originated in the far righthand corner of the tents inner apartment one of the structures stout supporting pillars had been blown to fragments and debris radiated outwards from that spot slowly skinner stepped towards the wreckage but suddenly he paused his eyes widening as he caught sight of what was left of danny the boy he had been sent there to see all of his clothes had been blown off the right arm and most of the right leg were missing forcing himself to look closer at the carnage skinner saw them lying a little way apart from the mangled torso he tensed and stepped closer keeping himself under control with an effort of will as he took in the horror of it in stages the corpse seemed to have been ripped open by shrapnel for metal glass and wood splinters were mixed in with the bloody mass the top of the young mans head had been sliced off and the blueygrey brain matter spread out beyond it skinner then realised that some of this terrible cocktail had been splashed on the boys friend nextdoor oh holy mother of god the voice came from behind skinner followed by the violent sounds of its owner vomiting skinner did not speak until the heaving had subsided then still without turning he said grimly didnt know you had got religion andy there was no reply other than another bout of retching you made it here fast detective chief inspector andrew martin head of special branch and once skinners personal assistant stepped up to stand alongside him not as fast as you boss but i wasnt that far away either sally and i were in john lewis when i got the shout she wasnt best pleased as a matter of fact she suggested it was a porky pie i had dreamed up to get out of shopping for her fucking curtains to hell with her i wish it had been a lie you should have brought her along to see for herself said skinner christ we get to clear up some right messes but this one he shook his head as his voice tailed away where were you boss along at the gallery precinct with sarah you heard the bang martin asked skinner nodded in confirmation what do you think it could have been it looks as if they were installing beer kegs in here could it have been one of the gas cylinders no way andy it was a bomb youve been on the courses too you know the different sound that explosives make that was what i heard anyway the beer and the gas bottles are all over there in that other corner he pointed a finger off to the left this was no accident some bastard did this in deadly earnest wed best be very careful just in case he left us any other wee parcels in fact i think that for once well be sensible and get the fuck out of here until the bomb squad arrives and checks the whole place over theres nothing we can do for poor danny there but we can empty the waverley centre and the balmoral next door they walked quickly from the tent outside more uniformed officers had arrived and were busy moving the crowds back an ambulance was pulling out of the princes street gardens gateway with its blue light whirling two others stood by waiting for passengers skinner caught sight of sarah beside the scott monument tending to dannys friend the boy from the tent as he looked on she wiped the blood from his forehead with a towel then helped him very gently to take off his frightful shirt for a moment the youth held it away from him at arms length then dropped it on the ground four fire appliances had arrived they were lined up on waverley bridge at the spot where normally the tour buses took on their passengers a senior fire officer recognising skinner came across what can we do here he asked nothing in the tent for now but you could tell your people to evacuate the shopping station and to close off the station exit up the waverley steps the officer nodded his bulky helmet giving this gesture added emphasis youve got it he turned and walked back towards the fire appliances barking out orders to his men skinner looked around for the highestranking policeman and soon spotted a superintendent in uniform he walked over and tapped the man on the shoulder the officer spun round impatient at first until recognition brought him swiftly to attention afternoon archie said skinner look i want the balmoral emptied see to it please then get on your radio and have someone tell the transport police on my authority that i want all trains stopped at haymarket and held up to the east until the bomb boys have cleared the site i dont want any more people in that station than can be helped if theres another bang it could bring down the glass roof if that one hasnt already the man saluted and moved away to carry out his orders skinner retraced his steps and found martin andy you get down to your office i want to know the minute someone claims responsibility for this mess and even if no one does i want the best analysis that your outfit can give me of the likely runners i dont recall any recent intelligence in my other job to give me a hint of this but ill look again you check your network for ideas maybe its the arabs getting even for us blowing out their plot pvescoanda own i dont fancy any of z rown some new ers of our the last one thetde wetl but the one i like le erronst outfit if thats so i o collected our ow them out wa to nail them quick and clean martin had been gone for less than ten minutes when the army bomb squad arrived from their base on the outskirts of the city major gabriel gammy legge their commander was well known to skinner from countless callouts to bomb hoaxes and from their work together on security preparations for royal and vip visits to the city the two stood beside the gold chairs in the first area of the marquee i suppose it was bound to happen one day bob said the slim soldier his accent was that of an ulsterman but its harsher tones had been smoothed away by years of military service all those false alarms and then when the real thing comes we dont have a chance to defuse it you might have that chance yet gammy theres all sorts of stuff lying in there needing to be checked out theres something else in there too maybe itll make you and your lads think twice about being heroes if it doesnt at the least itll sure as hell make you careful the smile left the majors face look out for yourselves but gammy i need the place checked out with all safe speed i need to get the forensics people in and i have to get the station reopened as soon as possible before the effect of train holdups ripples all the way down to london thank you robert ill take charge now the voice breaking in on their conversation came from the entrance to the marquee surprised and instantly annoyed skinner looked up to see the deputy chief constable in full uniform bearing down on him dcc edward mcguinness was in temporary command of the force in the absence on holiday of the recently knighted chief constable sir james proud skinner was aware that even at the best of times he was not the deputys favourite colleague at the chief constables regular management meetings he and mcguinness were drawn almost invariably to taking opposite sides in any debate now skinner guessed that to arrive at the disaster scene and find bob in command and matters well under control was more than the other man could bear mastering his irritation at mcguinnesss rankpulling he mustered a smile thats fine eddie im glad youre here crowd controls for the uniform branch anyway the dcc reddened id better fill you in since youve only just got here still smiling skinner seized him by the elbow and led him towards the entrance through the partition the bang happened through there some form of explosive we dont know for sure what but from the pattern of destruction it could have been semtex he ushered mcguinness through into the second area there have been some casualties almost all of them superficial apart from poor danny there the dcc had taken a few steps into the chamber before he realised what lay on the floor he started back in horror but skinner held tight to his elbow and drew him onwards mcguinnesss ruddy face had gone grey they can be hellish these crime scenes cant they eddie im glad youre here to take charge of this one ill be in my other office if you need me he slapped the dcc on the back in friendly fashion then turned and strode out of the marquee his grim smile broadening with every step skinners other office was a small room in st andrews house the headquarters of government in scotland three months before out of the blue he had received a telephone call from alan ballantyne then newly appointed as secretary of state for scotland the surprising thing he had thought as he answered that summons to a private meeting was that ballantyne had placed the call himself rather than arranging an appointment through his private secretary the unorthodoxy of this approach had soon been explained a suave politician ballantyne was still a few years short of forty and his rise to power had been meteoric it had been helped along by a lack of alternative talent among his partys scottish membership but nonetheless even with that dearth of competition his appointment to the cabinet had been greeted with some surprise on both sides of the commons chamber ballantyne was a stocky man with quick darting eyes and a quiff of frizzy hair which however expertly it was cut invariably stood up from the rest in defiance of gravity giving the appearance of a permanent overhanging questionmark at their first meeting in his office the new secretary of state had received the detective alone sorry about the mystery mr skinner but im finding that as in your own job there are one or two matters in mine which cant be delegated or even discussed over the telephone i find myself with a shall we say a personnel problem you will find many advisers to the secretary of state listed in those office directories over there but there is one who is not listed among the rest i think you are aware of the job im talking about and i believe that youre acquainted with the previous postholder he had paused then palms laid flat on the polished mahogany surface of his desk and had thrown skinner a sidelong glance which he still recalled vividly then he continued indeed i believe that you may even have had something to do with the mans rapid departure from office skinner had said nothing nor given anything away in his expression if thats the case mr skinner you yourself have left me with something of a problem so the way i see it now its up to you to solve it therefore with the approval of your chief constable i am inviting you to combine your present role within the police force with that of security adviser to the secretary of state in succession to mr hugh fulton at ballantynes suggestion skinner had called jimmy proud to discuss the offer there and then and had found his chief enthusiastic its an honour bob and itll be the first time that jobs been combined with active service in a police force theres all sorts of ways it could help you here of course i think you should take it who do you think put your name up anyway mind you combining the two jobs was my idea theres no way id want to lose you from here im not that bloody patriotic and so skinner had accepted with one proviso i dont want any more of this secrecy crap its well outdated hughie fulton used it only to build up a wall of mystique around him to suit his ego so if i take the job i go into the directories along with the doctors the dentists the social workers and all your other advisers if you say so the secretary of state had conceded but remember the confidentiality is most of all for your own protection skinner had laughed listen mr ballantyne i make enemies enough just by being head of edinburgh cid a few more wont bother me and so he had accepted the appointment in the ensuing weeks he had seen a lot of the secretary of state their meetings usually in private their relationship was informal and cordial yet skinner despite his long experience of appraising people still felt that he knew very little of the real man this secretary of state was an enigmatic secretive character and though skinner had sought to pinpoint the special quality which had won ballantyne his high office it remained hidden to him skinner had experienced no problems in coping with the extra workload of his parttime post most of it involved nothing more strenuous than writing reports to the secretary of state on an assortment of questions relating to his personal security and that of his junior ministers or to the security of establishments which were the responsibility of government directly or through its agencies he had taken the precaution of following some of his own security advice varying his daily routine rather more often than before garaging his car when possible and checking underneath it whenever it had been left in a public place for any length of time but overall his new job which carried a modest additional salary had made his life no more difficult than before however it had given him as a serving policeman one very big advantage as hugh fulton had been before him skinner was now regarded as an active member of the uk security service as such he had access to the latest files on terrorism at national and international level intelligence far more sensitive than any available to andy martins special branch network for example skinner was briefed fully on the ulster unionist plot foiled earlier that summer to assassinate president clinton in new york and on the secret elimination by the sas only a month before of an underground organisation in hong kong which had been planning violent public opposition to the forthcoming chinese takeover he had been told of the rigorous international search for the ringleaders in each case and of the harsh orders to be carried out should any of them be traced in britain he knew the true operational strength of the various northern irish paramilitary groups and was aware of the routes which were used to smuggle weapons and explosives to the british mainland he had heard rumours too of the summary justice meted out to those terrorists who by chance fell into the hands of the sas rather than the police but he knew of nothing at all on either the mi or the special branch networks which offered the faintest clue to the identity of the perpetrators of the waverley centre explosion much of the information held by mi is stored on computer skinner had access to it through a modem and a dedicated secure telephone line seated before his terminal in his st andrews house office he gained entry to the network by keying in his personal code a fiveletter password known only to him which was made up of his parents initials the colour screen lit up to be filled rapidly by a directory one by one skinner selected all of the most recent intelligence files then others which had any bearing on uk security or uk nationals or which attempted to predict future trends in terrorism he found a forecast of renewed irish activity on the mainland in late september through early october with a flash that a major event was planned for the week of the conservative party conference there was a warning of possible trouble within the chinese community in the wake of the recent hong kong incident another file reported that a senior government minister had become a major security risk because of an active homosexual relationship with a military attache from a north african embassy there was a warning posted of the possibility of further basque nationalist activity against british tourists arriving on flights into malaga and alicante airports but there was nothing nothing at all to suggest the likelihood of terrorist attacks in scotland after closing the last file skinner stared for a few seconds at the blank screen then with a shake of his head signed out of the network he picked up his secure telephone and called andy martins directline number which was also scrambled howre you getting on ive turned up nothing here the neither one thing i have done though is track down the managing director of the firm that sponsored that marquee some big knitwear outfit or other to check whether theyve got any serious business rivals or if there are any former employees with a grievance hes thinking over the second possibility but a lo i said theres no chance of the first he claims he knows all his rivals personally theyre all in the same golf club he reckons that alone would rule out any nasties skinner chuckled course it would you cant play golf with a man then bomb his business just isnt done got any other theories mboy martin exhaled noisily at his end of the line none that are worth a stuff boss ive checked out the nats and some of the wilder boys in the homerule wing of the labour party but theres absolutely nothing on any of the characters weve got on file to suggest that theyd be capable of this and just suppose there is a home ruler out there of a mind to do something stupid why the hell would he do it in some bloody tent hed choose a high profile target wouldnt he no my best guess is that its linked in some way to the sponsors of that marquee and thats all ive got skinner grunted and as far as im concerned you havent even got that ok andy im on my way down to fettes well need to work out a statement on this and get it out before the media start a public panic through lack of solid information see you shortly skinner was turning the key of the fivelever chubb lock to close his office door when his mobile telephone started its trembling call sound he dug it out of the breast pocket of his shirt and pushed the receive button skinner bob its alan ballantyne here im at number can you get here right away please skinner recognised concern almost alarm in the secretary of states voice but made an effort to keep his own tone relaxed sure alan im at the house just now ill be with you in five minutes thats good but use the back door will you i dont want anyone to know youre here skinners new bmw was parked in his reserved space in the st andrews house courtyard where he and sarah had left it earlier that day as he pulled out of the exit gates held open for him by a security guard he saw the traffic tailed back from the closed section of princes street so he nipped across the flow and headed eastwards turning into regent terrace just three minutes later he pulled off st colrne street and up the rising driveway which led into the car park at the rear of number charlotte square after parking he called andy martin to warn him that he had been delayed but without telling him exactly where he was then he climbed out of the bmw locked it securely headed over to the anonymous blue painted back door and rang its brass bell the official residence of the secretary of state for scotland had been gifted to the nation by an aristocratic family to be used for that special purpose it is a noble georgian building in the centre of the terrace extending along the north side of charlotte square edinburghs finest unlike downing street there is no ministerial office in number its only business function is to serve as a venue for government receptions and official dinner parties however its private apartments are occupied frequently by scottish office ministers particularly those with rural i constituencies alan ballantyne was member of parliament for a sprawling seat in the northeast of scotland skinner knew too that he had a shaky marriage and that he used his edinburgh residence on occasion as a bolthole the back door was opened by a beautiful woman she looked to be around thirty and was dressed in a silk blouse and a perfectly cut beige skirt about sarahs age skinner thought and he doesnt have any sisters dressed with money too careful alan careful the blondes accent sounded even more expensive than her clothes mr skinner he nodded come away in youre expected im carlie by the way a sort of friend of the family she led him up a flight of stairs which ascended to an austere hallway at street level at the top she turned to him alans waiting for you in the drawingroom do you know the way from here skinner smiled yes ive been here a few times usually get to use the front door though carlie returned his grin and disappeared through a door at the back of the hall skinner continued up a second flight of stone stairs one of the double doors to the drawingroom lay open he entered and closed it behind him the magnificent room extended across the full width of the house its original fixtures had all been preserved and the antique furniture and fittings were in tune with the period of the building itself the secretary of state for scotland stood leaning with his left forearm on the mantelpiece of the big empty fireplace his right hand held a heavy crystal glass in which a peaty liquid swirled skinner was astonished by this as he knew the man rarely drank alcohol in any form ballantyne turned at the sound of the closing of the door bob am i glad to see you want a drink skinner shook his head too early for me alan the too as a rule but when you hear what i have to tell you youll understand why first things first tell me about this explosion everything you know or suspect dont worry about anyone walking in on us theres no staff here today and ive told carlie not to disturb us ballantyne led the way over to two finely carved tightly upholstered armchairs at the far end of the room they sat down facing each other skinner leaned forward his forearms on his knees and looked the secretary of state in the eye well first of all there was no warning no tipoff no chance to clear the place whoever planted that bomb meant for it to go off and didnt care a bit about casualties mind you i dont think that it was meant particularly to cause injury it was placed in a corner of the tent and the lad who was killed a poor wee bugger called danny baker was just unlucky he was standing right next to the thing when it went off it blew him to bits and hurt quite a few other people but none of the survivors seems to have been critically injured the boys body probably shielded the rest of them we dont know for sure but the army people think it was some semtex device so it wouldnt have been very big and could have been stashed in anything a biscuit tin or any container like that something took the top of the boy bakers head off it could have been the lid as bauantyne winced at the thought skinner went on so despite the recklessness i think that this was meant as some sort of demonstration the objective could have been just to bring down the tent and attract public attention but its the why that beats me as for who our somebody might be ive looked at all the obvious candidates and i dont fancy any of them thereve been no hints from the intelligence networks of anything cooking so it looks like either a random nutter or a completely new setup its the semtex that worries me most of all you dont steal that stuff from construction sites anybody who can get his hands on semtex is either tied into an international terror group or has serious cash at his disposal i wish to god i knew which it is the thing that surprises me alan is that we havent had a call yet id have expected whoever did this to have been in touch by now identifying himself telling us what its all about and making some specific demands but so far theres been nothing at all ballantyne leaned back in his chair thats where youre wrong bob he said softly skinners eyebrows rose the secretary of state normally laid back and selfassured seemed as tense as the mainspring of an overwound watch ballantyne jumped up and strode across the room to a fine georgian writing table he picked up a brown a manila envelope and walked back towards skinner thrusting it before him there you are take a look at this it was handed in at st andrews house by a motorcyclist half an hour ago the security staff checked that i was here then sent it along to me read it man skinner took the envelope from ballantyne noticing that the mans hand was trembling a white address label was stuck precisely in the centre the words on it were neatly typed alan ballantyne mp st andrews house edinburgh to be opened by addressee only in contrast to the neatness of the label the envelope itself had been ripped open crudely skinner prised its sides apart with two fingers and saw inside a single sheet of white paper taking it by one corner he withdrew it carefully and laid it on the open palm of his left hand he looked at it for a moment then began to read to the socalled secretary of state for scotland from the fighters for an independent scotland by now you will have learned of the demonstration staged earlier today by the true representatives of the people of scotland for the benefit and enlightenment of you and your colleagues in the government of the occupying power be in no doubt that this was only a small token of the resources which are available to us and it is no more than a first warning our demands are simple and clear your westminster parliament will agree at once to take steps to annul the fraudulent treaty of union and to restore full power and authority to the estates of scotland through its properly elected parliament we have been compelled to take this stern action by the intransigence of your government and by the collaboration of the socalled opposition panics in denying scotland its birthright todays operation should be interpreted as a declaration of intent at the moment of writing this communique we cannot know whether it will be completed without casualties but if people have been killed or injured they should be seen as martyrs to the scottish cause the same will be true of those others who will be called upon to sacrifice themselves if you do not yield to our demands the edinburgh international festival has been chosen as the stage for our drama we hope that this will be a play in one act only but unless scotlands independence is restored at once there will be further scenes escalating in their violence until you the oppressors are forced to submit scotland deserves that the whole world should see her regain her freedom with this in mind the contents of this letter are being released simultaneously to the media future communiques from us should they be necessary will use the code word arbroath to demonstrate their authenticity skinner pursed his lips and whistled softly he glanced up at ballantyne wordy bastard this one is he not lovely turn of phrase poor dannyd be chuffed to know hes joined the great honour roll of martyrdom he paused and looked at the note again what have you done about the bit on the end ballantyne looked puzzled what do you mean come on alan get a grip what have you done about the press nothing so far do you take this thing seriously skinner pointed to his right foot see that stain on my shoe thats blood too effing right i take it seriously he took out his mobile telephone and punched in a number andy its bob listen i need you to act fast the secretary of states had a letter claiming responsibility for our bomb they say theyve put it out to the press too but they dont say how chances are theyll issue it by hand or by telephone i dont think theyd be daft enough to use a fax get hold of alan royston our press officer whatever golf course hes on and tell him to get his arse into the office while hes doing that you put out a holding statement on the explosion via our mercury distribution network dont say much just that the cause is being investigated then tell royston to field all incoming calls and while youre at it tell dcc mcguinness thats the sb party line and that hes to stick to it better still hes to say nothing at all will he take that from me hell take it from me use my name once that statement has gone out i want you to stop all other coverage use your duty staff and get them calling round all the media if anyone hasnt received the letter yet then tell them about it whatever the case say that we hope its a crank but that we need a complete news blackout on it while we study the contents run forensic tests and so on they can say that theyre calling on my behalf with the full authority of the security service and that dnotice procedures apply if any editor refuses to cooperate arrest him and let me know skinner heard martin gasp at the other end of the line thats a bit beyond dnotice procedure boss we cant just lift an editor because he wont do what we ask we dont have the i i skinner cut him off short andy i dont think youll need to go that far but if you do youll find that the secretary of state has just given me the authority i need that covers it now dont waste any time get on with it as soon as thats under way here are a few other things thatll need doing first locate all the scottish office ministers plus the lord advocate and the solicitor general and give them all special branch armed close protection then get round all the police forces in scotland and advise them that all public buildings police stations the lot should upgrade their alert status to one level short of the maximum he cut the line and turned to ballantyne did you hear that secretary of state i need you to sign a piece of paper dont i need downing street approval youve got more power than you realise alan you should read the new act the home secretary in england and you here in scotland have the right to take certain actions on the advice of the security service and to tell downing street afterwards well thanks to you im the security service and im giving you that advice now theres no such thing as an antiterrorist branch in scotland but if we have grown our own proves after all these years youre going to have to put one together quickly the faster we move the better the chance of killing the beast at birth and itll be easier if we can control the flow of information skinner looked ballantyne straight in the eye and the secretary of state returned his gaze he looked full of doubt but slowly nodded his head ok bob youre on if you take the letter that seriously ill back you that far set up your antiterrorist squad youre in command you can have your emergency power to control the media all i ask is that before you use it you remember that id like to be reelected in a couple of years time what else do you need tanks skinner grinned naw air coverll be enough ill pick my own team mostly theyll be people i know and trust id like to bring in someone with irish experience ill expect full cooperation from other forces where necessary but ive got no worries on that score have your private office call every chief constable to a briefing in st andrews house tomorrow morning and ill tell them whats going on i have a local problem in that mcguinness is standing in for jimmy proud id appreciate it if you would call him yourself and tell him politely to keep out of my hair i dont want any nonsense from that quarter his composure completely restored ballantyne nodded his head vigorously youll have all that ill call mypps now and ill have the solicitors office draw up that paper and get it here for signature today that way if you do have to jail the controller of bbc scotland at least youll be doing it legally you are certain that this wasnt just a gas explosion arent you skinner shook his head alan if that was a gas explosion then ill never use my cooker again then quite suddenly his expression changed his grey eyes had lost their warmth look id love to be wrong but im not like it or not youve got some big decisions to make my friend for what its worth heres how i see them do you could you close down the festival no way its too big and its too late everyones here tickets are sold and the shows start tonight do you warn the public id say not at this stage itd be too easy to start a panic and we would for sure frighten off thousands ofvisitors it could just be that all our friends are aiming to do is to disrupt the festival for now at least if we let them do it that easily then were in real longterm trouble that letter gives us nothing solid to go on all we can do is hunt these people as best we can and hope we get lucky but chances are the next move is theirs we all of us have got to live with that probability he paused looking hard at ballantyne then he said thats policemans advice secretary of state and for a reason ill teli you shortly its the most honest youre ever likely to receive its not a political judgement thats your arena but these are decisions that need to be taken now ballantyne returned his gaze he had respected bob skinner from the beginning of their relationship but now he began to understand the very strange thing that sir james proud imposing and unimpeachable as ever in full uniform had said as they had discussed skinners appointment bob is the son i never had hes clever and intuitive as a detective hes strict but fair as a commander hes charming and generous as a man yet inside all that there lives also the most fearsome human being i know i hope you never have to encounter that side of him looking into skinners eyes ballantyne felt for the very first time the faint chill of something else in the man something very hard and formidable and perceived at last an inkling of what proud had meant he had never sought to learn in detail the circumstances which had led up to hugh fultons resignation although he knew that something had caused bad blood between him and skinner now he realised with certainly that fulton had been mortally afraid of his successor suddenly and irrationally ballantyne was glad that he did not know why he forced himself to consider the choice he had to make the choice which skinner had set out for him there could be only one decision the show goes on warn the directors of the various festivals if you consider it necessary but no one else keep this thing under wraps for as long as you can issue a further statement through your press office saying that you are still looking into the causes of the explosion but at the moment it looks like a gas leak of some sort pick your team and use whatever time the news blackout buys you as best you can maybe well get lucky skinner nodded very good minister he said formal for the first time thats how it will be now ill tell you just how objective my advice was if this lot are going to start blowing up the festival as they threaten then that makes my daughter a target shes performing in a play on the fringe it could have been her lying in that tent today and when i find these characters ill go just as hard as if it had been her meanwhile im on the spot do i tell alex to pull out without telling her why or do i cfollow your orders to the letter and keep my mouth shut letting her run the same risk as the rest for gods sake bob of course you must get her out of it thanks alan but that has to be my choice to make it wont be an easy one there are so many what ifs the best answer is just to catch these bastards before this thing gets any bigger im off to do that now he picked up the letter and its envelope and made for the door but stopped just before he reached it oh alan heres a piece of nonpolice advice you could find photographers hanging around here today if carlie might be a problem in some newspaper picture best not let that happen eh thanks bob point taken skinner was deep in thought as he slid the bmw into st coime street on impulse he indicated to the left and drove up the cobbled slope of glenfinlas street turning left at the top into charlotte square as usual all of the parking bays in the square were occupied scores of cars and not a few camper vans bearing german french and belgian registration plates were nosed in on the angle facing the gardens in the centre their tails pointing back towards the oneway traffic as it circulated clockwise the space on the outer side of the wide street normally kept clear by yellow lines was mostly full the vigilance of edinburghs redoubtable traffic wardens being relaxed on saturday afternoons however there was a vacant slot only a few yards from glenfinlas street just outside the head office of one of scotlands largest public companies skinner reversed the bmw in switched off the engine and sat looking thoughtfully at the pavement across the street from the secretary of states front door with its fund managers its surveyors and its few remaining lawyers on the golf course rather than at work in their offices charlotte square was usually one of the quietest spots in central edinburgh on saturday afternoons occasionally special weekend events were held in its gardens on the grass among the trees around the oxidised bronze equestrian statuary on its marble plinth two years before an age ago to skinner this green space had been covered with marquees serving as the venue of the biennial edinburgh book festival but for this year at least the festival was being staged in different surroundings in the citys newly opened international conference centre now as skinner looked across the expanse of grass he saw only a few recumbent sunbathers enjoying the warmth of the august day he scanned the pavement opposite number its surface was m raised above the level of roadway by four cobbled steps and so he could observe the pedestrians clearly he saw two elderly grey haired ladies wearing shapeless hats and coats even in flaming august their backs to him walking slowly in step with the same rolling gait afternoon tea in the roxburghe ill bet he murmured to himself smiling at this enduring tradition among the aged welltodo of edinburgh as skinner watched them the two old ladies drew alongside and passed a bulky bearded figure who was leaning against the railings idly adjusting the camera which hung on a strap round his neck denis he said aloud recognising one of the citys bestknown news photographers he was on the point of climbing out of his car to talk to the man when suddenly his eye was caught by a motorcyclist astride his vehicle in one of the parking bays on the corner a tall figure in black leathers with a metallic blue crash helmet he wore the livery of one of edinburghs many motorcycle delivery companies thats odd thought skinner why the hell was a bike courier at work on a saturday and if he was supposed to be working why the hell was he sitting on his arse in charlotte square doing bugger all deciding to postpone his chat with denis the photographer he settled back into the drivers seat of the bmw keeping as inconspicuous as any good detective should be the leather gear made it difficult to judge the mans age but skinner knew that most of edinburghs delivery riders were in their early twenties and his build and bearing seemed to bear this out the courier held a folded newspaper in his left hand and gave the appearance of studying it intently but skinner noticed that every so often he would glance along the street looking in the same direction as denis the photographer towards the secretary of states front door what the devil is he up to skinner thought was he a tipoff man for the sunday mail maybe looking for action around number as he gazed at the man intrigued his view was obscured for a moment by a black rover sterling with a familiar figure in the back seat the car drew to a halt outside number and lord peters minister of state for scotland and as such ballantynes deputy heaved his girth on to the pavement he tapped the car on the bonnet in dismissal and made towards the big brown door tugging a key from his pocket as he walked skinner looked across towards denis who was snapping off frame after frame of the ministers arrival then glanced across at the motorcyclist the man had dropped his newspaper and now was holding a mobile telephone there was a brief scene of pantomime as he put the earpiece up to his crashhelmet then set the instrument down on the saddle of the bike and began to fiddle with his chinstrap lets check this boy out skinner muttered to himself he jumped from the car and began to trot across the street hey just a minutehe shouted as he ran the rider gave up his battle with the chinstrap and reached inside his jacket with his ungloved right hand later it would strike skinner as remarkable that he had not registered surprise when he saw the gun but at that moment all that concerned him was reaching the nearest cover it was a small weapon possibly a beretta the man swung towards him his left hand coming up to join the other in a marksmans grip by that time skinners trot had accelerated into a sprint he reached the other side of the street which was mercifully free of traffic and threw himself fulllength between a couple of parked cars he was still in middive when he heard the two shots and the zinging sound of the ricochets as the bullets flew off the tarmac behind him lying facedown aware of the pounding of his heart he tried to work out his next move but in the very moment that he realised that he did not have one he heard the motorcycle roar into life skinner pulled himself into a crouch behind the car which was his shield tyres squealed as the rider swung out of his parking bay against the traffic flow barely missing a red peugeot which was cornering at speed skinner stood up in time to see the silvergrey bike racing off down glenfinlas street but a second too late to read its registration number bob the shout came from behind him skinner turned and saw denis the photographer lumbering towards him what the hell happened there were those gunshots are you all right the big man was out of breath by the time he reached skinner no panic denis its okay theres no harm done what did you see anyway nothing much i just sort of heard the noise and caught a flash of you ducking between those two motors only i didnt realise it was you till you stood up who was the guy on the bike ill be looking twice at apache couriers next time they turn up on one of my jobs ill tell you skinner thought fast courier my arse that was a boy weve had under surveillance as a suspected drugdealer he put a hand on deniss shoulder and said conspiratorially but listen old mate you saw nothing understand all that you heard was the bike backfiring the fact is my imagination got the better of me and i got the wrong idea and jumped for it now for gods sake not a cheep about that in your bloody rag or ill be the laughingstock of edinburgh denis looked sceptical but nodded well if you say so bob if you say so but its a bloody queer backfire that can put a hole through a window thirty yards away he pointed across the street to number skinners eye followed his finger in the top righthand pane of one of its groundfloor windows there was a neat round hole cracks fanning out from it like rays from a tiny dark sun honest to christ denis see vandals these days nothings sacred any more a guileless look crept across his face what brings you here today anyway denis looked embarrassed you shouldnt ask me that bob secrets of the trade and all that the truth is as usual i dont know us photographers in our army were just the bloody infantry im told to get along here and get some pies of ballantyne and of anyone else that arrives here so thats what im doing but im not told why same old bloody story every other photographers at bloody tynecastle covering the football and im stuck here watching a fucking door skinner sighed out loud in mock sympathy silencing the rising tirade ah well big fella sometimes theres no justice at all sounds like a right boring afternoon but good luck to you me im doing something really exciting im off to take the wife to asda he raised a hand in farewell and strolled across the road towards his car thatll be bloody right muttered denis towards his disappearing back as was usual at weekends a heavy gate barred entry to the sloping driveway which rises up to the main entrance to edinburghs police headquarters building denied access to his parking space skinner drove on out of fettes avenue and used the side entrance in carrington road the civilian security guard manning the entrance barriers recognised him but nonetheless inspected his photographic warrant card carefully knowing that the acc would have roasted him had he done any less skinner entered the building at basement level in the rear and made his way up four flights of stairs to andy martins office on the same level as his own in the command suite but in the main fourstorey section the detective chief inspectors room opened off the main area of the special branch office in the outer room skinner recognised detective constables neil mcllhenney a special branch regular and barry macgregor borrowed he guessed from weekend duty with the crime squad to help with the callround of the media afternoon gentlemen had a busy time not as busy as you by the looks of it sir said the normally phlegmatic mcllhenney pointing towards skinners lower half been playing football wi the lads skinner looked down and noticed for the first time the split across the right leg of his denims just above the knee hah not quite football neil but a bit of fancy diving all the same mr martin in sir mcllhenney nodded in confirmation and skinner walked on up to martins door rapped on it and pushed it open without waiting for a response the special branch commander was seated behind his desk his shoulders hunched and the telephone pressed to his right ear he glanced up at skinner his eyes taking in the torn jeans and registering surprise he pointed awkwardly and unnecessarily towards the phone with his left hand then towards a filter coffee maker on a table beneath the rooms only window sorry sir but my boss just came in and i missed that he paused listening to the voice on the line i appreciate your point but you have to understand our situation too our information is that todays explosion was quite possibly accidental if this hoax letter appears anywhere it could cause quite unnecessary public alarm not to mention its effect on such a popular international event every other news organisation in the uk has already agreed to a blackout of that letter youll lose nothing by cooperating skinner was listening intently now who is this he mouthed silently to martin hold on one second please sir the chief inspector said to the telephone i have to speak to my chief he pressed the privacy button its an american guy sir hes chief editor or some such title of television news international that satellite channel that we always hear about on other peoples news bulletins i called his bureau chief in london about the blackout he told me he had to refer upwards and this is the result the blokes mouthing on about global responsibility sounds like hes after a world scoop and since his channels on in every newsroom in this country if he runs the letter weve got trouble emergency powers or not everyone else is playing ball but if this arsehole publishes it they all will skinners eyes glinted a dangerous smile hung around the corners of his mouth he held out his right hand towards martin gimme whats his name albert neidenneyer skinner took the receiver from martin earpiece first mr neidermeyer my name is bob skinner i am in charge of this investigation and the request made by mr martin comes directly from me as youve just been told we dont want to start a major public fuss over a letter which could well have been sent in by a crank every other news outlet in the country has agreed not to publish that letter for the time being so id be grateful if you would instruct your man in london to go along with neidermeyer cut in listen mister im in charge of the worlds biggest news organisation we didnt get that way by dropping our pants every time some guy like you comes by we have viewers everywhere and we dont keep news from them on the sayso of just any copper what did you say your name was skinner assistant chief constable skinner edinburgh cid skinner across the atlantic there was a pause say werent you the guy who this time skinner cut in yes i probably was look me up if your information library is any good ill be there while youre doing that let me tell you what ill be doing at this end ill be making one telephone call about two minutes later youll find that every one of your satellite transponders has been shut down for repair the more fuss you make the longer that repair will take im not just talking about europe im talking home base too im talking everywhere bull shit try me you want to find out whats possible then force me to make that phone call i dont care how big a fish you are in your own pond if you want still to be swimming there tomorrow youll do what we request if the situation changes well let you know for now please be sensible and cooperate with us for a few seconds there was silence then neidermeyer gave a loud sigh ok skinner experience tells me that if anybody makes a threat that heavy then he can probably make it good so ill do what you ask but pal youd better be right every step of the way otherwise youll have the full resources of the worlds biggest news organisation after your ass skinner gave a strange cold smile thank you mr neidermeyer for showing such good sense ill bear your promise in mind but just be sure that you dont forget mine he put the telephone back in its cradle there andy like my old mother used to say a problem shared is a problem halved and in this case solved martin looked at him curiously i suppose you could have done that thing with the transponders skinner grinned back at him affably well maybe it wouldnt have been just as easy as that i might have had to make two phone calls he took several steps across to the window table and poured coffee into two mugs he added a little milk to his own and handed the other plain black to martin then he took the folded envelope enclosing the letter from the back pocket of his jeans and tossed it down on the desk thats what the fuss is about what dyou think martin extracted the letter and scanned it quickly where was this handed in st andrews house by motorbike courier about half an hour after the bang well i suppose this could be from some idiot who saw the fuss over the explosion in the centre of town and decided to take the piss out of the polis but hed need to have moved very fast from the look of this too hed also have needed access to a computer and a bubblelet printer mind you that doesnt mean much these days given the size of some of the kit around what about the courier i havent checked that yet but i think that when we ask the security men at st andrews house well find he was wearing an apache couriers vest and when we check apache couriers and we will well find that they had no one working today but also that either one of their new recruits has gone missing or one of their vests has been nicked what makes you think all that then boss martin asked warily quickly skinner described the incident in charlotte square ripped my new levis too ill take it out of the bastards hide when i catch him see if i dont not of course that theres a cats chance that we will catch him nonetheless well put a call out for a tall guy with a metallic blue brainbucket riding a silver grey bike you never know anyway that wee encounter removed my last doubt that this letter could be just kidology our man was on lookout duty reporting all arrivals at number to someone else our anonymous correspondent no doubt weve got to assume that they were watching the back door as well and theyll have seen me come and go they probably wanted to see how ballantyne would react to the letter by now since theyve heard nothing on the radio theyll be finding that out i wonder what their next move will be he winced painful for someone i have no doubt he pulled up a chair and sat down facing martin across the desk what weve got to do now is put a unit in place to deal with these characters ballantynes given me all the power and authority i need for now at any rate martin raised his eyebrows you worried about him hes a politician andy i always worry about them their judgement gets clouded by the ballot box then depending on what son they are they either shit themselves or overreact and our secretary of states just one man on the ladder there are others with more clout than him but in any event the balls in our court so lets run with it and set up our antiterrorist unit i want a team briefing in this office at then i want to meet all of the festival directors in a hotel somewhere in the city centre you set that up will you make it for five oclock thats short notice boss the fuckers who planted that bomb didnt give us any notice at all said skinner tersely he sat silent in thought for a few seconds then went on our team has to be tight i want people i know and can trust not too many of them but enough theyve all got to be able to take sector responsibility if they need to for running a part of what will be in total a very big security operation naturally andy youre my secondincommand as my personal assistant brian mackie has to be in too and ill have maggie rose and mario mcguire theyve been over the course with us already theyre both tough and we know for sure they dont get rattled i thought you wanted them kept apart because theyre going together offduty ive had second thoughts on that but youll figure out why in a minute ill call their divisional commanders and put them on temporary secondment then theres those two outside neil and barry theyre in the know already and theyre good guys so well have them too you tell jimmy hodgson the crime squad gaffer that id like to borrow the boy macgregor until further notice do it nicely mind you hes his own boss in this place i need someone through in the west too although these lunatics say that its the festival thats under threat you never know when this could turn into a crossborder affair wholl you want over there asked martin willie haggerty who else haggerty what about mckinstery hes special branch in strathclyde not any more he isnt hes out and haggertys in martins eyebrows shot up skinner smiled at the surprise written on his face you special branch guys arent allowed to get together as a group in case you form your own secret police force so theres some excuse for you not to have noticed the changes that have been made lately what dyou mean i mean that you are now the only surviving special branch head who was in post during hughie fultons time since i took over the commander in every other force has been posted elsewhere its happened in stages but its happened mckinstery was the last to be moved youve done all that martins voice rose in surprise lets say that ive persuaded all their chief constables that it was a good idea but why remember when we had that carryon last winter and big fulton seemed to know everything that we did martin nodded at the time you and i pinned some of the blame for that on roy thornton up at the court as it happens we were right but only up to a point for there was a hell of a lot he didnt know that fulton still found out i wondered at the time who the big bastards touts were and itdidnt take me long to find out once i took over his job all your opposite numbers in special branch were feeding him stuff that even their own bosses my equivalents didnt know in short they were all in his pocket alee smith your predecessor was at it as well when sarah and i started seeing each other he reported it to fulton and big hughie had her vetted how did you find that out the stupid bastard kept a file on me as soon as he quit the locks on his office door were changed and so he didnt get the chance to destroy the file before he left hes in ibiza now retired be just as well for him if he stays there why didnt he approach me when i took over take that as a compliment he must have decided that you were incorruptible as far as i was concerned i guess that alee smith told him that actually alee did make one brief attempt to talk me into giving his job to someone else but he changed horses when he saw my mind was made up and he backed you instead who was the someone else if i told you it might prejudice your view of a perfectly good copper who is incidentally in the uniformed branch now skinner paused reflectively anyway all fultons boys are gone now theyre either back in uniform on promotion or theyre retired martin shook his head but i liked davie mackinstery alee too for that matter no need to stop loving them andy the fact that they were fultons touts didnt make them bad people he set the rules and got away with it thanks to his reputation and his power i dont condemn anyone for not crossing him still when i took over i decided that i could never trust anybody who had previously reported to fulton on that basis hence the complete and total clearout skinners tone grew heavy one thing stays the same all the new guys talk to me regularly the big difference is that none of them keeps secrets from or spies on his bosses in his home force its an open system now as far as it can be in our game martin stared at the surface of his desk his brow furrowed christ boss i knew you had clout but to clear the whole of special branch forget it andy its history and only the chief constables know that its happened so for this emergency itll be haggerty in the west bill finlay in aberdeen and peter buxton in dundee as and when we need them he stood up and walked over to the window there are two other people im going to include on our team ones a counter terrorist specialist from the sas i guy i met when i was away at that seminar in yorkshire last month his name is arrow captain adam arrow and hes got years in ireland and other places under his belt he paused martin looked up at him not another one of those guys bob please skinner smiled softly no son therell never be another of them anywhere not while im around at least arrows a good guy his speciality is counterterrorism ira uvf it doesnt matter to him he loathes them all hes put a few active service men into early retirement one way or another just recently he was involved in sorting out something particularly nasty that the loyalists were planning arrow knows something of what happened last winter but not everything andy martin looked at skinner and held his eyes an awkward silence hung in the room until martin broke it bob im your closest colleague and youve never told even me the whole story of that night youve changed since then you know i tell you this as a friend that ive noticed a side to you that wasnt there before just now and again its as if youre somewhere else in a very scary place maybe only people who really know you can see it skinner had his back to martin as he replied it was perhaps as well that the younger man could not see the expression in his grey eyes andy i try not to let any of my thoughts show on the outside but that was something of a night then suddenly skinner laughed out loud and ive got a fucking great bullet hole in my leg to remind me the tension broken skinner quickly changed the subject now the last member of the team i want to include sarah what dyou think can i have my own wife on my team martin looked thoughtful for a second then looked up and nodded yes boss im all for it she knows how you think and shes got her masters in criminal psychology too if she can help you shes helping us all and since shes still a parttime police surgeon technically shes an insider as well right andy said skinner emphatically thats our team picked now lets get it on the park the games started and the other sides a goal up already from the privacy of his own office in the command suite skinner made six quick fire telephone calls the first two were to the divisional detective superintendents at the torphichen street and st leonards police stations who were respectively the line officers maggie rose and mario mcguire he told them that each would be losing his best sergeant for an indefinite period he expected no questions or protests and received none the third call went to a private number the phone was answered on the second ring and a familiar deep voice sounded on the line mcguire hi mario acc here are you alone or is anyone i know there with you well as it happens sir ds rose is watching a video in the livingroom me im in the kitchen as usual in that case sergeant ive got good news for you and bad news for maggie you heard about this mornings bang in princes street mcguire grunted assent well im setting up a unit to coordinate the search for the cowboys who did it i want my best on it so you two are in get yourselves down to fettes right away and meet me in the sb suite next he dialled the mobile number of detective inspector brian mackie his personal assistant as mackie answered skinner could hear the din of a crowd where are you brian tynecastle sir kicked off five minutes ago the jam tarts are one down already so am i give the rest a miss and get into the office for his fifth call skinner switched to a green scrambled telephone on his desk seconds later he was connected to an mi duty officer he identified himself and asked the woman to call him back in confirmation when she did so he asked her to do everything necessary to have captain adam arrow report to him personally at police headquarters in edinburgh by am the next morning finally he called his own home number in edinburgh sarah and he had just moved into a bungalow off queensferry street even closer to fettes avenue than the flat in stockbridge from which they had recently moved he assumed that sarah herself would answer his call but he was wrong this is alex skinner speaking he smiled at the unexpected sound of his daughters voice hi kid i thought you were rehearsing up to the last minute no pops our director decided that we could only get worse so he gave us the afternoon off to rest up curtain goes up at sharp will you be able to get to it with all this bomb stuff and everything sarah told me about it in fact will you get home at all this evening pops theres someone here id like you to meet my new leading man you might say dont think so better postpone the introduction but unless something else happens i will make it tonight so you be good and if you cant be good just be sensational now put your stepmother on okay i think shes in the shower no i lie just a sec sarah its your old man moments later he heard sarahs soft new york drawl hello honey where are you at hq did you get everything cleaned up at your end eventually no other serious casualties that poor girl looked in worse shape than actually she was a bad scalp cut lots of blood most of it ended up on me god was i a mess ive just done washing it off next ill have to wash the showercurtain it looks like that scene from psycho when will you be home not for a bit yet but thats not why ive called look i want you up here now im putting a team together and i want you on it i need somebody with your sort of expertise so why not you well she tried but failed to sound matteroffact see you in twenty minutes detective inspector brian mackie had found that getting out of a football ground just after kickoff can be more difficult than gaming entry having been forced earlier to park his car a mile from tynecastle stadium he found himself the last to join the team in the special branch suite as he arrived apologetically the clock on the wall was just approaching pm nevertheless skinner greeted him with a smile hello brian we were beginning to think youd hung on there for the pies and the bovril hearts were up at halftime in case you hadnt heard i always had faith in them boss god knows why ok grab a seat and lets get on with it skinner walked over to a pinboard fixed to the wall most of you will know each other i think but maggie mario have you met barry macgregor here the two sergeants nodded towards the detective constable who at twentyfour was the youngest of the group by several years maggie rose gave him a friendly smile mind you even if you hadnt met him youd have marked him out nae bother as crime squad just by the hairdo macgregors mousyblond hair was shoulderlength it was pulled back into a ponytail and some of it was braided and ringed with white beads the young man grinned shaking his head vigorously from side to side to make the beads rattle all of you know dr sarah grace from various crime scenes and elsewhere be in no doubt that although shes my wife sarahs here now as dr grace police surgeon criminal psychologist and fully fledged member of the team if she slips up shell get bollocked just like any of the rest of you for me he said with a sudden broad grin the downside is that if i slip up myself shell let me know in her own special way then the smile left skinners face thats the last laugh youll get from me for a while weve been brought together here and its a reunion for all of us but you barry by a very nasty incident which took place this morning for those of you whove only heard the news reports ill tell you now what were dealing with as far as we know an explosion took place in a hospitality marquee on top of waverley market at around midday today it could be that it was meant to go off at noon exactly there was one fatality an unfortunate lad named danny baker who was too close to the seat of the blast to have stood a chance his nextofkin have been told apart from the boy baker there were no serious casualties although around twenty people wound up in the royal with shock or minor injuries ive just told the press office to issue a statement that we are investigating the possibility that the explosion was caused by a faulty gas bottle he paused for a moment this may shock you good people but that is an outandout lie gammy legge the bomb expert has just confirmed that it was caused by approximately one pound of semtex he believes that the explosive was hidden in a metal toolbox on account of some bits of scorched shrapnel dug out of the poor lad baker and three other casualties that fact makes it very clear that we must take very seriously the contents of this letter which was delivered to the secretary of state at st andrews house shortly after the explosion he went from person to person handing each a photocopied sheet read it note the details then each of you make sure you shred your copy before you leave this room no copies other than mine must be taken out of this building the original is currently at the forensics lab although the lads there will take until this time tomorrow to prove it i am quite certain that it and the envelope in which it was delivered will yield no fingerprints other than those of a couple of security guards the secretary of state dci martin and me they will also tell us that it was originated on a wordprocessor using a common software package wordperfect or some such and printed on a laser or bubblejet job with no distinguishing features in other words the sort of kit that thousands of punters buy across the counter at dixons every year however i could be wrong you never know the scientists might find a set of dabs thatll let us wrap this business up by tomorrow night if that happens i will personally treat you all to a fine steak dinner but dont set your taste buds going in anticipation mr martin has made sure that neither the existence nor the content of that letter will be mentioned in the press radio or television for the meantime at least that will piss off our friends no end but i dont expect any further action from them within the next twentyfour hours mackie raised a hand you said our friends sir couldnt it be just one bloke couldnt this letter be a con it could be but it isnt first itd be a very resourceful individual who could lay hands on a pound of semtex unaided second at least one person and maybe two had the secretary of states residence under observation after that letter was delivered reporting on arrivals and departures to someone on the other end of a mobile telephone this is clearly a terrorist group and to my mind a very determined one martin at the back of the group opened his mouth as if to speak then closed it tight as skinner froze him with a warning look only sarah noticed this silent exchange skinner continued with barely a pause because of that i want every one of you except dr grace of course to be armed at all times during this investigation youll have sb arms and ammo issued under mr martins authority you wont need to hand them in at the end of each shift each of you draw them from brian mackie at the end of this briefing martin had already taken his own gun under skinners authorising signature he carried it slung in a shoulderholster inside his baggy leather jacket skinner had not drawn a weapon for reasons which he had kept to himself i hardly need to say that this is only a precautionary measure i dont want any cowboys and indians out on our streets but in the unlikely event and all that i want you able to respond in any way you need to whether they meant it this time or not these characters have shown that theyre prepared to kill that means you have to be ready to drop them if it comes to it anyone got a problem with that he glanced in the direction of barry macgregor the young man understood the reason unsmiling this time he shook his head so slightly that his beads made not a sound ok we may not expect further immediate action but we have things to do now weve had a direct threat to the whole festival and we have to privately warn all the personnel involved theres no way that we can cover all the venues mr martins been pulling some figures together they should give you an idea of the scale of our task andy the detective chief inspector powerfully built and blond haired took skinners place at the front of the room his green eyes were made even more vivid by his tinted contact lenses as he fixed a piercing gaze on each member of the team in turn those of you who aint culture vultures and i have to admit im not myself will probably be surprised by just how big this festival is i should really say festivals because this year there are six different ones all running at the same time the festival proper thats the official job the one the city backs its relatively small over the next three weeks starting tonight it will put on about one hundred and fifty events concerts opera coots football sorry ballet and plays in more than a dozen different venues on the other hand the festival fringe despite its name is the biggest event of the lot this year itll put on several thousand individual performances of all shapes and sizes in over a hundred venues they range from church halls to circus tents and theyre all over edinburgh two of them are even staged out of town in musselburgh then weve got the film festival very prestigious not cannes or anything like it but it still attracts some highquality film premieres and some big names that whatshername the one with the big voicebox you know who i mean neil shes due in for it next week and shell have to be looked after put your hand down macgregor sergeant rose will draw that job the film festival takes place mostly in the filmhouse and in that other cinema up tollcross this year there are about a hundred screenings and five will involve personal appearances by directors and stars the best thing about the film festival is that it only lasts for a couple of weeks not the full three the jazz festival has an even shorter run nine days to be exact its been scaled down a bit over the last couple of years but it still puts on eighty shows or is that gigs in nine halls the jazz festival so a friend tells me tends to attract fewer tourists than the rest its for real aficionados and its the big week of the year for all the local jazzers there is also a strong correlation between the jazz festival and the consumption of strong ales and lagers which wont make our security job any easier the book festival is different entirely it only happens every other year and its an exhibition as much as anything this year theyve stuck ii in the new conference centre in lothian road that makes it easy for us cause theres all sorts of security built in there as well as all that lot we also have a television festival that only lasts for a few days and its more of a talking shop really but it still pulls in some very high rollers scottish television puts a lot of money and effort into it and all the big uk names from the bbc the commercial network and now from satellite turn up theres an international contingent too guess whos coming this year boss your mate al neidermeyer of television news international the rest of the team looked puzzled skinner laughed if we should happen to meet andy im sure the pleasurell be all his martin grinned and continued when id tallied that lot up i thought that all we needed to make up the set was an international gathering of arms dealers then i realised that in a sense we have because on top of it all although it isnt part of any festival theres the biggest event of them all the military tattoo three weeks of nighttime performances on the castle esplanade six thousand seats for every performance and every one of them sold in advance taking it all together the festival involves thousands of live performances at a couple of hundred different venues no one knows for sure how many people will be taking part but itll be in the tens of thousands for sure as for spectators working it out on a bumsonseats basis its reckoned to be around a million barry macgregor let out a soft whistle remember martin went on these are the performance events i havent mentioned the various sorts of art exhibition thatll be running there are about a dozen regular galleries in edinburgh and quite a few other places are pressed into service so thats whats happening in our city over the next three weeks and weve just had a threat to it of a lethal nature the idea of calling it all off is a nonstarter the government cant be seen to give in to terrorism and neither for that matter can the police service and anyway its too late so our job is to protect it the whole event as best we can and the best way to do that is to catch the people behind the threat on that front as the boss has said there are no leads so far on the security side i have only two bits of good news the first is that we can forget the exhibitions during the day at least and also the book festival all of those have highcalibre private guards as a condition of their insurance cover theres a very big exhibition in the national gallery rembrandts greatest hits or something well give that special attention at night the second bonus is that we can forget the tattoo its a military event and the military will look after it but the rest is up to us boss thanks andy skinner took the floor again right first ill state the obvious that which youre all thinking we dont have anything like enough polismen and women to give proper protection to all those venues and in any event the game plan is to keep this whole business from becoming public knowledge for the moment at least but within these four secure walls ill tell you frankly that i dont think weve a snowballs chance of doing that for too long if this lot are as determined and resourceful as i think they are theyll soon find a way to force us to go public on their threatening letter in the meantime heavy police presence at all the festival events even if it were possible would be counter productive as it could only alarm and annoy the public no what we must do is plan on the assumption that any future incidents will involve highprofile targets therefore were going to concentrate on the biggest venues the news blackout on that letter will buy us maybe a day or two so lets put that time to good use in an hour from now mr martin and i are meeting allot the festival directors save one in the george hotel were going to tell them whats happening and what were doing about it then were going to swear them to secrecy for as long as we say so i am operating and therefore so are you lot on my team with the benefit of certain extra powers afforded me by the secretary of state if anybody plays silly buggers with us we can as a very last resort bang them inside weve only had one problem so far with the guy neidermeyer from tni that mr martin just mentioned all our own people are toeing the line and so will the festival directors the reason im going to brief them is because youll need their cooperation i want you lot starting this evening to recce all the major venues and then check in here tomorrow morning with reports on how each one can be protected effectively with the minimum visible strength im not using uniforms if i can help it if this crowd do start taking pot shots at festival events then our boys and girls would be sitting targets in their blue suits and funny hats brian i want you to give everyone here a list of the venues cover all the official festival venues thats the usher hall lyceum kings empire and playhouse at least cover filmhouse and the telly festival venue too cover all multiple centres where theyve got more than one theatre thats places like the assembly rooms and the pleasance oh and cover the traverse remember thats part of saltire court and our friends may decide that a building named after our scottish national flag would make a prime target i want your reports to include details of all entrances and exits at each place by that i mean public performers and vehicle entrances produce for each hall and theatre a security plan if you think we need to shut a few entrances and slow the normal flow in and out dont be afraid to make that recommendation as long as we can empty a place in a hurry if we need to it doesnt matter to me how long it takes to fill it bear in mind too that by tuesday at the latest all performers and stagehands will have passes and will need to show them on their way into the building sarah spoke for the first time skinner sensed her striving to appear as formal with him as she could to stake out no special position within the team wont that involve thousands of people and will the photobooth machines be able to cope he nodded sure well have to issue thousands of passes but im going to second the scottish office information staff to do the processing and the passes wont be photographic theyll be creditcard style with a signature on the back well make every applicant sign their pass in the presence of the issuing officer and then well make them sign in and out of their venue every day but come on doctor tell me whats the real reason for the passes sarah felt as if everyone in the room was watching her a frownline appeared suddenly above her nose emphasising her concentration on his question then just as suddenly her face lit up its all about the application forms you want every performer or stagehand to fill in an application form skinner was pleased at her perception but kept it to himself right they fill in the application form then mr plod feeds the details into his great big computer and if his great big computer is any bloody good at all out pop all the nasty secrets unless we turn up a very nasty secret indeed something like a convicted paedophile giving a oneman show for kids in the back of a transit we do nothing precipitate but we keep a very close watch on all the oddbods to see where we get led skinner switched his gaze to macgregor what else do we do barry the young detective beamed with pleasure hotels sir everyone checking into a hotel is asked to fill up a registration form we just expand them a bit if necessary then every day we collect copies of all the completed forms and stick them through the computer as well thats the game son and what do we get out of all that probably sweet fa but we do it anyway and just like with all the other routine precautions were taking we hope that gods lucks on our side he paused to look around the room fixing his eyes on each member of the team in turn when he spoke again it was in a gentler tone ok my good people go out there and do your very best and as usual thatll be good enough for me but as you do it keep this thought in your minds i saw that poor boy today i know in my heart that this one will get even nastier than today before it gets better weve got other peoples lives in our hands here lets not let them slip while youre at it look out for yourselves too i love you all as friends as well as colleagues and i dont want any mishaps go to it this is a noleave job so ill see you all tomorrow morning andy said skinner and nodded for martin to follow as he headed for the door they left the room sarah following on their heels and waving goodbye to the rest of the team as she closed the door behind her bob paused in the corridor and turned towards her sorry love andy and i have a few things to do no need for you to hang around here any longer what you could do for me when you get home though is look at your copy of their letter which i see you did not shred before you left the room uhoh my first blooper sarah turned a shade of pink and hopefully your last still lets put it to advantage read it carefully study the language the style anything in particular that strikes you and see if you can come up with some sort of a psychological profile of the author yes boss and once youve done that burn it she nodded yes sir will do see you later we will get to alexs play wont we no problem ill rest easier if ive taken a bloody good look at that venue myself anyway ill be home for latest we can eat after the show so book us a table somewhere eh he started off towards martin who stood waiting at the end of the corridor but she held him back with a gentle tug at his sleeve bob in there earlier on i had the impression that andy was going to say something important but you shut him up was it something that you didnt want the whole team to hear or just me he looked at her wideeyed dont know what youre on about love when did i ever chop andy off in public and before you lower ranks too the unmasked doubt in her expression countered the wideeyed innocence in his skinner you are being evasive we h discuss this later her tone left no room for doubt at nothing to discuss but ill see you he strode off to join martin as soon as they were out of sight the big acc cuffed the head of special branch lightly around the ear dropped me in it there mate havent you dont tell me you werent on the point of chipping into my briefing with a homily about guntoting motorcycle messengers in charlotte square christ if i hadnt been looking at you at the time there are things you need to break to the wife in private if you choose to break them at all now ive got no choice martin wore a guilty look that was rarely seen sorry boss i just didnt think skinner considered his point made its ok son i chose to bring sarah into the team so its half my fault for putting you in the situation anyway theres another side to it though and a good reason not to tell the team about my wee bit of excitation these apache couriers are all over town id hate to think of what might happen if next week one of them even looked sideways at one of our team while reaching into his jacket bang bang dead courier oh you were only getting a hankie out were you sorry about that just a wee mistake no thank you very much not even proud jimmy would see the funny side of that one they had reached skinners office in the command suite come on in andy and ill let you halfway in on a state secret i told you ive already accessed available files on the mi computer from my other office and come up blank martin nodded well not all the stuffs on computer with all these hackers and folk like that and viruses and so on the plain fact is that information technology doesnt have the security you need at the very top level or at the bottom level depending on how you see these things there are files still kept on paper in london behind a very thick door with a very long combination and a very loud alarm im going to use my secure phone to brief the mis analysts to look at them all and prepare me a list of people to be considered it probably wont be a long list but ill bet theyll ave some entries for us this will all be stuff i probably havent n myself ill have picked up bits of it now and then just wee scraps of information but the total picture is gathered together by ion teams in head office he sat down in a chair at the side of his desk and pulled his scrambled telephone to him while i do this andy could you access your sb stuff through my terminal and run another list for me journalists anyone youve got on file either here or in branches in the rest of the country look at their special interests and their known associates i fancy well want to talk to one or two of them too when the moment comes that not a bit of a risk leaning on journalists asked martin who said anything about leaning on them well just say were consulting them itll make them feel important the hack is not yet born who is so hairybacked and antiestablishment that he doesnt want the polis owing him a favour you do that while i make this call then well get off to the george to scare the shit out of the festival directors the george is not the most imposing of edinburghs firstdivision hotels but it is one of the best it is situated on the street from which it takes its name and its narrow entrance affords clients a greater degree of privacy than its massive rivals at either end of princes street it is possible to slip virtually unobserved into the george while entry through the wide doors of the caledonian or the balmoral past their liveried and effusive keepers is always something of a performance skinner and martin arrived at the hotel in the bmw just after pm finding a parking place with unusual ease as the saturday shopping crush had eased off martin who enjoyed special relationships with every hotel manager in the city centre had asked for a private room for their meeting he carried a briefcase as they walked into the hotel six of the seven festival directors were waiting for them only trevor golley of the book festival had been unavailable none of the six had been told in advance that the others would be present as the two policemen entered the room the low buzz of conversation stopped and half a dozen faces turned towards them skinner broke the ice good afternoon ladies and gentlemen i must thank you for coming along here at such short notice and in response to such a mysterious invitation we appreciate how busy you must be just now so we wont keep you long three large thermos jugs lay on three occasional tables in the centre of the room everyone all right for coffee before we begin an assortment of grunts and nods came from around the room right if youll each find a seat ill explain what all this is about the long room had no windows it was furnished with three deep and comfortable twoseater sofas and two armchairs the policemen each took a chair leaving the sofas for their guests as the directors sat down skinner saw that they seemed to sort themselves unconsciously into natural pairings harriet nelson in her second year as director for the official festival sat on the lefthand sofa alongside colonel archie mcphee organiser of the military tattoo even seated harriet nelson was an imposing woman tall heavy featured and with a flaming red hair she had won her spurs in the arts in her late i twenties as one of the very few leading female orchestral conductors and had wielded her baton in concert halls around the world for almost two decades her appointment as director of the edinburgh international festival had been announced by the governing committee as a major coup which indeed it was colonel mcphee the military tattoo director was in his own way as imposing as his neighbour on the sofa before his retirement from active service five years earlier he had been a battalion commander in the parachute regiment and had seen bloody combat in the falklands he was in his early fifties with closecropped receding hair a sharp nose and piercing perceptive eyes he was dressed in light slacks and a shortsleeved green shin an outfit which emphasised an impression of total physical fitness the director of the film festival julia shahor sat directly facing skinner and martin next to the one person of the six whom skinner had not met before whom he knew therefore to be ray starkey head of the television event julia shahors shock of very black hair exploded in a natural afro framing a small pale but unforgettably attractive face she wore a voluminous white robe which covered her from neck to ankles she was a small woman the youngest of the six directors by at least seven or eight years skinner guessed she had come to the film festival ten months earlier on a oneyear contract and like harriet nelson she had been regarded as a catch for edinburgh she was still in her twenties but already she had built a brilliant career as a screenwriter it was said that her ambition was to emulate one of her predecessors by using the festival as the springboard for a career as a movie director in america ray starkey wore large yellowframed spectacles with lenses which made his eyes seem huge he was very fat and dressed incongruously in a pale blue armani suit with a grey shirt yellow braces and a tie which seemed to have been handpainted badly that same afternoon skinner knew that starkey had come to run the television event after having been a casualty of the commercial television licence auctions he had been programme controller with one of the losing franchiseholders and had waited in vain for a year for one of the winners to offer him a contract before being invited to take up the festival post finally seated together on the sofa to the right of the two policemen were david leroy the director of the fringe and jay hands his counterpart at the jazz festival the edinburgh festival fringe enjoys a reputation as one of the great showcases for newwave theatre and new performing talent many artists now worldfamous had made their first impressions upon public consciousness at edinburgh fringe productions david leroys appearance was completely at odds with the avant garde style of his festival while many of his performers found kaftans and sandals de rigueur the fringe director could have been taken for a successful bigfirm chartered accountant even on an august saturday he wore a blue austin reed suit black loake shoes a white shirt with a thin blue stripe and an edinburgh academy old boys tie however jay hands the longestserving of all the directors was much more in tune with the image of the grizzled jazzman even seated he seemed roundshouldered he was in his late fifties tall and lean with a sallow complexion and lank grey hair which looked two months overdue for a trim he had the tired eyes of a man who played with a jazz band several nights a week then stayed on after the show the six directors now sat in waiting some looking curious some nelson and hands in particular showing an edge of annoyance skinner smiled his wannest smile for those of you who havent met us im bob skinner assistant chief constable and head of cid in edinburgh its a matter of public knowledge that i also act as security adviser to the secretary of state my colleague here is detective chief inspector andrew martin head of special branch in edinburgh some of you may have guessed why weve asked you to meet us only two reacted in any way archie mcphee smiled tightly and nodded jay hands looked puzzled for those of you who dont already know we have had what we describe in policespeak as a serious incident specifically an explosion it happened at midday today at a festival hospitality venue in princes street in fact we now know that it was a bomb attack on the festival itself he paused opposite him julia shahors eyes seemed to grow impossibly wide jesus christ whispered jay hands skinner went on shortly after the bang we received this would you all read it please he handed his copy of the letter to harriet nelson she scanned it slowly then whitefaced handed it to archie mcphee by the time jay hands had finished studying the letter and handed it back to skinner all six directors looked considerably shaken before any of you ask me ill tell you that we are taking this letter at face value we believe that the people behind this atrocity are serious we dont know the first thing about them yet but we do know that anyone who can lay hands on a pound or two of semtex is unlikely to be a onehit wonder therefore ladies and gentlemen we have to believe that the festival events for which you are responsible are now all under threat more than that while i dont want to alarm you unnecessarily we have to assume for safetys sake that each of you could be a target he studied each face in turn the expressions ranged from the incredulity of ray starkey to the serenity of julia shahor as skinner had expected the first to speak was archie mcphee the colonels eyes seemed to gleam with memories of conflict as he asked softly what would you like us to do about it bob id like all six of you to cooperate with us but archie id like you to do a wee bit more than that the tattoo isnt run by the army but it is military in nature and it does take place at what is in fact an army base the castle id like you yourself to take on responsibility for extra security pull in soldiers from craigiehall if you have to you wont have any difficulty getting them i can promise you that at the moment im considering whether i need help from other quarters for the wider task is that okay with you certainly said mcphee emphatically thanks now everyone else the first thing to say is that we do not believe that we should nor do we even believe that we could call off any or all of your festivals in response to this threat and that isnt just a police view its a decision of the secretary of state so mr martin and i have two tasks first we have to take steps to protect all the festival events organisers performers and audiences as best we can then having done that we must make it all unnecessary by catching these terrorists and putting them away i have already set up a team to tackle both those jobs he described the instructions which he had issued earlier to his own team when my officers make their security checks theyll do so discreetly i dont want to cause any more public concern than is necessary at the moment that lettters between you us and some very cooperative newspaper editors weve secured a news blackout on it otherwise youd have heard about it before now i would ask you to assist my people in every way as they assess each of our priority venues if they need specific help or information please let them have it without question if any curious managers ask you what that was all about the party line is that it is routine procedure please stick to that skinner look around and smiled ok so far good thats what were doing about the buildings now for the people and this is where youre asked to give us the greatest help as part of the security operation we need to ensure that each participant can be identified and also that we know when theyre on site that means a pass system for everyone who is performing at every festival event front or back stage primadonna or callboy there was a collective cry of protest from five of the six directors only archie mcphee stayed relaxed sprawled comfortably back on his sofa the military tattoo had operated its own pass system since its inception you cant mean everyone said harriet nelson thats impossible said david leroy i do ms nelson and it isnt mr leroy he looked across at martin andy explain how well go about it martin waited until he was sure that he had the full attention of every one of the six he flashed a wide smile at julia shahor who responded with a small one of her own as mr skinner has said its important that we are able to check peoples identity and that we know precisely when theyre in their venues god forbid but we could have another incident like todays or an arson attack or even just a warning that we take seriously enough to act upon and if this threat becomes public knowledge we could have every drunk and nutter under the sun calling in hoaxes if anything like that were to happen wed have to clear the place in question totally and account for everyone supposedly there ticket stubs would tell us how many people are in the audience but we need a pass system for the performers agreed his last word was a statement rather that a question martin sat forward on his chair accidentally swinging his bolstered pistol into full sight his vivid green eyes were intense as they scanned the three sofas five heads nodded even colonel mcphee sat up straight good now let me tell you how well do it these passes neednt be photographic theyll be creditcard style and theyll be signed on the back by the holder in the presence of the issuing officer when theyre allocated well use experienced scottish office personnel to process the applications and issue passes on the spot theyll be based in your various offices so what wed like you to do as soon as you all get back to your offices is to organise a circular to every performing company thats here so far it should advise them that the fire safety officer has demanded that in the light of new regulations all performers and crew will have to carry passes and show them whenever they enter their venues heres a draft for you to work on he delved into his briefcase produced a handful of copy letters and handed them round this asks everyone involved to report to whichever festival office is appropriate between four and seven oclock tomorrow evening and to take with them some form of personal identification jay hands broke in what if they dont possess any we wont actually turn anyone down on those grounds but i think youll find that nowadays everybody carries something with their signature on it well put experienced people into your offices to do the job itll be painless i promise you no worse than the queue at the building society on the last friday of the month he grinned at the six directors julia shahor smiled back the rest reacted with an assortment of grunts and snorts of course you and all of your staff will require passes too even you colonel mcphee in case you need to go backstage at any other event the colonel acknowledged with the faintest nod of his head harriet nelson voiced again her earlier concern no exceptions at all martin shook his head ms nelson if the royal ballet had the ghosts of fonteyn and nureyev appearing in swan lake id want them to have passes there are no exemptions when it comes to security even the prime minister has to carry a pass for the house of commons he looked around the room once more your circulars should make it clear that as from monday anyone without a pass just doesnt get in so that this daily signingin routine isnt a burden with the larger companies well put our own plainclothes people in to look after it the smaller groups should be able to handle that end themselves martin picked up his briefcase again and lifted the lid as mr skinner said earlier we have to consider every foreseeable threat however remote it might seem for example these terrorists may decide that its easier to target individuals than venues youre all prominent people and we have to keep you safe if any of you want roundtheclock police protection just ask and youll have it in my view thats not necessary but just say the word anyone the room hung with tension but no one spoke ok but my offer stays open for what its worth i think a constant police presence would be a greater irritant for you than the risk justifies but there are some simple precautions which you should take all the same he reached into his case and produced two bundles of small volumes one bound in blue the other in russet brown he handed a copy of both to each of the directors these two wee books contain advice on security procedures the blue one relates to office security tells you how to look out for suspect parcels in the mail stuff like that the brown one deals with personal security tells you the bad habits to cut out like going to work every day at the same time by the same route it tells you how to search your car and what to do if you think youre being watched that last bits quite important if any of you do believe that youre being followed dont just try to scare the suspect off by shouting murder polis only do that if you feel youre in imminent danger what you should do is stay in a crowd if you can and try to find some unobtrusive way to let us know about your situation do you all have mobile telephones yes well youll find a telephone number written in the brown book shortcode that into your phones in a real emergency all youll need to do is punch in that one number and youll be straight through to my office remember we dont just want to frighten these people off we want to catch them and keep them for a hell of a long time he closed his briefcase snapped the locks shut and spun the combination wheels thats all i have to say sir skinner took his cue so thats the situation ladies and gentlemen im sorry youve been handed this extra worry but hate it as we may were all involved in this crisis if anybody has any questions well deal with them now and if anybody wants to ask us or tell us anything privately well deal with it here too julia shahors slim hand crept up tentatively like a child at school could i have a word with mr martin in private sure would the two of you like to step out into the corridor the policeman held open the door for the film festival director then closed it behind them outside she turned to face him her cheeks slightly flushed what can i do for you miss shahor julia please ok what can i do for you julia he looked into her eyes and had to stop himself from adding and if i can i will she really had very attractive dark brown eyes and even under the jesus dress all the rest looked in fair working order too well mr martin andy please well andy i heard what you said in there about no exceptions but you see weve got this mega star coming you know yeah sure whatshername thats right her well im just afraid that if we ask her to apply for a pass that well you know her reputation that shell just tell us to take a flying youknowwhat thats what shes said to be like martin almost laughed out loud but restricted himself to what he hoped was a reassuring smile he gazed deep into the brown eyes i hear you julia but i just cant make any exceptions ill tell you what i can do though since shes so highprofile i can bend the rules a bit how would it be if you and i went to her hotel and processed her there ourselves and you have a back entrance she can sign in there on the night andy thatd be great the only thing is whenever she makes an appearance like this she wants to pose out front shell never agree to sign in at the back door she will if the alternative could be a highvelocity round between the eyes tell you what why dont i come up and check out the venue myself would you really thatd be great can you come up tonight maybe were screening the european premiere of the new costner movie as our launch event you could look things over then stay on for the film as my guest or course id like that and ill even leave this thing behind in the office he tapped the gun under his left arm she laughed terrific just ask for me at the door better come about the film starts at she waved over her shoulder as she walked away martin stood gazing after her until the door opened and the other five festival directors emerged followed by skinner martin was still smiling as he and his chief went back into the room together he poured them both coffee from one of the thermos jugs whats the grin for said skinner accepting a cup christ you havent bloody scored with crystal tipps there have you andy see you boy youd shag desert orchid if you could catch it if i ever find out that you talk in your sleep ill have to think again about you as head of special branch martins grin was suddenly a little forced you can say that bob but since you put me in this job i havent been able to keep a girlfriend for more than two months at a stretch they say its because they never know where i am skinner laughed out loud bollocks its because they do know where you are youre usually with some other female come on lets get moving ive got to get ready for alexs show and youve got to fix up these scottish office people for tomorrow then get home and take your ginseng and vitamin e you wouldnt want to go limp on wee julia dropped off by skinner at fettes avenue martin entered the building by the back door and trotted up the stairs from the basement level to his office he was pleased to see that save for barry macgregor who was manning the telephones the special branch suite was empty it was pm and it was saturday but he knew this meant not that everyone has finished for the night but that the inspection of the chosen venues was already well under way sitting down behind his desk he read the exdirectory telephone number which skinner had written down for him on the back of a business card then picked up his secure telephone and punched it in a clipped slightly cautious voice answered hello michael licorish andy martin had met the head of the scottish office information directorate on a few occasions and had seen him in action in one or two highpressure situations licorish had impressed martin each time as an unflappable nononsense performer who could keep his media people under control out of respect as well as his authority and at times when others would be running for the nearest exit he had been deputy director in those days waiting patiently for his crusty old military predecessor to complete his last few months michael hi andy martin here special branch remember me the responding voice lost its cautious edge hah i should forget what can i do for you andy i take it that youll have heard by now the real story of our so called gas explosion in princes street today mm i know all about it secretary of state briefed me this afternoon told me about the warning letter too and about bob skinners antiterrorist unit seems a strong reaction for this s of s between you and me needed though as its turned out martin described skinners encounter with the motorcyclist jesus andy s of s didnt tell me that he doesnt know it happened after bob had left him now you appreciate how serious this is i hope you wont quibble over what im going to ask you for martin explained the plan for a pass system and all of the reasons for it were going to have to process a hell of a lot of people very quickly so the sooner we can get started the happier ill be my outfit is having the registration forms printed overnight and the passes too what id like you to do is to provide us with suitable staff to handle the accreditation at the festival office venues from tomorrow evening onwards i could put police personnel in to do it but your people are properly experienced in this sort of thing theyll handle it faster and the performers wont get prickly the way some people do when they have to deal with us what dyou say i say yes if youll pick up any overtime tab done right how many will you need tomorrow six good people two each at the festival and fringe offices and one at each of the jazz and film festivals the television thing doesnt start for another week after that their job will be continuous at least up to the third weekend with completely new companies and solo performers coming in all the time but well drawn up a rota of registration times at all the offices thatll let you run it with two people at the most maybe only one that sounds fair ill line my people up ill use my tour escorts theyre smooth talkers and my publicity section people they do this sort of thing on royal visits where will you want them and when ask them all to report to fettes at tomorrow and to ask for di brian mackie well brief them then and allocate them around the offices youve got it there was a pause here does this mean that we get to meet that glamour girl her with the if it does i might come along myself nice one michael but ive put myself down for that painful task that sounds like corruption to me andy see you the line clicked dead martin grinned suddenly he thought again of julia shahor her black hair her pale heartstopping face and her dark brown eyes he snorted crystal tipps indeed shag desert orchid indeed ginseng and vitamin e indeed giving away your own secrets bob skinner raised a hand in farewell to martin as he dropped him at the camngton road entrance to police headquarters he pulled the bmw away from the kerb its steel sunroof fully open the day was beginning to cool but the august evening sun still blazed from the west in a cloudless sky looking down as he reached for the onbutton of the radiocassette his eye was caught by the rip in the knee of his denims and in the same instant his mind swept back to charlotte square replaying the incident with the motorcyclist analysing the incident as he drove the short distance home several things struck skinner in succession the first was the sheer speed of his own reaction to the threat he had known instinctively that the man was pulling a gun even before he had seen its barrel the second was that he had felt no fear twice in his life now he had been exposed to direct gunfire and on neither occasion had he been afraid was it simply that there had been no time for the luxury of terror or was the answer somewhere deeper inside him more complex and more sinister was he a man who actually courted and enjoyed danger was there even in him a touch of the psychopath he cast his mind back through his career recalling the many criminal psychopaths who had crossed his path over the years one in particular stood out from the crowd a merciless killer whose most striking feature apart from his total lack of concern for his victims or his own safety had been his absolute coolness catching him had been the toughest job of skinners career yet as he thought of his own peril and of the danger he had faced on another occasion skinner recognised something of that killer in the way he himself had reacted to each situation cool unflappable and if he was totally honest ready if it came to it to kill another human being without a scrap of remorse that was the reason why when the firearms had been issued earlier he had declined to take one himself for skinner did know fear deep in his heart fear of the easy confidence and skill with which he handled a lethal weapon and of his readiness to use it the final thing to strike him in this selfanalysis was that it was now far too late to dream up a good story for sarah to explain away the rip in his jeans he would have to handle it as best he could that thought snapped him back to the present just as he turned the bmw into the narrow driveway of his home he pressed a remote signalling device and the door of the double garage swung up running the car inside he parked alongside sarahs frontera sport then entered the bungalow by the back door closing the garage doors with his signaller as he didso that was one of the small routine security precautions which had become a fact of his life the kitchen was empty neat as usual save for five crumpled safeway bags lying on one of the worktops skinner checked the fridge and found that it had been restocked he took out an opened carton of orange juice and took a swig leaning his head back and pouring it into his open mouth spanishstyle as he replaced the carton and closed the door two brown arms wound round his waist and a chin dug itself into the centre of his back from its position he could tell that sarah was barefoot and from the warmth flowing through to him he guessed that nakedness was her overall condition hi her voice was muffled slightly by his shirt as she spoke he felt her right hand at work in a few seconds she had loosened the buckle of his belt and unzipped his denims at the same time with her other hand she unfastened quickly and skilfully the buttons of his shirt when she had finished he turned into her embrace facing her shrugging off his shirt in the same movement she threw her left arm round his neck pulling his mouth down to hers as they kissed her right hand moved lower down quickly finding and releasing the object of its search he gripped the top of her thighs and lifted her clear of the floor feeling both her strength and her softness as she wrapped her legs around him not really needing her guiding hand as she lowered herself to draw him deep into her he found her mouth as she gyrated against him tasting slight saltiness gradually her movement grew faster her body bucking and heaving her legs gripping him tighter than he would have believed possible she cried out aloud once twice three times and then suddenly so did he as he felt himself erupt inside her coming and coming until he thought he would never stop but at last sarahs movements began to slow until she settled gently against him and he became aware for the first time of her weight on his hands arms and shoulders he whispered in her ear see if the window cleaner came now bob felt her laughter weu up from inside her she hugged him gripping him tight once more with her thighs he walked them still locked together through to their bedroom and laid her on the bed he settled on top of her but she rolled him over and sat up keeping him still hard and inside her as she reached down to strip off the rest of his clothes then slowly she began to move again her eyes misty and her body glowing with a light sheen of sweat her fingers ploughed their way into the ban on his chest until he drew her down close to him again and rolled her over thrusting deeper and hearing her gasp with what he thought for a moment was pain until it stretched into a long sigh of pleasure she arched her back and swung her legs up gripping him yet again and pushing with her thighs in perfect time with his thrusts her head was flung back her chin upturned her neck as if offered to the wolf strands of her auburn hair clung to her damp face she began to climax again throwing back her arms using only her legs to pull her centre tight to him and once more they came together gasping and crying and finally laughing at the skill and energy of their lovemaking and glorying in the sheer pleasure of being one together eventually he rolled away to lie on his side propped up on his left elbow with his right index finger he traced the line of her nose while smoothing back her damp hair where it had stuck to her forehead and to the sides of her face love you doctor yeah and i you copper she reached up and rubbed his cheek youre on the edge of needing a shave since their engagement on new years day and their subsequent april marriage theirs had become the deepest closest and most powerfully physical relationship that either had ever known in their intimacy sarah had been cautious at first holding herself back still with the memory of her earlier failed engagement in new york but as a wife she had developed a sexual frankness and an appetite for congress which often astonished her and always delighted bob with his daughter alex now independent of them living in her glasgow flat during university termtime and for most of the summer they had full freedom to enjoy each other and eagerly they took advantage of it bob despite being in his midforties had evolved sexually too he often thought of himself in the fifteen years between myras death and sarahs arrival in his life a quiet private thoughtful man a loner good qualities for a highachieving detective but barriers on the road to happiness for all of those years he had been wounded inwardly like sarah but more severely his few brief sexual encounters with available women never at his home and always when alex was away with her grandparents or at school camps had been deeply unsatisfying and had left him grieving afresh for his daughters dead mother so when he had first met sarah in the line of duty and had felt immediately drawn to her it had been in spite of himself and his nature that he had followed his instincts and now he was he knew a far better man for it he had still only a very few close friends andy martin and james proud top of the list but he had become more approachable more ready to laugh with others and to share his thoughts with them he perceived too that he was now more active in his support of those in trouble where before he might have offered no more than sympathy at first he had worried whether the new skinner might be too soft as a commander but he had realised quickly that the qualities which he had felt himself developing were strengths rather than weaknesses he had now lapsed into a reverie from which sarah recalled him abruptly by propping herself up on an elbow and tweaking his nose hey im still here you know she glanced down towards his right leg going to tell me about that now bob glanced down to see the red raw scrape on his knee he looked at sarah and grinned all right im in charlotte square and im watching this motorcyclist outside alan ballantynes place you know number think he looks a bit iffy so i decide to check him out im on my way over to talk to him when he reaches inside his jacket that bomb must have got to me more than i thought because i decide hes going for a gun and i dive for cover in fact whats he got in his hand is nothing but a mobile phone did i feel like a prat yes i did worst of all big denis from the scotsman saw it all ask him he said it all with a smile thinking that last part was a clever touch hope it does the trick sarahs eyes narrowed as she weighed up the plausibility of his story what did the biker do he got the fright of his life imagine he hears what he must have thought was a nutter shouting and running at him then sees him diving about in the street he revved up his bike and bombed off what else would you expect bob kept smiling his fingers mentally crossed as she looked at him for a few long seconds well if thats all lie there and ill clean up that knee she swung herself off the bed and walked on tiptoes into their showerroom a few seconds later she reappeared leaning on the doorjamb with an uncapped bottle of dettol and a wad of cottonwool in her hand as always the sudden sight of his wife naked gave bob a rush of pleasure even although he had seen her thus only a few seconds before he smiled as his eyes took in her long legs her smooth belly with the dark heart of mystery at its base her high proud full breasts in her turn she looked at him stretched out on the bed with the special relaxation that only follows great sex greymaned but still vibrant with the spirit of youth long lean and muscular he smiled at her again but she kept her face straight think its funny huh spread em boy and take your medicine he did as he was told rolling on to his back his legs forming a v she knelt alongside him and padded the scrape on his knee with the cotton wool now well soaked in the antiseptic she held the bottle of dettol upright in her left hand as she worked he winced as the antiseptic stung smiling a stage smile through clenched teeth thats a brave soldier she cooed then suddenly she straddled him again sitting on his legs immobilising him she switched the dettol bottle to her right hand holding it not upright this time but almost horizontally with her thumb over the top it hovered menacingly above his lower midsection this stuff stings dont it just she said bob laughed involuntarily taken by surprise he looked at the bottle unsure of what would happen next was that really how you scraped your leg big boy she said mock menace in her tone the grin stayed on his face well no the truth is i was at the zoo and i got too close to the alligator naw thats not it i was crossing princes street and i was run over by a bus or maybe it was when i tried to jump the food queue in marks and spencer ok ok ok i give up already she jumped to her feet and put the bottle on the bedside table now for gods sake get a move on its almost seven and we have to be at the theatre for eight his grin grew wider exactly so whats the rush he reached up and drew her to him they arrived at the pleasance theatre complex with only three minutes to spare for eleven months of the year the pleasance is used by edinburgh university and its graduates as a leisure and recreational facility and thus makes little or no impact on the life of the city but during august it is transformed into a cosmopolitan centre for the performing arts throbbing with activity eighteen hours a day bars cafeterias and two theatres are set around a central courtyard filled with benches chairs and tables around one corner of the cobbled yard rows of canvas seats are set out making the area into a third and impromptu theatre used by the ragbag of idealists and solo performers who unable to find or fund a venue flock to the fringe regardless ready to make use of even the crudest stage to further their dreams of glory bob and sarah saw alex before she spotted them wearing her stage makeup she stood at the top of the stairway which led into pleasance theatre her eyes scanned the crowd her arms were folded tight across her chest and her brow was knitted with impatience and gathering disappointment even caught off guard the girl still looked stunning tall and slim with big round blue eyes and a jumble of long dark hair shining with natural highlights which fell around her wide shoulders like a shawl as they approached bob and sarah saw her rise on her toes stretching up to peer as far into the crowd as she could then with a shrug of frustration she dropped back on to her heels and made as if to turn away alex at sarahs cry she turned and caught sight of them at last as they reached the end of a snaking queue of around forty people leading towards and then up the stairway entrance where have you two been she called down to them i was beginning to feel like id been stood up listen when you get in do me a favour and sit well to the back i dont want to be able to see either of you or catch your eye during the show in case it makes me freeze wish me luck bob smiled up at her break a leg kid or whatever he shouted sarah blew her a kiss alex waved to them and disappeared into the theatre there were only a few of the steeply tiered seats left when they entered but they found two in the third row from the back close to a spotlight none of the cast would look in that direction for fear of being blinded alexis skinner was five weeks short of her twentyfirst birthday she was the only child of bobs youthful first marriage which had been cut tragically short by the death of his wife in a simple car accident when alex was only three years old she had no clear memory of her mother and bob had brought her up virtually alone with the occasional help of his parents in the cottage in gullane the east lothian golfing village where he and sarah now shared their offduty time myra alexs dead mother had left a sizable endowment policy to provide for her education at one of the merchant company schools in edinburgh however the young alex had demanded that she be allowed to stay with her friends in east lothian stamping her tiny foot to emphasise the point eventually bob had let her have her way gullane primary and north berwick high it had been and both schools had done well by her university had been a different matter as she had chosen to read law at glasgow now three years on she was about to enter her honours year on track for a first with a string of commendations and prizes to her name she intended eventually to pursue a career at the scottish bar to her fathers private delight recently she had been awarded a faculty of advocates scholarship to help her through her period of pupillage and over the first months of her career in advocacy where traditionally a newcomer had little or no earning capacity when alex was five bob had invested her school endowment fund in a ivory sime capital growth trust switching to an income fund when she was ready to leave school her private means as sometimes with mock grandeur she described her mothers legacy allowed her to live a frugal but comfortable student existence freed from the need to find a parttime job she had been able to pursue her interest in the theatre which had been developing since the start of her university career gathering pace as she gained more confidence in the progress of her studies after a year in the university drama club she had joined a rather more ambitious theatre society founded by but no longer restricted to glasgows wealthy and influential jewish community bob and sarah had seen her perform in two productions each a musical and had been surprised by the way her naturally powerful singing voice had developed under coaching it was now good enough to have attracted interest outside the theatre group as sarah knew daughter and stepmother having decided to keep it a secret from bob until the release of the album she had been used as a backing singer by a glasgow rockgroup which was already internationally successful and still seemed to be moving on an upward career path this fringe show was far different from anything she had attempted before in fact alex had said it was the most difficult thing their group had ever tackled a stage version of tom wolfes book the right stuff telling the story of the pioneering american mercury astronauts no music just straight drama and for the first time alex played the female lead she was cast as glamorous glennis yeager the wife of the first man to break the sound barrier when not involved in dialogue she narrated in spotlight from side stage as the story developed she had enlisted sarah as american accent coach and throughout july the skinner household had rung to the sound of transatlantic conversation on occasion even bob had found himself joining in bob and sarah settled into their seats as the last light dimmed to blackness then suddenly in a brilliant stage illumination there were alex and the male lead miming a chase in which alex was steadily overtaken and thrown to the ground in what the skilful stagelighting effect made believable as desert the yeagers strange courtship ritual began a play which unfolded its gripping story over two and a half hours before the show bob had held private reservations about a play which attempted to tell the whole story of early space exploration in a makeshift theatre however when it was over he conceded to himself that it had worked thanks to the intensity of the fellow players and of course to alexs exceptional performance the final curtain was received with thunderous applause and a standing ovation a rarity on the fringe eventually after three encores the applause quietened and the audience began to file out bob and sarah made their way down to the front less than a minute later alex appeared through a side door she was followed a few paces behind by a muscular blond man an inch or so under six feet in height dressed in jeans and a tshirt well what did you think she bubbled still on a high from the warmth of the applause was it ok ok said bob it was brilliant you could take that anywhere well done baby always knew you were a star yes terrific kid sarah hugged her alex kissed them both thanks pops thanks sarah you really mean it they smiled their replies as alex turned and beckoned to the man waiting behind her theres someone id like you to meet this is ingemar svart known as ingo our lighting genius we imported him from sweden specially for the show ingo meet bob and sarah skinner my dad and mum inwardly sarah was enormously pleased by alexs introduction but she held up a hand please alex thats stepmum im only nine years older than you remember hi ingo its nice to meet you i thought your lighting was great thank you i am also pleased to meet both of you as he returned the swedes firm handshake bob was struck by the clarity of his iceblue eyes and by the easy confidence with which the man whom he judged to be around thirty returned his appraising gaze he tried but failed to read his thoughts through his calm expression behind the smile ingo svart was impassive alex reclaimed his attention pops d you mind if we pass on supper theres a firstnight cast party and weve really got to go to it you two could come with us if you like as his daughter spoke skinner caught sight over her shoulder of a tall balding figure framed in the door at the side of the hall no babe thanks but we wont i want to have a look round here then weve got our table booked at the waterfront cant let it go to waste you go on though enjoy yourselves youve both earned it now i must say hello to brian over there he walked with alex and ingo back across to the side door detective inspector mackie smiled and nodded a greeting to alex then he stepped aside and held the door for her and her companion before turning back to skinner evening boss good show im biased i know but it was one of the best things ive seen in a long time a fringe awardwinner for sure howre you doing fine ive just been scouting round this place and the other theatre no problems with either from a security viewpoint but the bars and that open courtyard scare the hell out of me it looks virtually impossible to make them secure as things are just now mind you there are only two ways into this complex how would you feel about blocking the back way and then searching everyone as they come through the arch skinner shrugged his shoulder id feel uneasy about it but maybe we dont have a choice think through the pros and cons and give me a recommendation in the morning while were here why dont you walk me through it after that were off to eat want to join us thanks boss but i wont if you dont mind im rubber ducked so im bound for an early night saturday or not as skinner and sarah chose their late supper from the blackboard menu in their crowded dockside restaurant a mile or two away andy martins evening was moving towards a satisfactory conclusion earlier he had inspected filmhouse the base of the film festival from its attic to its cellars there seemed to be no wasted space at all in the building and it seemed to pose no problems its two purposebuilt cinemas had numbered seating and everyone entering had to pass through a single wide foyer before reaching either of them or the restaurant and bar julia shahor had quickly agreed to his suggestion that she should install two video cameras in the foyer but placed where they could be seen clearly their value being deterrence rather than detection they had sat sidebysuie in front row seats during the film an intense drama set in revolutionary france before the dimming of the lights for the screening julia a designer outfit replacing the white robe she had worn earlier in the day had launched her film festival with a short assured and politically clever speech about the economic importance of the british movie industry ending with an appeal to the financial leaders who made up a sizable chunk of the invited audience to recognise the earning potential of a successful film by providing risk capital for worthwhile projects when she had finished and had taken her seat by his side andy had realised that his earlier assessment of the woman as naive or gauche had been well wide of the mark so he had warmed to her even more after the film they had eaten in the filmhouse restaurant at her suggestion they had discussed the film itself and others which were to be the highlights of the ensuing festival they had made smalltalk learning more about each other as their conversation developed sparring gently with words each establishing in the process that the other had no serious entanglements and then just as andy had been deciding what might happen next and how he should play it she had beaten him toil i dont suppose youd feel like giving a working girl a lift home do you in the same moment as bob skinners baked red mullet was placed before him by the waterfronts young waiter andy closed the passenger door of his red sports hatch and julia settled into her seat the moon was bright and clear as they drove through the new town as andy changed gear turning into northumberland street julia reached out and stroked the back of his hand her touch was featherlight and he felt a tingle run up his arm i bet all the girls say this but youre quite different from my idea of a policeman although youre not just any old policeman are you youre one of the special kind he laughed not that special honest and what all the girls say after a while at least is more like typical bloody copper followed as a rule by a slamming door along here did you say yes just around the corner but it gets narrow if you park there we can walk the rest julias home was a twostorey mews house in the lane which linked dublin street and northumberland street a tiny flowerpot garden surprising in the heart of the city was divided off from the roadway by an iron fence with a narrow gate she put a hand on its latch then suddenly stood on tiptoe and kissed him her face shone in the moonlight which flooded the lane andy was reminded of the taste of honey and the scent of fresh lemons im really just a nice jewish girl you know come in and ill prove it andy knew that if he tried to speak it would come out as a husky croak so he said nothing but followed her into the cottage closing the gate quietly behind him the house had no hall and the front door opened straight into the livingroom it was in darkness and so the womans voice when it sounded from the far corner took him completely by surprise julia the accent was guttural unspecified middleeuropean yes auntie its me she flicked on the light andy saw sitting in the corner a small greyhaired woman she turned her face towards them with a smile which the policeman thought had something strange about it ive brought a new friend home his names andy martin hes a policeman andy this is my aunt dome mrs rosenberg andy smiled towards her and knew with certainty as he did so that mrs rosenberg was completely blind julia tugged at his sleeve pulling him towards an open door which led into the kitchen at the same time she spoke across the room to her aunt im going to make coffee would you like some no thank you dear im off to bed my radio programme finished some time ago very pleased to meet you mr martin she stood up from her chair and began to tap her way expertly with a white stick towards a door on the far side of the room andy was still recovering from the surprise very pleased to meet you too mrs rosenberg he said belatedly goodnight as the old woman left the room he followed julia into the kitchen there i told you i was a nice jewish girl and au nice jewish girls have to have little old jewish mothers and if not aunties how long three years now but her sight was failing for five years before that its a very rare condition seventeen cases currently on the record in the uk the vision starts to go in the centre and the blind spot just widens out until its all gone quite incurable uncle percy took her everywhere looking for a different opinion but all the diagnoses were the same and all the prognoses she cant see a thing now not even the faintest hint of light hardly any point in her coming to a film festival is there but she said shed just like to be here in the city while it was on she can hear though can she hear a mouse hiccup at fifty paces she says julia drew andys head down towards her and kissed him so well just have to be very quiet wont we she murmured quieter than mice and being careful not to hiccup they tiptoed upstairs much of julias bedroom was filled by a kingsize brass framed bed positioned opposite a narrow whitecurtained window the drapes were tied back to allow in as much light as possible andy felt inside the doorway for a light switch but she placed a soft hand on his arm to stop him she led him gently towards the bed and without speaking began to unfasten his shirt kissing his chest as each button came undone her hunger for him was frank honest and somehow touching in its fragility for his part where he would normally have been confident and dominant now he felt as awkward and clumsy as an inexperienced teenager he was amazed to find that his fingers were trembling as he fumbled with the catch of her dress but eventually the zipper came free and unfastened in one long movement she stepped out of the expensive garment and laid it on a chair near the bed and when she reached out her arms to him and moved towards him her pale skin shining in the silver light like fine china he embraced her with a catch in his throat and with the knowledge that he had come to a pivotal moment in his life after which nothing would ever be as it had been before julia was generous and tender and enormously affectionate in her lovemaking he responded to her touches as she did to his with shivers and gasps allowing her to express herself as she chose as she introduced herself to his body he took pleasure in her tenderness finding himself excited as never before by her patience and by the relaxed fashion in which she unfolded herself to him he drank deeply from the well of her passion matching her pace where he would once have rushed holding back to sustain her as she climaxed letting go only when he could control himself no longer as he did he scaled a peak of pleasure which he had never reached before realising as he stretched himself on its summit that he was experiencing for the first time all the sensations of a genuine union between two bodies and souls when they had reached the other side of the mountain they lay side by side on the fluffy cover naked smiling at each other in the moonlight martin felt enriched and it came to him with the greatest clarity that the essential ingredient intimacy had been missing from the string of hollow purely physical relationships in which he had been involved over the previous few years i dont do this ever you know she whispered to him very softly on the first date i mean not very nice jewish behaviour at all he blew gently into her ear and smiled as her back arched and her nipples hardened in a second then he turned her face to his and said very softly would you believe me if i told you that was the first time ive ever made love her eyes widened and she opened her mouth to speak but he stopped her with a kiss its true until now what ive known has been no more than screwing he paused suddenly im scared this is new territory for me we met what eight hours ago and yet well its incredible im a logical man im pushing thirtyfive and here i am gone shot stoned in love i think do you think im crazy she laid two small fingers across his mouth if you are my darling its contagious she took his hand and placed it between her breasts feel here im shaking it was true under his touch andy could feel a faint trembling mixed in with the steady pounding of her heart he moved his hand round and drew her gently close against him he nodded his head towards the window maybe its just that full moon maybe tomorrow she smiled maybe but it doesnt feel that way to me in the meantime she pulled his head towards her and began to chew his earlobe gently a shaft of pleasure ran down his body all the way to his toes julia mrs rosenbergs voice came in an insistent whisper from the open doorway in her surprise julia bit down sharply on andys ear he managed to stifle a yelp taken completely unawares by the silence of the womans approach and forgetting that she was blind he reached out automatically for his clothes the whisper came again theres someone downstairs someone trying to get in are you sure auntie julia whispered in return of course im sure at the front door as well we have a policeman here in the moonlight he saw her smile faintly into the room martin was into his slacks and shirt before she had finished speaking barefoot he moved silently through the doorway and crept downstairs he and julia had left the livingroom door ajar when they had gone up he stood behind it and listened at first there was nothing only a heavy silence until he heard a scratchy creaking noise which he recognised as a jemmy on the doorframe keeping out of the moonlight and close to the wall he slid into the room and up to the front door grabbing the oval handle of the yale lock he twisted it and pulled hard the door swung open only to be stopped after a few inches by a brass security chain fixed peculiarly a few inches above floor level shit martin closed the door again and freed the chain then pulled it wide but in those few seconds the intruder had bolted the garden gate swung creaking on its hinges he had just time to see what he was certain was a male figure disappearing around the corner as he ran from the lane into the sloping dublin street he saw his quarry at the foot of the hill racing into drummond place martin gave up the chase seconds later he heard a motorcycle bark into life then roar away he jogged back to the house where he found julia standing in the doorway once again wearing her white robe sorry love he got away id have had him but i didnt notice the chain you were in the kitchen when i fixed it i do that every night without even thinking a previous occupant installed it down there he must have been a midget oh but andy thank god you were here so much for my precious alarm system martin looked up at the big red box above the door dont blame that too much the guys pumped some quickdry stuff into it a pound to a pinch of pigshit this was the container he knelt and picked up a long cylinder with a pistol grip at one end and a nozzle at the other yes sure enough quickdry mastic a sort of rubber solution your alarm probably still thinks its working it wont realise its been choked to death i dont suppose its linked to the gayfield police station julia shook her head together they went back indoors martin carrying the mastic tube wheres your aunt i made her go back to bed well go and tell her everythings ok but first show me where the phone is im going to call this in its in the kitchen will that mean police here tonight he chuckled apart from me you mean no ill tell them im handling things here but for the next halfhour or so i want anyone going through this city on a motorcycle pulled over and questioned on you go now put your aunts mind at rest she started towards the stairs then looked back at him from the doorway andy she said quietly will you stay till morning he smiled his widest smile and the morning after and the morning after that as many mornings as you want try and stop roe you lady now have the highestranking personal bodyguard in edinburgh she was waiting for him under the duvet after he had made his call and issued his orders to the gayfield nightshift her white robe lay on the floor the curtains were drawn and a lamp on the bedside table was lit he undressed and slipped into bed beside her as she hugged him he felt her shiver very slightly andy you dont suppose there could have been any connection between that burglar and the things you told us about this afternoon he shook his head vigorously not at all that was just a saturdaynight chancer the sort of thing that happens every weekend in life in any city as she smiled and pulled him towards her he hoped that he would never have to lie to her again i know its a big if boss but she is connected with the festival yes but hold on andy you said yourself that the curtains were open at the front of the house downstairs and upstairs and your car was parked round the corner the guy probably just guessed wrongly that the place was empty how was he to know that you just like having it off with the curtains open aye very funny bob look damn few opportunists come equipped with a cylinder of mastic to fuck up any alarm system they might happen to come across ok maybe he was a professional saturdaynighter skinner saw martins frown deepen his expression made even darker by the stubble on his chin he put a friendly hand on his shoulder look andy i know youre worried about this girl nothings impossible and the chances are well never know whether there was a connection but one things for sure after having a close shave like that theres no way the bastard will come back maybe so boss but im still having that house watched and julia escorted to and from work and once the alarms fixed its being linked to gayfield skinner whistled at martins vehemence here this sounds serious how long have you known this lass one day is this the andy martin that i know and that dozens of women have come to love in vain your thinking must be affected right enough otherwise last night youd have let that boy get all the way in the door then you could have stiffened him and wed have got all the answers that were just guessing at now thats what id have done if id been there and been thinking straight that is skinner and martin were alone in the private office of the special branch suite it was am on sunday morning and the headquarters building was weekend quiet but suddenly they heard the outer door open someones keen said skinner we told them nine oclock there was a soft knock on martins door come he shouted the door opened and a little round man no more than five feet four inches tall seemed to roll into the room at first martin was reminded of a football then noting the way in which the little man appeared to taper inward and down from the shoulders decided that he looked more like a spinning top the newcomer had a friendly inquisitive smile and receding gingery closecropped hair he wore a harris tweed jacket unusually heavy for august a check shirt and grey trousers his black shoes were polished to a high shine hello bob s good to see you again there was a twinkle in his eyes as he stretched a hand upwards towards skinner the accent was unmistakably north of england lancashire or hereabouts martin guessed skinner shook the outstretched hand and returned the smile adam good to see you too glad youre here although i didnt expect you to make it so fast you kiddin i was in fookin belfast you get a chance to get clear of that place you dont hang about natives are fookin restless over there just now whatever youve got here itll be a fookin holiday by comparison skinner smiled grimly hope thats the way it turns out mate he turned to martin andy this is captain adam arrow military intelligence special air services counterterrorist adviseryou name it hes the lot he and i met at that security seminar i went to last month adam meet andy martin dci special branch he might only look like a lad but hes been there done that thats enough for me said arrow the two shook hands and martin was suddenly aware that the little man was immensely strong arrow turned back towards skinner ok bob so why have i been pulled out of t fookin fryingpan all that the five woman said was that youd asked for me as a specialist skinner waved him over to a chair sit yourself down and ill tell you quickly but comprehensively he briefed arrow on the crisis describing the waverley market bomb ballantynes letter his own encounter with the motorcycle gunman and finally even martins latenight tussle like as not andys incident had nothing to do with all this but hes not so sure martin cut in lets just say im taking no chances arrow nodded his round head vigorously quite right as bob says its a long shot but its best to keep an eye on the lass if it were connected they might just have another go unless you identified yself didnt shout stop in t name of the law or owt like that did you martin grinned no i did shout something when that chain stopped the door but it wasnt anything like that arrow nodded then he looked up at skinner tell you one thing already bob nowt to do wi ireland this lot why so sure skinner asked loads of reasons your average paddy whatever side hes on wouldnt write it all down then nail it to secretary of states fookin door itd be telephone warning every time then theres t tone of yon letter its ponderous pretentious almost this bastard is a new hand at the game hes feeling very important or at least hes trying to make us think he is then theres your biker irish wouldnt do anything so fookin stupid as to shoot at a civilian and you didnt shout police either most of all our intelligence is pretty good when it comes to things like this were good at monitoring their contacts wi other organisations i reckon if theyd been in touch with anyone over here theres a fair chance our guysd have stumbled on it no no irish link ere this is a new lot and thats a big problem why so big said martin quizzically cos it means we know fookall about em thats why no established behaviour pattern in ireland we know how the lookers think gives us whatever edge we have lets us guess what theyre likely to do we dont always guess right but when we do and were in the right place then they can get out the black gloves beret tricolour or the union jack we dont play favourites and the hearse arrows small bright eyes hardened and his voice dropped to not much above a whisper cos theyll fookin need em he looked sharply across at martin this lots starting from scratch thatll make it harder for us what have you done so far on the security side bob as much as i could in what skinner looked at his slim gold wristwatch less than twentyfour hours he described the steps which had been taken the security checks the pass system all thats in place my people are coming in this morning to finish writing up security reports on each of the higherrisk venues weve designated about two dozen of them once ive looked through them ill be able to judge how im off for manpower his glance at arrow held a question in it if i decide im a bit light and need some extra cover for special places how are your lot placed just now the little man paused as if he was deciding how frankly he could answer such a direct question then with an imperceptible nod he said i think we could give you some help weve got quite a few over in ireland at the moment then theres others up to no fookin good in the middle east theres a few bastards out there were going to get even with and one in particular we lost some guys in the gulf war and we havent forgotten them suddenly the eyes lost all their jollity as his mind turned over a bitter memory we never forget things like that weve nailed a few of the guys responsible already but theres more to get yet that lot think its mossad he chuckled a quiet sound which chilled martin to the bone but it aint fookin pussies mossad are compared wi our lot when someone upsets us he looked up at skinner and the genial smile returned still an all i reckon the co could sort out a dozen or so good lads for you youd have to ask through the politicians mind you skinner nodded i know and i probably will meantime there are some things we can do inhouse andys pulled a list of oddball journalists from the sb files the sort of guys whose names pop up in criminal investigations or who are known to make heavy use of criminal sources theres about a dozen of them and theyve all still to be interviewed as well as that im expecting a report that i asked five to do for me last night its on its way up now by courier arrow raised his eyebrows too hot for fax or telex then mm skinner nodded tell you what adam are you checked in anywhere yet no im stoppin at redford wherever that is ill get someone to show you in fact well give you the grand tour while were at it lets see who was the earlyshift guy out there again i he pressed a buzzer on martins desk a few seconds later his question was answered as mario mcguire appeared in the doorway sir morning mario skinner introduced arrow to the big dark haired detective captain arrows new in town sergeant its your first time here adam isnt it the little man nodded mario said skinner id like you to give captain arrow a runaround take him out to redford barracks first to drop off his kit then show him festival edinburgh let him get a feel of the place show him some of the venues the usher hall lyceum assembly hall places like that take a look at the pleasance grab some lunch there maybe and ill see you both back here around two is that okay with you adam firstrate there a bar at this pleasance place then ill be fookin gaspin by then i reckon looks like im out of the fryin pan in belfast and into the fookin fire here right enough the two men one large one little left the room looking incongruous sidebyside yet as they left martin found himself thinking that of the two big hard and powerful as mcguire was if forced to make the choice he would rather tackle three mario mcguires than a single adam arrow as the door closed behind them skinner turned back to martin ok andy lets have a look at that list ofjournos from a secure cabinet which he opened with a key martin produced a yellow folder coming to stand beside skinner he laid it on the desk and opened it to show a list of names in alphabetical order theyre all here fourteen in all five in and around glasgow six in edinburgh one in haddington one in stirling and one in dundee only five of them are employed fulltime on the staff of newspapers the rest are a mixture of freelances mostly writers and researchers but two describe themselves as television producers skinner pointed to a name in the lower half of the list aye and that ones our numberone target martin followed his finger mr frazer pagett yes i agree christ hed take the huff if we didnt feel his collar hed take it as a slur on his reputation as an investigative journalist if he didnt get a visit from us skinner shook his head no he said vehemently thats just what hes not going to get i want him watched i want his phone tapped in fact i want taps on everyone on that list dont we need ballantynes signature to do that boss weve got it already that piece of paper he signed yesterday gives me authority to do as i think fit and i think fit now to start telephone surveillance on all the people mentioned here the half of them probably believe theyre being tapped all the time anyway as far as mr pagetts concerned were going to let him sit on it for a few days listen to him look at him and just see if he says or does anything funny hes the only guy on your list that i take seriously the others are just unscrupulous reporters or nutters well give all of them the courtesy of a visit right away word of thatll get back to mr pagett and itll make him nervous when we finally do go to see him i want him as jumpy as possible martin closed the yellow folder ill need your written authority for telecom to set up the phone taps no were not going to use them theres a guy in scottish office mel christian director of telecommunications heres his home number skinner scribbled on a memo pad tore off the page and handed it to martin call him right away use my name tell him its a beta operation thatll get his attention tell him what you need and hell make it ha he was cut short by the trembling tone of his mobile phone he took it from his pocket and pressed the receive button hello bob its alan b can you come to st andrews house right away ive had another the three flags hanging limp on their poles seemed to emphasise the sunday morning quiet making the massive grey stone building look for all the world like an abandoned fortress skinner pulled the bmw into a parking space opposite the tall brassbound double entrance doors one of which was slightly ajar across regent road the morning sun as it rose skywards shone brightly on the foliage of calton hill but the foyer of st andrews house which was northfacing was in shade his eyes took a second or two to adjust to the gloom as he stepped into the big entrance hall which was made even darker than usual by the closed outer doors he waved his pass at the security guard on duty in his booth morning john morning mr skinner as he crossed the hall he noted that the alert board had been changed from the lowgrade of the previous day to the yellow state which he had ordered he stepped into the waiting lift and pressed the button marked arnold shields ballantynes private secretary was working at his desk in the secretary of states outer office another man sat in a chair in the corner reading avidly the sports section of scotland on sunday skinner had taken three paces into the room before the man looked up recognition flooded his face in the same instant he dropped the newspaper and sat bolt upright for a second skinner fixed the man with a glare then he turned to shields the private secretary was tall thin and dapper he was also sharp perceptive and destined for high office as were all those who were appointed to his important post sunday morning or not he was dressed in a dark singlebreasted suit striped shirt collar and tie he was a reserved man with an unfailing formality of manner which added to his overall air of aloofness he did not mix socially with colleagues and none knew anything of his private life although he was respected universally he was regarded just as universally as standoffish and was disliked by his colleagues as a result skinner knew more about shields than any of the mans office peers he and martin had handled the meticulous vetting to which shields had been subjected before being offered the private secretary post they had discovered without difficulty that he was a practising homosexual and had a stable twelveyearold relationship with a partner in the glasgow office of an international accountancy practice after considering their course of action for some days skinner and martin had taken the unusual step of talking over the situation with shields and his friend they had been persuaded by the discussion that although the relationship was private it was not secret and that it could not possibly lay either man open to blackmail skinner had approved the appointment keeping the information he had uncovered entirely under wraps shields rose from his chair and extended his hand as skinner approached his desk mr skinner good morning the secretary of state is expecting you go right in ballantyne was working his way through a pile of correspondence as skinner entered sit down over there bob i wont be a moment read that in the meantime he pushed a brown envelope across the desk it was handed to the doorman at the caledonian hotel at nine oclock motorcyclist again but no couriers livery this time this one just wore denims and a crash helmet the manager of the caley sent the letter straight along here there was a faint catch in the secretary of states voice skinner studied him closely as he worked the tension of the previous day showed in his face once more as he scrawled his signature across a letter he cast it in its folder on to the pile in his outtray then picked up another barely reading it before signing skinner thought that the man looked strungout and nervous was that all down to this the terror threat or could some of it be due to that designer blonde carlie he mused he looked down at the envelope which ballantyne had handed to him it was the twin of the previous days addressed in the same way with a white label he drew out the letter and read to the socalled secretary of state for scotland from the fighters for an independent scotland code word arbroath the failure of the media to report yesterdays demonstration or to publish our letter leads us to conclude that you and your colleagues in the government of the occupying power have secured their silence by coercion clearly we cannot allow this situation to continue if your censorship is not lifted by pm today and if by that time yesterdays statement of our demands has not been broadcast on radio and television we will take further stem action to force you to accede no warning of that action will be given and full responsibility for its consequences will rest entirely with you skinner sank into a chair by the window and read the letter through once again as he was finishing ballantyne put the last of the green folders its letter signed in his outtray he rose from behind the desk and crossed the room to sit in a facing chair what dyou think bob whatll they do i dont know alan if i did id stop them from doing it and that would be that well what can do there was a note of frustration in the secretary of states voice maybe we should do what they ask weve bought some time and used it as best we could our plans are made and even now theyre being put into action we cant keep this genie in the bottle for ever so we might as well thank the media for their cooperation and tell them theyre free to run the letter absolutely not ballantynes tone was suddenly strident skinner was alarmed to detect hysteria lurking not far below the surface we cant do that i wont do that it would be a surrender to terrorism and the prime minister would never countenance it i spoke to him last night hes quite resolute skinner shook his head thats inspiring news look alan theres no surrender about it you were gungho yesterday and that was right but it doesnt do to be tough just for the sake of it sometimes youve got to use this as he spoke he tapped the side of his head you cant believe surely that we can keep the truth from the public for ever whats the point anyway as i said weve bought our time and used it wisely by putting in extra security everywhere thatll start to show soon give it a day or two three at the most and the public will begin to figure out that yesterdays bang wasnt any gas explosion and listen these bastards are right about one thing we have coerced the bloody media we did it for a purpose and now weve achieved it we should thank them for their cooperation and let them go ahead ballantyne jumped from his seat no he shouted its a matter of principle skinner stood too he glared down at the man and when he answered his voice was raised also ive had a taste of politicians principles in my time secretary of state and ive noticed that they have a nasty tendency to get innocent people killed do you think this outfit are kidding stern action to force you to accede whatever that means its a direct threat you seem to forget theyve threatened more action come what may unless we hand them the keys to the kingdom that is skinner slapped the walnutpanelled wall in frustration i dont forget that at all but theres no sense in pushing them into more violence when weve nothing immediate to gain although still shaking ballantyne had recovered at least some of his composure im sorry bob i am adamant the government must stand its ground we take the decisions your job is to protect thats what i expect you and your people to do skinner glowered at him making no effort to hide the flame of i his anger i hope you realise you could be signing some poor sods death warrant not your own though youre safe enough as for our job were already doing it but since youre making it difficult for us you can come up with some extra resources i want some sas people up here you can quote the prime ministers resolve to get the ok from mod a dozen will do me im told theyre available iballantyne retreated across the room to the citadel of the ministerial desk yes ill do that for you bob im sure itll be all right his tone had changed now it was almost placatory skinner too had cooled down i hope it is alan its your shout if youre wrong itll be as if our disagreement never happened i wont ever cast it up to you but youll have some job forgiving yourself ballantyne said nothing he stood behind his desk head bowed skinner looked at him coolly for a few seconds then changed the subject what time are the chief constables coming in twelve noon i thought wed see them in the thirdfloor conference room ill welcome them and you can give them the lowdown i spoke to mcguinness personally as you requested and explained that you were working directly to me or this thing i told him that if you need to ask for his cooperation in anything hes to give it without question ill tell the chiefs that too skinner looked at his watch it was five minutes before ten ok thanks look im going back down to fettes ive got one or two things to do there ill be back for ten to twelve fine see you then as he left the room skinner knew that something had gone for ever from his relationship with the secretary of state he had previously thought more highly of ballantynes judgement yet there was more to it than that he was deeply disappointed in the man skinners creed was built on unswerving loyalty to family to friends to colleagues to country the secretary of states implacable refusal even to consider his view had left him feeling personally betrayed and he knew in his heart that he would never be able to look at ballantyne in quite the same way again he closed the door quietly behind him if shields and the other man had heard the raised voices neither gave the slightest sign skinner smiled at the private secretary ill be back for that other meeting in a couple of hours arnold shields simply nodded in acknowledgement skinner beckoned the other man to follow him into the corridor when they were alone he turned on him detective constable howells just what the hell do you think youre here for you are an armed special branch officer assigned to close protection of the secretary of state i walk into that room and youre in there reading the fucking funny papers if i had been a bad guy youd have been dead in one second then mr shields then the secretary of state your job is out here not in there you have to assume that everyone who comes on to this floor unannounced is a bad guy and be ready to act until you find out different do you know what happens to detective officers if they screw up badly enough around me nightshift in uniform on the beat in fucking eyemouth thats what youve just walked perilously close to having a permanent smell of fish in your wide nostrils so dont do it again clear the detective who was two inches taller than skinner nodded vigorously clear sir sorry sir ok incident closed but be on guard in the corridor from now on he started towards the lift then looked over his shoulder ill be back youd better be the first person i see on this floor the courier was a woman she was seated in a corner of the main special branch office sipping coffee and reading a magazine when skinner entered the room she stood up at once recognising him from the photograph which she had been shown early that morning in london forestalling brian mackies attempt to introduce her she came towards him hand outstretched good morning sir my names mary im from five i have some papers for you from london which i believe youre expecting skinner shook the womans hand yes thats right thank you for coming all this way mary was carrying a brown leather satchel she fished a key from the pocket of her blue woollen jacket and unfastened the heavy brass lock releasing the catch with a flick of her thumb she withdrew a long white envelope and handed it over mission accomplished sir now may i call for a cab back to the airport skinner held the envelope unopened in his hand thank you mary no need for a taxi even on a sunday i think we can find you a driver he looked across to mackie see to it please brian sir dci in yes boss he thanked the messenger once more and excused himself martin was speaking softly into the telephone he was seated in his swivel chair with his back to the door when skinner entered the room he swung round making a windup motion with his left hand got to go now ill pick you up at around one oclock he paused for a second as he listened to the voice on the line if youre sure your aunt will be all right at home well go to my place i need to shave badly see you then he was still smiling as he replaced the receiver in its cradle skinner shook his head and laughed i dont believe what im seeing here a thirtysomething schoolboy everyones cracking up today first ballantyne turns into general fucking patton now you turn into fucking romeo martin looked at him curiously whats up with ballantyne skinners good humour disappeared as he described his altercation with the secretary of state i hate these boys when they decide to get brave andy its always some other bastard that winds up bleeding lets hope not this time yeah anyway forget that for the moment and lets look at whats in here its my report from five he drew up a chair and sat down facing martin across the desk slitting open the white envelope he drew out its contents three sheets of a folded top to bottom he scanned the first sheet and glanced across at martin this says theyve been through all of the most sensitive running files on politicians and found only one that fits the bill he put the covering letter to one side and studied the twopage report we know about this guy all right grant forrest macdainnid labour mp for glasgow marymount he used to be a right wee hoodlum when he was a youngster ran a gang and did time in barlinnie young offenders till he got into politics and started doing people over legally hes on the ultranationalist wing of the peoples party advocates direct action to secure home rule but theres a twist to him hes a monarchist wants to set up a scottish parliament with a head of state on scandinavian lines you know what they call a minimalist monarch a king with a day job hes even got a candidate picked out a descendant of the stuarts our potential king is an italian who barely speaks english but thats nae bother to our mr macdainnid the general view of him is that hes just a nutter but worth watching nonetheless hes got the sort of humourless zeal in his eye that alarms the likes of you and me mm i know what you mean said martin ive seen him on telly have we been paying him any special attention up here the glasgow special branch keeps a tap on his phone its never picked up anything more sinister than an order for a carryout chinese that probably means that he expects to be tapped he makes a load of noise in public but in private well the transcripts read like hes a real al bore thats what hes like up here skinner tapped the report on the desk according to this though he comes out of the closet when hes in london five were giving him a sort of general lookover a few weeks back they tailed him to an irish club in camden town it seems they walked into a sort of terrorist jamboree all shapes and sizes irish basques neonazis libyans all jabbering away pissing it up and our man macdainnid right in the midst of it all so what did the five guys do hung around long enough to commit as many faces to memory as they could then beat a retreat apparently so says this report they had a problem one of the five guys was a gal this was a real hairyarsed place and they felt too obvious so they split when they got back to the shop they dug out the picture gallery spotted four or five faces and realised what they had been into they sent the heavies round right away but the party had broken up theyve been tailing macdainnid ever since no more contacts but three weeks ago as soon as parliament broke up he went on holiday where to ready for this tripoli one of the worlds prime sources of semtex and other choice ordnance he got back to glasgow last thursday fucking hell couldnt have put it more eloquently myself they searched his luggage at the airport he had a big holdall thing as hand baggage and when he caught the shuttle they xrayed it but they couldnt search it without making him suspicious he could have had anything in there skinner folded the report replaced it in the envelope and handed it to martin here lock this in your safe so mr grant forrest macdainnid mp has been installed as bookies favourite we need a roundtheclock job on him want me on it no your wee friend julia and i both need you here anyway its a glasgow job one for superhaggerty dig out his home phone number for me youve got it here havent you martin nodded he flicked through his filofax until he found the glasgow number dialled it and handed the receiver to skinner two rings later a gruff voice answered hullo willie its bob skinner momin sir sunday mornin too whats up ye got a crisis in edinburgh is it rainin or something its about to rain on your weekend fella i need you through here im seeing your chief and others in about ninety minutes in st andrews house i want you there to hear what ive got to tell them itll save me having to repeat myself are you fit to drive i know what your weekends can be like aw come on sir you ken very well im teetotal skinner laughed ironically and replaced the receiver scotland can sleep easy in her bed andy haggertys on the job speaking of which take a few hours off and see your new girlfriend there isnt a lot you can do here till the troops finish their reports from last night me im going along to kill some paperwork till its time for my briefing martin smiled his new contented smile yeah okay boss i think ill do that before i go though one thing occurs to me about macdairmid if hes such a nutter why doesnt the labour party get shot of him as one of their mps they cant said skinner you see hes really a nat apparently an extreme nationalist splinter group like that old seed of the gael thing from ten years back infiltrated the marymount constituency labour party took control deselected the last mp and installed the boy macdairmid hes untouchable by head office theyd love to find a good excuse to bump him but they havent come up with one yet labour are desperate to keep the whole thing hushed up none of the other parties know not even the official nationalists if they found out theyd crucify them and so would the voters funny game politics eh martin grunted not when you start playing it with semtex it isnt macdairmid that bampot surely hes all wind and piss sir that was my impression too willie till five told me different the last of the chief constables had driven or been driven away from st andrews house and the secretary of state had departed for charlotte square skinner and detective superintendent willie haggerty the new head of special branch in glasgow were sitting alone in the big conference room which still reeked of the smoke from sir john govans pipe the glasgow chief two months from retirement had smiled cheerfully through the coughs and splutters of his colleagues the big table was still littered with the debris of the buffet lunch which the secretary of state had provided haggerty munched on the last of the sandwiches as he considered skinners story christ thats amazin we listen in taste the guys phone and he never as much as breaks wind down in the smoke and hes off taste a murder incorporated smoker and taste libya fur his holidays looks like he could be our man right enough not our man willie one of them perhaps but not the only one he was home in glasgow when the bomb went off and when the first letter was delivered and when that biker took a shot at me how dyou know that because ive read the transcripts the tap picked up three calls during that time one at to his wife theyre separated one at to his girlfriend one right on the stroke of midday to the chief reporter of the sunday mail its the third one that interests me twelve noon on the dot the same moment that the bomb goes off and he phones a mate on a newspaper what did they talk about thats the strange thing he calls the bloke up to ask what time the rangers game kicks off says he thought it could have been one oclock rather than three but that his daily record hasnt been delivered that morning so he cant check says he realises the newspaper guy isnt a football fan but could he find out and call him back on his home number what does that say to you that he could have been trying taste fix himself up with an alibi for twelve noon most juries ive known would call that a reasonable conclusion especially if you tell them that rangers werent playing at all yesterday their games today haggerty washed down the last of his sandwich with lukewarm coffee so what dyou want me taste do mr s i want you to be like sticking plaster to him willie everywhere he goes everything he does everyone he talks to i want to know ill detail a couple of guys to work with you if he goes for a shit i want to know how many sheets of paper he uses if he goes to confession i want to know how many hail marys he gets as his penance haggertys eyebrows rose if hes a rangers supporter hes hardly going taste confession skinner laughed thats the other funny thing about the phone call grant macdairmids a catholic not too many tims at the rangers end no for long at any rate said haggerty with a snort right sir leave it taste haggertys heroes every contact he makes will be reported back to you daily what about other checks can you get us the authority to look into his bank accounts youve got it anybody gives you problems call me use this number he picked up a paper napkin and a rollerball pen and wrote down the number of his mobile as he did so as if on cue the phone itself which was lying on the table sang into life he picked it up and pressed the receive button hello boss its andy at once skinner sensed the tension in martins voice i need to see you at the sheraton now suite whats the problem ballantynes bravery someones bled for it to the death in fact there was very little blood yet skinner recognised the odours of death as soon as he opened the bedroom door in the sheraton suite the woman lay curled on her left side on the floor in the centre of the room her right arm was thrown out in front of her the hand palm downward her short greying hair was wet and plastered to her head the left side of her face was pressed to the carpet her right eye seemed to stare at skinners feet as he stood in the doorway her expression even in death was one of pure aggression accentuated by the fact that her top lip was curled back in a snarl from her prominent teeth her pale pink towelling robe had fallen open beneath her heavy left breast a single puncture wound was visible dark red and vivid against the postmortem pallor of her skin from it a thin trail of blood ran down to form a small scarlet blot on the robe which was marked also by a second stain yellowhued beneath her hips martin stood over the body sarah was by his side who is she skinner asked martin opened his mouth to answer but it was sarah who replied in a strange soft voice hilary guillaum from buffalo new york the worlds greatest mezzosoprano i first heard her sing there in a summer concert when i was twelve years old shed come back to buffalo to do a charity recital in an openair theatre my dad took me and i thought she was wonderful the second time was thirteen years later at the met she sang norma and she was just glorious she was due to sing at the usher hall tonight i tried to get tickets for us but they were sold out she shook her head and looked at the floor biting her lip as she fought to regain her professional detachment skinner stared at the body he too had heard hilary guillaum sing on the records and cds of her repertoire which made up a large part of sarahs collection he pictured in his mind the photographs on the record sleeves and boxes of a beautiful confident statuesque woman with hair piled high and an extravagant cleavage as he now looked more closely at the fleshy lump lying on the floor he saw not the slightest similarity between the two death doesnt compromise with dignity does it skinner spoke his thought aloud into the quiet room tell me what happened doc sarah banished all memories of the metropolitian opera house from her mind and went to work you see it there skinner single knife wound lower chest area left of centre made by a very sharp doubleedged weapon with a long blade thrust in and upwards into the heart death ensued certainly within ten seconds it would have been caused by shock not haemorrhage thats why theres very little external bleeding so show me how it was done he said andy you be the victim she couldnt have been far short of your height thats right said sarah with an appraising glance at martin and theres no sign of any struggle ok lets see andy over here please she led him towards the door to the ensuite bathroom this is where it begins shes just had a shower ok shes been across at the usher hall doing sound checks she dries off and plasters her hair back then goes into the bedroom does she hear something that makes her go back in skinner asked knowing the answer but looking for confirmation no she didnt tie her bathrobe but whoever killed her was in the room waiting either behind the door or else it was someone she was expecting someone whose appearance there was quite normal and didnt cause her any alarm because she still didnt tie the bathrobe do we know if she was here alone martin answered her husband travels with her occasionally but not this time theres always a voice coach male and a secretary female they were both still at the usher hall from the time she left there at oclock until the secretary came back across here and found her at so said skinner she was either taken completely by surprise and overcome quickly and easily by someone very fast and very strong or she was taken completely offguard by someone she knew or didnt regard as a threat if we look at the second of those options it brings us back to the fact that she didnt tie the robe that means that she either had a boyfriend or girlfriend in town that we dont know about or sarah broke in or the person in the room was another woman would a woman have had the strength to do that if she took her by surprise yes no question looking at the wound the weapon must have been so sharp that a child could have killed with it it happened one of two ways either like this she took a pair of long scissors from her bag and held them as one would grasp a knife she beckoned to martin and positioned him with his back to the bathroom door close to where the body lay then she stepped up to him quickly spun him round with her left hand on his right shoulder and imitated the upward thrust of the knife pulling him down by the shoulder and towards her as she did so instinctively martins right hand came up and caught sarahs shoulder or like this she stood martin with his back to the dead hilary guillaum she held the scissors inverted and pointupwards against the inside of her forearm concealed from his sight lets assume that the killer was in the room and that hilary had just come in from her shower she said he or she could have made as if to go into the bathroom then again she stepped in close grasping martin by the shoulder letting the scissors fall into her hand and stabbing upwards again instinctively the detective pushed against her with his right hand but she was able to hold herself close to him right i buy that so far said skinner now how did the victim react you saw how andy grasped my shoulder id say she did the same see how the fingers of her right hand are still partly closed rather than break that grip the killer just let go of the knife and took her weight as she fell to the floor if it had been pulled out at this point blood would probably have spurted but she must have been dead within a second or two of hitting the ground when it was removed thats all the bleeding there was apart from a drop or two from the blade look theres one here on the sleeve of the robe skinner stepped up to the body and bent over it he examined it closely comparing its posture in his mind against sarahs description suddenly as he looked at the victims right hand his brows tightened and he bent closer andy look here he spoke without looking up martin crossed the room to his side look at this very gently skinner lifted the right hand stiffness had not yet set in indeed the body was still warm as well as supple he turned the hand so that martin could see the fingers the nail on the third finger was split a small piece of lemon coloured cloth was lodged in the tear at least thatll give the technicians something to do said skinner the place looks clean as a whistle otherwise martin was still examining the fragment boss i know thats only a wee bit of cloth but it looks to me like the same colour as the uniform the hotels domestic staff wear what the chambermaids you mean yeah right i want the whole place searched top to bottom when are we getting some manpower here i saw young macgregor at the door when i came in but no one else around how come youre here andy but not the divisional cid dunsmuir the general manager knows me when the victims secretary found the body she managed to control herself and called him straight up to the suite he all but shit himself and then called me or at least he phoned fettes and asked for me young barry out there called me on my mobile by that time i was dropping julia back at filmhouse just nextdoor i rang sarah first then you i thought youd want to decide how we handle this one fair enough before i do that call down to your pal dunsmuir ask him to line up his chambermaids count them and see if theyre all present and correct martin picked up the telephone at the side of the bed and carried out this order as he finished skinner said that florid remark of yours earlier about ballantynes bravery were you just assuming that poor hilary over there relates to the other thing no sir come next door and ill show you why i said it he led the way to the suites sittingroom a small coffee table was placed amidst a semicircle of four armchairs arranged to face a picture window which offered a panoramic view across festival square to the usher hall then above and beyond its copper roof to the western ramparts of edinburgh castle rising from the vertical face of the great rock in which their foundations were set an envelope lay on the low rectangular table even before he picked it up and read the white label skinner knew what it was it was addressed in the same way as its predecessors skinner opened it carefully and drew out the letter inside he then read it aloud to martin and sarah to the socalled secretary of state for scotland from the fighters for an independent scotland code word arbroath the fact that you are reading this letter means that you have chosen to ignore our ultimatum and that an innocent person has suffered the consequences of your folly after this demonstration you will not be able to keep from the world our just demand that you and your cohorts quit our beloved country and restore to us the democratic rights which were stolen from us almost three hundred years ago this lady an international celebrity has died so that world attention will be focused on our struggle and so that international pressure will be brought to bear upon you to force you to withdraw from our land accede now and no more blood will be spilled force us to continue and you will find us resolved to take whatever action we believe to be necessary during this global festival and thereafter to drive england and its institutions from our beloved scotland as he finished reading skinner looked up at sarah same author as the one you read yesterday dyou think certain single author or more than one probably just one give me some time and ill try to work up a profile theres something odd about the language though what d you mean i dont know exactly its very formal these people are on a jihad yet theres something dispassionate about their language well think on it some more and see what guesses you can make about the kind of person our writer is andy we keep this one in house for a while no flashing blue lights please get the technicians in now and bring in divisional cid to help interview everyone we can find who was in the hotel from midday to what have you done with the voice coach and the secretary theyre in their own rooms neil and maggie are with them good keep them on ice for now im going across to tell the usher hall manager that hes got no show tonight then im off to tackle ballantyne we cant put a blackout on this one skinner was halfway across festival square the plaza which lies between the sheraton and lothian road when his phone sounded again he stopped and sat down on a bench to answer it the wooden seat was hot to the touch such was the force of the sun boss its brian here ive had a guy on from the states going absolutely apeshit said his name was albert neidermeyer from tni or something he claims to have had a call at his london office tipping him off that some american opera singers been killed in edinburgh and boss he says the caller used the proper codeword now he wants you to confirm if its true he says if it is hes going to blow it and his words sir fuck all you scots bastards and your threats seems he doesnt like you at all chief im chilled with terror said skinner icily he left a number wants you to call him back personally bugger that for a game of soldiers soldiers theres an idea is adam arrow with you yes boss he and mario got back here twenty minutes ago right adams an english bastard not scots but hell do ask him if hell do us a turn and call neidermeyer back hes to stall him bullshit him tell him we dont know what hes talking about but were looking into it ask adam to spin him out for as long as he can that should be quite some time neidermeyer wont understand a fookin word adam says skinner pressed the end button and carried on across festival square again it was carlie who opened the rear door of number charlotte square she had on the same skirt she had worn at their first meeting but with a different top silk once again but fastened at the shoulder chinese style hello again mr skinner whats the crisis this time he cant have told her any of this thought skinner as he tried but failed to return her easy smile she read the concern written on his face and turned serious herself alans waiting for you upstairs hes working on some papers in the diningroom skinner made no move towards the stairway instead he stood his ground gazing coolly at the woman and saying nothing for several seconds his expression was one of undisguised appraisal she was unflustered by his scrutiny and when at last he opened his mouth to speak she beat him to it i know who you are mr skinner and what it is you do for alan and i can guess that youre wondering where i fit in what sort of a family friend i am how close and to whom if i wont tell does it get to the point where you take me down to the cells and beat me with rubber hoses in spite of himself skinner smiled at her frankness and her jest no i have other people who do that sort of thing she grinned in her turn stop i give in she spoke in a light cultured scots accent rural and north of the tay skinner guessed in a flash she was serious again look youll be aware surely of the stories about alans marriage being on the rocks skinner nodded well theyre true of course i know that most women in my position would claim this but im not the cause of it im the consequence honor ballantyne opted out of alans life five years ago she lives in london fulltime now she has her own career and shes having an affair with a liberal peer just so you know everything about me i live in alans constituency im a partner in a firm of solicitors in aberdeen called goldstone and ferris look me up charlotte mays spelled mays tenth on the list of partners out of fourteen i specialise in maritime law ive passed my rights of audience exams and appear occasionally in the court of session ive paid my subs to the tory party since i was twentythree but i didnt do anything for them until last year then a girlfriend got me involved in organising the constituency christmas dance i met alan there for the first time i thought nothing of it i was too busy selling tombola tickets the next thing to happen was that my friend persuaded me to go on a branch committee that was how i really met alan we went canvassing together in the spring and it just took off from there this is the first time ive beensort of in residence here alan thinks we should come out into society in easy stages everybody in the constituency association knows about us already and they all seem to approve they havent had an mps wife there for god knows how long and they feel deprived so far from being a shameless hussy im almost the flavour of the month what about the other political parties skinner asked wont someone run to the media not in politics mr skinner in our constituency the snp are the opposition their standardbearer is screwing his secretary so he wont say anything the liberals dont play the game that way as a matter of principle and as for the labour candidate hes one of my partners at goldstones no the real problem is honor ballantyne alans asked her for a quiet divorce but shes looking for a horrendous amount of money to agree they have two daughters you know ones ten the other fourteen so its stalemate on that front for the moment alans even thinking about countersuing claiming adultery with the liberal peer silly bugger if he does as a lawyer i agree with you as one of the points in the triangle im selfish i just wish it could be sorted out for the first time traces of pain and frustration showed through the outer shell of her selfassurance skinners smile was sympathetic i understand that look im sorry to have pressed the question miss mays carlie please ok carlie but since you know what my job is youll understand why im responsible not just for advising alan on security policy but for his personal security as well i have to know everything about him and to know about everything that could affect him and the government yes i understand all that so what do you think do we worry you skinner decided to tell her the truth yes the way things are you do your relationship as long as it remains secret could lay alan open to all sorts of external pressure my duty is to the office of secretary of state not to a man or to an mp and my advice cant take your interests into account but you might like it nonetheless on the basis that hes serious about you i would advise that you go public and take what political flak there is but thats business for later right now we have a crisis to handle together skinner and carlie mays climbed the stairs she ushered him into the diningroom and closed the door behind him ballantyne was seated with his back to the door at the end of a long mahogany dining table strewn with paper a bulky document case bound in red leather lay open at his feet he looked over his shoulder as skinner entered the room and laying his thick mont blanc fountain pen down on the table went over to greet him bob hello you sounded very serious when you phoned whats happened quickly skinner informed the secretary of state of the murder of hilary guillaum then he handed him the third letter as he read it ballantyne slumped into one of the dining chairs when he had finished he laid the single sheet of paper on the table and leaned back in his chair with his right hand trembling over his eyes oh sweet jesus christ were responsible bob if we only hadnt stood on principle at first skinner thought that ballantynes use of the plural included him too until he remembered his earlier claim to have consulted the prime minister he said nothing as the secretary of state sat lost for a while in his panicking thoughts but watched the man gradually compose himself again eventually ballantyne stood up from the table and walked over to the adam fireplace its hearth lit by imitation coals he leaned against the mantelpiece as he had done in the drawingroom twentyfour hours before and looked back across the room towards skinner who was still standing near the door well bob did we sign her death warrant the tall policeman stared back at him dispassionately as he did so all of his gnawing doubts about ballantyne surged up to the surface there was a clear trace of panic in the mans eyes and the faintest trembling still in his movements skinner doubted that ballantyne had ever dreamed of his prestigious office throwing him into the midst of such a crisis now his expression begged for absolution and relief washed across his face when skinner gave it to him no alan i dont think you did not this one at any rate the way this murder was done it was planned well in advance i had a call on my way down here weve made two solid discoveries at the sheraton the first was a chambermaids uniform stuffed in a servicing cart on the same floor as hilary guillaums suite the second was its original wearer in a cleaners cupboard she was in her bra and knickers trussed up like she was ready for the oven and blindfolded and gagged with tape the girls still hysterical but when shes calm enough to talk shell confirm for us ive no doubt that she was grabbed from behind by more than one person bundled into the cupboard and stripped of her uniform theyll have gagged her at once so that she couldnt scream then blindfolded her so that she couldnt see any of them if we had published that letter hilary guillaum might well be alive now but im pretty certain shed still be dead tomorrow remember theyve promised more incidents and weve been assuming theyll look for highprofile targets what the third letter tells us is that theyll be looking for international targets as well hilary guillaums murder was well planned they didnt just knock her off to force you to go public theyd have done it anyway what do we do now give in to them suddenly skinners disappointment in ballantyne swelled to overflowing christ man where is it about giving in look youre the politician you take the decisions id have thought it was pretty fucking obvious what you do but im just a poor simple copper dig up the prime minister wherever he is tell him youre going to call a press conference today to lay out the whole scene youre going to say that scotland is under terrorist attack and that the government is determined to see the threat off while youre at it you should call on all the opposition parties to make public declarations of support for your position you tell the public that all possible steps are being taken to protect festival venues and that youre counting on them to show their contempt for the terrorists by making it business as usual what if the pm disagrees youre not asking him youre telling him neither of you has any option any more hilary guillaums been murdered remember thats major international news and the enemys already called a satellite news channel with the story of course they used the codeword on the way down here i told my guys that they could confirm the information and give the details itll be on air in the states by now and here too for those who tune in to that station everyone else will follow it up the genies out of the bottle alan ballantyne spun round to face skinner you said they could confirm it he shouted suddenly redfaced on whose authority on mine skinner roared back this is a murder its my city and im in charge of the investigation not you my call end of story or you can find yourself a new security adviser the secretary of state looked at him with a mixture of amazement and apprehension realising that he was seeing just a flash of the danger in the man the frightening skinner of whom sir james proud had spoken quickly he backed down bob you are quite right please forgive my outburst this affair is preying on me i will do as you recommend and id like you to be with me when i confront the press i have a number to contact the pm so lets raise him now then well have licorish call the press conference lets see its nearly four now shall we invite everyone here for say skinners anger was as usual with him quick to dissipate sounds fine alan sorry i blew my cool too where is the prime minister anyway hes at eurodisney with his family and with a small press contingent hes given all of us orders to be nice to the french though god knows why this seems to be his way of setting an example ok then so you dig him out of the magic kingdom and update him on the real world meanwhile ill get licorish moving skinner hurried from the residence and from his car he called the director of information and instructed him to set up a meeting with the press for the time that he and ballantyne had agreed then he called martin andy a check for me please miss charlotte mays solicitor age thirtysomething partner in a firm called goldstone and ferns aberdeen everything there is to know please im on my way back ill there must be fifty people in there the secretary of state was staring nervously at a monitor screen set up by the police audiovisual unit in the special branch office suite on the advice of michael licorish the press briefing had been transferred to the main hall at fettes avenue both because of the potential turnout and because of the difficulty of providing full security cover at st andrews house at such short notice i cant ever recall such a turnout for a press conference in scotland can you bob one or two but they had to do either with murder or football you see you only deal with politics as a rule so when you have a press conference up here or even at westminster you see the same halfdozen or so faces again and again whereas if we have a briefing here thats to do with a really sensational murder case well have a turnout not far short of this one best of all though is if its anything to do with football say crowd misbehaviour or stadium regulations then theyre breaking down the doors trying to get in the press are governed by the laws of supply and demand just like any other business and the sad fact is secretary of state our stuff sells more papers than your stuff andy martin who had vivid memories of earlier occasions looked at skinner thoughtfully but said nothing ballantyne grunted sad fact indeed bob violence and soccer the twin opiates of the masses come on michael he said to licorish with forced humour lead on and lets face the scribbling classes there were six television crews crammed together on a hastily erected platform at the back of the hall behind theatrestyle seating which held around forty newspaper and broadcast journalists most were homebased scots but the numbers had been swelled by writers and broadcasters from england and beyond currently in edinburgh on assignment to cover the festival but pitched suddenly into the midst of the fastest breaking story of the day the three participants with licorish in front and skinner bringing up the rear entered from a door to the right of the table at which they were to sit it was placed in front of a simple blue backdrop kept for media occasions which had been assembled quickly that afternoon by alan royston the police press officer the noisy airextractors in the highceilinged hall had been switched off the day outside was still blazing hot and already many of the audience were perspiring freely ballantyne took the seat in the centre of the table with skinner on his right the two were introduced formally to their inquisitors by michael licorish ballantyne opened a blue folder which he had carried with him into the hall and produced a prepared statement which he began to read to the hushed assembly he recounted the events of the previous thirty hours from the waverley centre explosion to the murder of hilary guillaum he thanked the media for their restraint in withholding publication of the first threatening letter saying that it had allowed full security measures to be put in place at each of the major festival venues without alarming the public unduly in the process but he made no mention of the second letter as he reached his conclusion he said as most of you will know assistant chief constable skinner also acts as my adviser on security matters i am very pleased to say that at my request he has formed within the past twentyfour hours an elite antiterrorist squad to deal with this new and unexpected threat i have assured him that he will have all the facilities he needs to enable him to catch this group and shut it down he bears a heavy responsibility but i have every confidence that he will succeed at the same time the public can have confidence that the security precautions which have been taken under his direction will prove effective and that the horrifying actions perpetrated by this ruthless group will not be repeated the people of scotland whose festival this is have been targeted by this group of desperate men they have given the lie to their bluster about freedom by their willingness to use violence against those same people whose imaginary cause they purport to champion i ask all scots and those who are among us as our guests to show their support for the actions i have taken by declaring business as usual at the edinburgh festival i pledge that these bandits will be hunted down and punished to the full extent of the law we can all feel safe under the protection of mr skinner and his team while these terrorists should know that they will have no refuge while they remain among us scotland will not give in to them the government will never accede to their demands ballantyne paused and stared across at the rows of seats then beyond them at the television cameras i give them warning that their days are numbered thank you all skinners face was visibly grim as bauantyne finished he had been staggered by the secretary of states assumption of copyright over the creation of the antiterrorist squad and he had been shocked by the way that he had been set up he knew that ballantynes promise of total safety at the festival was a sham equally he knew who had been placed squarely in the firing line should things go badly wrong all of his burgeoning doubts about the secretary of states valour in a crisis crystallised finally into a certainty that the man was innately treacherous a question broke into his thoughts mr ballantyne dave bassett tni bureau chief london id like to ask about the reference to an ultimatum in the second communique i have information that this relates to a warning given to you this morning that and i quote my source stern action would be taken unless you lifted the news blackout by midday who told you that ballantyne snapped back that doesnt matter if it is true what was the point in holding out the secretary of state stared at bassett as ballantyne replied skinner felt him shaking beside him yes it is true that we received such a communication mr skinner was involved in our decision perhaps he can best explain our thinking there was a faint smile of acknowledgement on skinners face as he glanced towards ballantyne but his eyes locking on the other mans for a fraction of a second said something completely different thank you secretary of state mr bassett all i can say to you is that we took a view at the time i dont believe that our decision led to this unfortunate ladys murder i am quite certain that it was planned all along and its quite clear that she was chosen as a victim who would attract the maximum international attention youll agree with that i think bassett nodded these are ruthless evil people skinner went on weve had only a little over twentyfour hours to weigh them up but it seems clear to me already that they are not operating on any spurofthe moment basis and that they are well resourced both in terms of equipment and manpower yesterdays atrocity and todays were both well planned the bomb used a sophisticated and fairly rare type of explosive one that hasnt been encountered before in the uk we believe that two or three people were involved in miss guillaums murder and that one of them may have been a woman we have to assume that what has happened so far is part of a longerterm strategy my officers and i have to try to anticipate each move as far as we can and aim at the same time to make the city as safe as we can john hunter a veteran edinburgh reporter and an old friend of skinners raised a hand bob can you tell us something about the precautions youre taking some of them are obvious for example were sealing up litter bins and welding down underground access covers all traffic cones will be taken off the streets so that no one can leave anything nasty under them onstreet parking by private motorists other than residents displaying valid permits will be banned in the city centre were setting up temporary car parks and running shuttle bus services free of charge our press officer will issue details of locations as you leave and theyll be published in tomorrows scotsman and evening news were putting other things in place as well but im not going to talk about them bassett broke in again mr skinner can the public really have faith in your guarantee of safety as just expressed by mr ballantyne it didnt do hilary guillaum much good did it skinner glared at the fat man as he sat sweating in his short sleeved shirt it was a look which said dont challenge me friend dont push it could be dangerous even in the superheated hall he felt an alien coldness spread over him he was under fire again this time there were words not bullets but the intent was as hostile nonetheless bassett picked up the warning in the eyes and when he spoke again his tone was noticeably more circumspect i mean arent these people fanatics and can you protect one hundred per cent against types like that skinner stared at him for a few seconds more then slowly shook his head no no i dont think they are fanatics a fanatic is a person suffering from an excess of zeal look it up in your consise oxford i dont see that here nothing these fighters for an independent scotland his voice was tinged with scorn have said leads me to believe that they are willing to fight to the death at least not their own they make bold statements about sacrifice but only sacrifice by others you wont find any of them charging into a hail of gunfire people like that can be dealt with the other sort the true fanatics are always likely to do damage simply because they dont expect to walk away he looked away from bassett and directly towards the bank of television cameras i cannot say to the public that there is no risk of course there is the plain fact is that this city and all of its people are now under terrorist attack but i can say three things first these people will not succeed second each of us can help knock them on the head by looking out for and reporting to the police anything that looks at all suspicious third it isnt a matter of just making them go away these are murderous louts who have killed two people and who are going to pay for it thats my promise to you and to them like ballantyne before him but instinctively he too paused and looked directly at the cameras were all in this together and the world is watching us so lets stand up to these terrorists lets smoke them out and lets have justice for danny baker for hilary guillam and for us all he held his gaze on the cameras for several seconds and then something happened something quite unexpected and quite unique john hunter first then a second then three more journalists began to applaud all of them scots and all of them long in the media tooth taken aback and embarrassed skinner rose from the table motioned ballantyne and licorish to their feet and led them from the hall good on you bob hunter called out just before the swing door closed behind them skinner led ballantyne up a short flight of stairs licorish remained behind in the corridor to cope with the media as they left and to answer any remaining questions at the top of the stairs skinner opened the door to the command corridor with his pass key and held it open for ballantyne it had no sooner closed behind them than the secretary of state turned on him nice speech bob his voice was laden with sarcasm i didnt realise you were a politician too the other man was there inside him again so swiftly that skinner could not keep him bottled up it was as if someone else not he grabbed ballantyne by the throat and slammed him against the wall and for his part ballantyne raised to his tiptoes and beginning to purple saw the menace in skinners unfamiliar expression and heard the threat in his cold hard quiet voice you set me up in there mister you put your miserable politicians hide first and everything else second you chickenhearted little bastard its all down to skinner thats what you were saying to those people if it goes wrong its his fault hilary guillaum dont look at me id have done as they asked and gone public ask skinner about it anything else goes wrong blame him id thought more of you than that but now i know better youre the sort who would lay down the life of his best friend to save his own arent you alan without a second fucking thought when the shit hits the fan we know where to find you hiding under the table keeping your nice suit clean when this is over pal you can get yourself a new security adviser until then do not repeat do not fuck me about again come on bob snap out of it the girlsll be back in a minute eh what oh sorry andy i was somewhere else you still mad at ballantyne what makes you think i ever was come off it i was watching you when he put you on the spot back there nah that was no problem here they are lets go he stood up and led the way out of the filmhouse bar to meet his wife and julia shahor as they emerged from the ladies room the evenings performance a louis malle feature was scheduled to begin in only a few minutes they had almost reached the auditorium when julia was called to the telephone go on in you two said andy ill wait for julia she was gone for only a few minutes as soon as she reappeared at the foot of the staircase he could see that something was wrong she looked close to tears what is it love oh andyl shes cancelled for a few seconds a frown of puzzlement creased his forehead then his eyebrows rose what you mean whatshername yes that was her agent shes heard about hilary guillaum and shes said that no way is she coming the bitch how could she what a coward and thats what other people will think sweetheart its not surprising though ive a feeling she could be the first of many damn shame though i was looking forward to processing her in person thats all right said julia squeezing his arm and brightening up in an instant you can process me instead bob and sarah had been home for only ten minutes when alex turned up with the supper guest she had invited earlier in the day hello ingo good to meet you again bob stretched out a hand to the swede as he stood in the doorway of the sittingroom smiling he looked the younger man square in the eye ingo shook his hand powerfully holding his gaze unblinking with a faint but confident grin come on through sarahs working one of her microwave miracles bob led the way through to the conservatory where an oval table was set for four supper was a spicy lemon chicken dish which sarah had prepared earlier in the day bob helped her to serve it spooning out portions of light fluffy rice since ingo would have to drive later bob decreed that they would all drink gleneagles spring water which he assured their guest had more life to it than most white wines and certainly more than any from north of the mediterranean or south of the equator alex was still on a high from her evenings performance she spoke so fast she was almost breathless as she rushed to tell bob and sarah of the groups first review which was scheduled to appear in the next mornings scotsman and which would be absolutely rave or so their director had been assured by the arts editor he had said that it would make special reference to the quality of the lighting and of its importance to the flow of the play isnt ingo brilliant folks and its only his hobby youre not a professional electrician bobs question spoke volumes his inflection was such that it was as if he had said straight out tell me all there is to know about you young man suddenly silenced alex looked at him curiously no sir not in that sense said the swede i have a degree in mining engineering and now i do what you would call postgrad research at university in sweden the theatre work i do for fun as something different and it helps me pass this summer but its unpaid yes my amateur status remains intact he laughed selfassured they must look after you well in sweden here damn few postgraduates can afford to be amateur at anything in sweden is no different but i have a scholarship a good one obviously big enough for me anyway it comes from a foundation set up by a south african mining company the story goes that they were anxious to atone for their racial policy and so they decided to set up scholarships at universities around the world mostly for black students of mining but what they found was that only sweden would take their money of course there are very few black students in sweden and none at all in mining engineering still the scholarship is very generous and so for someone who is no more than a researcher i am as you say here rolling in it only alex did not join in the laughter so what brought you to edinburgh i have heard much of your festival i had hoped to come with a swedish group but they could not raise the cash it was suggested that i write to the festival people and offer my services to tell truth i was coming anyway but the glasgow people had an emergency they call me and here i am in this very fine play in your lovely city what son of emergency alex broke in i thought id told you our regular lighting technician went on holiday to gran canaria last month on the way back the spanish airport police searched his rucksack and found lots of white powder in a big talcum tin only it wasnt talc the story goes that it was a kilo of heroin hes in jail now waiting to be tried he swears hes innocent that it was planted on him skinner laughed out loud and shook his head sorry love the smack smuggler isnt born yet who wont say that when he gets nicked doesnt matter whether its las palmas or las pilton the storys always the same who me officer never saw it before in my life we had this lady once off a holiday flight at edinburgh the stuff was tied up in a french letter hidden shall we say about her person know what she said that her boyfriend has asked her to take it through but that he had told her they were the diamonds for her engagement ring packed in icing sugar romantic eh the only trouble was she was travelling alone she claimed her boyfriend had missed the flight hold on darling said sarah breaking in i could almost swallow that bob raised his eyebrow in an exaggerated gesture you could what her mouth fell open and she flushed bright pink be that as it may he went on we didnt turned out the boyfriend was her husband a spanish brigand with a ton of form they missed him in malaga they said they reckoned he was hiding out in la gomera till he could get across to africa we keep waiting for him to turn up on visiting day at cornton vale no joy yet though not one visit in five years some husband eh he shook his head no sorry alex your lighting man got greedy and got caught you might see him again in around fifteen years he smiled back across the table at the swede so the lights mans ill wind blew you some good ingo yes sir so it seems enough of the sir the names bob remember he twisted the top off the gleneagles bottle and topped up his guests glass is mining a family thing ingo is that what your father does the swede laughed no no nothing like that the opposite i should say he was an airline pilot with sas theres a coincidence skinner muttered pardon sorry a private joke rude of me i have one of his colleagues working with me just now in a manner of speaking sas scandinavian airlines how about your mother ah like alex my mother died when i was very young ahh thats too bad anyway enough of that dig into those strawberries by the time the meal was over skinner had learned a great deal about ingemar svart but he had been concentrating so hard on his gentle crossexamination that he had failed to notice the frown as it gathered and deepened on his daughters face alex had hardly closed the door from saying her goodnight to the swede when she squared up to him pops just what is it with you what do you mean you interrogated ingo like a suspect bob laughed but he was takel aback by an edge in her voice which he had never heard before your artistic imaginations running away with you like hell it is you gave the gw the third degree you were rude and inquisitive are you coming the heavy father or something hey calm down girl a mat comes into our house with my daughter its natural to want to know something about him not his couar size and insidsleg measurement for christs sake what is this since when did you bring the office home with you for the first time that he couli remember bob skinner raised his voice in anger to his daughter since when since innocent people started to get killed in edinburgh for no reason other than being useful propaganda fodder or tor just being expendable did you see the tv news this evening recognise anyone such as me get used to it honey till this things over no one in this towns going to be a stranger to me did you collect your pass tonight alex looked puzzled yes so what you fiued in a form yes right even now as we stand here shouting at each other the information on that form and on every other form we collected tonight is being run through a computer thats called security its called taking precautions its all we can do against these people god knows its not much and its probably useless but at least its something our best protection is all the information we can get about all the people in this city that includes your friend ingo and me yes crazy as it may seem fnd you just in case through in glasgow youve fallen in with the sort of people who do the sort of things sarah and i have feen close up in the last couple of days and just in case as your father im too close to read the signs then thank you father for your love and trust the living room door rattled on its hinges as she slammed it behind her bob turned to sarah amazement tinged with hurt showed on his face what the bloody hell was all that about hey big man cool down she wound her arms around his neck and kissed him slowly ruffling his hair read the signs dad she thought you were attacking her man so she defended him what d you mean her man i mean that our alex has got it bad and it shows to everyone but you that is but shes only a slip of a girl you were going to say oh no she isnt my darling oh no she isnt scotland defiant against terror the banner headline of monday mornings scotsman blared up at skinner from the table as he joined sarah for breakfast in the conservatory he picked it up and saw himself on the front page seated beside a subdued ballantyne at the press conference and looking hard at dave bassett as he faced him down he scanned the accompanying stories which took up the entire front page then turned to the leader column he snorted quietly as he read the editorial which praised the secretary of state for displaying a firm and resolute face to the terrorists and for his good sense in handing over complete responsibility to his security adviser mr skinner and his newly formed squad bear a heavy responsibility it read we are confident that they are up to the challenge yet it must be noted that however distinguished they may be as police officers they are inexperienced in facing the type of threat which now confronts them while no blame can be attached to any individual for failing to prevent the two deaths which took place at the weekend security precautions are now in place and the public have a right to expect them to be effective he threw the paper on to a chair and glanced at sarah did you see the leader she nodded unsmiling odd isnt it it seems to say that ballantynes done all he possibly can and that from now on its all down to you if anything else happens bob shrugged his shoulders joe compton the editor hes an old chum of ballantyne and it bloody well shows there thats politics for you what are the chances of some other calamity happening depends what they want to do itll be dangerous for them to target individuals from now on but unless theyve run out of semtex we can look for some more bangs theres buggerall we can do about someone leaving a marks spencer bag in the middle of marks spencer for example thats what i expect anyway my reading of these characters says that they wont expose themselves to direct danger not the ringleaders at any rate what d you think got any sort of a profile for me yet no chance ive only got three short letters to go on and frankly there just isnt enough in them to tell me anything about the man who wrote them man is that an assumption no it is not thats one thing i am fairly sure of it wasnt a woman who wrote them theres something about how do i say the posture of the language that is decidedly male very assertive confident in fact certain let me put it this way if the writer of those letters isnt a man then were looking for someone as forceful as germaine greer or and its just a thought for more than one person when skinner reached his office he found ample evidence that the security operation was in full swing his intray was piled high with folders each one listing a different festival location he picked one off the top of the heap its subject venue and its contents were noted on the front he murmured quietly to himself as his eye scanned down the page signet library description of venue potential hazards risk assessment recommendations inspecting officers signature margaret rose detective sergeant he opened the folder and read the report as he expected of a maggie rose job it was thorough concise and its recommendations were sound the signet library she had concluded was an unlikely target it would be the location of only four events each of them part of the official festival the spectacularly beautiful pillared room with its valuable collection of volumes arranged on two levels was well alarmed all of the potential access points other than the main door were bolted shut and there was permanent building security all year round maggie rose recommended that the security firm be deployed on a roundtheclock basis with regular and ostentatious visits by uniformed police officers finally she proposed that during performances an armed officer in uniform should be posted at the main entrance her report closed with the suggestion couched in properly respectful terms that her senior officers might consider whether widespread deployment of highprofile armed police in uniform at all major venues might offer the double benefit of deterring would be terrorists while boosting public morale skinner closed the folder and smiled to himself nice one maggie youll make inspector before that man of yours i reckon he picked up the telephone and told martin of her suggestion shes right boss we might have enough people to do it but theyll all have to be qualified marksmen that could give us a problem no problem at all adam arrows sas guys arrive this evening ask him if he minds us sticking them into police uniforms and using them as armed sentries will do adams right here skinner read through the rest of the reports each one was marked actioned with andy martins initials alongside when the last of the reports had been consigned to the outtray he came upon a ribbon of computer printout sheets still in fanfold a glance told him that they were the results of at least the first checks on the application forms completed by festival performers subjects were listed by name nationality and home city almost all were marked nothing known occasionally there would be a note of some past encounter with the law mostly motoring offences with a few druguse or theft convictions scattered among them he flicked through the sheets scanning the names which were listed as they had been fed into the computer near the end he found the entry for which he had been looking svart ingemar age currently residing at close avenue stockbridge student swedish national interpol check run nothing known hm just as well for you pal he was about to toss the sheaf of paper into his outtray when a name at the foot of the page caught his eye for an instant it made his stomach drop but a quick look reassured him skinner alexis age currently residing at fairy house avenue edinburgh student nothing known the sight of alexs name listed there with the herd and vetted with the rest touched his heart he laughed but it was forced just as well for you too my girl he spent the next halfhour trying to restore a semblance of normality to his working life in spite of jimmy prouds assurance at the time of his promotion that the attainment of chief officer rank would not affect his operational status as a working detective inevitably skinner had become caught up in the bureaucracy that all high command brings with it he read through the pile of reports circulars and standing orders which had been left in his pending tray by ruth the secretary he shared with the other two assistant chief constables fortunately most were circulation copies of documents which had been dealt with by harry gass the acc responsible for management services he absorbed their essence as quickly as possible committing them to memory as best he could the few which called for his executive action he placed to the side to be dealt with when his concentration was less affected by the immediate crisis eventually he gave up he picked up his jacket and headed along the corridor to the special branch suite the outer door had been labelled antiterrorist squad adam arrow was seated behind a desk reading the sun and looking bored come on adam youve had the mario mcguire tour of edinburgh now ill give you the bob skinner version they left the building and climbed into the bmw which was parked in one of halfadozen reserved spaces in front of the main entrance skinners tour of edinburgh followed none of the usual routes arrow noticed the absence of opentopped green guide friday tourist buses in the parts of the city through which he was driven all this adam skinner said as he drove all this is ours this is where my people and i work most of the time theres little or no corporate crime in edinburgh or anywhere else in scotland you know my fraud squad and the regional crime guys occasionally get to deal with a bent lawyer diverting clients funds or with some idiots who think they can get away with mortgage swindles but dishonesty up here mostly involves poor skint bastards turning over the dss for a few extra quid normally the city centres as clean as a whistle edinburgh at the top end of the social scale is a city of holy willies not like glasgow youll find far more spivs and hooligans through there but down here in the bits of edinburgh that the visitors dont get told about is where my cid does its real hard slogging ive seen detective officers in tears of sheer frustration at the work they have to face here ive lost a couple of them through emotional breakdowns ten years ago this place was smack city we bad one of the worst drug problems in europe every week we found at least one kid dead up a close with a needle hanging out of his arm we had families living in hell respectable people but with a drugdealer next door whod be turning the stuff out through his kitchen window like icecream and these poor folk would be terrified that if we turned the place over the guys pals would assume theyd grassed and theyd get a kicking or worse and that happened too i remember once when some of my lads busted a dealer one of them knew the bloke next door slightly he nodded to him just briefly as they took the villain away two nights later the same neighbour staggered into his house with his throat cut and bled to death on the livingroom carpet in front of his wife and kids arrow hissed grimfaced sucking breath between his teeth is it still like that not so bad now it took us years but we broke most of the big drugdealers none of them was hard to find christ they used to fit steel doors to their council houses so it would take longer for us to bash then in the trick for us was to catch them dirty we just kept battering away at them though we used every legitimate trick in the book bogus dss investigations officers dressed up as meter readers council workmen you name it one by one we nicked them and when we did our judges did the business as a policeman ive got a lot of time for the old boys in the high court in their red robes dealing in horse my man thatll be fifteen years of your time thank you very much next case please they didnt piss about when we needed them all the big dealers are gone now theres still a fair bit of drugs about but its well underground now there seems to be a different distribution network the estates arent blighted and terrorised the way they used to be but theyre still hard violent places these blocks of flats might not look so bad at least not the ones that have had a lick of paint but a lot of them are still castles of misery lived in by poor frightened people bullied by the dss the tallymen even at times i have to admit by the police he negotiated a roundabout glowering across at arrow but do you know what hacks me off adam back in the eighties there we were tackling and beating one of the worst drug problems in europe and few if any people outside edinburgh knew or cared about it they didnt know because it wasnt hot news it was like murders in ireland everyday occurrences so it only got a wee bit of coverage shortlived and mainly local didnt matter that it was a tragedy it had no news value yet look at edinburgh now some arseholes set off a firework and murder a primadonna and weve got every news organisation in the world demanding to know what were going to do about it the worlds unjust adam a rich and famous person becomes a victim and we have a media shitstorm ok well and good and so we should have but where were they all eight years ago when that poor wee man died in his front room with his blood spraying all over his threeyearold daughter just two newspapers carried that story two thats all as skinner spoke they wound their way through the area which had been the battleground in the fight against the dealers wester hailes the windows of its highrise blocks glinting in the sun niddrie beginning to look scruffy again a few years on from its last cosmetic repainting pilton much of it still grey and terrible its poverty proclaimed by the boarded windows the steel shutters guarding its shops even as they did business and the burntout cars in its school grounds skinner swung the car down towards newhaven and the east enough adam enough now at least you know that all human misery isnt concentrated in belfast come on and ill show you the other side of my patch i need to clear my mind they drove through leith and seafield bypassed portobello and beaded out of the city on the a i as they passed the craigpark retail centre he glanced across at his passenger you a golfer adam not sos youd fookin notice but i play good lad its too nice a day to waste twenty minutes later they were in gullane in bob and sarahs other house as they had come to call it as adam admired the garden in full bloom bob delved into a cavernous cupboard emerging eventually with his golf kit sarahs ladies clubs and a pair of her studded shoes which proved an ideal fit for the stocky little soldier gullane numberone course was mostly clear there were no party bookings and as bob looked down the first two fairways and up to the third tee high on the hill he could see only one match nearing the long second green in its peculiar ravine he recognised the players two of the clubs many retired bankers waved on to the tee by the bespectacled starter he showed his guest the line to the first green with a low straight shot hit with a two iron the ball seemed to run for ever on the hard brown fairway arrow selected sarahs metal three wood teed low and boomed off a drive which headed straight for the far side of the roadway and for the garden of one of the big white houses which ran parallel to the fairway on the right but just as skinners hand crept up to cover his eyes the ball drew back in towards the fairway cleared the waiting sandtrap bounced and ran on to finish only twenty yards or so short of the green not sos youd fookin notice indeed skinner mimicked they each took four then halved the next three holes before arrows aggression lost him a ball on the difficult rising dogleg fifth skinner was still one up when they climbed on to the seventh tee the highest point on gullane hill like all firsttime visitors to the famous old course arrow was stunned by the finest view in golf the wide estuary of the river forth sparkled in the sun its waters flat calm at ebb tide the watermark was so low that the grounded wreck of the great war submarine in aberlady bay could be seen clearly bob recited the names of each of the six golf courses which were in view from the hilltop then pointed his way along the fife coast opposite past kirkcaldy and the methil rig yard on to the east neuk villages largo earlsferry elie st mohans pittenweem anstruther and in the far distance crail by christ bob why bother to play fookin golf why not just come straight up here and enjoy it skinner laughed manys the time ive wished i had done just that mate and it tends to be all downhill from here in more ways than one their match continued as tight as it had begun each was fiercely competitive and sarahs clubs seemed to suit arrow perfectly however skinners straighter game gave him the edge until they shook hands on the green of the short sixteenth after the little soldier had missed a tenfoot putt for a matchsaving half both to celebrate and to demonstrate on the seventeenth tee bob took out his boronshafted driver for the first time and sent a huge shot soaring over the downwardsloping fairway his body english seemed to give the shot extra yardage as it squeezed over the cross bunkers guarding the approach to the green arrow came very close to following him but his ball found the sand as they walked down the steep slope the little soldier looked up at his partner cool bugger most of the time aint yer bob its as well you dont give people the same treatment you gave that fookin ball there tell me something youve told me one thing that makes you angry but is there anything that makes you really mad really blow your stack as he continued down the hill bob looked deep into himself as if searching for the other skinner the one whose appearance he dreaded as if analysing him working out what brought him to the surface eventually on the ridge above the bunker he stopped and leaned on his clubs thats a better question than you know adam and its a tough one to answer honestly but ill try you say im a cool bugger but youre wrong i might be controlled but thats a different thing there are i think just two things that would make me lose selfcontrol christ i hope there are only two one is any direct threat to my nearest and dearest to my wife sarah or my daughter alex most people would say the same the other one is betrayal an act of serious betrayal that gets me and if that betrayal is bad enough then well lets just say im not so nice to know arrow looked at him shrewdly betrayal you mean like what that prick of a secretary of state of yours did to you at your press conference skinners eyes narrowed as he took out his putter who called the prick a secretary of state adam thats what id like to know he said softly with a cold smile rolling the ball into the hole the world was still turning on its axis as normal when skinner ahd arrow returned to edinburgh from gullane it looked like any other festival monday afternoon as they drove along princes street the hospitality marquee above the waveriey centre had been repaired banners bearing the sponsors corporate logo fluttered from poles set on its supporting pillars a few guests stood in the entrance drinks in hand enjoying the summer day skinner rolled down the windows of the bmw the sunroof had been open all through the journey from gullane as they drove along they took in the sounds of the street competing bagpipers some live some no more than taped muzak floating from the openfronted shops competed for attention above the noise of the traffic vehicular and human the openair fringe sideshow at the mound was in full swing edinburgh was alive full of bustle the capital was wearing its bright festival face as if there was no threat as if no crisis existed back at fettes arrow headed for the car which had been assigned to him and drove straight off to redford barracks to await the checkin of his sas unit his men were travelling north on various afternoon flights from heathrow in groups of two or three skinner settled back into his swivel chair behind his desk at precisely two minutes before pm just in time for his regular monday meeting with his deputy and the six divisional heads of cid as commander he needed to know everything that was going on throughout the forces sprawling territory at the same time these weekly meetings as a group encouraged a healthy exchange of information among colleagues once ruth had brought in coffee and the obligatory chocolate digestives he gave his fellow detectives a comprehensive run through of the threat and the security operation the summary briefing took only ten minutes so thats what weve done skinner said finally and thats whos in the antiterrorist squad any questions gentlemen one sir skinner looked across at douglas armstrong a big bluff man from dalkeith armstrong was his nominated deputy and as a detective chief superintendent a tank above the divisional heads whose side are the politicians on if you mean our own board theyre solidly behind us as always if you mean ministers theyre backing us too for the moment at least weve got a job to do lets just do it as well as we can and cam any thanks we get at the end of the day and when i say weve got a job to do i mean you too whatever your division aye even you down in the borders ron these people must have a home base for all the highflown language and all that crap this is just another bloody gang we dont know how big it is but there has to be a ganghut somewhere a place where the boss is a place where orders are given a place where these letters are typed even if theyre so well organised that they never meet as a complete group there is still movement and contact between them they communicate through letters not over the phone and they use pretend couriers theres a contact point when the courier picks up his envelope unless of course hes the author but thats unlikely so were not just looking for people were looking for that place as well i want you in your divisions to put all your people on the alert uniform as well as cid to keep an eye out for any possibility however slight the only forensic knowledge which we have is that the notes were produced by a computer or word processor using a fairly obscure typeface called venice and that they were printed on conqueror paper by a hewlett packard deskjet he handed each man a manufacturers brochure showing the ugly but functional squareshaped printer and a sample sheet of conqueror paper with its clear water mark if any of your people find anywhere where they see those two items together they should report it back and let us follow it up i dont care who the owner is whether its your wifes brother or the parish priest each case is to be reported back were checking out all printer stockists and paper suppliers both these items are sold over the counter but we already think we know where the printer was bought a shop in queensferry street last tuesday buyer paid cash and left a phoney address for product registration all the assistant could describe was tallish male may have been darkhaired but he wore a hooded tanktop and shades so she couldnt be certain she didnt remember his accent the shop doesnt sell conqueror paper but theres a stockist in william street and were checking it out now any prints on either letter asked armstrong no douglas not a smear gloves all down the chain so gentlemen unless any one of you has anything else on your patch thats about to go pearshaped and you need to tell me about in private thats it for today see you all here next week on a group basis again i think unless you hear different go to it and good luck heading for home skinner was in the act of closing the door of his office behind him when another thought occurred he went back to his desk and picked up his scrambled telephone keying in one of forty preprogrammed numbers the call was answered brusquely on the first ring hullo willie skinner here how are you lot getting on with our pal no bad sir how are my guys doing first class thats a hard big bastard that mcllhenney and the boy macgregor hes so sharp hell cut himself well just you keep an eye on him and see that he doesnt now what about macdairmid hes spent most of the day at the constituency labour party offices ah had a tap put on them too is that ok wi you yes for now but just make sure you remember to take it off as soon as macdairmids eliminated as a suspect shame but yes sir thats understood no that its produced anything yet that would interest you other than the guy haranguin lassies in the housin department threatenin them that their jobs no be safe if they dont do as he says hes not saying hell use his political clout to have them sacked is he not straight out naw well it isnt enough for a charge if thats what yere thinking its nothing that the crown office needs to taste hear mind you haggerty mused if someone dropped a copy of the transcript taste the sun it might finish him as anmp dont bother yourself willie nice thought as it is it would cause too many problems anyway weve got enough on the guy now to make sure that hes quietly deselected and well do that at the right time for now just keep tabs on him and see if he leads us anywhere haggerty grunted understood there is one thing sir the boy does have a funny habit twice he left the offices and went fur a pint in a pub on greenlands road mcllhenney and macgregor took turns tailing him apparently each time he only had a halfpint and hardly touched that but each time he used the pub payphone sthat no interesting its funny for sure it could be anything though that he didnt want heard in the office calling the girlfriend for example still well take a punt on it as soon as you see him heading for the clp offices again put a tap on that pub phone and lets see what we get the rest of the day passed peacefully bob and sarah took in a oneman show based on the life of houdini in a converted church hall in newington the star a game guy as bob declared later performed several ofhoudinis easier illusions as part of the show prevailing upon members of the audience to verify that he was securely chained or straightjacketed or boxed in whatever each trick demanded sarahs enjoyment of the show was dampened slightly by a constant niggling fear that bobs mobile telephone would ring but it never did they returned to their bungalow in fairyhouse avenue at around pm half an hour later andy martin and julia shahor arrived for a late supper after the evenings film performance it was partly a social visit and partly an opportunity for the two detectives to touch base on the days events while in the conservatory skinner told martin of grant macdairmids peculiar visits to the pub in greenlands road sarah and julia chatted in the kitchen hows your aunt reacting to all the excitement sarah asked shes taken herself off said julia a note of disappointment creeping into her voice giving it sudden depth where normally it was flat and devoid of accent she said that i had enough on my hands without having her around and so she insisted on going back home to uncle percy in brighton i put her on the gatwick flight this morning and he was going to pick her up at the other end im sorry in a way she likes to be around when its busy to help me as best she can she still does little things about the house i said i didnt want her to leave but she had made her mind up so youre there on your own now julia smiled well not exactly andy says that since his work has become involved with mine and since he insists on looking after me after my scare the other night it makes sense for me to move in with him for a week or two that is nice of him is it not sarah laughed nice its amazing for as long as ive known andy martin hes been adamant that hed never let a girlfriend hang her clothes in his wardrobe this sounds serious hes not the headoverheels type and thats not the way you strike me either i didnt think i was but when i saw him on saturday something just went into meltdown earlier tonight he asked me to marry him sarahs mouth dropped open in amazement he did what what did you say i said that he should ask me again in a month if he does and if i still feel this same way then i will marry him and just as fast as i can good for you lady bob and i didnt hang about either we took a little more time over it than you and andy but still we only met last year he had to be a bit more cautious though having the other love of his life to consider what do you mean his job sarah smiled again and shook her head apart from that no i meant alex his daughter if she and i had hated each other itd have been difficult for him and for me too come to that it was fine though i love alex shes like my kid sister only shes no kid its funny but your moving in with andy its come just at the right time in a way it might help bob understand something he doesnt fathom yet whats that alex and bob had their first real row last night i mean their first ever she brought her new man home for supper and bob gave him the third degree after hed gone alex just blew her stack so did bob this afternoon she came back from her theatre while he was out shes acting in a play and picked up some of her clothes and things shes moved in with ingo the boyfriend i promised id break the news to bob she saw a look of apprehension cloud julias face and was quick to dispel it dont worry i wont let it spoil our evening ill wait till afterwards to tell him what will he do well he might just go and find ingo and give him a quiet going over she paused and julias mouth dropped open a frown creasing her forehead sarah grinned but i think i should be able to stop him doing that especially now that i can remind him that you and andy are in the same situation hell sulk for a while but hell be ok alex wouldnt do anything just for the sake of hurting bob and he knows that would it help if i asked andy to talk to him said julia tentatively god no andy treats her like a sister too hes known her sinceshe was a little girl hed probably have ingo deported no dont say anything to him well let bob sort himself out first then he can sort out andy at the insistence of sarah and julia no shop was talked during supper instead bob replayed shot by shot his round of golf with adam arrow the walk in the sun had added a pink touch to his tan and a bleached hint to his hair his account rose in its superlatives until it climaxed in his description of his eagle two at the seventeenth passed off casually at the time for arrows benefit but in fact a lifetime first and what happened at the eighteenth asked andy trust you boy i was going to gloss over that but ok gave it the long handle again didnt i stuffed my drive in that chesthigh rough up the right bunkered my second ball took eight anyway by that time i was thinking about work again in a sense that was true in fact as he stood on the tee he had been considering still in depth the subject of betrayal he seemed the usual skinner on arriving at his office next morning but ruth ever the perceptive secretary caught a preoccupied slightly sharp edge to his good morning wheres alex he had asked as the door had closed on andy and julia seven hours earlier then sarah had told him he had taken the news better than she had thought he might but his reaction had opened a new shaft of concern for alex in sarah herself sarah love in all of her life since her mother died the girls never known disappointment some of that ive seen to but most of the credits hers shes never failed an exam in her life and as far as i can remember or at least know about shes never made a serious error of judgement but i suspect that shes made one this time what do you mean i mean that guy ingo isnt right not for her at any rate theres something about him that i dont like i cant say what it is all i can tell you that in my time ive interviewed a lot of people in the course of police investigations ive reached the stage when i can usually smell the wrong ones and believe me that fellow smells wrong hes a selfcentred bastard and he doesnt give a damn about alex hes just taking a loan of her come on bob youre hardly being objective im hardly objective about criminals either but im usually right sarah reached out a hand and touched his cheek whispering as she did fair seedtime had my soul and i grew up fostered alike by beauty and by fear whats that wordsworth it just came into my head thinking about you and alex your relationship is beautiful bob but theres fear there too your fear every fathers fear of what might happen to his little girl he shook his head i wish it was so simple or so poetic lover but the hair on the back of my neck prickled the first time i ever met the guy when alex introduced him just as one of the squad without even saying there was something between them and the day i stop trusting the hair on the back of my neck that day ill be finished as a detective well if you really believe that what are you going to do what can i do i cant talk her round its gone too far for that i could put the fear of god into him but to do that properly i have a feeling that i might have to break at least one of his legs and what would that do for me and alex itd never be the same again no i what do i mean we just have to accept it for now but watch the situation and be around to pick up the pieces when he dumps her and buggers off back to sweden they sat up until am discussing alexs decampment back in his office faced once again with the tyranny of his pending tray bob could feel the loss of those few hours sleep but he persevered until by midmorning he had worked his way through most of the heap of files and folders just after am he was interrupted by a call on his private line he picked up the receiver and heard a familiar voice echoing through a bad international connection bob jimmy here ive just seen a copy of yesterdays telegraph what the heus going on there sir james prouds celebration of his recently conferred knighthood was taking the form of a fourweek break with lady proud in lanzarote twentyeight days of doing absolutely sod all he had announced before his departure his holiday still had almost twentyone of those days to run skinner was not in the least surprised by his call hello chief i thought youd be on the phone as soon as the news caught up with you if youve seen the telegraph you probably know it all since the murder of the guillaum woman weve had no more incidents or any further contact from the terrorists thats nearly fortyeight hours now weve put as much security in place as we can including some of the boys in black from hereford maybe weve scared them off but i have my doubts hows ballantyne taking it i dont want to talk about that for a few seconds there was only a whistling sound on the otherwise silent line as proud considered the implications of skinners reticence when he spoke again there was a warning in his tone you watch our friend robert like most politicians hes not to be trusted look ill try to get a plane out of here i should be back home there no you shouldt what could you do that i havent done besides if youve read the torygraph youll know that this isnt a force matter anyway officially its in the hands of an antiterrorist squad and im in command courtesy of our friend ballantyne so you just lie in the sun with lady chrissie and try to enjoy doing all that buggerall that you were looking forward to but man ill feel terrible worrying about you lot why should you do you think all crime stops in edinburgh just because youve gone on bloody holiday think of it as just another investigation proud grunted i suppose youre right i have to admit that chrissie did give me the start of a very black look when i mentioned going back home hows mcguinness getting on not bothering me and sarah hows sarah terrific shes taking years off me and alex playing house with some swede at the moment much to my displeasure i have to say take some advice from an expert bob let her get on with it when youre her age no one else knows anything about life thats more or less what sarah says too warning pips sounded on the line ok boss thanks for the call now go on get back to your sunbed proud laughed all right if youre certain its true what they say by the way i have to get up at to book our places so long the line went dead the rest of the day passed peacefully apart from the distraction of a midafternoon bank robbery at the bank of scotland in picardy place a crime which was almost refreshing in its normality after the tumult of the weekend the bearded senior managers terse and vivid description of the raiders struck a chord with the investigating detective chief inspector and a replay of the bank video confirmed his suspicions within three hours of the crime arrests were made and the stolen recovered bob and sarah decided to give the performing arts a miss that evening instead they visited a private view of a major exhibition of inca treasures in the royal scottish museum after their guided tour they mingled with the rich and famous of edinburgh and various members of the visiting glitterati at a drinks reception in the museums main hall under its magnificent higharched glass ceiling they had just spent some time in confusing conversation with one of scotlands leading young jazz saxophonists and his identical twin brother and were circulating towards the next group when they were confronted by a stocky bulllike crewcut figure sweating in his pink shirt and white cotton jacket even in the controlled climate of the museum skinner the man seemed to bark rather than speak skinner nodded hackles rising instantly a neidermeyer we spoke on the transatlantic horn on saturday remember oh yes i remember skinners voice was suddenly soft he felt sarahs hand tighten on his arm as if she was holding him back a vein throbbed on the side of the shorter mans bulletlike head i want you to know that im watching you skinner you fucked me around i dont forget that you slip up just once on this case and ill make you international bad news ill screw you so hard your eyesll pop you get me now tell me what the fuck youre doing to catch these people a slow cold smile spread across skinners face beside him sarah was trembling in fury she made to speak but bob still smiling silenced her with a slight movement of his hand the chattering of the groups of guest around them had stilled and a circle had opened up around them the closest bystanders stared selfconsciously into their wine glasses mr neidermeyer or can i call you al youre new in town youre probably jetlagged and like my wife here youre an american all that cuts you one piece of slack youve just used it up the smile left his lips so now you listen to me and listen well here you get the same rights and privileges on this story as any other member of the foreign press in your special case that means youre at the back of the queue you want to ask any questions about this investigation you contact my information office you dont waylay me in a public place understood suddenly his voice was different still quiet but hard now and very very cold and one more thing you ever talk to me like that again or block my way or use language like that in front of my wife and youll either be on liquids for a week or locked up or both come on love time we were going he slipped an arm around sarahs waist and led her from the museum an hour later sarah was still seething she sat on the edge of the bed in her matching pink bra and panties pulling a brush through her hair bob lay naked between the sheets that little jerk who the hell does he think he is guys like him give all us americans a bad name what an asshole if i ever see him again bob laughed and shook his head calm down doc youre getting as red in the face as he was ill tell you what why dont you phone don the consul and report him she frowned at him how can you be so calm about it he threatened you in front of all those people yeah and i threatened him back i dont think hell do it again if he does ill just have to call my pal joe to hell maybe ill do that anyway whos your pal joe the fbi guy in your embassy in london i wonder if old al would fancy a fullscale irs tax audit sarah looked at him even now he was still capable of surprising her could you fix that damn right i could now forget that bastard and come here theres a fella wants to talk to you in an instant she slipped out of her bra and panties and into bed reaching for him just as he drew her close to him the telephone rang sarah swore softly rolled over and picked it up hello sarah its maggie rose here at once sarah was aware of the tension in the detective sergeants voice the woman was struggling hard to stay in control im sorry but i need to speak to the boss frowning sarah handed over the receiver bob took it from her yes sergeant what is it its a bomb sir in the assembly rooms in the music hall theyve done it again oh my god but its awful get here please sir just get here please george street was closed off along its entire length from charlotte square to st andrew square a uniformed officer stationed at the junction of queen street and frederick street recognised skinner and sarah instantly and waved them through they parked in front of the doublewindows of phillips the fine art auctioneers clad in the jeans and sweatshirts which they had pulled on after tumbling out of bed they raced across the street past the police cars lined along the central reservation and past the rank of ambulances which stood like bluebeaconed taxis at the arched and pillared entrance to the assembly rooms at once skinner spotted deputy chief constable mcguinness standing in the doorway looking out into the street the portly policeman was in evening dress as if he had been summoned from the opera his normally ruddy face had a yellowish tinge and his eyes gave a clear hint of what lay inside skinner greeted him sympathetically hello eddie whats happened even as he spoke two paramedics hurried past bearing a keening victim on a stretcher towards one of the ambulances he looked down at their burden and in spite of himself he felt his stomach knot and his testicles tighten it was a girl young and blonde her left ear and part of the left side of her face had been sliced off through the mess skinner could see white bone a long shard of wood protruded from her belly her hands all bloody were grasping it as if she were holding on to her pain and through that to life itself mcguinnesss lips moved as if he was speaking but no sound came out instead his eyes filled with tears as he followed the girl on her stretcher for the first time in his life skinner found that he felt sorry for the deputy he knew that most of mcguinnesss career had been spent in administration and yet here he was visiting his second charnelhouse in only four days go and sit in one of the cars eddie you dont have to look at this you cant help these people but the deputy chief constable shook his head blinking the glaze from his eyes then as skinner looked at him he straightened his back and clenched his jaw no bob i realise that things like this come with the job skinner patted him on the shoulder with a newfound sense of camaraderie good man eddie he murmured softly jimmy would be pleased with you as he led sarah into the foyer of the assembly rooms they were met by a babel of sound the shouts of the emergency teams mingled with cries of paid from victims somewhere not too far away a man was screaming carrying her bulky firstaid bag sarah looked around until she saw a nurse in uniform im a doctor she called out to the man wheres the medical centre up those stairs in the big room to the left she turned to skinner bob im yes of course ill send for you if i need you maggie rose said it was in the music hall he said to no one in particular then he caught sight of andy martin standing at the foot of the wide staircase to the right waving to him boss he called this way skinner followed martin up the staircase at the top he made to step into the big music hall which he knew so well but martin caught his arm no boss come up to the gallery youll get a better idea there and listen prepare yourself its not a pretty sight martin led him through the access door to the balcony and up a second flight of stairs much narrower than the first as he stepped into the auditorium skinners eyes screwed up involuntarily taking in the horror glass was strewn across the full width of the upper seating area white stuffing much of it stained crimson with blood protruded from torn tipup seats a line of pockmarks ran irregularly along the painted back wall of the gallery the whole upper area of the hall looked as if it had been strafed with machinegun fire as soon as skinner looked down into the body of the hall he realised why the framework of the huge ornate chandelier which had been the main feature of the room now hung twisted and tangled suspended from the ceiling by only a few wires its heavy crystal fittings were virtually all gone skinner saw at once that the blast had torn them off and sent them whistling like heavycalibre bullets into the balcony seats he walked down the few steps from the doorway and looked into the body of the theatre from the way the wreckage was spread out he could see that the explosion had taken place mid stage the lower part of the auditorium was filled with temporary tieredstall seating the rows of seats nearest the front and thus closest to the explosion were below stage level and seemed to have been shielded from the worst of the blast he could see that those in the middle and towards the rear had been riddled with a savage assortment of wooden glass and metal shrapnel skinner remembered the girl on the stretcher and guessed that it was the debris of the stage furniture suddenly he was overwhelmed by the horror of it all jesus christ andy what a mess martin had been working at the scene for some time but he too was still ashenfaced hellish weve got at least twelve dead and who knows how many injured a few of them wont make it there was a girl there i know i saw her i think sarah came with me shes gone next door to do what she can thats good boss maggie rose is there too she was in the building down in the foyer and thank christ not in the hall when it happened she holding up ok maggie are you kidding thats good now tell me what youve worked out so far well as you can see the bomb seems to have exploded right on the stage itself the show was an australian musical called waltzing matilda or some such the cast was bang oh christ he paused aghast at his choice of words in the middle of one of their big production numbers when it happened we can account for three bodies on stage but theres another one missing we reckon shes probably just been blown all over the fucking place you can see what the blast did to the big chandelier the folk upstairs caught the worst of it one or two of the poor sods were just cut to pieces the audience downstairs didnt do too well either the people at the front and at the back got off lightest mostly shock some deafened a few scrapes the folk in the middle caught the stage debris they were lucky the frame of that big chandelier didnt come down on them as well martin paused to bring his rising voice under control skinner looked over into the midsection of the big hall which was flooded by the temporary lights which had been set up many of the seats were torn and as in the upper area some were stained scarlet more blood trails led up the aisle towards the exit door by the time i got here martin continued theyd taken eight people out dead from the audience five more are touchandgo one woman had her hand sliced off her boyfriend had to put a tourniquet on her he paused gulping in breath the worst casualties are on their way to hospital most of them are being treated here skinner caught sight of gammy legge kneeling in the centre of the scorched blackened stage do we know anything about the type of bomb yet was it the same as saturday theres an old guy reckons he can describe it for us hes a weird old boy hes either tremendously excited or a bit hysterical or both he cant stop talking ive sent him downstairs with a pc do you want to talk to him too right lets get to him before he starts to embroider it martin led the way out of the music hall and down the wide carpeted staircase back to the foyer the fringe cafebar in the rear groundlevel hall had been turned into an emergency canteen a number of survivors more shocked than injured were sitting around on stacking chairs drinking mugs of hot sweet tea skinner could hear the old mans shrill hoarse voice rising above the hubbub even before martin pointed him out he was standing on his tip toe clutching a white mug with his chin stuck out bellowing and gesticulating with his free hand to the young officer detailed to look after him his small stature was accentuated by the wizening and shrinkage which the advancing years had brought with them skinner could see at once why martin had thought him weird more than anything else he looked like a large monkey in fancy dress he had a broad flat face and a high forehead from which his long thinning hair swept back skinner noted with surprise a sprinkling of black still showing among the grey a small gold ring looked garish in his left ear but somehow it was in accord with his crewnecked blueandwhite hooped sweater and comfortcut black jeans he wore opentoed sandals without socks he might have been skinner estimated anywhere between sixtyfive and eighty martin introduced them boss this is mr charles forsyth mr forsyth acc skinner the little man turned and looked slowly up at the figure towering above him so youre the great bob skinner ive met you once before must be nearly twenty years ago you were just a rawarsed sergeant then the mans voice was still raised and hoarse and skinner guessed this was his normal tone he looked at forsyth afresh trying to place him in his memory but failed well im pleased to meet you again mr forsyth although id rather it hadnt been here and in these circumstances so you were in the music hall when the explosion happened tell me were you there alone call me charlie aye i was alone thank christ mary thats my girlfriend she was feeling a bit offcolour and anyway she didnae really fancy the idea of aussies pretending taste be songand dance men dont know what brought me truth be told its out of my usual line all that prancin poofter stuff im a writer yknow he added inconsequentially skinner was not surprised by the revelation but decided instinctively not to pursue that line of conversation where were you sat charlie downstairs three rows from the back if id been three rows further down the guy in the sixth row straight in front of me caught a big lump of flying timber or something right in the throat it took the poor bastards head half off and that could have been me mind you ive always been lucky i remember once in burma his voice trailed off as if he had suddenly discovered that this detail of his wartime memories was no longer there andy says you can describe the explosion charlie skinner prodded gently the little mans eyes lit up at once and he seemed almost to straighten from his stoop aye too fuckin right i can it was the radiogram what well this nonsense i wont dignify it with the name of a play was set in the early sixties and the stage was dressed with props from that time gateleg table chintzy chairs that sort of stuff and one of those huge standard electric radiograms they had back in those days youll be too young to remember them maybe great big bastards they were they weighed a ton thats what blew up i was lookin straight at it at the time it just seemed to disintegrate and puff outwards in smoke and everything else on stage along with it funny looking back its as if it happened in slow motion are you certain certain of course im fucking certain i was there wasnt i there was a lassie standing right alongside it lamentable christ what a sight i remember once i saw this big nigerian soldier take a direct hit from japanese artillery the only thing left was his boots great big boots they were with his great big fucking feet still in them id ordered him taste stay under cover christ ye couldnae tell those boys anything at all hearts of lions brains of fieldmice his voice tailed off the awful memory of the evening reviving another horror of the past taking him back to the jungles of fifty years before skinner calmed the old mans excitement thanks charlie thanks very much youre a good man youve given us the first eyewitness account weve had since all this business started he turned to the young pc constable organise a car have mr forsyth taken home the man set off obediently ta said forsyth ye know skinner all this it makes me glad im not long away from the wooden waistcoat i grieve for scotland when this can happen good luck to you son catch these fuckers as he left the little man in the canteen skinner wondered about his reaction what kind of man could witness such appalling carnage and still describe it so matteroffactly then he realised quite simply that perhaps an eightyyearold could do so someone knowing that his lease on the planet was running out taking every day as a bonus caring only about that day and the next and hopefully the day beyond the horror of that evening might be blocked out easily by a man like that and a strange satisfaction drawn from the privileged position of being an important witness from the unexpected burst of warmth at being the centre of attention once again rather than being just another lonely old man shouting his bizarre reminiscences to gather himself an audience in the foyer dcc mcguinness now seemed in full control both of himself and of the situation the stream of casualties out to the ambulances had subsided skinner went to check on sarah in the firstaid room which was still crowded with bleeding shocked victims waiting mainly in silence for attention he realised that the decision to treat the less seriously injured at the scene had been a wise one edinburghs main hospital casualty departments would have been swamped by the numbers sarah estimated that she had another thirty minutes of stitching and patching to do look youll want to start work on this why dont you just leave me the car key and go off with andy yes ill do that he agreed handing her the big bmw key he kissed her on the forehead and went downstairs in the lower hall he was intercepted by alan royston the police media relations manager who had set up a makeshift press office in a room to the left of the foyer he led skinner to where a dozen reporters stood waiting there he explained to them what had happened in the music hall describing the scale of the destruction he answered the questions of the group as best he could and agreed finally to roystons suggestion that the journalists and photographers should be taken together into the hall to see for themselves as he was making his way towards the exit al neidermeyer arrived there was a television cameraman puffing at his heels a city freelance whom skinner knew by sight well copper snarled neidermeyer so much for your security how many more people did you let die here tonight once more skinner felt his selfcontrol valve begin to strain he glanced quickly at the camera to make certain that the red action light was unlit the cameraman was looking away embarrassed then his right hand swept upwards in one short swift motion as it passed close to neidermeyers face he flicked the second finger with his thumb lightningfast the broad fingernail caught the american very hard square on the tip of the nose neidermeyer howled and instantly his eyes hooded with ritt p pushmg your luckaskinner whispered leftua t hsten he swept the man from his pasrand andy martin was waiting for him outside he saw the anger in skinners eyes but an inner caution stopped him from asking what was wrong instead he suggested that they go and talk things out at his flat near haymarket rather than return to the headquarters building they found julia shahor there when they arrived home from the film festival she greeted martin obvious anxiety turning quickly to relief radio forth rfm was playing and the television was on with teletext on on screen carrying the latest news on the explosion a royal infirmary spokeswoman had confirmed the current death toll at fourteen the condition of two other victims was said to be critical for a time they stared grimfaced and speechless at the news bulletin on the screen then martin handed skinner and julia a becks each from the fridge taking a tin of tennents la for himself he joined julia on the sofa facing the television while skinner settled on the floor his back against the wall it was skinner who broke the silence broke the spell cast by the horror of the assembly rooms andy my brother weve been kidding ourselves to think that we could prevent something like tonight and weve been underestimating these people theyre good very well planned weve got to catch them before it goes any further but i do not for the life of me know how were going to do it for once martin had no word of encouragement to offer in reply skinner finished his becks in one swallow straight from the bottle he got up to fetch himself another then resumed his seat on the floor with a wry smile he said but thats me seeing the glass halfempty the positive side is that at least weve got some straightforward police work to do thanks to good old charlie forsyth what do you mean asked julia well first we have to check every member of every other company thats been using that venue then theres the stage props that exploding radiogram no fucking way oh sorry julia did they bring that all the way from oz they must have sourced it locally maybe i can help you there she offered i know of only three companies in scotland which supply stage props i looked into it earlier this year when i needed things for a display i put on at filmhouse ones in glasgow ones down towards the borders somewhere but the biggest by far is here in edinburgh let me see what was it called proscenium props that was it it was based in a big warehouse out to the west of the city near sighthill good julia thanks for that well andy thats a priority task for first thing tomorrow i mean this morning find out where those props came from then well find out all there is to know about everybody on the suppliers payroll like whether any of them has been handling semtex over the last few days he drained his second becks then pushed himself up from his hard seat on the floor right thats it for me im off home want me to phone for a patrol car to pick you up asked martin no no dont do that the boys are too busy for taxi runs tonight ill walk its not that hellish far from here he paused its a nice night and itll let me pull some things together in my head so long julia martin walked him to the front door of the secondfloor flat he looked quizzically after his chief as he disappeared down the brightly lit curving stairway eventually he closed the door and rejoined julia in the livingroom she caught the faraway look in his eyes what is it she asked its the boss hes got one of his niggles i can tell what do you mean how do i explain it every so often on a really difficult job when were pursuing a particular line of enquiry bob decide that maybe its not quite right that all the bits dont fit that jigsaw but hell keep it to himself just niggling and worrying away at the thought like a dog at a bone until either hes satisfied himself that yes we are on the right track after all or until he comes up with a completely new approach he broke off but enough of that heard from your aunt yes shes fine which side of the family is she from mother or father actually said julia hesitantly as if looking for the right words neither shes a sort of courtesy aunt really she was at school with my mother they were very close in israel funny i wouldnt have thought that her accent sounds more european no not in israel somewhere else the thing is well the thing is my parents broke up when i was a girl and i went to live with relatives in israel i got in touch with auntie again when i came to the sorbonne suddenly she looked troubled but andy i really dont like to talk about all that it was a bad time for me and it is best left in the past sure love he said soothingly and in a second it was forgotten hes some machine old bob when he gets one of his niggles going wonder what it is this time one things for sure though sooner or later well find out the first rumblings of discontent appeared in the hastily written leaders of the following mornings scotsman and herald while in the tabloids the rumbling was a fullscale earthquake one late edition banner blared plod fiasco bombs hit oz this articulate headline filled twothirds of the front page and led a story filled with hastily assembled bystander condemnation of the security operation in general and of its commander in person resisting the urge to crumple it up and throw it across the room skinner read it through to the end he noted grimly that the only critic identified in the story was al neidermeyer while the more serious scottish dailies were more circumspect notes of concern rang in them all the sombre leader in the scotsman went so far as to praise skinner as an outstanding detective but developed its theme of two days before wondering whether counterterrorism was suited to his skills and whether the crisis might be better placed under someone elses command like who for instance he muttered to the empty room michael licorish and alan royston had scheduled a media conference to be taken by ballantyne and skinner at am in the main hall at fettes avenue in preparation for the inevitable grilling the acc read all of the reports which lay on his desk including one from the royal infirmary which put the final death toll at eighteen including the girl he had seen on the stretcher her name had been alice carroll and she had been seventeen years old also listed at the end of the report was alices elderly grandmother untouched by the shrapnel but who had died of a heart attack shortly after the explosion skinner had just finished his perusal when ruth buzzed through on the intercom to tell him that licorish was waiting outside ok he said send him in the information director came in a few seconds later skinner could see an embarrassed look in his eyes and knew that he had some uncomfortable news to break he took a guess wheres the secretary of state mike i thought hed be here by now thats just it bob he cant make it he asked me to apologise to you and to ask you to take the chair in his place he said i was to tell you he still has every confidence in you thats fucking big of him whats his story its to do with a family friend having just died between you and me its actually a friend of mrs ballantyne you know how it is with them skinner nodded but he wondered if licorish knew how it was with ballantyne and carlie the scottish office man continued almost sotto voce shes been having an affair with a liberal peer lord broadgate but it seems she was too much for him he had a stroke during the night she phoned s of s in a bit of a panic and he caught the first shuttle down to london mmm skinner muttered nice of him as he looked at licorish he sensed something else before he could ask the civil servant produced a brown envelope which he had been holding behind his back this arrived just after he left he pushed it across the desk the latest letter was brief and to the point ballantyne you and your lackeys must believe us now we have shown you what we can do and we will not stop until you give us back what is ours now we have the attention of the international community and we have its support withdraw from scotland before its people rise up and join us in throwing you out skinner threw it down on the desk what the hell is that its just fucking rhetoric they kill an american they kill australians they kill their own scots folk these people have to be crazy or playing for very big stakes is scotland that important he rose from behind his desk and led the way to his meeting with the media in the briefing room the media corps even al neidermeyer his nose noticeably swollen were unusually subdued as skinner described the scene in the music hall then listed the dead finally he put down his notes and looked at his audience theres little i can say to you that i havent said before this is a wellorganised wellresourced and completely ruthless group of people what happened last night was beyond words beyond mine and i think beyond even yours eloquent as you all may be the thing that i find most incredible is that scots people could treat other scots in this way whatever justifiable cause they think they have last night i talked to an eightyyearold man who told me that he grieved for scotland i share his grief having said that i can tell you that there is now some sign of outside involvement in these atrocities the explosive used in both attacks is a new type of semtex so far its been unknown here it hasnt even turned up in ireland until now no one has been aware that there was an illicit market in this material the country of manufacture is pretty jealous of its reputation and its government felt sure that all batches were accounted for it seems they were wrong we now know that there was a breakin at a french military arsenal two months ago when a quantity of the stuff was stolen were pretty certain thats the explosive used here before all this started we never had an inkling of any embryonic scottish terrorist organisation its asking a lot of me at least to believe that such a group has existed all along with a plan so detailed that it involved stealing high explosives from an arsenal in france skinners old friend john hunter interrupted him bob are you suggesting that all this might have been contrived outside scotland or that there might be some foreign involvement i cant say that for certain john but whatever this group is its tied into some sort of network irish i dont know i know someone who definitely doesnt think so but sooner or later ill find out for sure thank you gentlemen from now on in the light of these events im prepared to take briefings on a daily basis at every morning here but thats all for this morning skinner rose to his feet there was a stampede for the door as the media corps rushed off en masse to file their french connection copy a message written in ruths neat hand lay on skinners desk when he returned to his office call dc mcllhenney glasgow urgent she had noted down the telephone number using his secure telephone he keyed it in neil acc here whatve you got for me morning sir our man macdairmids an early bird he pitched up at his party offices at this morning but he was only there for twenty minutes then off down to that pub of his its got an earlyopening licence for nightshift workers at the factory up the road barry beat him there he was waiting when he arrived sure as god made wee green apples he ordered a halfpint of gillespies then used the payphone the glasgow technical boys had their tap in place and got the whole thing interesting as mr haggerty would say too bliddy right it is sir but you can judge for yourself theres a motorcycle polisman heading along the m right now with a copy for you he should get it to you in halfanhour ill tell you one thing sir that macdairmid for an mp hes bollockdeep in something thats definitely nonparliamentary thats bliddy certain bridie lindwall writer of the new musical revue waltvng matilda and director of the brisbane youth theatre company was still in a state of shock when andy martin and brian mackie were finally allowed into the private room in the murrayfield hospital in which she had been installed thanks to the provision of generous private health insurance by her shows australian sponsor ms lindwall had been given a heavy sedative by the junior doctor who had treated her at the royal infirmary immediately after the explosion and so it was midday before martin and mackie were allowed to interview her even then martin had needed to use his special branch clout to overrule the senior house officer in charge at first martin thought that talking to her was like interviewing mist the two detectives were unable to hold the womans attention for more than a few seconds before a distant glazed look washed across her face as her fuzzy memory took her back to the night before fitting together jagged fragments of recollection to form a jigsaw picture of confusion and terror ms lindwall martin said finally as gently as he could but with an edge of steel to hold the womans concentration we have to know where you sourced your props for the production the explosion happened in centre stage we believe that the bomb was hidden in a piece of prop furniture the woman was sitting up in bed propped against a mound of pillows she turned her freckled face towards him explosion oh yes the explosion how is everyone it all happened so fast little kelly how about her is she all right martin sat down on the side of her bed and took the womans hand dont worry about the others just concentrate on yourself youve had quite a shock now we need very badly to know about those props where did you get them was it proscenium the woman frowned as she tried to clear a path through the flotsam of her memory proscenium no we went there first but they couldnt give us everything we wanted eventuallywe found someone who could in a little place with a funny name south of edinburgh what about the radiogram you remember the big thing in centre stage did you get that there too she shuddered the radiogram her voice rose yes i remember the radiogram i was standing in the wings there was a flash and i was being pushed backwards by a great big hand yes it was as if the radiogram reached out and pushed me she shot bolt upright in the bed starring wideeyed at martin ok now its all right he put his hands on her shoulders and eased her very gently back on to the pillows we think thats where the bomb was hidden ms lindwall in the radiogram now can you remember where you got it she nodded her head vigorously suddenly she seemed more in focus yes that was one of the items that they couldnt give us at proscenium we had to go to the place with the funny name to find that thats good ms lindwall now one other thing when you werent actually using the theatre when the other companies were using it what did you do with your props we have a storeroom allocated to us in the basement all our stuffs locked up there between shows who keeps the keys i do both of them the theatre management doesnt want the responsibility of looking after anyones kit have you ever given a key to anyone else no no one at all you dont recall seeing any sign that anyone else might have been in that store nothing at all everything always looked normal ok ms lindwall thats been very helpful now you get yourself some more rest she grabbed his arm as he stood up arent you going to tell me about the rest of them how is everyone how is little kelly martin decided that economy with the truth would be in everyones interests look bridie obviously with a bang like that there were a few other scrapes as well as your own we dont have the full details yet but ill arrange for someone to come by and talk to you as soon as possible now you just relax and thanks again mackie closed the door of the private room gently behind them nice one andy i wouldnt have fancied telling her that one of her guys is dead because wee kellys arm was blown right through his chest mcllhenneys motorcycle officer arrived with the promised tape cassette five minutes ahead of schedule meanwhile skinner had called adam arrow to his room to await its delivery when ruth brought the package in she found the two seated in armchairs beside the low coffee table skinner accepted the clear plastic cassette and dropped it straight into a taperecorder placed in the centre of the table once his secretary had closed the heavy door behind her he pressed the play button for a few seconds there was only the hiss of the tape then they heard seven coins drop one by one followed by the musical beeps of a thirteendigit telephone number being keyed in on a modern instrument seconds later a ringing began in monotone the call was answered on the sixth ring in a tongue that sounded like arabic the voice was guttural the accent heavy neither listener was able to identify the language grant macdairmids response in english was strangely hushed far removed from the bellowing rant for which he was locally famous hello glasgow here how are our arrangements coming along everything is progressing very well we will be able to move on to the next stage on saturday the second delivery will be made then from the same french source yes thats good my people have things well in hand too the police dont have a bloody clue and theyre stretched so tight just now theyre starting to come apart yes i see that your compatriots are keeping them very busy that worries me a little their approach is so highprofile and you are shall we say so well known might it not mean that your security people will soon turn their attention to you macdairmid laughed softly look we went over all that at the start im a public figure an mp yes the sb plods keep an occasional eye on me its son of like a ritual dance i can always slip their gaze like now and they wouldnt really expect me to be involved in something like this grant macdainnid mp windbag demagogue and general nuisance thats my reputation but the real view of our friends in the cheap suits is grant macdairmid mp all fart no shit this time the other man laughed ah my friend if they only knew you as i do why youre full of shit there was a moments silence as macdairmid tried to work out whether he had been insulted then deciding to make allowances for the other mans poor grasp of colloquial english he ignored the remark and went on so its saturday where do we take delivery i suggest that we do it in edinburgh the police there are fully occupied yeah why not so where do we meet there was another silence then macdairmid laughed softly theres a booksellers in george street called james thin on the first floor theres a coffee shop most of the time its full of old people and young mums and kids but during the festival theres all sorts in there ill have my person there by am are you using the same courier as before yes fine so identification will be no problem then its all gone well so far but theyve seen nothing yet once i get my hands on your next consignment well really make scotland go off with a bang there was a click as the receiver went down skinner switched off the player he and arrow stared at each other in silence across the table fookin hell said the little soldier eventually yup that just about sums it up said skinner hes right you know adam we do think of him as just a loudmouthed wanker capable of causing bother up to a point but no further i mean i know the five computer spat out his name but i didnt think for a minute that hed have the stones to be into this sort of thing from the sound of it i was wrong so what do we do bob pick him up on what grounds one meeting in a pub in london which hed claim was a coincidence one funny telephone call even antiterrorist squads need evidence if theyre going to go around arresting mps im not a copper bob arrow spoke slowly as if weighing his words skinner noted that his accent had disappeared let me go underground for a couple of days and youd never hear of the man again skinner looked at him steadily and seriously adam i know what can happen in ireland but its not going to happen here im a policeman not a judge listen chum i knew a man once for whom that was the only way you may have gone to the same school but youre not like he was so far be careful you never get that way because if you do sooner or later youll come up against someone like me wholl have to stop you arrow smiled at him and when he spoke the accent was back rather not come up against you bob dont worry mate thats not my choice but these people are fookin butchers so i had to make the offer ok enough said anyway taking macdairmid for a trip wouldnt necessarily stop anything he may be mixed up in it he may even be a leader but no way is he doing the heavy stuff himself no well watch him like a hawk till saturday then well pick up his messenger and the other one now thats a job you can handle my face is too well known be glad to will you give me someone to work with sure itll be mcguire and rose mcllhenney and macgregor are already watching macdairmid so it could be theyd know the messenger by sight and he in turn might clock them so youd better have a different team and if it comes to a bundle mcguires your man i can hardly wait right ill brief them now what about the other voice on that tape any ideas not a voice i know put it that way it sounded like a fookin libyan though could have been but im hardly an expert in middle eastern languages ill have copies of the tape made and get someone on a plane down to london well let five have a listen and six for that matter lets see if it strikes a chord with anyone down there stow the place with the funny name was a drab little village its pronounced as in cow not as in blow mackie a borderer himself explained to martin they reached stow just on pm after a fortyfiveminute drive down the a the road from edinburgh to galashiels and the borders heartland of rugby football the place clearly offered no attractions to delay the northward flood of tourist traffic on the scenic route into scotland the business base of frank adams theatrical props as the yellow pages listing read was difficult to locate even in such a pocketsized community eventually with the help of the sub postmistress they found their quarry in a cluster of buildings which mackie guessed had once been part of a small farm before leaving edinburgh they had checked out frank adams theatrical props as far as they could using the department of social security and the inland revenue as their starting points the business had only two staff francis snowdon adams listed by the tax office as selfemployed and hugh minto dickson both were in their forties with adams three years the elder at fortyseven from a friendly bank manager contacted through the dss they had learned that mr adams made acceptable annual profits from business contacts all around the uk these were steady throughout the year and peaked during august and also over the christmas season when the british pantomime craze was at its height the company operated on a cashandcarry basis mr adams owned the premises and his overheads were restricted to the two salaries rates heat and light motor expenses hotel costs arising from his buying and selling trips around the uk stationery including a modest catalogue stock purchases and insurance to the bank managers certain knowledge the last category included a substantial indemnity premium to cover death or injury to any customers arising from defective stock wise man mr adams martin had commented although adams lived in lauder a few miles away from stow the bank manager knew him well not only as a customer but also as a neighbour he had described him as a forthright man with abiding interests in rugby football golf and cricket but little else he was also an avowed conservative who regarded nationalism and its exponents as just plain stupid hugh dickson was employed as stock controller dispatch clerk and bookkeeper he was exceptionally well paid possibly the bank manager surmised due to the fact that he was mr adams brotherinlaw neither man was personally extravagant although mr dickson who was single and lived in stow rentfree in a cottage alongside the companys storage barns was known to have a close relationship with the village pub however he was known most of all for his reluctance ever to leave stow it was said that his last journey of more than oneandahalf miles had been to galashiels by bus eighteen months before to buy clothes and christmas presents for his sister her husband his employer and two nephews mr adams and mr dickson enjoyed a cordial proper relationship but said the bank manager they could not be described as bosom companions martin related all this account to mackie as the detective inspector drove them southwards down the a from the sound of it said skinners personal assistant well get nothing from these guys on the face of it thats right but maybe theres someone else in the chain that we dont know about someone who fits in between them and the aussies both men were taking a coffeebreak in the companys small office when martin and mackie arrived unannounced neither adams not dickson seemed in any way surprised by their visit frank adams stood up to greet them shaking each by the hand and making steady eye contact he was a big man not exceptionally tall but big with a hand that swallowed even brian mackies oversized paw as martin looked at him remembering his own rugby days he guessed that once he might have been a member of the closed brotherhood of frontrow forwards weve been expecting you guys after that thing last night said adams we supplied that company but youll know that already i suppose dickson remained seated even in his chair he seemed dwarfed by his brotherinlaw yet he had that air of aggressive self assurance that small men often adopt to compensate for their lack of size never underestimate a wee man skinner had said of adam arrow that one therell kill you just as dead as anyone the words returned unbidden to martin as he returned dicksons confident gaze he switched his attention back to adams what exactly have you heard or read only that the explosion happened on the stage itself in mid performance nobody would leave a bomb just lying about so it must have been planked somewhere you guessed right tell me about the radiogram you hired out to the australians that big bugger was that it christ you could hide a depth charge in there look it was nothing to do wi us iu tell you that right now martin laughed lightly mr adams if thought it was wed have come in here with guns and flak jackets youd have to be very stupid indeed to hide a bomb in your own gear and then sit here waiting for us to turn up youre not that stupid are you or you mr dickson adams grinned possibly in relief martin guessed dickson looked mortally offended no what we do need to know is whether anyone else had access to that radiogram while it was still here when was it hired out last could it have been passed on directly from one renter to another adams rubbed his chin thoughtfully hughie can check the stock sheet but im certain it hadnt been out for two years and we always have kit brought back here first just so we can check its ok we make our customers pay for the insurance of all our stock under our own policy delivery back here is one of the conditions and we take a twenty per cent value deposit so who else had access to it here other than you and mr dickson nobody martin was surprised by his vehemence you havent seen any sign of a breakin no nor heard any all our storage buildings are alarmed like bank vaults you try and get insurance without that these days and youve had no visitors no we havent its your busy season you havent taken on any casual labour no look were not the dss if you have you can tell us it goes no further no i tell you adams tone was insistent ok ok he glanced at mackie thats as far as we can take it brian thanks mr adams mr dickson we wont take up any more of your time now ill dictate a statement back at the office and have a uniformed officer drop it in for you to approve and sign they had almost left of the building when they heard hugh dickson call out frankie the detectives stopped and looked back the little man had stood up he was looking not at them but at adams a strange pleading expression on his face look frankie this is nae use sister or no i wont say a word taste shona i promise but yeve got taste tell them about the lassie if looks could kill thought martin as adams glared at his brotherinlaw wed have a murder on our hands here but then the big mans eyes dropped and his shoulders sagged aye hughie youre right enough ive got to havent i but mind if you do say a bloody word to shona martin broke in listen mr adams if you dont tell us whatever it is right now ill arrest you and do you for wasting our time then shonau find out for sure now cough it up adams led them back into the office this time he offered them seats mackie produced a notebook and pen about three weeks ago adams began this girl showed up looking for work she was american she said her name was mary mccall said she was working her way round britain that she was skint and needed a job most of all she told me she needed a roof over her head i said i didnt need any help that hughie and i could manage fine hughie by the way he was down the village getting coffee and stuff when all this happened then she says if i give her a job and a place to kip shell make it worth my while i ask her what the hell she means and you know what she does before martin and mackie could hazard a guess he went on she comes straight over and unzips me then she gives me the most memorable adams closed his eyes and shuddered christ man i thought she was gonnae he stopped and glanced at martin in a strange conspiratorial mantoman way anyway that was how mary persuaded me to give her a job not that she did much work standing up at any rate theres a wee hat above the garage across the yard i let her stay there i was giving her one every night once or twice i didnt go home but shona thought nothing of that sometimes i kip over there if hughie and i have had a few bevvies after work i didnt mean it to go on for more than a few days but man she was something else she fucked like a jackrabbit hughie here caught on quick enough he wasnt best pleased at first but he laughed about it eventually he called it the old rams last stand he glanced across at his brotherinlaw with a sheepish grin the smaller man looked at the floor how did it end asked martin i take it that it did end oh yes said adams it ended i came here last saturday night after golf shagged me stupid she did just like always i came back across on sunday about midday and she was gone she didnt have much in the way of baggage but what she had was away she left not a trace behind her no goodbye note no thanks for a great time no nothing did she have access to your stores while she was here sure she helped hughie check out some orders including the australian stuff aye i think so thats right dickson confirmed when was that last thursday said adams they wanted it delivered by friday for their rehearsals and she disappeared on sunday morning right did she take anything steal anything you mean no nothing the petty cash tin was there too wi twohundredodd quid in it but it was untouched you didnt see her leave mr dickson asked martin the man shook his head no i had nothing taste do wi her ahd rather have a good pint taste a blonde any day ah stayed out of her way as far as ah could martin looked back to adams how good a description can you give us try this five feet nine or ten shoulderlength hair blonde but dyed tanned all but her bum legs right up to her arse very narrow waist explosive hips firm bum wide shoulders good sized firm tits with wee pink nipples two moles low on her back appendix scar blue eyes wide mouth good teeth long eyelashes oh yes and very strong eh aye shes got exceptional strength on her for a woman she challenged me to armwrestle once i had a hell of a job getting her arm over and im no pussy he rolled up his shirt sleeve to display a massive forearm did she ever talk about herself not much she said she came from iowa that shed run away from home when she was sixteen seven years ago said shed been abused by her stepfather but that she didnt want to talk about it did you ever see her passport no right well need to get a technical team down here to go over the flat where she stayed will you show us now please adams led them out of the office and across the yard past mackies mondeo and past a silver audi which the detectives assumed belonged to adams a flight of narrow steps led up to the little flat which had only two rooms one was the main living area and the other which opened from it contained a single bed and a small wardrobe a shower room and toilet opened off the top of the stairs if this is our girl said mackie chances are shes wiped the place clean martin looked into the showerroom the toilet seat was up he turned to adams do you always leave it like that the man grinned aye bad habit of mine the wifes always getting on to me not so bad this time ill bet you we get a print off that if nowhere else six called just after four copies of the macdairmid tape had been rushed down on the pm shuttle carried by a special branch typist she had handed them over to a motorcyclist waiting at heathrow and they had reached their destinations by pm sorry to take so long to respond skinner thought for a moment that the deputy dg was joking but remembered that she had no sense of humour the woman was rarely flippant and most certainly never on a scrambled telephone it took us a little while because we believed we were listening to an arab but we were wrong the reason he sounds that way is because he learned his english in libya actually the subject is a peruvian our friend macdairmid has got himself into some seriously bad company the man on the telephone is jesus giminez she paused skinner knew the name at once he had been shown the file on giminez a legendary figure among the worlds security services the man was an international terror consultant wanted in many countries around the globe but most of all by the israelis he was known to be responsible either as hitman or as planner for a string of political assassinations over around thirty years his name had run like a scarlet thread around the worlds trouble spots until not long after the death of robert maxwell when he had vanished abruptly from the distant surveillance which the international intelligence community had managed to maintain tenuously for a quarter of a century some believed that he was dead but the most commonly held opinion was that at the age of fiftyfive he had decided to retire like any businessman might one of the most impressive things about giminez had always been his anonymity other terrorists had become household names but to the international media and to the world at large giminez had remained unknown of course we had no idea he was active again the deputy dg continued god knows what hes up to but an operation like the one youve got on just now is right up his street and if he was involved hed run it through someone just like macdairmid a radical frontman with an axe to grind one thing about giminez his only principle is money he works for cash only big cash so if hes a player someones paying him not less than seven figures sterling can you think of anyone in scotland with access to that sort of cash its possible but what about contact the mans a shadow so how do you set about hiring him he has an agent believe it or not or rather a string of them theyre contactable through officials of a certain middle eastern government with a very dark name for that sort of thing but if wasnt aware of that how could someone like macdairmid be in the know well he is an mp after all he does mooch around whitehall you can get anything there if you really want it of course maybe they approached macdairmid meaning meaning if your thing up there wasnt hatched in scotland at all not everybody loves us brits you should know that more than most suppose someone wanted to do us a really bad turn weve already got ireland on our hands as an endemic problem stir up scotland then the welsh then a bit of ethnic warfare in bradford or manchester say mix all together and britain would become ungovernable our economy our whole society would collapse you know bob i really do think you should catch these people andy martins guess had fallen just short of the mark his technicians found not one but two sources of fingerprints from the toilet seat the sceneofcrime team had lifted perfect prints of the thumb and first three fingers of what they suspected by taking and eliminating the prints of adams and dickson to have been mary mccails right hand and they had excelled themselves by taking from the toiletroll holder the thumb and first finger of her left hand everything else in the tiny garage apartment had been wiped clean meticulously and as was clear to the technicians by someone who had known exactly what she was doing martin and mackie had arrived back at fettes avenue with the prints at pm and had found skinner still in his office you say she split on sunday morning you think shes our woman then andy yes boss i do indeed i think that our mary deliberately gets herself tucked in beside randy old frank adams and has time to take her pick of the stuff hes got going out to festival companies she had a choice of seventeen customers she picks the aussies and plants her bomb in the radiogram with a timer set for mid show adams told us that she had a fringe programme in the flat and stays under cover in stow till last weekend she gives old frank one to remember her by then nips up to edinburgh on sunday morning either by bus or hitching and teams up with the rest of her team to kill poor hilary guillaum shes a big strong girl says frank well able to handle the knife work yes said skinner his eyes bright with interest it fits all right brian get out to the lab now if not sooner and compare those prints with everything we lifted from hilary guillaums suite at the sheraton and from that chambermaids trolley while youre at it dig up a technician and get me blowups of those prints top quality they can manage get back here as soon as you can ill be waiting well see if the states can help us adam arrow and gammy legge arrived together the two soldiers had met before in ireland and were resurrecting old stories as they walked into skinners office just after pm so put yourself in my place gammy there you are you search the fookin house when the fellas out and you find hidden in his fookin bedroom a bomb wi the timer set to go off in thirtysix hours i ask you what would you do i suppose id send for me what did you do ah but you werent about no i just moved the timer forward thirty hours and fooked off six hours later and so did e sound asleep in his bed smashin dream be must have ad skinner put his hands over his ears for gods sake adam keep those stories to yourself ill assume you made that one up the little man laughed course i did his eyes twinkled skinner decided not to pry further instead he gave each man a beer from the small fridge standing in a corner of his office and briefed them as they drank about the days discovery at stow does our assumption about the bomb sound right to you gammy could the timer have been set as accurately as that yes thats how shed have done it all right theyve got some really pricey timers these days although if she really knew what she was about she could have done it with the programming chip from a video so in theory we could have sleeper semtex bombs lying around all over edinburgh christ thats all we need ah but in practice its a different matter how come thanks to some technical spec the manufacturers sent me ive been able to work out how much of this supersemtex stuff was used in each of our two explosions the good news is that the total matches exactly the quantity nicked from that french arsenal add the fact that all of the rest of the world supply is accounted for and in safe hands and we reach the conclusion that as far as this supersemtex is concerned the bastards are out of ammo thats a relief but what if they have conventional explosive maybe there are still sleeper bombs lying around if there are said legge then our dogsll be able to smell them or well be able to pick them out with some other little tricks that we have weve already given every festival venue a really thorough sniffing and well keep on doing so on a regular basis skinner looked across at arrow all that makes our friends meeting on saturday even more interesting the little soldier nodded but major legge looked puzzled until skinner described the surveillance of macdairmid without actually naming him arrow cut in did you find out who the other fooker was on the line skinner nodded but said nothing instead he slapped a thick folder which lay on his desk it was labelled most secret and had arrived by courier from mi only two hours earlier it contained the career history of jesus giminez arrow raised his eyebrows but asked no more questions well said legge good luck to you cloakanddagger johnnies tell you one thing though if your geezer is expecting another consignment of those special fireworks then hes likely to be disappointed unless theres a second factory that no one knows about because no one else is keen to be caught with their drawers down like the french were hah skinner snorted brave words gammy but from what weve seen so far of this outfit someones arse is going to be exposed to the four winds the two soldiers had been gone for only ten minutes when brian mackie returned with blowups of the six mary mccall fingerprints he brought too the opinion of the technicians that a fragment of a print taken from the chambermaids trolley in the sheraton hotel could have come from her right hand thats a start said skinner now lets see how far our luck will run he led the way along the corridor to the special branch suite past the duty officer in the outer area and into martins empty office a fax machine with a scrambled line sat on a table iii the corner skinner picked up its telephone handset and dialled in a london number fbi skinner was always struck by the frankness of the americans they knew and valued the respect in which the bureau was held around the world and were never shy of announcing its presence even in foreign countries joe doherty was the fbis senior man in europe based at the embassy in grosvenor square he had looked skinner up on a tour of special branch heads when first posted to the uk in and they had been in touch ever since you dragged yourself in then said skinner yup i said i would but this better be worth it lets hope so joe im going to fax you down six fingerprints id like you to scan them into your magic machine the one that connects back to the states and see what it tells you if it tells you anything at all that is ill wait here youll get me on andy martins direct line he gave him the number ok bob said doherty go for it skinner loaded the fax selected halftone quality and keyed in the fbis london number the six pages took just over five minutes to transmit he settled down to wait brian this could take a while you can go home if you want no way boss i want to see what he turns up on martins office television they watched the remainder of news at ten then midweek football rangers were two down in a league cup tie to motherwell skinners team when the telephone rang bugger it he swore but switched off the television set as he picked up the receiver bob dohertys excitement rang down the line taking skinner by surprise know who youve got there typhoid friggin mary thats all and who the hell is she typhoid mary little horse one of the most celebrated members of the american underclass hitwoman bankrobber political activist terrorist highly skilled with firearms knives and explosives you name it thats typhoid mary deadly is her middle name she styles herself a native american freedom fighter but shes just a plain killer we lost sight of her when she broke out of jail in kansas last year so whats she into over here as quickly as he could skinner explained the detail of the music hall bomb and summarised adams story when he had finished doherty whistled loudly down the line thats mary both times shes great with explosives and she likes to kill people but ill tell you this bob if she has scotch blood then youre a friggin sioux indian doherty paused then went on couple of things for your mr adams first the moderately good news not everything she told him was a lie she was indeed raped by her stepdaddy when she was sweet sixteen and she did indeed run away from home the detail that she left out was that before she ran away she cut his heart out and i mean that literally my friend sounds like our friend frank might have been lucky well no bob you cant exactly say that for now comes the really bad news for the adams family mary can kill you in a whole lot of ways but in one thats the most certain of all she can kill you with her snatch without you even being there like shes probably killed mrs adams by now through her poor sap of a husband her nicknames an understatement weve got marys prison medical records bob shes hiv positive look ill fax you up her picture better find her man before she screws the whole of scotland to death so thats the story so far alan a scots mp mixed up with an international terrorist and a crazy squaw killing people all over edinburgh the secretary of state looked stunned he leaned back in his chair and stared for several seconds up at the ceiling affording skinner a clear view of a large bruise perhaps the size of a thumbprint on the right side of his throat eventually he looked back across the desk their sunday confrontation had not been mentioned but a coldness hung between them one which each man knew would never dissipate completely this mi womans theory what do you make of it mary little horse showing up makes it the best one weve got you can count on the fingers of two hands the people in scotland who could afford to fund this thing and still have three fingers left over i know i have counted then you can rule out all of them as being too old too straight too boring too lawabiding none of the radical groups have the dough either yes alan it all fits so what do you do now well im holding my morning briefing in an hour ive got crown office permission to issue photographs of mary little horse and to put out a do not approach warning as he spoke skinner opened the folder on his lap and handed across the desk a copy of the computergenerated print which joe doherty had faxed to him ballantyne looked at it and saw an attractive blonde girl expressionless in the standard prison mugshot ill leave out the hiv bit skinner went on stows only a wee place and im sure the story of adams and the yankee dollybird will be all over town already the press coverage will produce a ton of calls all of them rubbish no doubt but if the heat makes her run for it itll have served its purpose if i cant catch her here id rather she was somewhere else he paused and looked ballantyne in the eye but even if we do get rid of this girl that doesnt solve our problem shes a mercenary and someones brought her here to do a job there may well be others and we have got to expect other attacks with that semtex stuff used up im less worried about more bomb attacks but there are other things they can get up to like picking out more bigname assassination targets for example there are two events that really worry me one is fringe sunday and the others the fireworks concert in princes street gardens on the last thursday of the festival ones held in a park the other takes place after dark and theyre both too big for us to give them total protection so i want to cancel them both ballantyne sat bolt upright in his chair absolutely not ive made my position and the governments position quite clear on that we will do nothing that concedes an inch to these people they cannot be allowed to claim a single victory through the threat of more violence these events will go on as scheduled and its the job of your team and of your force to police them better still its your own job to catch these perpetrators youve shown me some progress but now i expect more concrete successes protection and detection thats what i want to hear from you bob not retreat and vacillation it was skinners turn to jerk upright in his chair an angry retort formed on his lips but was stilled as he realised that something else was troubling ballantyne by now he knew the man well enough to read like a book the ups and downs of his personality and he sensed clearly a second layer of concern beyond the festival crisis alan is there anything else that you want to tell me he probed the secretary of state sighed and slammed his right fist into hi left palm oh damn it yes bob look im sorry i was so sharp thereyoure right i have another problem you heard about my trip to london yesterday skinner nodded in silence my wife has been absolutely devastated by the death of her shall we say friend she regards it as some sort of punishment upon her the upshot is she announced to me last night that she intends to resume our marriage to make a fresh start mm said skinner i can see that might be a problem i had a talk with carlie alan for security purposes you understand i know the situation yes but you dont know about this he produced a brown manila envelope from his desk drawer and pushed it across to skinner who picked it up and shook out a letter the salutation was the same as the earlier communications but the message was different skinner read it quickly attached is a photograph of the lady with whom you have been carrying on a liaison we have others of you both which are more explicit and in which the press will be interested accede to our demands ballantyne or the people of scotland will learn what a dishonourable man you are clipped to the letter was a photograph of carlie leaving number charlotte square by the back door what do they mean other pictures alan havent a clue bob why would they do that anyway keeping up the pressure alan on you on me on us all they know were unlikely to ask for media help on this one im afraid youre just going to have to take it on the chin when they show us what theyve got is there nothing i can do yes you have a choice announce that your marriage is over and that carlie is the next mrs ballantyne or get her out of the country the mary little horse story caused a sensation at the thursday morning briefing even without the intimate details of her relationship with frank adams skinners carefully worded statement warning the public to be on the lookout for the woman together with her photograph caught the media corps off guard so where does that put your investigation with some of his belligerence recovered al neidermeyer put the first question it puts a new slant on it thats for sure inevitably you have to be a bit sceptical about the real nature of a socalled patriotic organisation that gets itself involved with a foreign criminal like typhoid mary skinner saw the eyes of the sun reporter seated in the front row light up at his use of her nickname i regard this as significant progress for legal reasons i cant go into much detail but we need to talk with this woman urgently in connection with the death of hilary guillaum and the waltzing matilda bombing shes a striking girl the sort who stands out in a crowd she is also very very dangerous i am assured by thefbi so any member of the public who thinks theyve spotted her should give us a call at once but otherwise leave her well alone reported sightings of typhoid mary began to flood the fettes switchboard from the moment the first reports were broadcast indeed the earliest claims were made even before the first edition of the evening news had hit the streets giving her photograph pageone prominence as skinner had surmised all the calls were fruitless members of the public from as far afield as barra and lerwick called in to declare that they had seen the native american fugitive but although these sightings were all followed up none was even close to the mark the only action that the police saw was when a young lady with a pronounced sloane ranger accent was detained in shetland before being identified as the daughter of a minor peer on a backpacking tour of the scottish islands as thursday stretched into friday with no sign of further action by the fighters skinner was able to report an incidentfree twentyfour hours at the next mornings briefing when skinner returned from the friday press conference he found alex waiting in his office as he entered the room she jumped up and rushed across to him s hi pops i he took her into his arms and hugged her i pops im sorry youre under all this pressure and i behave like a selfish lovesick cow i am really really sorry am i forgiven his face lit up as he smiled at her suddenly the world was a better place yeah just this once ill let you off with a caution how are you and the boy getting on fine ingos great hes so bright and i just love him to bits dont worry though im not going to do anything daft like rushing off to sweden with him ive got a degree to finish first and a diploma to get after that hes got his course to finish too once hes done that he says hell find a job in britain in the theatre if nothing else and we can be together for good in spite of his misgivings about the swede bob grinned sounds like youve got his life thoroughly organised for him just like you organised mine for twenty years exactly but youve got someone else to do that for you now even andy i hear from sarah may have found the love of his life i have to have someone to look after well babe all i ask is that you look after yourself as well in fact put yourself first for a while he decided it was time to change the subject hows your play then we must pay it another visit were doing great it wont be announced in the scotsman till tomorrow but weve won a fringe award why dont you come to the sunday show its being presented then sunday bob referred to his memory for a second sorry cant do that sarahs got tickets for le cirque mobile or something down on leith links tonight were doing a movie with andy and julia his new girlfriend and tomorrow he paused for a second tomorrow i might be busy so well come some time next week alex did not notice his momentary preoccupation le cirque ive heard of them theyre all bikers or something like that arent they theyre supposed to be terrific well see he said although his tone implied doubt all that carbon monoxide inside a tent doesnt sound too great to me id rather be at your show darling believe me but sarahs dead keen on it alex laughed itu be all right sarah can pick em you know well look pops if i dont see you at the theatre ill look out for you at fringe sunday no his sudden vehemence stopped her in her tracks look babe do just one thing for your old man steer well clear of fringe sunday but why all the gang are going just for me give it a miss she looked hard at him you think something bad might happen do you know something lets just say ill feel happier if i know i dont have to look out for you there well my old dad if it makes you feel happier ill give it a miss promise she stood on tiptoe kissed him on the forehead and flitted out of the room waving goodbye sir james proud was the last man he had expected to see that morning or so skinner told himself at first but when he thoughtfl about it later he realised that he had not been in the least surprised when his door burst open to reveal the chief constables ample frame proud jimmy as he was known throughout his force looked as imposing as ever in full uniform chief what the hell are you doing here you know bloody fine said sir james proud i couldnt settle for a moment out there knowing all this nonsense was going on back home eventually it all got too much for her ladyship yesterday morning she said to me jimmy thats it im packing and were going to the airport get your gold cardji ready so here i am skinner smiled at him he realised at that moment just how much he had missed the solid support and advice of sir james proud well im sorry it had to happen that way but by god im glad youre back so whats been happening quickly skinner updated him on the crisis he showed him the mi file on jesus giminez and the fbi sheet on mary little horse i am impressed said the chief you seem to draw these people bob like a flame attracts moths so now im back what can i do how can i help you can chair tomorrow mornings press conference for a start ill be busy doing something else ill have a member of parliament to arrest neil mcllhenney was impressed by macdainnids choice of meetingplace edinburgh born and bred he had never heard of the kelvingrove art gallery and museum far less visited it so when he ambled up the red sandstone steps and into the cathedral like central hall with its massive pipe organ at the far end he was taken by surprise by its elegance and its scale neil had always liked organ music and the fact that he had arrived in the middle of the friday afternoon recital made the job the highlight of his week in glasgow the tap had picked up grant macdairmid on the pub telephone as he set up his assignation at kelvingrove his call had been brief and to the point cassie grant here look i need you to run another message for me meet me this afternoon fourthirty kelvingrove art gallery haggerty had instructed barry macgregor to tail the mp from his office to the meetingplace while mcllhenney had been sent on ahead wooden seats were set out in rows across the hall those near the front were well filled but in the row second from the back a girl sat alone roundshouldered but relaxed in a pale blue tshirt mcllhenney looked at the back other head and wondered rather than take a seat he wandered across to one of the display cases in an area off the hall it was filled with an assortment of cromwellian armour outofplace somehow in a glasgow setting he could observe the main door from the far side of the glass case and so macdairmid did not see him as he glanced all around the hall on his arrival satisfied the mp moved swiftly down the hall and made his way calmly between the seats towards the girl mcllhenney noticed that he was carrying a black briefcase macgregor entered a few seconds later and sat down in the back row a comfortable distance away from the couple he had untied his ponytail and his long hair with its whitebeaded plaits fell around his shoulders he wore a crewnecked short sleeved shirt over faded jeans split at the knee mcllhenney looked at him and smiled crime squad throws up some sights right enough he whispered to himself the meeting lasted only a few minutes neither detective dared edge close enough to hear the conversation but from what they could see it was onesided macdairmid doing all the talking less than five minutes after he had entered the mp stood up and made his way out of the gallery without the black briefcase neither detective made a move to follow him they knew that glasgow officers were waiting outside at each exit from the gallery ready to pick up macdairmids trail instead they stayed as ordered with the girl she had little taste either it seemed for the fine organ music for three minutes later she too rose to go the briefcase looked heavy in her right hand outside she made quickly for the car park where she unlocked the door of a battered green metro she heaved the case on to the passenger seat before jumping in and driving off braided hair flying behind him macgregor sprinted over to mcllhenneys astra and jumped in as the older man revved the engine and set off after the girl registration d qqs barked mcllhenney call it in using the car telephone rather than radio macgregor waited on the line while the number was checked eventually he said got that and put the phone back in its magnetic cradle its his sister neil the buggers using his own sister on a pickup the metros registered to cassandra macdairmid date of birth june listed address dundonald road partickhill in that case shes going home said mcllhenney turning the astra into dundonald road a adam arrow mario mcguire and maggie rose were all in position in the chapter one coffee shop on the first floor of james thin in george street well before cassie macdairmid climbed the staircase at am they were seated several tables apart wearing a light cotton jacket arrow looked for all the world like a tourist as he sat reading the saturday telegraph his view extended from the top of the stairs and into the second room of the cafeteria he could see mcguire and rose at their table through the open doorway which connected the cafes two rooms they looked for all the world like a thirtysomething edinburgh couple which in fact they were out on a mornings shopping expedition maggies marks spencer carrier bag containing a few purchases made earlier that day added authenticity they recognised cassie macdairmid as soon as she entered not only from the description given by mcllhenney and macgregor but from the heavy black briefcase which she carried in her right aand it tugged her shoulder down slightly as she moved arrows eyes were fixed on her back as she passed through the doorway past mcguire and rose who seemed to take no notice of her she made her way to the service counter where she bought a cappuccino and a slab of thick brown cake with difficulty she carried them and the briefcase in the direction of a table somewhere to the left of mcguire and rose but out of arrows line of sight if being inconspicuous was part of the other messengers brief then thought arrow he was inept at it he wore the loudest blackandwhite check woollen jacket that arrow had ever seen on a man with bright yellow polyester trousers his lank jetblack hair which emphasised his sallow complexion looked as if it had been cut by a blind man apart from the fact that he looked so out of place it was his briefcase which marked him out immediately as their second target it was identical to that which cassie macdairmid had brought with her from glasgow arrow studied his telegraph intently as the man looked quickly round the room and clearly having seen nothing to alarm him moved through towards the service counter he purchased a coke and holding the bottle looked round once more at last his eyebrows rose briefly in recognition as arrow guessed he caught sight of cassie macdairmid the messenger moved towards her table may i join you he heard him asking in a hispanic accent just as he disappeared from view arrow switched his gaze to mcguire and rose ready to take his cue from them five minutes had passed before he saw maggie rose make at sudden slight movement in his direction with her left hand the little soldier stood up and moved towards the wide doorway just as the man appeared in it arrow noticed at once that this time he was holding his briefcase in his left hand while the other was plunged deep in the voluminous pocket of his jacket as the two mens eyes met the right hand started to move arrow stepped in close and fast with his left hand he grabbed the mans right wrist and immobilised it just as the gun came into sight at the same time the hard edge of his right hand smashed across the messengers windpipe with a choking sound the man dropped his briefcase and crumpled to the floor arrow ripped the gun from his grasp and let his wrist go he stepped over the writhing popeyed form and through the doorway maggie rose was holding cassie macdairmid down in her chair by the shoulders the woman looked terrified mcguire held the second briefcase he was about to open it when arrow called to him no mario leave that for major legge he should have arrived outside by now lets get the public out of here and fetch him in gammy legge shook his head no damned explosive ive ever seen looks like that he stood in the second inner room of the james thin coffeeshop still wearing his heavy black blast armour you can come up now he called loudly footsteps sounded on the stairs and a few seconds later arrow rose and mcguire appeared together in the doorway the black briefcase which the man had brought with him lay open on the table it was full to the brim with fistsized packages wrapped in brown paper legge had slit one open and held it in the palm of his hand what is it asked arrow buggered if i know old son but it isnt explosive maggie rose took the parcel from him she looked at the powder inside and sniffed youre wrong there major she said quietly this stuffs explosive all right its highoctane and very dirtylooking heroin i am assistant chief constable robert skinner and i dont believe im saying this but grant forrest macdainnid i am arresting you on suspicion of being a party to the illegal importation into the united kingdom of a controlled substance namely heroin and of being involved in its illegal sale you have the right to silence but i must caution you that if you do say anything it will be taken down and may be used against you macdainnid looked from skinner to willie haggerty and back again in blankfaced astonishment as soon as the call had come through from maggie rose they had gone in four of them mcllhenney and macgregor made up the quartet and all but skinner were carrying firearms they had brought a search warrant and even as skinner cautioned macdainnid the two detective constables were beginning to take his flat apart seems you didnae reform after all grant the intensely angry edge to haggertys tone was one that skinner had never heard from him before there was a passion in it which was totally unexpected in the normally cynical worldly glaswegian ah remember you as a tearaway wi yir heavies and yir dirty wee protection racket ah wis one of the team that lifted ye the last time but ye wont remember that there were we thinkin that yed seen the light but ye had us kidded on all along you never gave it up did ye you jist got dirtier how did ye get taste be an mp how did ye get away wi that most people in glasgow are just as thick as you so it wasnt difficult there was contempt in macdainnids voice haggertys fury was ready to erupt he took a pace towards the man his heavy fists balled but skinner held him back youre the thickhead in this room pal skinner said with all thats going on just now you should have known that wed have been on you like bluebottles on a turd yet you still got involved in this deal you must be fucking mad as he said this it occurred to him suddenly that he might well be right for a man in his predicament macdainnids arrogance seemed beyond belief dont count your chickens skinner i want my lawyer here now i bet that any evidence you have against me wont be admissible in court once im out ill crucify you the next election isnt that far off you know i expect to be a scottish office minister once its over then youll see with lazy strength skinner picked macdainnid up and slammed him against the wall hard the back of his head cracked against the plaster listen boy to what you are he said in a controlled steady voice you are a fucking horse trader youre a heroin dealer you are less than dogshit on my shoe make no mistake you are going away for a long long time there is someone in this room whos an expert with a hammer and nails and youre looking at him but before your public crucifixion in the high court youre going to tell me how a glasgow snotrag like you comes to be mixed up in a drugs deal with jesus giminez international terrorist numero uno how do you think old jesus is going to like having had his messenger his two hundred grand and his drugs all nicked maybe i will let you go and see just how long you survive personally i wouldnt give you a month as macdainnid stared at him fear and amazement replaced the bellicosity what the hell do you mean whos this jesus whateveryoucalledhim ive never heard of him my only contact was some colombian even then we only spoke over the phone and only ever on secure lines macdairmid was convicting himself with every word but he cared not a bit not as secure as you thought said skinner we heard you talking to giminez he was identified by the best you wouldnt believe some of the heavyweight things hes done so whys he messing himself with a wee shite like you thats what youre going to tell me and bloody fast too he let go of macdainnids shirt front youve got some serious talking to do before the days out but not here ill see you again through in edinburgh neil barry finish up here and take mr macdairmid mp though to fettes his lawyer can see him there hed better be bloody good though macdairmid was handcuffed and the two detective constables hustled him away well sir said haggerty we didnae expect all this did we no we bloody did not fucking ironic willie isnt it you and i have just made whai for most coppers would be the arrest of a lifetime yet here we an well me at least absolutely pissed off we started of thinking that macdairmid was our best lead to the fighters foi fucking freedom now we find hes just another drugdealer look at the time we spent on it a great result sure and im glad that stuff isnt going to hit the street but as far as our main business in concerned were right back to square one skinner was passing shawhead on the drive back to edinburgh when brian mackies call came through boss this is incredible i thought youd want to know right away the lab boys ran a quick test on a sample of macdairmids heroin their reports just arrived that stuff is lethal first of all its so pure that your average addict would off himself with just one fix and as if that wasnt enough theres something else in there too they havent isolated it yet but it seems to act as a catalyst to turn the heroin into pure poison thats what macdairmid was going to spread all over glasgow holy christ brian look dont let anyone say anything about it to our man i want to break that piece of news myself what about his sister she saying anything since her arrest she cant stop crying she says she knows nothing about anything but how many times have we heard that before she swears she hadnt a clue about the heroin she says she thought she was picking up hot cash from libya to fund some leftwing newspaper and that the briefcase she brought with her was just a dummy for a swop weighted down to make it look authentic what about the messenger he definitely isnt saying anything he tried to pull a gun on captain arrow the wee man hit him so hard he smashed his voicebox hed have died if sarah hadnt been with the emergency team outside she did an emergency tracheotomy she kept him alive but she reckons he might never speak again hes in intensive care ok brian thanks be back soon next from the car he called six then joe doherty who for once had been spending a weekend at home when he broke the news it was the first time that skinner had ever heard doherty rattled christ bob you really mean that giminez is running poisoned smack i gotta feed that back to the bureau and the dba suppose hes doing that in the states as well you any idea how many people you could kill with a case full of poison as many as there are needles to go round my friend good luck the sentinel broke the carlie story on sunday morning bob and sarah were still asleep when the telephone rang it was ballantyne in a panic which verged on hysteria first bob calmed him down then he dressed and drove down to the newsagent at the nearby road junction to pick up a copy of the newspaper the sentinel was a new independent scottish sunday tabloid launched three months earlier and already struggling for survival the candid backdoor shot was there all right but much more serious there was a second photograph taken with a long lens through an upper floor window which showed clearly the secretary of state and his lady in a fond embrace fortunately skinner thought as he studied it they were both fully clothed mystery blonde in ballantyne lovenest screamed the headline crediting the fighters for an independent scotland as the source of the photographs and printing in full their denunciation of ballantyne however in neither the statement nor the sentinels subsequent story was carlie identified as sarah sat down to read the story and study the photographs skinner called ballantyne back on the kitchen phone alan im sorry for you but this isnt one that i can help you with theyve broken no law here any paparazzi could have done that and im surprised that no one has before now best thing you can do is call mike licorish and ask him if hell stretch the rules and issue a personal statement for you but bob my career alan with respect you should have thought of that before what you do now is up to you and your conscience youre either a man or youre a weasel i know what i think you are its up to you to prove me right or wrong as he hung the phone up he noticed that sarah was looking at him in astonishment but he shook his head and said no more an hour later as they were clearing away the breakfast dishes the telephone rang again this time it was michael licorish bob i thought youd like to hear this before it goes out you listening skinner grunted its a statement by the secretary of state it reads mrs ballantyne and i deprecate the publication in this mornings press of photographs of our close friend miss charlotte mays and the libellous story which accompanied them one of these photographs was particularly intrusive in that it shows miss mays comforting me immediately after i had received the sad and unexpected news of the death of another close family friend lord broadgate mrs ballantyne and i wish to make clear that if there iff any further publication of these photographs or these allegations we will pursue libel actions against the perpetrators with the fuuf rigour of the law what do you think of that jesus thats our man all right wheres carlie now on a plane heading for thestates s of s bought the ticket isnt he just the ticket himself eh cheers mike he hung up sarah reaching up to put two mugs away in a high cupboard looked across at him well which is he then i was right enough hes a fucking weasel i the full team police and sas backup gathered in the fettes hall at am long after the last journalists had left the regular morning briefing for the newsmen the highlight had been skinners brief and completely unexpected statement that grant macdairmid mp and his sister cassandra had been arrested along with a third man identity as yet unknown and charged with possession of heroin with intent to supply faced with a threat by skinner of prosecution for attempted murder macdairmid on the advice of his lawyer had made a full formal statement at am he had said that his contacts in london had taken him to meet a man in a pub a libyan who had told him that he had a connection to some cheap highquality drugs macdairmid had also admitted that he had been dealing for some years the contact had given him a number in colombia and he had talked price with the man there the supplier had explained that he routed the heroin in through france and across the channel easy since the borders had been opened macdairmid had decided to take a trial shipment and had done well out of it he had agreed to take a second batch bigger this time he had been astonished at the mans low price the same thought had occurred to skinner two hundred thousand for a caseload of heroin was bargain basement but now skinners full attention was turned to his briefing for the fringe sunday event from the rows of theatre seating which had been set out for the press twenty serious faces looked back at him among them was sarahs he had attempted to persuade her that she would not be needed and that her presence would be a personal distraction to him but she had been adamant you included me in this team that means all the way now he fixed his troubled gaze upon her as he stood up behind his desk to address the team well ladies and gentlemen let me begin by giving it to you straight this is going to be the devils own job to police even in a normal year fringe sunday gives your average pickpocket an orgasm just thinking about it this time well for our army friends who may be new to the festival let me explain what happens fringe sunday is the one major gathering of all the fringe performers giving the public a chance to see them closeup and to sample their shows youll all by now have seen what happens at the foot of the mound every lunchtime and youll have an idea of the crowds that gather there well this event attracts about forty to fifty times that number it takes place in holyrood park its open to the public and its absolutely free weve only been able to guess at the possible numbers but the experienced boys in operations reckon that there could be as many as one hundred thousand there given a fine day and this will be as fine a day as you could ask for ive checked the forecast and theres no chance of the weather breaking for a few days yet you might expect the crowd to be less today with all thats happened lets hope thats right but its been nearly a week since the last major incident the press are even beginning to suggest that the enemy has shot his bolt skinner paused to look around the hall dont you believe it these people want something big theyve had access to stateoftheart equipment and to people who know how to use it mario mcguire cut in theyre claiming they want an independent scotland are you saying it might be something else theyre after thats what im beginning to wonder yes how come we dont have a clue as to who they are we led ourselves well and truly up the garden path with macdairmid all our known agitators have checked out clean even that daft hack frazer pagett there is something else mario i feel it in my water maybe its really us theyre after i us yes the police authority maybe thats what its all about he turned back to the group but thats irrelevant for now today weve got to be fully on guard against another terrorist attack thats our job fringe sunday presents a big target and so far thats the pattern theyve followed big attentiongrabbing events there are four official entrances to holyrood park well have uniformed officers guarding them all and there will be plenty others among the crowds the sight of all those flat hats might have a deterrent effect but just in case it doesnt i want you there too all of you armed and ready to react in whatever way seems necessary you will all wear sunglasses and one of these he held up a small small lapel pin in the shape of a golden lion so that if there is trouble the uniforms will be able to tell the difference between the terrorists and the good guys if we have action and you sas people get involved then please leave the scene as soon as its over we dont want any of you identified by anyone i take that very seriously the uniformed detachment all ninetyfive of them arc being given their briefing separately for that very reason by the way people the uniformed detachment is led by the chief the deputy and the other two accs will be there too i want you to know that the command suite is leading from the front on this one he looked around the room once more any questions no one answered good lets go the group began to break up and heyl twenty faces turned back towards him he was grinning be careful out there as skinner was heading for the exit he was stopped by the chiefconstables staff officer a uniformed superintendent sorry sir but before you leave could you please call mr doherty hes in his office he said you would know who he is thanks malcolm skinner sprinted up the stairs to his office and punched in joe dohertys number on the secure line joe what can i do for you just listen thats all i have a story to tell you about giminez and your friend macdairmid the patsy ive found out who was i behind it all skinner sensed that doherty was spinning out the suspense joe come on for fucks sake ive got a crisis here the fbi man laughed so have some cousins of mine ok ill get to the point its the cia theyve been running giminez what yeah to be exact its one man a crazy hawk at langley called goodman it seems that at some point during the last administration the president was being given an interdepartmental briefing on the drugs problem and he made some sort of throwaway remark along the lines of if someone would just go away and come up with a miracle cure for all this what a goddamned hero hed be a bit like your henry ii wishing to berid of that turbulent priest of his so goodmans at the meeting and his crazy little mind starts to work he figures well never kill all the colombians and the burmese or torch all their crops so what we have to do is discredit their product the health agencies all over the world have been saying it fof years if you touch smack or coke you will die eventually to an addict that just aint true weve had a boom in the di market and in all the other crime that runs alongside it goodman figures that what hes got to do is make the u believe if you touch heroin or smack you will die now n second chance then he does some more thinking and comes up with giminez the cia have been running him for years doing all sorts of things that we wont go into goodman tells him what he wants giminez says ok gimme da money i do it but itll take time goodman siphons off dough from a big cia slush fund giminez drops out of sight and stays in deep cover for years what hes been doing is one hes been building up supplies of horse and coke two putting some of the worlds finest illicit chemists to work in making them lethal and three and most recently setting up relationships with dealers around the world like your mp friend all of them greedy and in the market for cheap supplies say bob being an mp thats pretty good cover eh the final stage of the plan and its a beauty i have to say is that giminez through his network feeds the marks a little good stuff to whet their appetites and get the street excited then drops the bomb with the big shipment end result is dead users all around the world stories leaked to the press mass panic and everyone too scared to touch the stuff like ever again time was ebbing away but skinner was fascinated so how did you get on to goodman i passed the name giminez on to langley they found the slush money traced the payment to goodman and used all means necessary to make him talk so how do they stop it god knows maybe they cant goodman doesnt know names or even how many macdairmids there are and the cia cant get to giminez anyway hes operating blind broke contact with goodman long ago all the cia can do now is put the word out on the street and tell the colombians about giminez in the hope that they can stop him but maybe they wont do that either because goddamn it crazy goodmans crazy idea could actually work i did hear that the dba cant figure out whether to give you a medal for uncovering this whole operation or put a contract out on you meantime interpol has started to log reports from hamburg of dozens of coke users some of them top people suddenly winding up dead all over the city and somehow i doubt if thatll be the last we hear of giminez and his special deliveries hope your crisis up in scotland turns out to be a damn sight easier to solve skinners mind whirled with the consequences of dohertys story as he headed off towards holyrood park in his bmw on the heels of his squad the park is in a sense the biggest back garden in scotland within its grounds behind a high grey wall stands the palace of holyroodhouse modest in size but rich in history four centuries ago as the machinations of the court of the doomed mary queen of scots tore her country apart it was a place of intrigue and murder today it stands largely unchanged as the official residence in scotland of her heirs and successors and as a venue for great gatherings of heads of government though holyrood is a royal park in status in practice it is one of edinburghs favourite and largest public open spaces covering well over a square mile of greenlands with three small lochs which provide lodgings for dozens of swans geese and ducks with literally thrown in a constant supply of food from children and tourists holyrood park is dominated by arthurs seat an extinct volcano from whose vantage point the legendary king is said to have overlooked the first dwellings of what was to become thef beautiful city of edinburgh dark age overtones continue to cling to the ancient hill as he looked up at it in the fine august morning sunshine skinner recalled with a tug at his heart another morning twenty years earlier when he had walked with his first wife myra the baby alexis cradled in her arms to the summit with dozens of other parents to wash in the midsummer morning dew he closed his eyes for a moment and could see again the clear vision of myra gently dabbing her babys face and saying softly there thatll guard her beauty for life she had beei right in her prediction for alex but sadly life had not been longj for myra skinner tore himself back to the present and surveyed the royal park it was stih well short of midday but thousands of people were there already congregating on the flatter grassland around the palace and beyond towards the park wall and the grey tenements of royal park terrace at intervals flatbacked lorries and other temporary staging had been set up to provide venues for impromptu performances by fringe players he noted with approval the numbers of police caps which could be seen in the crowd occasionally he saw casually dressed figures looking around observantly through their sunglasses and caught the glint of gold on their chests the first performers arrived just after midday a student revue from oxford university they set out their props on one of the lorry stages and soon gathered a crowd as they began to perform snatches of their show involving the audience whenever they ould gradually more and more spectators and more and more layers filled the park until by pm it was thronged with happy folk singing playing and laughing in the sunshine the only people there who could not relax were skinners plainclothes team the sas soldiers and the ninetyfive policemen and policewomen in uniform who continued to mingle with the crowd he was standing with sarah some way off when it happened a few minutes earlier a wide circle had opened amid the crowd perhaps one hundred and fifty yards across a motorcycle had roared into life then another then a third and a fourth its le cirque mobile sarah cried lets have a look but he had held her back seeing no easy way through the thick crowd so sarah had stretched on tiptoe catching only glimpses of the riders lightweight helmets and occasionally the clown makeup on their faces as they bucked and twisted their bikes in wheelies or left the ground in acrobatic leaps skinner was looking away when he heard the first screams and sarah grasped his arm tightly he looked round to see the wide circle of spectators burst apart as one of the riders revved his bike and roared through them steering with his left hand alone the bike carved a swathe amid the diving people as it ploughed through the panicking crowd it headed straight towards a wide platform stage on which a group of dancers were performing dressed in a colourful folk costume one by one they stopped and stared as the cyclist roared towards them they could only look on frozen with shock as he threw the object which he held aloft in his free right hand the grenade exploded in midair among the dancers bodies flew everywhere and a fine red mist seemed to hang in the air for a second or two as the screaming erupted and escalated skinner running now towards the scene saw the motorcyclist veer away from the makeshift stage pulling a squat ugly gun from his jacket there was something about his movement about the way he handled his bike which made bob certain that this was the same man who had shot at him in charlotte square but this time he was carrying an automatic machinepistol as he roared through the scattering crowd towards the meadowbank gateway he sprayed fire from right to left and back again to his horror skinner saw young barry macgregor go tumbling backwards gun in hand blood spraying from his throat and then the man had broken through the last of the crowd the bike accelerated towards the exit the rider steering now with both hands he had thrown the gun spent on the grass behind him it was a hell of a shot they all agreed later brian mackie fired only once technically skinner might have rebuked him for failing first to call out identifying himself as an armed police officer but in the circumstances he decided to let this pass the riders back arched and his arms flew wide as the bullet cut through his spine he seemed to rise out of the saddle and to hang cruciform in midair for a second before falling almost gracefully on to his back at the same time the front wheel of the motorcycle reared up and the whole machine spun in a grotesque somersault crashing handlebars first to the ground with its engine still roaring a few feet away from its spreadeagled rider skinner ignored the biker and ran instead towards barry macgregor as soon as he reached him he realised that there was no hope the young man was convulsing blood pumped from an awful wound in his throat squirting through his fingers as he struggled in vain to stem its flow and running down his neck and shoulders to stain his braided hair sarah arrived only seconds later but even in that time the last of the life had ebbed from the boys body for a time skinner knelt beside him blood on his hands and tears in his eyes though his jaw was set firm when eventually sarah took him by the shoulders and drew him gently to his feet she found on his face an expression which she had never seen before not his not bobs but that of someone she did not know at all suddenly in the stillness and silence which surrounded their little tableau she felt very frightened fear for her husband and for a flash fear of him and yet not him of someone cold vengeful and absolutely deadly who dwelt within him bob isnt that our clown remember on saturday the one on the unicycle at the mound with the leaflets it could be love could be but i do know i saw him somewhere else that same day skinner had banished his grief and rage and looked his normal self again controlled hardened against the horror and deferring his time of mourning until the job was done they were standing with andy martin and brian mackie in the area which bad been cordoned off around the motorcycle assassin a hundred yards away sir james proud stood at the head of an honour guard over the body of young barry macgregor as his officers cleared the park slowly of public and performers i in contrast to the stillness of the two groups the ambulance crews were working feverishly to tend the casualties there were some who were as far beyond help as barry macgregor four of the six members of the belorussian folk ensemble the onstage targets of the grenade attack lay sprawled in death the lucky survivors were already in an ambulance which was screaming its way out of the park towards the royal infirmary its blue lights whirling three members of the crowd had been killed including a baby still clutched in the arms of her stunned mother and fourteen others wounded either by the explosions deadly shrapnel i or by gunfire i the motorcylist in his turn was very dead one or two colleagues had bestowed on brian mackie the nickname dirty harry because of his legendary prowess with various firearms on the rifle range at st leonards police station but brian never acknowledged the title nor played up to it in any way not for him the dint eastwood stride or throwaway lines about days made brian took his role as an expert marksman very seriously indeed it was an important part of his job as a policeman and not the subject for humour on the one occasion in his career when he had been called on to fire at a human target his disciplined approach ensured that his reaction had been instant emotionless and absolutely effective afterwards his conscience had been untroubled he had not as he said once in answer to andy martins question lost a single nights sleep so it would be again now he knew as he looked down at the body of the motorcyclist he banished from his mind any feeling of elation that he had felled the man who had killed barry macgregor this was just another job done well and on that basis alone he was pleased as an expert mackie believed in arming himself to suit the occasion and the possible circumstances his choice of weapon that morning had been a colt magnum revolver the gun he noted as he looked at the body had lived up to its awesome reputation there was a fistsized exit wound right through the bikers breasthone mackie saw chips and slivers of white bone mixed in there he surmised that the bullet had spread when it struck the spine shattering it and sending fragments of bone and lead tearing through the heart sarah had removed the mans helmet but through the clown makeup it was difficult to tell anything about the mans appearance other than that he was blond mcguire rose and mcllhenney were standing a little way off with the three other riders from the troupe and one other a muscular shorthaired girl who wore a vest with le cirque tour emblazoned on its front skinner waved them over the three riders cringed when they saw their dead colleague but the girl merely whistled and shook her head you guys dont miss eh she said in a chirpy east london accent this is alison sir said maggie rose the three lads are all french all the english they speak between them couldnt buy you a bag of chips but alisons one of the troupe too shes a mechanic and she knew this fellow hey steady on i know he called himself ricky but thats about it skinner looked at the pass which he had taken from the back pocket of the dead mans jeans it was made out in the name of richard smith how long had he been with you he asked the girl he joined us in france a month ago said he was a scottie and wanted to work his way home didnt want much in wages only his fare paying the manager said he had a reference from a man in marseilles he was a mechanic too and good with the bikes mind you he wasnt a regular in the troupe shouldnt have been riding today only only what said skinner impatiently as the girls story tailed off momentarily as if she was working something out in her mind only paul the fourth of our regular bikers got mugged in leith last night three geezers jumped him apparently hes in hospital now they banged him up and broke his arm ere you dont think fine alison just you leave the thinking to us any ideas you have you keep them to yourself is that understood sure boss anything you say ok now will you please give a statement to ds rose here give her also your address and then take your pals home from the look of them theres no show tonight her story checked out then the mugging aye the boy paul was french too but he spoke english apparently he was making his way home last night after the show when three guys in suits came up to him took him up a close and gave him a doing skinner and proud sat facing each other over two large whiskies in the chiefs room at fettes avenue it was still only pm but each looked tired and drained removed from the scene of the crime a second wave of sadness had washed over them both at the loss of their colleague then in suits said the chief constable that doesnt sound much like leith no it doesnt strangest thing of all the boy said there was a woman with them and she seemed to be giving the orders it wasnt this typhoid mary woman was it no this one was darkhaired and she was under fivesix im already pulling in all of our likely candidates to undertake a contract thumping but i dont hold out any great hopes that any of them will fit the bill these will either have been members of the team or outoftown heavies brought in for this job alone and so virtually untraceable they were very professional apparently one of them said to the boy sorry mate but its in a good cause then he broke his arm with a masons hammer according to paul when the guy spoke to him the woman said silence and again according to him she said it in french but since hes french himself and he was having his arm broken at the time im discounting that one what about the late mr ricky smith do we have anything on him yes he has a french connection too their police have dug out their file for us according to his prints his name wasnt richard smith at all it was raymond mahoney age twentysix birthplace glasgow timeserved mechanic lived in france since he was twenty bad boy raymond or so they think believed to have been involved in the gang scene in marseilles they had him marked down as a driver mostly but he was known to have been in the vicinity of two or three shootings the closest they came to doing him for anything was when he was picked up as one of a team in a freelance armed robbery but then one of the police witnesses was killed on duty and the other had a fit of amnesia financially induced they reckoned so nothing came of it technically hes got a clean sheet but they wont miss him now hes gone proud freshened up then drinks from a bottle of highland park whatre you doing about thepress roystons got a statement ready to go out as soon as ive been to visit barrys dad hes a widower and hes been away golfing with a pal theyre due back at eight according to the pals wife ill catch him them no you wont said proud ill see thats taken care of youve done enough come on jimmy he was my man my man too i was planning to see mr macgregor myself but eddie mcguinness insisted he feels that he has to take on at least some of the tough tasks personally a solid man is our eddie so im beginning to realise said skinner thoughtfully the chief constable took a sip from his glass savoured the smoky taste and swallowed it so what do these bastards do next bob im trying to think like them jimmy looking at the pattern so far id say its got to be the fireworks concert a week on thursday they know we wont let them near any more celebs and the fireworks are the last big event in the festival its even on telly this year they might stick in a couple of wee surprises between now and then but ill bet thats the next thing theyll go for lets cancel it then ive already suggested that to ballantyne but theres no way hell agree hes got brave again well well just have to police it so tightly theyll have to use aircraft to hit it tomorrow you and i will go and see mr bloody ballantyne its time you had some backup when youre dealing withhimf the inevitable communique was delivered to the queen street office of the bbc at am on the following day for the first time it was addressed to the media rather than to the secretary of state the news editor radio never a man to turn down a scoop took a snap decision he sent copies at once to st andrews house and to skinners office then ordered that the mornings music programme should be interrupted and the text of the letter broadcast skinner therefore heard it on the radio before he received his copy he was alerted at once by the excitement in the newsreaders voice the following message has just been received by the bbc because of its use of a special codeword we believe it to be genuine it reads as follows from the fightersor an independent scotland communique it is with regret that we report the death of a fine young scottish patriot raymond mahoney on an active service mission in edinburgh yesterday we regret too that a further demonstration of our resolve has proved necessary however the intransigence of scotlands colonial governor the secretary of state left us no choice as before our target was selected with a view to focusing international attention on our struggle for freedom we note with some satisfaction that one member of the enemys security forces also fell yesterday if the occupying government continues to deny scotland its right to freedom he will not be the last the first phase of our struggle is over we have claimed the attention and we believe the support of the nations of the world from now on we will seek to strike at the heart of the tyranny wherever the opportunity arises our fight for an independent scotland will not end with the edinburgh festival it will go on until the occupying government yields or until the last of its members is cut down the secretary of state and his puppetmasters in london are legitimate targets they must realise that their police cannot protect them for ever that is the end of this newsflash said the newsreadt breathlessly now back to the studio and to eddie for christs sake sir james dont you people ever listen ive told skinner ever since this thing started that we will not give in to terrorism now even you have joined the chorus of appeasers i will not cancel the fireworks concert proud jimmy looked at his most formidable as thunderclouds of rage gathered on his brow skinner sat back in the secretary of states comfortable armchair and waited for the storm to break but ballantyne had not finished whatever these people may threaten far from cancelling the event i will attend personally and i wont be alone i spoke with the prime minister himself this morning and he has insisted on being present also my information directorate has just made that announcement sweet jesus said skinner softly ballantyne shot him a haughty glance but continued to address the chief constable protection and detection is what i asked of bob last week as our opponents point out in their socalled communique his antiterrorist squad has protected very little so far and detected even less lets see if things will improve now that youre back secretary of state prouds tone was even but skinner knew that he was controlling himself with difficulty i note what you say however i have to tell you that i believe that you are being foolhardy and that the prime minister should know better than to go along with you if you insist the concert will proceed however since my force is responsible for your safety i will apply the following conditions first the general public will be barred from the gardens and only people with auditorium tickets will be admitted princes street will be closed to all traffic between w mound and lothian road spectators will be confined to the north side of the street well away from the railings theyll hear the music and see the fireworks but they wont see either you or second the arena will be kept in darkness throughout the conductors rostrum and the players will be lit to the extent that is necessary but the rest will be blacked out third the pms armoured jaguar will be used to drive you and him right up to your seats fourth soldiers in protective clothing will be positioned behind you both throughout the concert acting as human shields fifth as soon as the concert is over you and the prime minister will be collected by the jag and driven from the gardens to overnight accommodation of our choice which will be made properly secure on those conditions alone the concert may proceed ballantyne stood up behind his desk quite unacceptable that is quite unacceptable he shouted we will not skulk in and out like that proud rose up too massive and formidable in his uniform his voice was still quiet and steady secretary of state sit down while i tell you something if you do not accept every one of those conditions and put yourself and the prime minister completely in my charge then i will resign as chief constable and will make it known loudly and publicly that i have done so because the secretary of state for scotland has no thought or concern for public or police safety and is prepared to put lives unnecessarily at risk lives like that of young barry macgregor who died yesterday obeying your orders or of that baby who was killed because you thought it was right to have a party in the face of terrorism still standing ballantyne seemed to fight for a few seconds for breath and words eventually he gasped you cant threaten me ill ill a the storm broke proud jimmy exploded in a fury that skinner had never witnessed before he roared at ballantyne dont be a bloody fool man i am scotlands senior chief constable youre just another tinpot politician you have no jurisdiction over me of course i can threaten you i have just threatened you i am still fucking threatening you and i will carry out my threat at once if you cross me he glared at ballantyne for a moment then went on his voice lower grinding out the words ill go further than that i missed the first few days of this affair but ive kept in touch with bob skinner here who in spite of your scorn is in my opinion the finest policeman in britain i am now observing for myself the final stages of your transformation under fire from a moderately acceptable minister to a dangerous buffoon who is quite unsuited for high office for now mr ballantyne bob skinner needs my support but i tell you today that once this affair is over i will renew the promise i have just made to you and wilt carry it out exactly as i have described unless you yourself resign to make way for someone with the judgement and ability to do the job he glanced down at skinner who sat in his chair marvelling silently at his chief come on bob lets go and get on with the job of keeping this pathetic man alive he turned his back on ballantyne and slammed out of the room skinner for once in his life followed silently and obediently at proud jimmys heels at the chief constables insistence bob took the rest of that monday off take your lovely wife away to the seaside man recharge those batteries for thursday night so with sarah signed off from her practice and her police duties for twentyfour hours they headed down to gullane all three of the golfcourses were jampacked and so they decided instead to walk along the beach path to north berwick and back via the highway a good twelvemile hike dressed in tshirts shorts and reeboks they walked mostly in silence at first finding and following a narrow path which wound down through a forest of headhigh thorn bushes then ran for a stretch along the perimeter of muirfield golf course before opening out on to the broad east sands far from the gullane bents car park no day trippers knew of this attractive beach and so it was always deserted even on the finest of days sheltered in a natural alcove among the dunes from the light breeze which signalled the turning of the tide they lay down to sunbathe for a while stripping off their tshirts to use as beachmats bob marvelled anew at the firmness of his wifes body as she lay on her back highbreasted nipples erect eyes closed against the sun which glinted on her auburn hair perfection he whispered and suddenly into his mind came a premonition of brownhaired sons and of a second shot at fatherhood he felt himself harden and laughed softly skinner she voiced his name as a question then without needing an answer she rolled sideways and on top of him full of desire and with the suppleness of her youth she made love to him quickly lustily hungrily in the hoti august sunshine which bathed the deserted beach mounted on him as if he were her stallion calling out to him in her pleasure when their journey was over she lay upon him for a while longer their foreheads touching covering his face with kisses and then as if she had read his earlier thought she said you and i are ready to be parents my love you deserve another shot and i couldnt get any broodier if i tried he held her breasts in his hands as she lifted herself up from his chest well honey he said huskily if that happens well just have to call him jimmy after all he did give me the afternoon off the mallards eightyshilling ale was pouring at its best the village clock showed pm as they arrived back in gullane their hike and the excitement of their sudden spontaneous sun washed coupling on the deserted beach had left them with a raging thirst which they slaked with two pints each of scottish brewers finest product they gave some thought to dining in the bar but eventually they agreed that the evening was too good to be spent indoors and so instead they went back to their cottage and barbecued i two thick steaks in the garden with potatoes baking in foil in the redhot coals and sliced onions sizzling on the grid they ate as hungrily as they had made love in the sand washing down the succulent meat with good red valdepenas and finishing off with a whole pineapple quartered and soaked in cassis then all their appetites satisfied they sat in the garden and watched the day go down in the west and with it their brief break from the dangers which had so recently overwhelmed their lives will they ever stop bob sarah asked him suddenly yes love theyll stop when theyve got what they want and that isnt scottish independence or any of that crap i dont believe that any more theyve got us teararsing around all over edinburgh and thats what theyve been out to achieve all along its all being done with a purpose in mind though ive no idea at all of what that could be when i do know thats when theyll stop because ill stop them i the hard determination in his voice made her suddenly afraid again just as she had felt in the park over the body of young macgregor darling promise me one thing please that when you do meet up with these people youll take care of yourself inside and out he looked at her in silence theres someone in you that i dont know its like theres a closet inside you with something awful and dangerous inside a real bogeyman im just terribly afraid that if he ever really gets out he could take you over she held his gaze until his eyes dropped aye my love he said with a deep sigh i know the man you mean ive met him and ive no wish to encounter him again either but i have to say that if im ever in that kind of danger again i hope hes still around because one thing about my alter ego he doesnt half get the business done skinner saw the ball drop as the gun went off this is where ill be andy i can see the whole show from here the three of them skinner martin and adam arrow stood on the castle battlements just at the angle where the millsi mount battery joins with the western defences a part of the image which most visitors conjure up when their thoughts returnj to edinburgh f it was a few seconds after one oclock close by the famoui gun still smoked having just boomed out its time signal when it had fired skinner had been gazing out across princes street over the scott monument and the balmoral hotel at the roof of the round grey stone building on the top of calton hill and had seen the huge green globe as it slid down its flagpole in a visual time check for navigators in the wide river forth simultaneous with the sounding of the gun for those on land now all three looked downwards observing the main glasgow railway line at the base of the rock and beyond it the chasm of princes street gardens all in the shadow of the great castle the tented roof had been removed from the ross theatre only the stage was out of sight under the canopy of the openair bandstand which for all its grand theatrical title it was for most of the year the air was heavy the heat stifling skinner glanced up thete was a hint of purple about the sky i its going to break andy e you can set your watch by it boss whatever else the weather does in edinburgh you can be sure itll piss down on the fireworks concert skinner laughed aye that and dont forget the queensjgarden party in july but their moment of light relief was a short f one have we covered everything dyou think he asked deadly serious once more yes i think so said martin princes street gets blocked off to vehicles at nine oclock but the crowd barriers will be installed along the north pavement this afternoon and well close the pavement looking into the gardens at eight as soon as the last of the shops close right said skinner and as soon as you see to that youre off to number to meet up with ballantyne and the prime minister although weve doubled the guard on him like all the scottish ministers i want you and brian to be as close to him and the pm as their underarm deodorant until tonights well and truly over the pms protection men are happy for us to run this one not that they were given a choice you and brian will be in the jag with our two vips when they leave number youll have armed officers in cars in front and back and four motorcycle outriders one on each corner mind you you should be all right in that jag anyway theres a tonandahalf of armour plating in it and all its glass is proof against any sort of bullet so listen if the shit does start to fly down there tonight the first thing you do is get ballantyne and the pm inside that bloody motor itll be the safest place in edinburgh he turned to arrow adam you and your men will be stationed inside the theatre area agreed mm thats right weu guard the perimeter and keep watch on the seats in case some lookers planted himself in the audience one lookin out one lookin in alternately all the way round using night glasses id be happier with another couple of men though youve got them ill give you mcguire and mcllhenney in fact why dont we kit them out in bulletproof vests and helmets and ask them take up position behind ballantyne and the pm theyre both big wide buggers theyll make good blockers theyd have to volunteer but i know them they will thatll ee up all of your guys for what theyre best at thanks bob what about maggie rose said martin we mustnt forget about her shed be pissed off if she was left out of the action thats ok maggie will be with me up here watching for whatever happens for believe me boys there will be something to be seen and it wont be just fireworks ive never felt as certain o anything in my life everything that evening happened on cue even the weather thef storm broke finally at pm just as skinner and maggie rosch were driving up the deserted castle esplanade between the highh tiered temporary grandstands which on another night would have been filling with spectators gathering for the military tattoo in the wide parade ground which they hanked but fireworks and orchestra had taken precedence over marching bands and military gymnastics and for that skinner guessed as the first flash of lightning lit up the gloaming six thousand potential ticketholdersg should feel truly grateful heavy raindrops pounded on the roof of the car as he swung if into the tunnel which takes vehicles into edinburgh castle resuming their bombardment as he drove back into the open anc up to the parking area between butts battery and the castl hospital which had once been ironically its powder magazine he felt glad of the long burberry waterproof coat and hat whic he had thrown on to the back seat as he had left home maggie rose was clad for wet weather too in kneelengti boots jeans and a hooded barbour jacket she looked for all th world like a countrywoman on a weekend walk not a detective engaged on lifeordeath duty skinner opened the boot of the car and produced from it two pairs of oddlooking heavy binoculars here take these he said handing one set to maggie rose theyre lightintensifying infrared or some such however they work theyll help you see in the dark youre going to need them before much longer are you armed he asked casually as they walked up to their vantage point on the mills mount battery no sir i didnt see the need for it up here the neither this is an army garrison after all theres guns enough all around us i the adjutant of the castle garrison regiment the royal scots was waiting for them on the battery he held a large blue umbrella over his head soldiers bravado thought skinner as lightning cracked across the sky searching for a route to earth taking a chance major ancram arent you he said pointing at the umbrella the big middleaged officer laughed rubber soles old boy anyway if the bloody argies couldnt hit me what hope is there for this lot skinner shook his head and smiled daft as a brush he thought he introduced major ancram to detective sergeant rose then moving forward to the edge of the battery he raised the nightglasses and swept his gaze along princes street from the mound to lothian road without its street lighting the famous street with its shops on one side gardens and castle on the other was beginning to resemble an island of darkness in the midst of the dramatic illuminations which show off historic edinburgh by night in the deepening gloom the north pavement was already well filled with people braving the rain for the sounds and spectacle of this unique evening above the pedestrians was a second tier of spectators those privileged ones with access to upperfloor windows or to the wide galleried fronting of some of the buildings memorials to an architectural eccentricity decades earlier which had envisaged the eventual creation of a firstfloor walkway running the length of princes street the lights of the new club of which skinner was a member caught his eye through its high windows he could see clearly that the fireworks drinks party was gathering momentum he was suddenly glad that he had persuaded the chief to make the club his vantage point out of harms way yet able to observe the crowd further along others with glasses in hand peered out of the upper apartments of the royal overseas league business was good he noted in the twostorey burger king bright on its corner in contrast to the gap site on the opposite side of castle street where the palace hotel had once stood and where rebuilding work was still far from completion past foods selling well he muttered to no one in particular as he registered that mcdonalds too was packed from princes street skinner swung the glasses down into the gardens to the ross theatre itself he checked his watch it was still only too early for ticketholders especially on a night like this but already arrow and his blacksuited men were deployed there in waiting hooded and with bulky automatic weapons in their hands the stage was hidden from his view but twenty feet away from it behind two seats in the centre he saw two bulky figures grotesque in their helmets with rain tunics over their flakjackets but standing there solidly as human shields skinner was suddenly very touched by the loyalty of his team and very proud of them his moment of reverie was broken by major ancram everything ok mr skinner yes major so far so far what do we do now we wait and we watch and if youre into it you might like to do a wee bit of praying for those boys down there and for the two clowns theyre looking after if smiles could cut you andy martin thought to himself ballantyne would be bleeding all over the place the tension between the prime minister and the secretary of state for scotland was obvious to the six other people in the room martin himself brian mackie the ministers two private secretaries fowler and shields and the pms two protection officers from chance remarks it was also obvious that the appearance by the countrys leader at this concert had been ballantynes idea rather than his own the prime minister was a small man almost slender alongside the stocky bulk of ballantyne but his firecracker temper was known to equal that of even his most formidable predecessor he was clearly not best pleased to be here in edinburgh in the firing line in the rain the conversation between the two ministers remained polite but it was stilted they were clearly not the closest of political allies and although the pm was working hard to maintain an affable front every so often the truth of his feelings would flash in his eyes behind the spectacles betraying the insincerity of his professional smile it was a relief to everyone when martins radio crackled into life on an open channel only he could hear the voice through his earpiece it was distorted but it was unmistakably skinner its all secure up here andy the punters are in their seats the orchestras tuning up and the blue touch papers lit its five to ten so lets get the show on the road martin snapped an acknowledgement into the handset then turned to his charges alls well gentlemen so if youre ready yes said the prime minister fixing ballantyne with his frostiest and least sincere smile i love a good fireworks display in the rain sitting behind a bulletproof shield lets go alan and do your duty m the rain still poured down the thunder crashed and the lightning flashed like some great overture to the fireworks to come the motorcyclists and the escort cars peeled off as soon as the convoy entered the gardens watching from above skinner and maggie rose could follow the jaguars headlights as they cut a path through the dark to the entrance to the ross theatre expertly the pms driver swung the car round and reversed it up to stop a few feet in front of four empty seats two of them with massive sentinels positioned behind them martin and mackie in heavy anoraks and flat caps jumped out and scanned the audience then martin leaned back into the car and spoke softly the prime minister stepped out first and then the secretary of state for scotland each in heavy rainwear their arrival in the darkness went unseen by the great majority of the audience but they were greeted by a round of polite applause nonetheless led by the concerts guest conductor daniel greenspan standing well back on his spotlit rostrum only just out of the pounding rain the prime minister was ramrod straight and smiled widely around him as he walked the few steps to his seat behind him ballantyne glum and nervous hurried to sit down under the cover provided by mario mcguire martin took the seat immediately beside the pm while mackie flanked the secretary of state each detective kept a hand inside his jacket on the butt of his pistol greenspan turned to face the orchestra and raised his baton skinner felt maggie rose jump slightly beside him in involuntary alarm as the first firework launched from the wide area around the foot of the castle rock exploded in synchronicity with the first bars of aaron coplands outdoor overture get used to it maggie keep looking around and keep your fingers crossed thats all youll see or hear for some while it seemed as if skinners hope against hope would be fulfilled as the concert unfolded the unamplified music boomed up towards them on their battlement different shapes colours and patterns of light burst all around them as the pyrotechnics lit the night sky in uncanny harmony with the music skinner concentrated his view to the left and rose kept hers to the right from time to time flashes from the fireworks were channelled through the nightglasses and blinded them but as the hours duration of the concert wore on they were able between them to keep under observation the whole of the area surrounding the gardens and the theatre they could see nothing untoward only the enthusiastic crowds down in the street as they jumped and clapped with each new wonder of light in the dark sky at last the programme reached its climax handels musicor the royal fireworks theyre nearly at the end now skinner called out above the noise to his two companions so far so he was cut short by the sound of an explosion carrying clearly through a lull in the music and a momentary break in the fireworks it came from their left skinner swept his glasses along princes street to the caledonian hotel but saw nothing untoward carrying on he scanned along castle terrace saltire court and the traverse theatre seemed undisturbed and from what he could see of the usher hall and we sheraton they too looked undamaged but beyond them beyond the royal lyceum in lothian road to the left of the high top of capital house he saw a billowing cloud of smoke and dust rising and shining in the floodlights which illuminated the front of the building which had been home to the film festival his radio was in his hand in a second major incident filmhouse he barked into the open line all emergency services required now every second officer in princes street go to the scene immediately just as he finished issuing the order he heard the tailend of a second blast this time sounding from the right again skinner swung round searching through the glasses but something took him instinctively to the balmoral the hotels foyer was out of his line of sight but his eye was caught at once by the shattered windows in its side then he saw the smoke of the bomb as it spread outwards in a mushroom from the front of the huge square stone building jesus christ theres been another the radio mike was in his hand once more second explosion balmoral hotel emergency services respond again headquarters lets get every policeman in edinburgh into this area he was still issuing his orders when maggie rose grabbed his arm sir whats that over there on the mound he followed her finger pointing into the night until his glasses found the stationary lorry it was big and flatbacked and it seemed to have been pulled right up on to the pavement just at the point where the curving section of the mound straightened to run down towards princes street past the national gallery the lorrys cab was empty but its curtain side facing the gardens had been pulled open and four figures stood on its platform skinner could see them clearly and could see clearly what they were doing two of them clasped bulky boxlike objects to their shoulders while the others were braced against them to hold them steady andy he roared into the radio get them into the car now theyve got missiles in the car in the car in the car and as he spoke he saw the launchers fire simultaneously he followed the path of the squat flybywire projectiles as each homed in on its target down down everybody down he screamed into the radio and into the darkness of the garden theatre the prime minister experienced a sudden sensation of flight one second having forgotten temporarily his anger over ballantynes ridiculous bravado he was enjoying handels finest work the next he was in midair seized bodily by andy martin lifted clear of his seat and bome at speed across the short distance to the jaguar then its rear door was wrenched open and he found himself thrown across the back seat an instant later ballantyne landed heavily on top of him hurled there by brian mackie then mackie himself dived in to cover them both with his large body martin his pistol drawn slammed the door shut behind them slapped the side of the jaguar and dived to the ground as it roared off he looked up back towards the audience and could spot mcguire and mcllhenney obviously they too had been alerted by skinners voice in their earpieces since arms outspread they were gathering in as many of the people around them as they could and forcing them down between the seats on stage the orchestra played on in triumph as oblivious to the two explosions as were all but a few members of the audience overhead the fireworks crashed and sparkled at their luminescent climax there is no mistaking a sidewinder missile for a firework skinner watched struck dumb by the horror as one of them smashed right into the middle rows of the audience and exploded he saw that at the moment of impact several people noticing the sudden commotion in the front row had stood up trying vainly to catch a view in the dark by a small mercy the other sidewinder flashed across the front of the stage exactly where the jaguar had stood bare seconds before over a figure lying facedown in the tarmac and then off to explode in the trees beyond the theatres iron gate maggie rose screamed out loud and kept on screaming until skinner gripped her by the shoulders and shook her hard even without nightglasses major ancram could see the flashes of the missile strikes and needed no telling what had happened mr skinner im calling out the garrison ill have to get every man down there yes major said skinner recovering his power of speech fast as you can too lets get down there and then suddenly he changed his mind no he said loudly and the major who had been heading away to gather his soldiers stopped in his tracks and turned to stare in surprise theres something else said skinner vehemently i said that they want to get us teararsing around thats what theyve got now in spades but what happens next he stood for perhaps twenty seconds thinking hard while rose and major ancram stared at him then decisions made he looked again at the soldier major ok you get your men down there on the double but leave halfadozen up here with me maggie you go on down with him and do what you can she nodded silently determined to be as tough as anyone in skinners command and ashamed of her earlier weakness major how many men have you got just now three hundred good when you get down there i want you to put armed men on guard around the national gallery and at the big bank branches at the mound st andrews square george street and the west end ill tell you why later for now get going and send that halfdozen men to me a germ of a notion was festering in skinners mind one so bizarre that he thought that it surely had to be fantasy and yet it was there and he could not totally dismiss it as a possibility an afterthought struck him and he called after the disappearing ancram major see if one of your men can find me a whistle andy martin picked himself up from the wet tarmac without even a thought of dusting himself off when he heard skinners first alert he had jerked bolt upright in his seat and a voice inside him had screamed silently for a second he had almost sprinted from the prime ministers side off through the gardens and into the night to lothian road the filmhouse and julia but then the second alert had come and skinners frantic command he had acted instinctively and had ensured that the jaguar and its passengers had made it to safety now he looked around him and listened carefully on the stage a percussionist was banging away either lost in the score or refusing to believe what had happened daniel greenspan stood in his spotlight his baton by his side staring into the darkness martin reholstered his pistol and took out his radio he switched channels to call the operations room at fettes find whoever can arrange it and get as much light as we can in here for a start have someone turn on the lights in princes street and get me any news you can of filmhouse i a second later he found that his first instruction had been anticipated by the stage manager of the ross theatre above the stage a row of floodlights flickered into life illuminating the i audience martin moved forward fearfully into a world of death and desolation unable to block out the fear that it might be the same where his julia was there was carnage indeed in the ross theatre nd yet he soon saw it might have been worse he looked around first for mcguire and mcllhenney and to his great relief spotted them both still huge in their jackets and helmets shepherding uninjured spectators away from the scene and then adam arrow was by his side god andy ive never seen anything like this what do you hear on that radio of yours once again the accent had vanished three attacks one after the other first filmhousc then the balmoral both bombs from the sound of it then here we were attacked by missiles fired from the mound one missed the other hit over there by the looks of it sidewinders i imagine in that case we were lucky not all of us though they had reached the heart of the missiles devastation neither could be sure how many had died but a circle of twelve metal seats lay tangled and bloody under the floodlights with broken bodies twisted among them around this immediate circle perhaps two dozen people sat stunned and disbelieving some were bleeding and several held their ears as if deafened the silence was that of a mourning parlour it had a power of its own one which seemed almost to hold at bay the growing clamour from princes street and the howling of sirens as police fire crews and ambulances raced to their different destinations the soldier and the detective began to direct the men at their disposal to the care of the casualties to render firstaid to those who were bleeding and to confirm as far as they were able that none of the walking wounded was seriously hurt when he was satisfied that everyone was in good hands martin called across to mcguire mario youre in charge here now ive got to check out filmhouse as he sprinted into the night he glanced up at the halfmoon battery standing at its edge framed in light he caught sight of a silhouette unmistakable even in its overcoat thank christ for the boss tonight he muttered sincerely but whats he doing up there still the corporal looked puzzled as he handed skinner the whistle skinner took it from him with a curt nod right you all know me sir said the corporal speaking for all six men major ancram will have told you that you are rtow under my command what i want you to do is this throw a guard around the crown square thats the great hall the queen anne barracks the war memorial and the royal palace all the areas below will be empty by now but theres nothing there that anyone would be after what you must guard against is anyone or anything that shouldnt be there the chances are that nothing unusual will happen but if it does he paused to let his words sink in then went on if any of you sees anything and you dont know for sure its friendly dont ask i for its name shoot it if it turns out to be the regimental mascot f or the rsms tart well thatll be too bad but they can both be replaced right corporal get your men spread out he held up the whistle i know its oldfashioned but if i need you ill blow this thing if you hear it regroup here by the one oclock gun if any of you need me chances are ill have heard you shoot but skinner was wrong he was standing by the gun training his nightglasses on the national art gallery looking for any sign of intruders for he suddenly felt acutely aware that the building was currently housing an international exhibition of the lifes work of rembrandt it had been brought to the edinburgh festival under the sponsorship of a major insurance company and it was worth conservatively over a hundred million pounds forget the banks thats only money he said softly to the night his thoughts gathering speed anybody with the resources to fund what weve just seen doesnt need money but what if he wants something else something unique just for himself and will go to any lengths any cost theres only one other collection in edinburgh as valuable as that exhibition and were up here guarding that then he heard the strange sound in the dark and knew at once with his detectives instinct that the national gallery was not the target and that his germ of an idea had been right all along the royal regalia of scotland are not nearly as famous as their english counterparts in the tower of london and they have been admired by far fewer tourists over the years indeed most scots do not even know they art there since the union of the kingdoms almost five hundred years ago only king charles ii then an exile and outlawed by cromwell has been crowned in scotland thus the honours of scotland as they are sometimes called are in main older than the crown jewels of england they are also in their own way beyond price therefore they are guarded in the most effective manner possible by the army itself in the heart of the garrisoned citadel of edinburgh which stands impregnable on its rock unless in some dire emergency that garrison were to be flushed out without waiting to discover exactly what that sound in the dark had been but sensing its meaning anyway skinner grabbed his radio and spoke urgently into the open channel get some backup here to the castle theyre after the crown jewels he stumbled over the body in the dark the soldier lay facedown near the portcullis gate at the foot of the lang stairs skinner turned him over the heavy clouds reflected the amber light of the city back down to earth and in that dim glow skinner could see that the man had been stabbed in the throat the gurgling sound heard earlier must have been his death rattle or a last attempt to raise the alarm the man had dropped his rifle skinner spotted the short fully automatic weapon lying on the ground he picked it up without further thought thankful for his practice sessions with this same firearm on the st leonards rifle range leaving the dead soldier skinner hurried back to his rendezvous point by the one oclock gun he hesitated for a moment about blowing the whistle with the risk of alerting the intruders but quickly decided that alerting his own men had priority so he gave a single sharp blast and hoped that the raiders would confuse it with the many other varied sounds now floating up to the castle from the chaos in the city below only three of the other soldiers answered his summons including the corporal skinner glanced at him and held up the whistle a gesture asking whether he should blow it again but the nco shook his head sadly naw theyre good lads theyd have come if they could with twentytwenty hindsight skinner cursed himself for not commandeering twice as many men then he addressed the remaining three look lads weve got a raiding party in the castle theyre after the crown jewels i dont know how many there are but they must be inside the palace by now ive already radioed for backup but we cant wait that long if they get what theyre after then get loose out there in the dark well never catch them corporal you take one of these two and go round behind the war memorial to the main entrance to crown square the other will come with me up the stairs and in by the side way and again ask no questions you see it you shoot it the corporal slapped one of his soldiers on the shoulder and together the pair headed off up a slight incline to the right hunched in the dark and their rifles held ready skinner led the remaining man back past the body of his dead colleague and up to the top of the stone staircase until it opened on to the topmost level of the castle together they raced across the ground behind the fore wall and the half moon battery and flattened themselves against the side of the scottish national war memorial slowly skinner eased forward to peer round the corner into crown square at the edge of his vision he saw the corporal and his partner sprint into the square away from the dangerous frame of the narrow entrance bracing themselves crouched against the buildings there were two men stationed at the door of the palace they were dressed in black and carried short ugly guns which skinner recognised at uzis they spotted the two soldiers as soon as they appeared at the far end of the square and swung their weapons up to firing positions but too slowly the corporal and his companion cut them down with bursts of sustained deadly accurate rifle fire skinner saw both men thrown back against the wall of the jewel chamber by the impact then as the firing stopped they crumpled slowly limp and dead to the ground he shouted across the square corporal is there any other way out of there no sir the man called back whoevers in there must come through that door at the foot of the flag tower right we wait our backup should be here any minute as he spoke he heard from within the building a sound like the smashing of heavy glass an alarm bell began to ring pointlessly skinner left his soldier companion in the lee of the war memorial and ran across to the steps of its only entrance he shielded himself behind its arch and blessed his luck and foresight as a grenade exploded in the square he heard shrapnel zing i against stone walls and ricochet off into the night then he swung i himself out from behind the grey pillar and waited ready for what he knew would happen next a there were two others also dressed in black like their dead colleagues each carried a holdall in his left hand and a blazing uzi in his right as they burst through the door they sprayed fire blindly at unseen targets but this kept the soldiers at the far end of the square pinned down nonetheless they could not see where their greatest peril waited skinner dropped the first intruder with two quick shots the other swung round towards the side exit from crown square and straight into the path of the waiting soldier who roared a battle cry as he emptied his magazine in revenge for his fallen comrades in the silence that followed amid the reek of the gunsmoke skinner found time to look inside himself he was pleased that he had been able to fire without hesitation pleased too that he had handled the job so unemotionally without any thought of barry macgregor in his mind perhaps he thought the closet door was locked for good maybe he did not need that other guy after all he held the other men in position for three full minutes lest there were other intruders still inside the jewel chamber but the next man to enter the square was captain adam arrow leading his silent troops in full combat array arrow appraised the scene in a second and realised why skinner and his trio of soldiers were waiting immobile at his signal two men sprinted across the open space and threw stun grenades through the open door of the flag tower holding their ears against the percussion then they rushed inside the building and up the stairs their guns held in front of them a few seconds later they emerged and waved the allclear to arrow as skinner and the soldiers gathered at the doorway the corporal found a switch and soon the square was ablaze with light weapons at the ready they approached the four figures lying crumpled on the flagstones three of the raiders were as dead as they could be but the fourth still showed signs of life skinner radioed for an ambulance the two holdalls lay on the ground nearby the larger of them was streaked with blood skinner knelt down and unzipped it and from within he took a sword still sheathed in its bejewelled scabbard not just any old sword this one but that which had been ceremoniously borne in state before the kings of scotland he held it up by its scabbard for a moment feeling its weight and its fine balance then he handed it over to arrow and bent to open the other bag knowing also what he would find there first the golden sceptre finely worked heavier than it looked and then scotlands ancient pride the crown itself it was almost indescribably beautiful even in the harsh artificial light its jewels glinted in the delicate gold circlet pearls set in gold gleamed on the red velvet inner cap and six more with four sapphires formed the cross at its apex skinner held it up by its white ermine surround for all to see there you have it lads this is what our freedom fighters were really after priceless they call it but for someone who wanted it badly enough not beyond price it seems skinner could scarcely believe that so many journalists would turn up sober for a am press briefing extra seats had been brought in filling the briefing hall completely yet they were all soon occupied and the side aisles were also packed with correspondents many standing others crouching to allow the photographers and television cameramen a clear view of the table at the head of the room and of the big darksuited steelhaired stubblechinned man who sat at it his chief constable in full uniform and cleanshaven by his side skinner waited as alan royston and his uniformed assistants distributed the printed statement which he and proud jimmy had dictated together within the last hour they waited for some minutes more to give every man and woman in the room an opportunity to read and understand it fully when he judged the time was right skinner rapped the table with his knuckles to recapture the attention of his audience and began slightly hoarsely id appreciate it if everyone here could take that statement as read itll save my voice but ill sum up now for television and radio he glanced down the room towards the camera platform in relative terms we have been fortunate tonight this is no comfort to the families of the nine victims killed by the groundto ground missile fired into the ross theatre however things could have been much worse there were no other serious casualties either in the gardens or due to the other explosions at filmhouse and at the balmoral hotel the first of these we know now was caused by a satchel of explosives placed against a wall in the foyer it brought down the front of the building but the rest stood firm fortunately all the audience and staff were inside the cinemas at the time so everyone was brought out safely we believe that the balmoral bomb too was left in a suitcase in the foyer again fortunately the receptionist had gone into her office and the doorman was outside watching the fireworks so that area was completely empty when the device went off we believe that the second missile at the ross theatre was aimed at the prime ministers car but the vehicle moved out of the line of fire just in time thanks to the speed with which dci andy martin and di brian mackie acted to get the two ministers clear of the scene on impulse sir james proud broke in pointing towards a stocky blond greeneyed man leaning against the wall id like to single out andy martin for special commendation but also congratulate all the other members of the team brian mackie mario mcguire and neil mcllhenney who placed themselves without hesitation in the line of fire and not forgetting ds maggie rose but for whose keen eyes we could well have had a dead prime minister by now not to mention her fellow officers and friends as al neidermeyer raised a hand skinner eyed him without animosity the american looked back with caution and new respect were putting this out live on tni could you just run over the whole picture of what happened tonight certainly its now clear that the socalled independence campaign was in fact a professionally planned operation to cause chaos and confusion among the police and emergency services and to steadily stretch us to the point we reached tonight when w had to call out every last resource at our disposal including theji garrison from the castle we know now that the real objective was theft of the honours of scotland our royal regalia call it fantastic call it audacious but it actually happened and it almost succeeded do you think youve got them all bob the questioner was the grizzled john hunter looking slightly unkempt in the middle of the night an unaccustomed time for him skinner smiled at the familiar face no john we havent we dont know yet whether the types who planted those bombs and fired the missiles were the same ones who attacked the castle forensic tests should tell us though also we dont know for sure that there were only four in the raiding party up at the castle long rope ladder was found fastened to the half moon batta dropping down to the lawn below that was their getaway roll so possibly someone was guarding it then legged it theres mary little horse too we still havent traced h and theres someone else we havent got thats the one who set this whole thing up somebody who wanted so badly to possess the scottish crown jewels that he or she was ready to providethe necessary finance for an operation as brilliant and as ruthless as this one there is absolutely no clue as to who that person might be but we can assume that he or she is extremely rich and must have some very special interest in scotland so what else have you got said al neidermeyer well weve got a wounded man in the royal under very special guard an hour and a half ago we faxed fingerprints from all four intruders to various agencies around the world but weve had no firm response as yet so we still havent identified any of them however we think we may have the getaway vehicle we found a mercedes saloon with false plates parked in johnstone terrace under the half moon battery not the driver though and none of the four killed in the raid had car keys on him within the last hour weve learned that an aircraft a de havilland dash has been sitting in a hangar at cumbernauld airport ever since it was flown in two weeks ago the hangar rent was paid up until tomorrow cash down by the pilot who flew it in the copy receipt is made out in the name of mr black unfortunately the airport manager is away on holiday but were trying to trace him to obtain a description and were also tracing the ownership of the plane my guess is itll turn out to have been chartered for cash this mr black could he have been one of the men taken tonight asked neidermeyer skinner shook his head i dont think so so mr black is still out there skinner nodded i reckon so mind you i dont expect him to turn up in person to collect his aeroplane the getaway plane stayed where it was but something else was picked up instead something much more precious one thing that niggles me andy is not knowing if any of the bastards are still hanging around here it was just over twelve hours since the press briefing skinner and martin were settled in the dcis office in the special branch suite going through the mountain of paperwork involved in the winding up of the enquiry each had snatched a few hours at home although andy had spent much of his break consoling julia after her frightening experience with the filmhouse explosion if any of them are still here said martin theyre bloody crazy that guy in the royals going to make it hes bound to bargain a few years off his sentence in return for telling us everything he knows dont count on it those were pros theyll have been well paid for this job and it probably included something extra for keeping shtum if they got caught and dont assume that he knows skinner was interrupted by an internal call on martins extension being closer to it he picked it up skinner the caller was ruth sorry to bother you sir but i felt i had to its a mr morris and he says its important its about alex put him through skinner had never met the man but he recognised the name ben morris was the director of alexs theatre company what can i do for you mr morris the man hesitated look im sorry to bother you but do you happen to know where your daughter might be the first faint chill crept into skinners stomach what dyqu mean he didnt realise that he had snapped at the caller a hard edge suddenly in his voice morris began to splutter well its just that well last nigt her friend ingo didnt turn up alex didnt know where hed gt to we went on with the show but without the lighting effects was a bloody disaster alex did her best but i still felt i had to give the audience half their money back i called their number this morning to find out where the hell he had been but i got no reply so i went round to see them the landlady said she hadnt seen or heard either of them all day she let me in with a passkey but the place was empty not a sign all his clothes all of his things were gone some of alexs stuff seemed to be there but i couldnt see her handbag you know that big one she carries everywhere so can you help me are they with you ive got to know if hes coming back skinner replaced the receiver without a word martin watched him anxiously as he sat staring chalkfaced at the wall his first thought was that his boss had experienced some delayed reaction to the nights events whats wrong bob the voice which replied was strange quiet shaky unlike anything martin had heard from him before its alex shes been snatched eh that was her director that guy ingo didnt show up last night now alex has disappeared too andy knew he was wrong hes taken her steady on man she could be anywhere maybe hes just done a moonlight on her and shes down at your place now crying her eyes out to sarah skinner shook his head feeling cold all over no andy since last night ive been wondering whether our mr black would have a plan b now i know that he has and i can guess what it is the letter was delivered only ten minutes later it had been found on a table in the firstfloor coffee lounge of the busy mount royal hotel but none of the staff could describe the person who had sat there last it was addressed assistant chief constable skinner police headquarters private and confidential to be delivered the hotel manager had brought it personally to fettes avenue skinner could not stop his hand from trembling as he slit the envelope he had recognised at once its style and its size and the typeface on the address label he withdrew the familiar single sheet of white paper and steeled himself to read what he knew would be there he read it aloud to proud martin and arrow who had all gathered in his office mr skinner you may know my name already let us say that i am simply someone who has undertaken to obtain something special for a client who wants it very badly last night i almost succeeded but your own good fortune prevented me however i do not give up as easily as you might have hoped through the good offices of ingo svart i now hold in my care someone who is very precious to you i now propose that we exchange her for that which is just as precious to my client the items which you prevented us from taking last night i require that you arrange the following the regalia will be left in the same holdalls which my associates carried into the castle in the middle of the car park at the gyle shopping centre at pm tomorrow night once the delivery has been made the car park should be completely cleared an aeroplane with a range of at least three thousand miles will be waiting fully fuelled on the runway at edinburgh airport no attempt should be made to follow us at any stage no personnel police or military should come anywhere near no attempt should be made to hide tracking devices in the holdalls we have the equipment to detect them no attempt should be made to track our flightpath we also carry equipment that can detect radar if any one of these conditions is breached in any way miss skinner will be shot immediately however if all are met to the letter she will be released safely as soon as we reach our first stoppingoff point mr black skinner placed the letter slowly on his desk he looked up at andy martin with absolute desolation on his face give that paper to me bob said proud jimmy gently but with determination in his voice im off to see the prime minister i dont care whose daughter she is secretary of state said sir james proud hissing the words in a tone he had rarely used before in his life if bob skinner had heard you say that i would not guarantee your safety he took a menacing step towards ballantyne sir james please the prime minister restrained him with a light touch on the sleeve of his uniform he turned to face ballantyne questioningly across the drawing room of number charlotte square i only meant that we cant give in to blackmail pm said thesecretary of state now flushed and flustered the prime minister walked slowly down the long room towards him his eyes cold behind his spectacles alan if you showed such bravery and courage with your own person as you do in putting other peoples lives at risk mine included then you would probably make a great minister as it is youre undoubtedly the biggest mistake i have ever made last night i said i wanted you to demit office on health grounds after a decent interval you dont deserve decency man give me your resignation now please he turned back to proud now sir james how are we going to help mr skinner with respect prime minister that isnt really a matter for you a voice interrupted there was a fourth man in the long room sir hamish tebbit private secretary to the queen had flown to edinburgh that morning for a personal briefing on the situation from the prime minister the tall greysuited courtier stepped forward from the window he had been doing his best to make himself inconspicuous while the politicians and the policeman had their confrontation i would remind you that the honours of scotland are the property of the crown therefore their disposal is a matter for the crown alone if you will permit me i will withdraw to another room one with a telephone and seek guidance from that highest authority andy son theyll kill her whatever you know that this mr black wont leave her alive to identify him hell realise that if he does itll be too easy for me to find him and when i do find him ill find his paymaster his bloody client oh believe me andy ill find him anyway but unless we do it by tomorrow night well be too late to help alex sarah had joined them in skinners office she sat beside bobon one of the low cushioned seats shocked and redeyed sipping coffee martin looked back at skinner he had no answer for he knew the inescapable truth of what skinner had said bob pushed himself up from the seat pounding fist into palm in a gesture of pure frustration we dont know where she is boys and we havent a clue how to find her oh my lass my poor poor lass where in gods name are you as he cried out he linked his fingers together and covered his eyes with his hands martin and arrow gazed helpless and silent at his back androunded shoulders but sarah rose quietly from her chair and crossed to him taking him in her arms cradling his bowed headagainst hers they stood like that for a time motionless then slowly steadily skinners shoulders straightened and his hands left his face he now stood erect again and it was almost as if martin and arrow were looking at a stranger the man they saw skinner but not skinner touched them both tough as they were with sudden alarm distress and despair had been put aside and replaced by hope the light of which gleamed cold and savage in his eyes theres someone who does know boys or whod better know and hes lying in the simpson the voice was little more than a whisper he eased himself out of sarahs arms and started for the door but adam arrow stopped him and using all his strength heldhim back bob bob listen to me bob skinner looked down at him still with that awful cold look man said arrow quietly making an effort at a reassuring smile if you went near that man just now the first time he said no to you youd rip is fookin head off and piss down his fookin neck hes got to be handled gentle if hes to tell us anything thatu help alex so you stay here with sarah leave him to me ill talk to him reasonable like you know what i mean if he does know anything ill get it out of him better than you could his smile would have calmed the wildest beast which for a moment skinner had seemed to be sir hamish wasnt out of the room for long but he was gone long enough for alan ballantyne to scrawl out the briefest of letters of resignation for reasons of health and in the interests of my family on scottish office crested notepaper he handed it to the prime minister and without even the briefest glance at sir james proud stalked out of the room scarcely more than five minutes had elapsed by the carriage clock on the adam mantelpiece before the queens private secretary returned from his telephone consultation to his huge relief the chief constable noticed that he was smiling in satisfaction prime minister the tall grey man said formally her majesty has given me some very strict instructions which should make your course of action quite clear the demands contained in the letter to mr skinner are to be complied with in every detail her majesty has said that when seen in this context no treasure is of greater value than a human life he looked at sir james she has said also chief constable that knowing mr skinner from her many visits to edinburgh he and his daughter have her heartfelt sympathy in their predicament she will pray for alexs safe return her majesty said also that she expects mr skinner to ensure that once he has been reunited with his daughter her kidnappers will not remain for long in possession of the honours or indeed of their own liberty warmly and spontaneously the prime minister shook sir hamish by the hand he turned to proud who was standing just behind him there you have it chief constable now go and get the girl back and bag these people while youre at it babies made adam arrow feel uncomfortable he would never actually admit that he disliked them it was only that having been involved all too often through his chosen profession with the other end of the life cycle they pricked his conscience with the thought that every one of the villains he had been forced to deal with had been some mothers son or occasionally some mothers daughter a conscience was something which arrow could not afford and so it was to maintain his own efficiency what others might call his ruthlessness that adam tended to steer clear of any close contact with babies thus it was that to him the everyday sounds in the private wing of the simpson memorial pavilion in the royal infirmary of edinburgh were a little disturbing andy martin had arranged with the general manager with whom he had frequent professional contact that the wounded prisoner from the castle should be housed in a private room in the maternity wing the reason given was that the simpson was the last place where any prying journalist would be likely to look however martins overriding consideration had been that not even mr black or his associates should they feel the need to tie off a loose end would have the idea of searching there either none of the hospital staff knew of the wounded mans presence other than members of the theatre team who had operated on him or were now overseeing his recovery and these people had been sworn to secrecy the surgeon was an ramc major with a career dedicated to repairing gunshot wounds he and his chief nurse had been flown up specially from england near the door of the private room two men sat on opposite des of the corridor casually dressed in jeans and bulky jackets they were reading magazines and did not look particularly interested in each other or in what was going on around them but wnen arrow turned into the corridor he saw to his satisfaction that each man glanced quickly up before at his brief nod delving back into his magazine arrow rapped the door three times the agreed signal and entered another two sas soldiers also in plain clothes were on guard inside one watched the window the other the door hello lads all secure yes sir said the man facing the door in a thick cornish accent quiet as a church its been hows our pal hes doing all right the doc said they turned to look at the bed its frame had been arranged to support the prisoner at an angle presumably to guard against congestion he wore no gown and heavy bandages were wrapped round his chest and extended down from his shoulder covering the wounds where skinners two shots had torn through his right lung the man seemed to be dozing and arrow noted the rough edge to his breathing a tube ran into his nose and another led out from beneath the sheets into an opaque flexible container which was hung below the level of the mattress a long needle was taped down in place on the mans left forearm it was connected by a third tube to a jar of glucose solution hanging high on a stand beside the bed has he had much to say for himself yet asked arrow nah said the cornishman we tried talking to him but he told us to fuck off arrow smiled pleasantly towards the bed maybe hell talk to me lets see shall we you lads take a tea break you can take them two outside as well ill lock myself in this must be a fookin boring detail take alfanhour at least id look after him the two soldiers left the room without protest arrow said nothing for a while he stood quietly at the side of the bed looking down at the nameless prisoner midthirties he guessed as he studied the torso more closely where it showed above the sheets he noted several marks and disfigurements including a ragged scar on the left shoulder crudely treated at some time from the size of the stitch marks he guessed that it might be the relic of another bout of gunplay both upper arms were garishly tattooed there was a lavishly endowed naked lady on the right with the word mother scrolled below and on the left a snake entwined around a dagger with four characters alongside welltravelled feller aint you arrow said suddenly mercenary id guess that could be a problem i hate fookin mercenaries showing up in other peoples countries and killing em for no reasons other than they like it and cos they get paid hate em i do still i shouldnt hold that against you youre a wounded man after all so come on my friend tell me who are you the pattern of the mans breathing changed the closed eyes opened lazily the laboured voice croaked go fuck your mother arrow laughed out loud shes dead pal and anyway id rather fook yours he sat on the edge of the bed idly he touched the tube which led to the needle in the mans forearm he was still smiling ok thats the pleasantries over now lets have a nice little chat ill go first all you have to do is to listen for now at least i belong as my friends whove been looking after you belong to what you might call a closed organisation no ones allowed to see us and when we leave a place its as if wed never fookin been there at all only its different that place i mean its been changed in some way or another sometimes a building or two wont quite be where it was before other times theres some fooker doesnt live there anymore or anywhere else for that matter sometimes both for a closed organisation were quite famous really youll have heard of us im sure he stopped and looked at the bed slowly the man nodded in that case youll know this too when we go into action we go all the fookin way he paused again people never quite believe us so let me tell you a little story thatll help few years back there were some trouble in a jail up here in jockland some lads held a warder hostage and the prison governor he gets fed up decides to teach em a lesson and so he gets authority to send for us so half a dozen of our lot goes up there in a truck with plans of the jail peterhead it were called that they studies on the way its after dark when the truck arrives the plan is for us to go into action straight away so the truck gets backed right up to the hall where the trouble is and the first of our lads jumps out hood on fookin submachinegun in his hands and theres the governor and he sees our lad tooled up like and he all but its himself how far are you chaps going to go e asks and you know what our lad says thats right he says all the fooking way mate and he were right they would have just gone in and wasted all the bad lads cos no one had told m different course they didnt that time in t end the governor made em leave their guns behind gave them pickaxe handles instead they didnt half cream the shit out of those bad lads though arrow stood up again so thats my little story and the moral is pal im not here to piss about youre going to tell me everything you know that i want to hear or im going to go all the fookin way wi you youd better be ready to die cos if you dont talk to me youll be dead within an hour he looked at the glucose bottle on the stand just about at his eye level then continued you see mate after your stunt last night didnt work the guy who paid you did a really stupid thing he decides hes not going to give up so he snatches the daughter of a friend of mine and i really hate it when my friends get upset and he says hell kill her unless we give him the swag and a plane out of the country and thats really dropped you in it mate cos youre the only bugger weve got thats alive to tell us anything about this looker whats his name black and where he might be hiding our lass so this is the deal mate as he spoke his hands began to fiddle with the connection of the tube to the bottle theres a way of killin someone that works every time as effective as a firework up the arse it is but a lot less messy untraceable in fact all you do is take a tube like this of stuff thats goin into someones bloodstream and you pinch it tight like this to stop the flow then you disconnect it like this see the prisoner watched bugeyed as he spoke then you squeeze out some of the stuff at the top like this see then you lets a little air in instead are you watching he needed no reply then you reconnect the fluid like this see then you turn on the drip like this then you let the tube go and the little magic bubble works its way down the tube and up the needle and into the bloodstream and round and round until embolism i think they call it whatever they call it its fookin fatal and thats all thats to it the man stared at arrows hand as it held the tube he had gone rigid on the bed arrow smiled at him no no its all right im not going to let go yet i wont let go until you make me believe that you really want to die and that youre not going to tell me what i need to know to help me find my friends lass but the second i do believe that i let this tube go and not long after that my friend you will experience very painful and quite inevitable death now lets start wi your name go skinner was touched by the queens good wishes most of all he was relieved by prouds news of her insistence that all steps necessary should be taken to ensure alexs safe return ill take personal charge of this operation said proud jimmy i promise you that no risks will be taken ill put marksmen in hiding around the aeroplane if im completely satisfied that its safe for alex ill open fire otherwise ill let them take off well send word to every country within the planes operating range to watch out for its landing and that way well get alex back as soon as possible i skinner smiled a tired drained sort of smile two things chief first you will need to tie me down to keep me away from this operation remember im still head of the antiterrorist unit ballantyne set up until his successor tells pie otherwise next if you have men waiting at the airport theyll be there all bloody night mr black knows theres no way ill let him get on board that plane with alex as soon as they were clear of our airspace shed be dead theyre not going to show up at edinburgh airport that planes just another feint thats the way our mr black works he sells you a dummy every time hes got something else planned well so have i his jaw tightened and some of the tiredness left his face anyway it might not come to that lets wait to see what our guest in the simpson has to tell adam what makes you think hell teh him anything skinner laughed quietly you dont know adam carl stewart the name broke out of him in a strange halfstrangled squawk as if the man had been holding his breath in disbelief while he watched the last of arrows preparation for his execution thats good seen the light have we arrows right thumb and index finger were clamped tight on the clear plastic tube holding up the flow of the nutrient and of the deadly bubble lets have the rest then nationality canadian id guess by the accent right the man nodded and you are a fookin mercenary arent you whereve you been it came more slowly this time weakly as stewart measured each painful breath i wasnt always a mercenary i was a regular in the gulf i came out after that since then ive been in bosnia in africa in guatemala and a few other places what dyou know of this mr black the fella who paid for the plane you lot were going to catch he does things for people difficult things they need done or want done you worked for him before twice once in the states once in south africa first time we busted into a gallery in new york and stole a painting for a collector who dont know we never know who the customer is or the client as mr black calls them and we know better than to ask mr black wouldnt like that and you dont cross him so what did you do in south africa we started a bit of a civil war we killed a black guy a leader made it look like one tribal group did it then we killed some other guys leaders on the other side and made it look like the first lot was taking revenge once they were all killing each other we killed some white guys and all the black guys were blamed at once christ man we had them all chasing their tails down there just like weve had you chasing yours up here once the cops were all used up keeping the sides apart we hit a diamond mine we cleared one hundred million dollars in uncut stones the nearest cops were sixty miles away caught in the middle of a gun battle mr blacks a great planner what makes him so great is he thinks big so whats he like ive never met him arrows hand moved on the tube the man flinched in quick terror come on stewart you expect me to believe that you tell me that this cooker walks on water then you say youve never mt him its true none of us have ever seen him he sends hi messages his orders through someone else a woman i names ariel shes european of some sort we all figure she m be his lady if youve never seen this mr black how dyou know this m isnt the boss herself ariel could never do what someone did to klaus that had be mr black himself whos klaus he was our explosives guy on the new york contract we wen holed up in a cabin in the middle of nowhere up in the catskills ready to go when klaus decided that the money wasnt gooc enough he told ariel that he was out unless the dough was doubled he said he wanted to see mr black himself not deal wit his whore ariel got very steamed up as she can but she saii ok she would arrange for klaus to meet him so what appened next morning we all came down to breakfast ariel cooked for us all in that place and she dished it up in this big mess hall klaus was there waiting for us he was nailed to the timber wall i mean he was crucified hands and feet man there was a big knife through the middle of his chest pinning a notice it said a deal is a deal anyone else want to meet me wasnt no ariel did that to klaus the guy was a house six feet six looked like hulk hogan a mary little horse she was brought in to replace him a genius with explosives and pretty good with a knife too i read in the papers youve tied her into this thing but i never saw mary here she did the jobs she was paid to do but she didnt know the whole story or get to see any of my team mr black let only me and my guys in on the whole plan ariel said he had a very big commission money no object from some collector each of us was on dollars and if anybody had to do time there would be an annuity waiting when we were released so wed never have to work again no mary just did her thing with the bombs then she came up to town and did the singer ray helped her get in but it was mostly her she went underground after that ray the guy you killed he stole the special explosive in france arrow nodded so who was in on last night who planted the other bombs ariel and ingo did that ingo arrows grip on the tube almost slipped yeah ingemar svart hes our pilot engineer an allround mechanical genius you need it built lngo build it you need it fixed lngo fix it you need it to run lngo run it you need it screwed lngo for a second the man laughed weakly then coughed with the effort ingo flies us out of the action so he tends to be kept out of the shooting but he has pitched in sometimes i saw him in cape town he is very good with a gun stewart looked pleadingly at arrow so howm i doing man adam shook his bullet head somewhere along the corridor a baby was crying but he put the sound to the back of his mind not well enough mate you still havent given me any clue where mr black might be keeping our lass wiout that well its turn out the lights the partys over so tell me the rest of it then well see a farmhouse that was where the four of us were holed up and dave our driver he didnt know the plan only where and when to be waiting and where we were going dave used to drive indy cars we rehearsed there in the barn practised handling the sidewinders looked at videos of the castle that ariel had shot she just walked in there like any tourist with a camera and cased the place the videos showed us the tunnel entrance and the vay up to the jewel building so wheres this farmhouse the nearest name on the map is some place called longfonhacus if thats how you say it east of the city and south way up on the moors in the middle of nowhere a shit track road way too far for traffic or tourists only snakes and sheep up there does it have a name stocksmoor it was called ariel said mr black had rented it for the whole of august and september so no one else would go up there until weeks after we were clear if you want to find your i friends girl thats where to head first he stared at arrow again a plea in his eye adam smiled at him along the corridor the babys crying hadstopped he sat on the bed still holding the tube pinched tightlgently almost he took stewarts right hand in his left al carl afookinone thats just what i wanted to hear and then the smile left his face turningt as hard as stone but you know summat i still hate fookin mercenaries especially them as kills soldiers like you lot did in the castle last night i he let go of the tube now grasping both of stewarts hands and holding them vicelike he stared into his eyes without mercl or pity as the man struggled in vain to find the strength and the breath to scream as the air bubble made its way downwards and finally out of sight so hows our man stewart doing now didnt you hear he had a relapse the poor bugger must ave been just a couple of minutes after i left him what a shame eh now he wont collect his pension skinner eyed him pensively but decided to ask no more questions their helicopter was flying low over the lammermuirs away from the setting evening sun skinner and arrow martin and mackie were crammed around the pilot in the small craft another helicopter larger than their jet ranger followed behind carrying mcguire mcllhenney maggie rose and six sas men in full combat gear all of the police officers including skinner carried firearms so there could be as many as five of them yes bob thats if mr blacks there too theres him ariel ingo and dave the indy car driver right said skinner well assume that theyre all there and that theyre all armed your men have seen photos of alex yes yes bob dont worry man theyll know her god theyd better skinners voice betrayed for just a second the unbearable tension which gripped him right when we get there we watch for five minutes then your guys go in hard upper and lower floors in sync her life could be in your hands adam i trust you with it my friend with everyone else in there your usual engagement rules apply do what you think best and ill back you just as he finished speaking the helicopters banked in to land some two miles away from the farmhouse called stocksmoor the group waited until it was fully dark and until their eyes had grown accustomed to the night conditions before beginning to move across the moorland towards where their maps indicated the farm buildings lay they took bearings with compasses as they went confident of the accuracy of the ordnance survey the ground was completely open for the first mile or socovered by a mass of tangled heather still soaking from the stormy of the night before which caught at their feet as they movi through the night christ bob said arrow what do they farm here sheep mate sheep and adders watch your ankles eventually the ground began to drop the clinging heather began to thin out and gave way to grassland and gorse bushes they found themselves descending into a narrowing valley with a dark shape at its heart arrow raised his nightglasses down there his voice was hushed although they were still more than half a mile from their destination they moved on three hundred yards from the farm arrow drew them all together police and sas he handed skinner the binoculars take a look bob tell us what you see skinner put the bulky glasses to his eyes and adjusted the focus wheel there are two buildings ones a steading or barn of some sort looks half ruined the house is more of a cottage two storey but the upper rooms are in the attic theres a chink of light through the curtains of one of the upstairs rooms theres a car in the yard looks like a vitara i cant see the registration from here well call it in for checking when we get closer said martin no said skinner were keeping radio silence and your mobile wont work up here its a blind spot on the network any sign of movement said arrow no none right said the little soldier my lads approach first you coppers stay twenty yards behind stay quiet and keep your fookin heads down ok lads you three he pointed to the men nearest him on the roof but not a fookin sound mind the rest of us on the ground five minutes from now if nowts changed i fire one shot and we go in like shit off a shovel through the windows stun grenades first then us now you all know what alex looks like confirm that everyone please six voices each whispered yes in the dark right everyone else goes down no one walks out arrow turned back to skinner right bob once were in and the shootin stops bring your people in better you dont see what were up to but dont worry about your lass shell be all right wi us he gestured to his men and they moved off towards the house skinner led his group after them at the distance arrow had specified keeping low and taking whatever cover they could eventually behind the dilapidated steading they hid in waiting skinner checked his watch and counted down softly he felt his heart race christ andy he muttered softly to martin i know bob i know but itll be all right seconds later they heard arrows single gunshot its echoes still rang round the valley as the sound of shattering glass reached their ears and the stun grenades exploded they waited for more shooting but there was none skinner waited for a call from arrow but none came come on people he said grimly sounds like theres no one there lets go in they rushed from their cover towards the house light was blazing now from all of its windows three of the sas men stood in the lower hallway of the shabby dwelling it smelled of damp but of recent occupancy too the aroma of ground coffee came from the kitchen blown through on the night breeze from the shattered window skinner stepped into the room to the right off the hall it was deserted a small television set in the corner was switched on but the sound had been turned down either by the departed occupants or by the soldiers martin still standing in the hall was the first to realise that none of the sas soldiers would look at skinner a small knot of apprehension grew in the pit of his stomach he looked up the narrow flight of woodenbanistered stairs adam arrow stood at the top his voice was sad desperately sad and once again devoid of accent as he called from the upper floor looking down not at martin but beyond him at skinner who had stepped back into the hallway bob can you come up please we need you here skinner almost fainted when he saw the body lying on the crumpled bed involuntarily he turned his head away grasping either side of the doorframe to hold himself steady but at last he forced himself to look back into the small room with its damp stained yellowing wallpaper its wardrobe its cracked mirror and its twin divans and on one of them he saw his alex dead for it had to be alex the girl stretched out on her back was tall alexs height she was tanned all over alexs tan from sunbathing topless in the secluded cottage garden at gullane or on the beach in her early summer trips to their holiday home in spain her legs alexs legs were long and lithe unpitted still those of a girl rather than of a woman her small pink proud nipples set on young firm breasts alexs breasts pointed towards the ceiling she was wearing only a pair of cream panties wet at the crotch and grotesquely a white pillowcase it was pulled over her head like a hangmans hood and it was bloodstained at the front it reached down to her shoulders covering completely her hair face and neck still braced in the doorway skinner feeling his heart thundering in his chest looked desperately at her hands for jewellery for a wristwatch for anything strange or new to him anything that would let him tell himself no this is not my daughter but he saw no sign nothing there to give him that comfort maggie rose moved past him towards the body stop sergeant she froze in her tracks at the sound of his voice i have to do this maggie dreadfully slowly or so it seemed to those who watched be walked towards the body andy martin was not in the room he sat at the foot of the stairs trembling the knot of fear in ms stomach now grown to a grasping twisting fist at last bob skinner reached the dead girl he leaned over her then gently reverently lifted her shoulders up from the bed and drew the pillowcase away from her head as he did so he closed his eyes it was only with an effort of will that he opened them again and looked into the face of mary little horse the girls eyes stared back at him lifeless above them there was a dark round hole in the centre of her bloodsmeared forehead later skinner would feel guilt at his immediate reaction but in the moment of recognition he knew only a sense of relief deeper than any he had ever experienced in his life and he gave thanks to whoever was there to hear him that it was this girlwho was dead and not another he gave way suddenly to a great weakness he felt unmanned and so afraid that his frailty might be recognised he laid mary little horse a murderess but another fathers daughter nonetheless back down on her deathbed walked from the chamber head bowed and without a word and locked himself in the bathroom across the landing he sat for a while on the white enamelled edge of the old cast iron bath and alone behind the solid oak door of the little room he wept tears of relief he was trembling and his heart was still pounding he had been certain that it was his alex lying there and in that short time from his first sight of the body to his discovery that it was not her he had been swept by a sense of bereavement so profound that even although it had now been lifted the shadow of its desolation would remain with him for ever he lost all track of time for a while but eventually he calmed himself and recovered his strength but with it he found a feeling of new foreboding his daughter was alive but now his best chance of recovering her safely had evaporated mr black had outguessed him now they would have to risk the jewels staking them and most of all staking his daughters life on the plan he had devised feeling a sudden pressure in his bladder he raised the wooden toilet seat and the lid together and urinated heavily into the wwl finished he pulled the flush lever zipped himself and turned to wash his hands in the white basin as he turned on the ps his eye was caught by a piece of white paper folded and jammed under a plastic shellshaped soapdish which sat on a wooden shelf above the basin curious he lifted the pink dish and picked it up the three sheets of paper appeared to have been torn out of a diary they were folded across tlie centre as he opened them out his earlier foreboding was swept away by his sudden joy at the sight of his daughters message written in pencil on the torn dirty pages scrawled but still legible hi pops they let me watch tv today i saw you and know what this is about ingo says im mr blacks second chance so i can guess what my ransom is he and an american called i dave brought me here during the night on the way they picked up a girl called mary shed been living rough in a hut near gifford its pm a woman called ariel just turned up and were leaving in a hurry she said mr black assumed youd get someone called carl to talk theyve allowed me a quick pee and a wash first though ingo just killed my roommate mary he came in as she was changing pulled a pillowcase over her head and shot her he said she was too risky baggage to carry further i dont know where were going now but if i see a chance ill leg it when you catch up with ingo pops be careful hes very dangerous im sorry i got you into this love you alex he was smiling as he walked out of the bathroom and down intds the hall where martin mackie and arrow waited anxious nont of them certain what sort of a man would emerge he waved thq note at martin look at this andy its from our lass shes something elsej martin took the note and read it arid as he did bob skinnerj laughed to himself and shook his head again in wonderment at hisdaughter he had never been prouder of her she had just seen murder done sudden and shocking but she had still had the presence offt mind to leave a note to try to give what assistance she could bright tough and brave too hi hoped in the hours to come he could live up to her example if you were there youd be putting alexs life at risk theres no way love ill let you do that bob thats an awful thing to say how could you sarah wore for a moment an expression which was completely new to him one of pure hurt then it melted into one of anger and frustration dammit man im a member of your team you made me one remember well as of now youre off the pitch i didnt tell you about last nights operation until it was over because i knew that if i had wed have had this argument then but you could need me there as a doctor if there is trouble if theres shooting people could get hurt alex could get hurt you could get hurt he put his big hands on her shoulders and kissed her on the forehead she leaned back against the larder cupboard of their kitchen at fairyhouse avenue tears gleaming in her eyes he did his best to soothe her sarah my darling i hope with all my heart that when i catch up with them these people will decide that they are not on a suicide mission and will let alex go in fact im forcing myself to believe thats what will happen if im wrong then yes there will be shooting if there is then believe me the people on my team are the best me included but to give our best we have to be completely focused on the job if you were anywhere near youd be a distraction for me and probably for andy too if the shit did start flying wed have you to worry about as well all our thoughts have to be focused on protecting alex and rescuing her if you were there to distract us then as i say you would be adding to her danger look wherever we end up if we need a doctor well get one quick if i do decide to take one it wont be you itll be an army medic but adam arrows probably as good as anyone hed seen action and dear with wounded slightly guiltily a grin gleamed through her tears yeah from what ive seen of little arrow with a pointfcurfive round in the ear the tension between them eased bob chuckled quietly he lifted up her chin and made her look iim in the eye thats better youre smiling again thats how you can help me most love she hugged him close and very tigtit oh but my darling ill be so worried about you about you both about you all i know honey but well be all riglit he was struck by a sudden thought listen wee julia be in the sam boat as you in her ca worrying about andy ill have him britg her up here and the two of you can hold each others hands like the astronauts wives did in alexs play when their men were in orbit she brightened up again yeah we can watch videos woody alien rather than kevin costner though what not even the bodyguard especially not that what about batman thatd be quite appropriate really for you and julia she looked at him puzzled why well what with andys nickname among the oldtimer uniform pcs whats that robin the boy wonder i her eyes widened so that means yours must be exactly thats why i gave up wearing the black leather coat folk thought i was trying to live up to my nickname they laughed together again in the midst of their troubles and bob kissed her once more right ill fix that up with andy now i must be off to fettes its eight oclock all my plans are nude its time to brief the troops brians picking me up and hell be outside by now next time you see me alex will be with me believe me as the door closed behind him the smile on her face dissolved she leaned back against the larder door once more tears flowing freely yes my love i do believe you she whispered but will you both still be alive brian mackie hefted the snipers rifle with its telescopic sight to his shoulder and settled it against him like a new lover adjusting himself to its shape making himself comfortable with its feel and with the lines of its long body skinner looked at the two of them man and mistress silhouettes in the little light which invaded the dark of the office he took in the slender shape of the handbuilt gun and was struck by the contrast with the ugliness of the long silencer which extended its barrel mackie nuzzled his cheek against the walnut stock and waited it was pm outside the gyle centre car park cleared completely of vehicles as instructed was illuminated brightly by its floodlights on their pillars in contrast with the bulky darkness of the two superstores and the other smaller shops which bounded it on two sides its nearly time brian said skinner any second now remember our car is a white mondeo theirs might be a vauxhall senator he felt the rush of adrenaline pumping him up readying him for action though he was still fearful for alex he was glad that the moment had almost come the last thirty sleepless hours had been the longest of his life the rest of the farmhouse had offered them few new leads they had found mary little horses things in a rucksack in the wardrobe in the bedroom the only other signs of the houses occupants had been their refuse the tins and discarded food wrappers which someone had thrown into a green wheeliebin outside the back door and the coffee pot and stained mugs which had been left on the kitchen table eventually skinner had returned to look again more professionally and dispassionately this time at the body of mary little horse alex wasnt kidding about mr ingo andy the man must be good our mary here was a pro herself yes said martin and she was strong as well according to poor old frank adams ingo must have taken her completely by surprise pillowcase over her head and bang before she had time to react poetic justice i suppose or dog eat bitch beside the vitara in the yard they found and photographed a second set of tyre tracks in the setting mud a tyrecentre manager called out in the early hours of the morning had identified them as belonging to the type normally fitted to a valve vauxhall senator the flagship saloon of the range vauxhall skinner had grunted not exactly a rare model still put the word out to all of our traffic cars and to all traffic wardens to look out for senators anybody who sees one carrying a group of two men and two women is to call it in right away but no one is to approach it i dont want them getting nervy while alex is still in that car i want these bastards out in the open the memory of his own instructions snapped him back to the present just as the white mondeo swept into the deserted car park heading towards the centre of the pool of light he had time to spot maggie rose in the drivers seat before she swung the car around so that its nearside faced the office where skinner and mackie were hidden as soon as it had drawn to a halt neil mcllhenney jumped from the front passenger seat and raced round to the boot he pushed the release button and as the lid swung up reached inside and withdrew the two holdalls one long the other squarish which skinner had seen before in another place he wonder whether anyone had bothered to clean off the blood streaks then found himself hoping that they had not without even glancing around mcllhenney obeying to tin letter skinners orders at his briefing earlier that evening put the holdalls down close together on the ground right in the centre of the car park he took three long strides back to the passenj door and jumped in the door had barely closed behind h before maggie rose slammed the car into gear and raced off ir the night heading out of the centre and turning in the direction the city skinner peered at his watch holding it up towards the little li that crept in through the open window it showed almost pm he looked at the second hand as it swept up towards the hour and waited hardly daring to breathe the senator was fortythree seconds late they heard it just before they saw it roaring through the car park entrance and into view the high floodlights reflected strongly from its brilliant white bodywork and gave the heavily smoked glass of its windows a mirrorlike sheen skinner in his hide read the numberplate from afar through powerful fieldglasses he struggled to catch a glimpse of the occupants but the glass was impenetrable under the floodlights and he was unable even to make out their shadows driven very fast and very smoothly the car zigzagged for a second or two as it entered the park before straightening up and making directly for the two holdalls sitting in the centre just as it drew close the driver slammed on the brakes hard and swung it round and to a halt tailfirst at it spun skinner thought that he could just make out four heads inside but it was the most fleeting of glimpses and he could not be certain ok brian stay ready in the dark renewed tension almost overwhelming gripped skinner sir mackies reply was whispered but certain the vauxhall was positioned now between their office stakeout and the holdalls a few seconds passed with no sign of movement skinner guessed that the senators occupants were looking around for any sign of an ambush involuntarily he pressed himself back into the shadows at first he was unable to catch a clear view of the person who climbed out of the car the only indication of any movement was a very slight drop in the suspension then from his distant viewpoint through the glasses he saw under the vauxhalls body a shadow moving on the ground beyond as the passenger door was opened left then right two feet in trainers appeared he swung the fieldglasses upward and caught the back of a blond head and broad shoulders rising well above the level of the car roof its ingo i think he said to mackie the powerful figure moved over swiftly to the holdalls for a second or two there was more of him in view across the bonnet of the senator then none at all as he crouched down disappearing from skinners sight completely even his feet were hidden by the front wheels some time passed he must be giving those bags a good going over mutter skinner just as well we didnt chance putting a tracking device i there mackie who was concentrating all his attention on his vie through the telescopic sight offered no reply only the shadow on the ground told skinner that the search was on the move then suddenly he was in his clear view again l he came round to the rear of the vehicle still crouching with aa holdall in each hand but in the right hand also a small blacldtt object not much larger than a walkietalkie radio handset without putting down his burden he pressed the boot release button with his left thumb the lid swung up he placed the bags and the black object carefully inside and quickly slammed it shut as it closed the man stood up straight and skinner caught his first clear sight of him even if the view was only in profile and af a distance the power of the fieldglasses left him in no doubt ingo right enough his mind swept back to their last meeting in his own home with ingo as his guest as his daughters guest as her lover he remembered the mans cool arrogance and skinners own certain belief that he was being sized up by someone with much more to i him that met the eye as skinner watched ingo swung round scanning the surrounding buildings one more time and he was able to look straight into his face it was cold intent ruthless a face he had seen before yet never seen in this way even without the evidence of mary little horses corpse he would have known at once why alex had stressed this mans menace for a moment the swede seemed to halt in the sweep of his gaze it was as if his and skinners eyes had met skinner thought for that second his heart dropping that ingo had spotted him even from that far away then with relief he remembered that he was looking through fieldglasses the gaze of inspection continued on past their place of concealment and round the rest of the adjoining buildings then he spun on his heel and ran back to the passenger door disappearing from sight the car started to move skinner stared after it numbed by hatred for the man who had abused his daughter and now threatening her life beside him brian mackie pulled the trigger without waiting for any order to be given the soft thud of the silenced rifle broke skinners trance he trained his binoculars on the senator as it started to gather pace and picked out on the offside rear wing something that had been not been there before it was barely distinguishable against the white bodywork but there it was a big whitishgrey stain looking for all the world like a seagull dropping nailed it brian good shot son no problem sir mackie looked over at skinner as he stood in the shadows staring after the car as it disappeared into the night so that was ingo himself boss that was ingo all right no one else he didnt spot us there but hes going to see me again before this night is over oh by christ he is there is no way that helicopters can fly quietly they heard the first whirr of the rotors barely twenty seconds after the vauxhall senator had cleared the car park the bell jet ranger which had taken them to stocksmoor twentyfour hours earlier came in low from the south where it had been hovering out of sight and sound waiting for the pickup at a distance the pilot swept in low across the car park touching down as close as he dared to the building from which skinner and mackie were emerging skinner sprinted up to the craft ducking by reflex under the rotors the door swung open as he reached it and he saw andy martin and adam arrow seated inside behind the pilot skinner jumped into the empty front seat then turned w mackie brian did you bring regular ammo for ttiat gun mackie looked offended of course bos lets have it then you never know it might come in handyhe took the gun and ammunition from his aide and closed i door instantly the jet ranger lifted off stinner turned to at the two men in the seats behind him right boys he said grimly grasping the rifle by its stock i unscrewing the ugly silencer lets hunt sofie bears mcguire was inside the jetstream parked on the runway at edinburgh airport alongside him were three of adam arrows sas contingent fully armed and ready for action the remainder were disguised as airport ground crew with sidearms tucked inside their work tunics mario mcguire carried an h k carbine rather than a pistol for its extra accuracy even at close quarters and its instant stopping power he had once stood up against an automatic weapon when armed only with a handgun and had good reason to be aware of the difference the small turboprop aeroplane stood on the tarmac in front of the main terminal building just beyond the loganair stand a hundred yards away twin gates lay open to allow the getaway vehicle access to the aircraft skinner had asked for radio silence on the operation in the assumption that mr blacks group would be covering all open frequencies however mcguire was linked by a shortrange two way radio to sir james proud who was perched high in the airport control tower he checked his watch and spoke into the handset its sir see anything from up there up in the tower the chief constable surveyed the wide carriageway which led from the landscaped a airport sliproad up to the terminal building the last shuttle had long since landed and no tourist flights were allowed to depart from edinburgh that late in the evening the road was empty proud jimmy clicked the transmit button on his radio nothing yet mcguire looks like mr skinners right this whole thing was a feint theyre going somewhere else give it to then hold on even as the chief spoke he saw in the distance a car shoot off the roundabout at speed and enter the approach road its headlights were full on and badly adjusted even at that distance he was blinded for a second theres a car now cant make out colour or anything else but its travelling it could be the target ready for action on m command officer at the terminal approach route that ca straight on to the tarmac itll be with you in no more than thin seconds acknowledge the uniformed constable on the road at the british midland terminal raised a hand above his head to indicate that he had heard proud had underestimated the cars speed less than twenty seconds later it took the corner into the terminal straight headlights still ablaze the constable stepped into the roadway and flagged the car vigorously towards the open gates and on to the tarmac the driver slammed on the brakes and swung the vehicle round and through the opening the policeman had no time to identify the make of the vehicle he saw only a white flash as it sped past him above proud watched the car as it slowed down to crawl even from his high vantage point it was half obscured by the first buildings of the terminal complex but as he watched it cruised slowly towards the jetstream which was parked in the open beyond a loganair atp ready everyone they may be confused about which plane to take but theyre getting closer theyre stopping ok wait for it doors opening now go down on the tarmac the drivers door of the white car swung open a stocky gingerhaired man got out and reeled back in surprise as six handguns were trained on him by airport groundcrew i what the fuck he cried reaching so high above his head that for a second it looked as if he would take off what the fuck said sir james proud up in the control tower mcguire get out and see what this is mario mcguire jumped from the dash and ran over to the silent group surrounding the white car the passenger doors had been torn open there were no other occupants police snapped mcguire as he reached the scene who are you and what the hell are you doing here the redhaired man continued to reach for the sky harry page ahm harry page look ah know ah wis speedin ahm sorry ma wife works as a stewardess fur loganair ahm here taste pick her up christ mister what is this ahm late enough already ah should have been here at tenfifteen shell bloody murder me as it is remember pilot let it get more than two miles away and weve fookin lost it but it is working sure bob its working like a fookin dream theres enough irradiated iodine in that paintsplash to give us a good strong signal cracking shot by brian that were arrow held a small box on his knee it was wired into the helicopters electrical system a green glow from its screen reflected on his face we can follow them forever with this as long as we stay within two miles and as long as the paint doesnt get washed off can we make visual contact skinner asked the pilot yes but do you want to take the chance sir a mile is as close as id come to be sure they wont see us no arrow answered for him trust our little box bob ill wager thats the only car on the road with a big patch of radioactive birdshit on its tail ok adam skinners voice could only just be heard above the noise of the helicopters engine lets go with it what does it tell us well you were right theyve bypassed edinburgh airport that were a con all along i reckon theyve just gone past the norton house unless they turn off for ratho its newbridge roundabout next said skinner from there they can go anywhere north over the forth bridge although i dont think theyll fancy stopping to pay the tolls falkirk and stirling up the m or due west to glasgow on the m and then as far south as the road goes how far can they get on a tank of fuel in that thing asked arrow hard to say but the bigger the engine the bigger the tank even though thats a threelitre he should get to birmingham easy maybe london at a pinch without stopping if he goes south and gets into heavy traffic weve got a problem as long as hes got that paint on his arse hes the one with the problem lets hope so said skinner watch that tracker he should be at newbridge any second now arrow bent close to the little screen the reflected glow turned his face green in the darkness of the cabin here we go hes swinging hes going left yes hes off ls the ms bob hes off to glasgow no one came to the door when maggie rose rang the bell the porch of the skinner bungalow in fairyhouse avenue was lit and welcoming but no one answered surely they havent gone out she said to neil mcllhenney cant imagine so but then the boss didnt tell them we were oming it was an afterthought of his this babysitting idea god neil dont let sarah hear that remember the party line that he decided he should expect anything from these characters o with him and andy out of town he sent us down here as irotection shell never believe that maybe not but she wont take it out on us shes a nice lady lie doctor try the bell again they rang again listening hard to make certain the bell had sounded and waited for two full minutes more before deciding to check round the back they crept softly along the gravel towards the back door and saw as they went that the garage door was open skinners car was there but sarahs was gone the garden was lit from the unshaded kitchen window arid from the back door which lay slightly ajar they had their pistols drawn as they slipped nervously into the house moving quickly through the deserted kitchen they went from room to room on the ground floor checking each one cautiously then they climbed the short flight of stairs to the attic to satisfy themselves that the three upper rooms were empty also before returning to the livingroom for a second look they saw that sarah had prepared for julias arrival a big oval plate of freshly cut ham and tomato sandwiches americansized t on the low glass coffeetable between the two sofas alongside it were two plates two china mugs knives spoons and paper napkins nothing there was out of place they went back into the kitchen the coffee filter was primed and ready waiting to be switched on two glasses a bottle of smirnoff silver and a tin of diet cocacola sat on the work surface beside the tall fridgefreezer without touching anything mcllhenney crouched down and studied each item closely one glass was threequarters full a few bubbles clung to the side and a slice of greenish lime floated on the surface lipstick traces showed on the rim he leaned over the glass and sniffed bacardi and tonic he said he looked at the other glass a slice of lemon was wedged at its foot in a finger of a clear liquid he sniffed that too but found no trace of alcohol he looked again at the bottle vodka and coke in the making probably so what happened to them he asked maggie sarahs got a drink on the go when julia arrives and she comes into the kitchen to mix one for her guest she gets the ice and lemon from the fridge drops them in the glass takes the smirnoff and the coke from the fridge as well and thats as far as she gets then they decide to go to the pictures hardly maggies face broke into a sudden relieved smile neil shes a doctor isnt she not just with the police but in a general practice shes had an emergency callout rather than leave julia here shes taken her with her thats your mystery mcllhenney looked sceptical oh aye and being an accs wife she just runs out the back door and leaves it wide open with all the lights on maggie grimaced i see what you mean then she made a decision look lets wait here anyway as ordered but in the meantime lets try and check her practice then we can call in to brian mackie when he gets back to the office glasgow reflected yellow in the night sky ahead closer at hand they saw below them the lights of the harthill service area as the helicopter continued to track the vauxhall westward along the m they matched its speed keeping a mile behind it occasionally skinner fancied he glimpsed taillights in the distance the car was travelling fast at just over mph but not so fast as to attract the attention of the motorway patrols skinner checked his watch the time was pm yet it seemed like an age since the senator had raced into the gyle centre he hated to be bottled up it made him feel claustrophobic eventually he could stand the tension inside him no longer he dug his mobile telephone from the top right pocket of his black leather jacket pilot if i use this thing will it work shouldnt have a problem this close to the ground were right on top of a cell here too you might find it a bit patchy but go ahead skinner peered at the keyboard in the dim cabin light and keyed in the stored number of brian mackies direct line he was answered after a few seconds brian its me you made good time getting back youll know by now that we were right about that plane at edinburgh were heading for glasgow i want you to call willie haggerty give him the number of the senator he dictated the number which he had memorised tell willie i want people at all docks and i want as many men as he can get under cover at glasgow airport the line went faint for a second then strengthened again you think theyll go for another plane has to be could be theyre just going to drive in and hijack one using alex as bargaining power but the way this things been planned i reckon theyve got a backup ready neednt be very big an mile range will get you to a hell of a lot of places from glasgow especially overnight whatever it is wherever it is i cant let them take off with alex on board now give haggerty the message and tell him to make sure that nobody moves in without me there to give the orders i dont want any of those glasgow lads playing cowboys with my daughters life on the line suddenly the trace vanished from the monitor skinner could not actually see the screen but he sensed its disappearance from the sudden look of panic which flashed across arrows face wheres it gone whats happened he snapped sok bob came the calm steady voice of andy martin seated next to arrow he had detailed maps on his knees and a torch in his hand theyre in the charing cross underpass beneath that ugly office block that goes over the road well have them back in a second yes there it is still on course for glasgow airport just going on to the kingston bridge now skinner turned to the pilot how fast can this thing go twice as fast as they can and dead straight remember good i must be at the airport before they get there well follow them for a minute of two more then once were absolutely certain thats where theyre headed well put the foot down and beat them to it suppose they see a chopper there at an airport they wont think anything of it martin broke it hold on boss they seem to be turning off the motorway eh which way hold on theyre in a sort of a curve theyre still on the slip road ill know in a minute yes theyre still heading west id say theyre taking the offmotorway route to the airport out through govan thats got to be it its one last feint tricky sods these god andy but i hope youre right look we cant track them street by street through this lets give them two more minutes then we commit to glasgow airport they hugged the line of the motorway as it headed towards the airport and as they did so the trace from the dye on the vauxhall senator stayed to the north on arrows screen moving much more slowly now as the car wound through the streets of govan skinner tapped the pilot on the shoulder to attract his attention how long to the airport for us three minutes for him by that route fifteen minimum skinner was about to commit himself finally to glasgow airport leaving the trace behind when martin broke in what the hells this theyre doubling back what the trace its turned back on itself dear christ said skinner with a sigh of fear and frustration its gone again said martin pilot hover hold your position arrow and martin stared at the screen skinner leaned back over the seat for a clear sight and arrow turned the tracer set half towards him to allow him to view the little cathode screen stayed obstinately blank damn it damn it damn it skinner roared in his rage wheres the fucker gone arrow offered a suggestion in hope he could have gone into a garage to fill up i bollocks you think this lots planning includes running out of petrol in the middle of the night in fucking govan theyll have another car somewhere the bastards have stashed the senator and switched weve lost her boys weve lost her his despair was even greater than that of the night before for then there had been that other slim possibility but now no the certainty in martins voice banished the darkness gathering in skinners heart the tunnel the clyde tunnel entrance is down there pilot head north the helicopter banked sharply round and headed away from the bright lights of the motorway towards the network of orange lines which crisscross the west of glasgow by night bisected by the dark slash of the river clyde north they went but the screen was still dead even when they had almost reached the river andy you sure about this what other chance is there theyll have gone out of range for a bit well have to catch them up look there they are already yeah you beauty skinner cried with delight you bastards wont do that again he growled at the trace as if through it alexs kidnappers could hear him he looked again and saw that the senator was headed due north so now wherere they off to asked adam arrow and the atmosphere at once grew more sober again what does the map say asked skinner i dont need the map for that said martin theyre headed up crow road towards anniesland cross from there they can go in four different directions its anyones guess now which one theyll take whatever it is said skinner weve got to guess their destination and get there before them otherwise his voice tailed away wearily lets see what they do said martin they could even cut back across the erskine bridge and come into the airport from the other side anniesland cross tell us that they must be there now the trace has stopped thatll be the trafficlights of course theyre so complicated there its always possible the bugger could get lost he stared at the screen there he goes again west is it no hes going north still that makes it bearsden and milngavie beyond that thats the wrong way for a boat and its away from all the airports christ knows where hes off to bob to lie low for a few days dyou think skinner shook his head no theyve got what they came for they wont let the sun come up on them somewhere theres an aircraft any ideas pilot no sir not in this direction i have to warn you though if theyve got a full tank theyll outlast us especially if were flying stopandstart like this skinner nodded aye i figured look my last option is that if were going to run out of fuel we land on the road in front of them and shoot their tyres out but thats nightmare stuff its the slimmest of all chances for my daughter how long have we got no more than half an hour sir jesus here bob hold on a minute ive got it skinner looked over his shoulder to the rear seat a sly smile showed on martins face the green eyes made even greener by the reflection of the screen caught in his contact lens seemed to glow brightly in the dark hes off to balnaddar sorry to bother you sir but weve got a mystery here maggie rose had come through on mackies direct line nc long after he had finished passing skinners message on ti superintendent haggerty she explained to him that sarah s julia shahor had vanished find that there were clear signs t their disappearance had been sudden and unplanned so what have you done about it weve checked the doctors callout service no emergency calls have been put through to sarah tonight then weve checked the hospitals she hasnt been een at any of them weve checked with telecom no calls to or ffom this number all evening weve checked with uci and the other cinemas that take creditcard bookings none made by either sarah or julia oh yes and weve even searched the garden just in case they saw us and decided to play the fool all in all sir s far not a trace of them mackie took a few seconds to consider what he had been told ok maggie youve done everything right so far ill take things from here you two stay there and wait for them getting back from the chinese or yvhatever carryout shop theyve probably gone to ill have an east lothian car check out gullane you going to let the boss krtow no bloody way he and arfdy have enough on their minds without nonsense like this the airfield was just where martin had said it would be it lay a few miles north of milngavie t uks least pronounceable town as arrow had dubbed it on the a to blanefield and ultimately to aberfoyle just where the flatter landscape gives way finally to seemingly endless hills skinner had committed the helicopter as soon as the trace showed that the senator had taken the fork to milngavie swinging wide round the car the pilot had outpaced it easily now the dead screen showed that they were well in front of it but skinner was unworried he knew that there were no other forks or turnoffs on the road for their quarry to take but if he was wrong and this was not to be the stopping place he still had fuel in hand for the gamblers last throw which he had contemplated earlier what was this place used for then andy he asked as the helicopter hovered low over the strip martin did not answer for a moment as he watched the searchlight beam follow the entrance road from the a sweep along the short grey tarmac runway and finally pick out the hangar the only building in the field the university flying club used it in my day he said eventually they ran three planes out of here a few private pilots flew from here as well then some of them played silly buggers and got too close to the glasgow flightpath so the caa had it closed down after that somebody rented it for a while and ran it as a gokart track until mountainbikes and video games came along and killed that business stone dead since then it hasnt been used at all as far as i know the university still owns it but they cant think of anything to do with it they cant get planning permission for houses and so they cant sell it the last i heard of it was when i saw in a graduates association circular in the spring that it was going to be used for a charity bungeejump whod be likely to know about this place other than the locals and students skinner asked just about any pilot with access to the right charts itll still be marked on them like for emergencies only as he spoke the helicopter touched down facing the hangar the pilot switched off the engine and as the craft settled raised the beam of the searchlight and played it on the rusting doors they stood slightly ajar the policemen the soldier and the pilot jumped from the jet ranger and walked towards the hangar their shadows on its doors growing smaller as they neared it they saw immediately that it was impossible for the doors to be pulled fully shut because of thick grass which had sprouted in their runner one by one the men squeezed through the gap although for arrow who seemed squatter than ever it proved a tight fit martins torch had a wide beam adjustment in the broad light it cast they saw in the centre of the hangar its propellers facing the doors a small twinengined aircraft martin shone the torch into the aeroplane it had four seats two in front two to the rear with storage space behind what make is it skinner asked the pilot could be some sort of fokker range depends on the load but if its fully tanked up quite a way southern ireland no sweat well into france the benelux countries scandinavia even and this one is fully tanked up look at the way shes sitting on the suspension that says it all said skinner he reached inside his jacket and took a browning automatic from its holster right we havent got all night we must get that chopper airborne again now adam you and i are the reception committee you in that corner over there against the wall and beyond the door ill take the other side he turned to martin and the pilot you two get the hell out of here and do what you have to he paused then a strange look came into his eyes a look with fear hope and determination all mixed in the i have an appointment with my daughter and with one or two people who are going to wish they had never met her they heard the vauxhall senators tyres sizzle on the rough tarmac road and saw the beam of its headlights swing round as it slowed to a halt facing diagonally into the hangar arrow was almost caught in the sweep of the light as it lanced into the big shed through the gap in the doors just in time he jumped back into his corner hidingplace they heard a car door open then a voice familiar to skinner said thank you dave this is for you the sound of the gunshot followed less than a second later then sudden reflex female reactions two women screaming skinner thought ingo could not have warned ariel about his plans for dave he tensed himself in the dark and flicked off the safetycatch of the browning he was ready for instant action but not for what came next all right pops you and your boys better come out now dont want pretty daughter to get hurt ingo called directly into the hangar for once in his life skinner was taken completely by surprise come on bob ingo called again if youre in there you step out within three seconds if youre not there well i dont need her any more so i just shoot her now just like poor dave i didnt tell him it was only a little plane come on out now your last chance ok skinner roared from the shadows of the hangar he left his place of concealment the browning still in his hand but pointing to the ground and stepped through the opening out into the halogen light out to face the kidnappers and his daughter both the front and back offside doors of the senator were wide open ingo stood beside the car pressing alex tight against him his left hand held one end of a thick leather belt which was looped through its buckle around her neck his right hand pressed a pistol to her temple cold hard rage swept over skinner like an arctic wave hi right fist tightened on the gun he wanted very badly to kill t man now and knew that there was nothing left in him no shred of restraint to stay his hand he looked ingo dead in the e with such fearsome anger that for a second it penetrated the oti mans coolness and made him flinch even with his gun held cl to alexs head you will let my daughter go now said skinner in a holli voice and then i will deal with you but ingo held on to his nerve and skinner saw that alexs n had not exaggerated the menace of the man no no bob let her go now you must think i am crazy now you you look a little nuts if you are still trying to trick me it will be bad for alex he pushed the muzzle of his gun harder against the girls temple now where are the rest tell them to show themselves skinner opened his mouth to call out but then heard a movement behind him he looked over his shoulder to see adam arrow step into the light thats good but wheres the other one who this martin the one that alex told me all about you wouldnt leave your righthand man out of something like this where do you think he is i sent him off in the chopper to call up the heavy squad ingo laughed then hell be too late were fuelled up and ready to go and no one will ever track me in this thing i can go too low too slow for the radar it will just think im a fat bird so come on lets get on with it your guns on the ground please ingo glanced towards arrow as he threw his pistol on the ground and in that instant skinner snapped his browning up to a firing position left hand on right wrist it was pointed directly between the mans eyes as he held his aim skinner felt an icy coolness sweep over him felt the presence of the other man the man in the closet as sarah had described him no son he said calmly and steadily you dont understand it ends here you just said you werent crazy so work this out i know for certain that if you take alex away from here youll kill her just like you killed the girl in the farmhouse and your driver there so i will not let you take her away if she is to die she will die with me her father beside her but if you do kill her even if you harm just a single hair on her head then i will shoot you at that very moment believe me that is my solemn promise if youre not crazy you dont want to die so let her go now the last word was as soft as a whisper but it carried the force of a shout death stood surely before him and yet ingo svart laughed in its face and in that second skinner looked at his daughter and saw only her concern for him not fear for herself pops she mouthed silently no poor old bob said ingo it is you who dont understand your situation time for our last surprise i think he called over his shoulder ariel the nearside passenger door of the senator opened and a woman stepped out slowly but it was not ariel not yet it was sarah she looked helplessly at bob then shook her head and then another woman stepped out julia but not julia ariel the doeeyes which skinner had come to know so well were now hard as flints as they stared across at him her smile previously warm and wide was cold tight and controlled she held a gun to sarahs side and stood pressed close to her so now i think you will take your pistol off my brother and we will see if we can reach some agreement her voice was as dark as her eyes her accent seemed to have changed too it was clipped more european in origin her hair usually flowing was pulled back into a long heavy ponytail she was dressed functionally in jeans and a white shortsleeved top far removed from either the flowery or the formal styles of the julia shahor that he had thought he knew so how did you he began but he could guess dont blame andy bob he told me nothing we didnt know already until he picked me up tonight i was just about to leave his place to meet up with ingemar when he called to tell me of your excellent idea that sarah and i should look after each other then he said that he had to go catch a helicopter not a plane a helicopter thats when i knew for sure that you hadnt bought our escape story and that you wouldnt just set an ambush at the airport but would try to trace us to wherever we were heading we expected youd probably find some way to track us in the end i know youre a very dangerous man especially where your beloved alex is concerned so when andy said that i decided we had to take sarah too just to make sure a selfsatisfied smile crept across her face did our little surprise give you a scare last night sorry about that but you have really annoyed us we have been planning this operation for two years we committed finally when i was offered the film festival contract imagine to be running an operation and to be in on the police security briefings we planned every detail down to the last little item even to auntie staying with me to give me an excuse to get away from filmhouse at odd hour shes enjoying this thought skinner keep her talking boy wait for the moment then take it by god you take it the thought sent a thrill of anticipation running through him ariel went on we ran this type of operation once before inp south africa it worked so well there we really didnt think wedj need a backup plan this time but when we did alex working in the same show as ingo was such a gift and my getting involved with andy was the icing on the cake the breakin thing at my house was clever wasnt it poor ray staged that one for me and andy was hooked thats andys one weakness you know hes vulnerable to love such a pity because he turned out to be my one weakness too for a moment ariel paused her boasting turned to wistfulness if it had worked i was going to stay here not leave with ingemar i could have married andy hows that for funny but when i had to let alex see me last night i lost that chance ariel enough we have to go for the first time anxiety showed in ingo she nodded yes we must so here is he deal bob we leave the ladies here but we take you just you not your little friend hes the soldier andy mentioned i imagine we couldnt handle you both in that little plane and we take our prizes here of course the crown the sceptre and he sword we have a delivery to make to our client you she turned to arrow fetch the bags from the car and load them into the plane then we take off and you make sure there is no attempt to stop us bob you take your chance at the othel end now throw down your gun lets get moving arrow looked across to skinner who nodded to him arid at the same time dropped his browning on the ground the little soldier moved past sarah and ariel behind the car and took the holdalls from the boot he carried them across to the hangar shoving its doors further apart with his shoulders and placed them on one of the two rear seats of the plane thats good said ariel thats the most important part now bob you get on board please skinner shook his head not till the girls and adam are free and clear oh no adam is not going anywhere barely looking to take aim she snapped off a single shot arrow crumpled and went down so that just leaves the five of us now do you get on that plane or she stopped and shrugged her shoulders impatiently but why bother its much easier if we just kill the lot of you ingemar ill shoot the women you take skinner now as she called to her brother she pushed sarah away from her and levelled her gun at her chest the shot was still cracking all around the airfield even as she fell andy martin lay on the damp grass he saw the cars approaching headlights and saw it swing to a halt with its beams shining into the hangar he saw the muzzleflash and even at that distance heard the sharp sound as ingo dispatched the driver he saw him pull alex from the car he saw the eyetoeye guntogun stalemate between skinner and the swede and then he saw sarahs head and shoulders emerge from the far side of the car and saw the profile of the woman who followed pushing her forward but staying close holding something to her side it was the profile he had come to know so well in the moonlight not so long before but different somehow the truth came to him in a flash and his heart sank he had taken the devil into his bed and into his heart in the guise and the garb of an angel he watched helpless seeing her lips move he strained to hear what she said but of course he was too far away he saw arrow take the bags from the car and carry them into the hangar he started in horror as she shot him down and then still through the telescopic sight of the snipers rifle which skinner had taken earlier from brian mackie he saw her push sarah away from her and knew instantly what she was about to do tears flooded his contact lens but only in the second after he pulled the trigger ariel who had been andys beloved julia twisted like a corkscrew as the heavy rifle bullet tore through her ingo looked across in horror as his sister fell his gun which had been swinging towards skinner wavered aimlessly for a moment and in that moment skinner was upon him not the affable if inquisitive skinner whom he had met before as alexs pops this was another skinner the cold deadly skinner he had glimpsed a few minutes earlier the executioner skinner with no mercy in his eyes he felt his gun hand immobilised as an immensely strong forearm knocked it outwards and upwards he felt his arm twisted and a hard hand clamping across his throat setting his jaw at an angle he felt no more after that but he heard crashing through his brain a terrible thunder as the heel of skinners right hand slammed under his chin driving it upwards throwing his head backwards and breaking his neck that thunderclap sound was the last living sensation of ingemar svart skinner held the dead weight upright with one arm as he hugged his daughter tight against him with the other for a few moments the three figures stood there in some terrible tableau until ingos lifeless fingers loosened their grip on the belt around alexs neck and skinner allowed his body to slip to the ground he felt alexs long slender hands on his face turning him towards her pops pops are you all right he blinked and then smiled at her as wide a smile of relief and happiness as she had ever seen as they stood together sarah came to them and wrapped her trembling arms around them both as bob embraced them the women felt a violent trembling run through him as sudden exhaustion physical and emotional ovcttook him but quickly he brought it under control its all right now girls its all right its all over he led them across into the hangar and towards the plane now you two sit in here and look after the queens sunday hat while i get this lot sorted out he held the door open as first sarah and then alex stepped up into the small craft then he turned to go to look for the fallei arrow and found to his great delight that the little soldier wav sitting upright v fookin marvellous these new flak jackets are give us a handup i laughing with relief skinner pulled him to his feet dont know whats so fookin funny bob takes your fookin breath away does a bullet in the chest a few yards away ariel lay on the ground most of her white top had been stained bloodred but she was still moving skinner knelt beside her as he did he glanced across the landing strip in the direction from which the shot had come the moon had risen and in its glow he could see andy martin coming slowly towards him a rifle in his hand his shoulders sagged as he walked like a man with no desire to reach his destination skinner looked down at the woman her lips were blood frothed and he saw that she was dying ingo she said faintly no he saw her eyes flood with tears ariel he asked who is your buyer but he was not surprised when with the last of her strength she shook her head then who is mr black not so clever after all eh bob she whispered work it out for yourself a final light of satisfaction shone in her hard eyes then it faded and she was gone and in death she was julia again softeyed gentle julia skinner unfastened the ribbon which tied her ponytail and let her hair fall loose then he stood up as andy martin came to his side and stood looking down with reddened eyes at his lovers body tin sorry bob he said very quietly she took me in hook line and sinker i even brought her to your house and put sarah in danger andy andy she took me in too she was crystal tipps remember i believed her every bit as much christ it was me who told you to take her to sarah andy man never blame yourself again what you did was the hardest thing youll ever have to do in your life and because of that it was the bravest too when i let my gun go i knew i was putting all our lives in your hands and i never doubted for one second that youd come through then he add adam arrow took andy martin now limp and exhausted and led him away from the bodies of ariel who had also been his julia and of her brother with whom she had schemed stolen killed and finally died ah but lads said andy as they walked away in a voice full of almost unspeakable regret when she was julia when she was good ill never find anyone again like the woman she pretended to be adam arrow dug him gently in the side with an elbow sure you will andy sure you will she were only an illusion remember she werent real theres plenty of women who are though why for a start theres two in that plane over there mind you ones spoken for and the other well er fathers a bad fella to cross so our mr black didnt exist after all it was midafternoon only one day and a half after the deaths of ingemar and ariel and the end of all their plots their projects and their schemes bob skinner and sir james proud stood in the back garden of the bungalow at fairyhouse avenue the blazing heat which had marked the first festival days had gone but there was still enough warmth in the sun for them to be in shirtsleeves each held a drink in his hand proud jimmys a ginandtonic bobs the usual beer straight from the bottle well jimmy you could say that in fact he did he was well what would you call him a trading identity i suppose ariel and ingos joint trade name and it really was their name too shahor in hebrew which she wasnt and svart in swedish which he wasnt either both mean black interpol have finally tracked them down brother and sister they were indeed but german by birth and guess what their family name was schwartz julias story to andy about her parents marriage breaking up and her being sent to israel that was a load of balls apparently the truth is that the teenage schwartz kids joined a rightwing action group one that went in for violent protests of various sorts the police never caught on to them but their father found out about it and threw them out after that happened they seem to have decided that terrorism had a limited future not to mention very poor profit margins but that the sort of things they had learned could be put to good commercial use given the right sort of customer one prepared to put up whatever funding they would need to get what he was after they must have known they were both very young to be credible as the leaders of the sort of operations they were offering to put together so they seem to have invented mr black as a sort of authority figure a mystery man in the background to keep their clients happy that they were dealing with someone really heavyduty and to keep even the hardest acts among the hired help well in line when their bluff was called they were tough enough as anyone who crossed them found out interpol has been trying to get a handle on them for a while they reckon theyve been in business for six or seven years that would have made them early to midtwenties when they started in no small way apparently they stole a twentymilliondollar stallion in the states its never been seen since but some very quick two and threeyearolds have started showing up in the gulf states and in hong kong the schwartzes disappeared around five years ago and then ingemar svart and julia shahor showed up each had brandnew degrees phoney of course although they were both exceptionally talented they followed different careers well apart but each according to their passports was able to do a lot of travelling the stamps show that they were both in the vicinity of those jobs that stewart told adam arrow about they were a roaring success until eventually they showed up here proud sipped his drink the ice almost melted quite a pair quite a story im just glad you were able to stop them so how are sarah and alex are they getting over it how are you for that matter the girls are ok a bit shaky still so are we all but were leaning on each other were a family well be fine and andy what about him dyou think thats something else again what a thing he had to do i told him to take a month off but all he said was that if i did then he would too ill keep an eye on him for a few weeks make him take counselling at least then once hes justified himself to himself and shown everyone he can carry on regardless ill sort out a sabbatical for him maybe we could send him off to do some research on security policing in another country with another force somewhere far away thats a good idea said proud jimmy ill look into some possibilities oh by the way therell be no fai on ingo or ariel ive fixed that with the crown office they did a postmortem on him last night the old pathologist told me he couldnt believe his eyes he said the last injury hed seen like that was thirtyseven years ago and that bloke had been hanged how bloody strong are you bob strong enough to look after my nearest and dearest thats all the strength ill ever need well my friend i hope you never have to call on it again skinner smiled go on jimmy get the girls and andy and adam those steaksll be barbied by now a proud jimmy turned to walk into the house then stopped interpol havent a clue about the client have they no not a sniff you know im beginning to think they might have done it on spec and that they might not even have had a client if they were risking their own money that could explain why they pursued it to the very end theyd have had cash enough from their earlier jobs to fund the whole operation and there are enough wealthy weirdos around the world for them to have set up an auction for the regalia and pulled an incredible price that could have been what it was all about but chances are well never know epilogue everard balliol sat in his den he was a ten percent shareholder in tni and as such received daily transcripts of the stations output as a matter of course his jaw was working fiercely as he read the account of the foiling of the edinburgh castle raid and of the failure of the followup attempt on the crown jewels of scotland just as well for those two they didnt make it he growled wouldnt have been no mountain high enough for them everard balliol was a vengeful man it ran in his family he was also one of the richest in the world and so had the resources to indulge his whims in whatever form they developed it was that crazy book he had picked up on a hotel stopover a few years back when there was nothing else to read the lion in the north it was called by some guy named john prebble and that had started him on his crusade until then hed no idea that he was the descendant of kings the names had jumped out at him early in the book and he had read all night john balliol and then edward balliol kings of scotland and allies of the mighty plantagenets of england their throne usurped by the brigand bruce and so robbed of their birthright his familys birthright his birthright for the finest genealogists his money could buy had confirmed his instant assumption he did spring in direct line from the seed of those ancient kings royal scottish blood did flow through his veins everard balliols crusade to restore what he saw as his familys good name had been his driving force from that time on he had paid frequent trips to scotland he had studied its later history its laws its institutions he could have bought up much of it but had decided early on that he wanted no part of contemporary scotland it had been corrupted softened anglified and its people had been spread around the globe so instead he had considered how to have his personal entitlement of scotland and eventually he had decided if he could not have his kingdom he would have its crown from a hugely wealthy and very unorthodox art collector friend he had heard already about mr black and the anonymous box number in geneva very special assignments you want it you give him enough money hell get it for you his team is good the friend had saidi know look at that painting they got for me even if i had been able to buy it at auction it would have cost fifteen million dollars through mr black i got it for eight and so balliol had contacted the geneva box number and black had sent his messengers that little woman and her blond brother he had given them enough money given it to them two years back and he had waited and now it was gone and nothing to show for it he slammed his fist on the desk in his den in his bungalow in his fortified compound in the deeps of texas as he read the report again he fixed on one name a memorable name assistant chief constable bob skinner some day my friend some day everard balliol said aloud
