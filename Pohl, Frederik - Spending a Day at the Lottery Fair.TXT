all writers have favorite themes and return to them over and overeven when they dont intend to and perhaps as in my own case dont realize quite how often theyve done so until it comes time to put a collection of stories together their excuse which i do dearly hope you will find justified in the present examples is that a new treatment a new setting a new angle of attack can refresh an argumentespecially an argument that seems worth making in the first place at any rate this story came about in the summer of when curiosity led me to knoxville to see how they were doing with their firstever worlds fair i am no great connoisseur of worlds fairs id only been to three before knoxvillethe pair in new york city a generation apart and the event in osaka japan knoxville was a much smaller spectacle still it had a lot of interesting exhibits and a holidaycarnival atmosphere i had a good time the locals i talked to seemed to be enjoying it a lot less and when i asked them why so glum they reported that it was losing money by the fistful and pot what then was the reason for having it echo gave me an answer and so i went back to my hotel room and began writing this story they were the baxter family randolph and millicent the parents with their three children emma and simon and louisa who was the littlest and they didnt come to the fair in any old bus no they drove up in a taxi all the way from their home clear on the other side of town laughing and poking each other and when they got out randolph baxter gave the driver a really big tip it wasnt that he could really afford it it was just because he felt it was the right thing to do when you took your whole family to the lottery fair baxter believed you might as well do it in style besides the fare was only money though millicent baxter pursed her lips when she saw the size of the tip she certainly was not angry her eyes sparkled as brightly as the childrens and together they stared at the facade of the lottery fair even before you got through the gates there was a carnival smell buttered popcorn and cotton candy and tacos all together and a carnival sound of merrygoround organs and people screaming in the rollercoaster and bands and bagpipes from far away a clown stalked on tall stilts through the fairgoers lining up at the ticket windows bending down to chuck children under the chin and making believe to nibble the ears of teenage girls in bright summer shorts rainbow fountains splashed perfumey spray people in cartooncharacter costumes gus the ghost and mickey mouse and pacman handed out free surprise packages to the kids when simon opened his it was a propeller beanie a fan for emma for little louisa cardboard glasses with a groucho marx mustache and crowded you could hardly believe such crowds off to one side of the parking lot the tour buses were rolling in with their loads of foreign visitors chinese and argen tines and swedes they had special entrances and were waved through by special guards who greeted them some of the time anyway in their own native languages willkommen and bon jour and ey there mate as long as they didnt speak anything like urdu or serbocroatian anyway for the foreign tourists didnt have to pay in the usual way they bought their tickets in their country of origin with valuable foreign exchange and then everything was free for them of course it wasnt like that for the regular american fairgoers they had to pay you could see each family group moving up toward the ticket windows they would slow down as they got closer and finally stop huddling together while they decided how to pay and then one or two of them or all of them would move on to the window and reach into the admissions cuff for their tickets randolph baxter had long before made up his mind that there would be no such wrangles on this day for his family he said simply wait here a minute and strode up to the window by himself he put his arm into the cuff smiled at the ticket attendant and said grandly ill take five please the ticket seller looked at him admiringly you know she offered there arent that many daddies wholl take all the little fellows in like that sometimes they make even tiny babies get their own tickets baxter gave her a modest idowhatican shrug though he could not help that his smile was a little strained until all five tickets had clicked out of the roll he bore them proudly back to his family and led them through the turnstiles my what a crowd sighed millicent baxter happily as she gazed around now what shall we do first the response was immediate see the old automobiles yelled simon and no the animals and no the stiffs cried his sisters randolph baxter spoke sharply to themnot angrily but firmly there will be no fighting over what we do he commanded well vote on what we do the democratic way no arguments and no exceptions now he added the first thing were going to do is that you kids will stay right here while your mother and i get tickets for the job lottery the parents left the children arguing viciously among themselves and headed for the nearest lottery booth randolph baxter could not help a tingle of excitement and his wifes eyes were gleaming as they studied the prize list the first prize was the management of a whole apartment buildingtwentyfive thousand dollars a year salary and a free threeroom condo thrown in millicent read his thoughts as they stood in line dont you just wish she whispered but personally id settle for any of the others look theres even a job for an english teacher randolph shook his head wordlessly it was just marvelousfive fulltime jobs offered in this one raftle and that not the biggest of the day the last one after the fireworks always had the grandest of prizes arent you glad we came millicent asked and her husband nodded but in fact he wasnt altogether at least until they safely got their tickets and were on their way back to the children and then he was quickly disconcerted to see that the kids werent where they had been left oh hell groaned randolph it was early in the day for them to get lost but they werent very far his wife said sharply there they are and look what theyre doing they were at a refreshment stand and each one of them had a huge cone of frozen custard l told them not to make any purchases when we werent with them millicent cried but in fact it was worse than that the children were talking to a pair of strange grownups a lean fair elderly woman with a sharp stern face and a round darkskinned man with a bald head and immense tortoiseshell glasses as the baxters approached the woman turned to them apologetically oh hullo she said you must be the parents i do hope youll forgive us mr katsubishi and i seem to have lost our tour and your children kindly helped us look for it its all right dad simon put in swiftly theyre on this foreign tour see and everythings free for them anyway dad why cant we get on a tour and have everything free were americans his father explained smiling tentatively at the tall englishlooking woman and the tubby cheerful japanesehe decided that they didnt look like depraved child molesters you have to be an international tourist to get these unlimited tickets and i bet they cost quite a lot of money dont they he appealed to the man who smiled and shrugged and looked at the woman mr katsubishi doesnt speak english very well she apologized im rachel millay mrs millay that is although my dear husband left us some years ago she glanced about in humorous distress i dont suppose youve seen a tour leader carrying a green and violet flag with a cross of st andrew on it since randolph baxter had no idea what a cross of st andrew looked like it was hard to say in any case there were at least twenty tour parties in sight each with its own individual pennant or standard trudging in determined merriment toward the pavilions the rides or the refreshment stands im afraid not he began and then paused as his wife clutched his arm the pa system crackled and the winners of the first drawing were announced neither of the baxters was among them well there are six more drawings said millicent bravely not adding that there were also six more sets of raffle tickets to buy if they wanted any hope of winning one of them her husband smiled cheerfully at the children whats it to be he asked generously the life exhibit the concert we already voted dad cried emma his elder daughter its the animals no the stiffs yelled her baby sister the old autos cried simon anyway there wont be any stiffs there until later not to speak of baxter smiled indulgently at the foreigners children he explained well i do hope you find your group and he led the way to the first democratically selected adventure of the day the space exhibit baxter had always had a nostalgic fondness for space and this was a pretty fine exhibit harking back to the olden golden days when human beings could spare enough energy and resources to send their people and probes out toward the distant worlds even the kids liked it it was lavish with animated d displays showing a human being walking around on the surface of the moon and a spacecraft slipping through the rings of saturn and even a probe though not an american one hustling after halleys comet to take its picture but randolph baxter had some difficulty in concentrating on the pleasure of the display at first because as they were getting their tickets the tall smiling black man just ahead of him in line put his arm into the admissions cuff looked startled withdrew his arm started to speak and fell over on the ground his eyes open and staring it seemed right into randolph baxters when you have a wife and three kids and no job living on welfare never thinking about tomorrow because you know there isnt going to be anything in tomorrow worth thinking about a days outing for the whole family is an event to be treasured no matter what the priceespecially if the price isnt in money so the baxter family did it all they visited six national pavilions even the paraguayan they lunched grandly in the dining room at the summit of the fairs great central theme structure the cenotaph and they did the rides all the rides from the sloshaslide water chutes through the immense ferris wheel with the wind howling through the open car and simon threatening to spit down on the crowds below to the screaming shattering rollercoaster that made little louisa wet her pants fortunately her mother had brought clean underwear for the child when she sent the little girl off with her sister to change in the ladies room she followed them anxiously with her eyes until they were safely past the ticket collector and then said rand honey you paid for all those rides yourself he shrugged defensively i want everybody to have a good time now dont talk that way we agreed the children and i are going to pay our own way all the rest of the day and the subject is closed she proved the point by changing it look she said there are those two foreigners who lost their tour group again she waved and mrs millay and mr katsubishi came up diffidently if were not intruding said mrs millay we never did find our tour guide you see but actually were getting on quite well without but isnt it hot its never like this in scotland millicent fanned herself in agreement do sit down mrs millay is that where youre from scotland and you mr kat kats katsubishi he smiled with an abrupt deep bow then he wrinkled his face in concentration for a moment and managed to say i toosukottaland millicent tried not to look astonished but evidently did not succeed mrs millay explained hes from around kyle of lochalth you know since millicent obviously didnt know she added thats thejapanese colony in northern scotland near my own home in fact i teach english to japanese schoolchildren there since i know the languagemy parents were missionaries in honshu you see didnt you know about the colony actually millicent and randolph did know about the colony or at least they almost did in the way that human beings exposed to forty channels of television and with nothing much to do with their time have heard of without really knowing much about almost every concept phenomenon event and trend in human history in just that way they had heard of the united kingdoms pact with japan allowing large japanese immigration into an enclave in the north of scotland the japanese made the area bloom both agriculturally and economically the united kingdom got a useful injection of japanese capital and energy and the japanese got rid of some of their surplus population without pain i wish wed thought of that millicent observed in some envy but her husband shook his head different countries different ways he said patriotically and actually were doing rather well i mean just look at the lottery fair thats american ingenuity for you observing that mrs millay was whispering a rapid fire translation into mr katsubishis ear he was encouraged to go on other countries you see have their own way of handling their problems compulsory sterilization of all babies born in evennumbered years in india as im sure youre aware the contraceptive drugs they put in the water supply in mexicoand we wont even talk of what theyre doing in say bangladesh mrs millay shuddered sympathetically as she translated and the japanese beamed and bowed then spoke rapidly he says one can learn much mrs millay translated from what foreign countries can do even america millicent glancing at the expression on her husbands face said brightly well lets not let this day go to waste what shall we do next at once she got the same answers from the children old cars animals no whined baby louisa i wanna see the stiffs mr katsubishi whispered something in staccato japanese to mrs miilay who turned hesitantly to millieent baxter one doesnt wish to intrude she said but if you are in fact going to see the hall of life and death as your daughter suggests well we dont seem to be able to find the rest of our tour group you see and we would like to go there after all it is the theme center for the entire fair as you might say why of course said millicent warmly wed be real delighted to have the company of you and mr kats kats katsubishi he supplied bowing deeply and showing all his teeth in a smile and they all seven set off for the hall of life and death with little louisa delightedly leading the way the hall was a low white marble structure across the greensward from the cenotaph happy picnicking families on the green gay pavilions all around ice cream vendors chanting along the roadways and a circus parade horses and a giraffe and even an elephant winding along the main avenue with a band leading them diddleyboom diddleyboom diddleybang bang bangall noise and color and excitement but as soon as they were within the hall they were in another world the hall of life and death was the only free exhibit at the faireven the rest rooms were not free the crowds that moved through the hall were huge but they were also reverential as you came in you found yourself in a great domed entrance pavilion almost bare except for seventyfive raised platforms each spotlighted from a concealed source each surrounded by an air curtain of gentle drafts at the time the baxters came in more than sixty of them were already occupied with the silent lifeless forms of those who had passed on at the fair that day a sweetfaced child here an elderly woman there there side by side a young pair of newlyweds randolph baxter looked for and found the tall smiling black man who had died in the line before him he was smiling no longer but his face was in repose and almost joyous it seemed hes at peace now millicent whispered touching her husbands arm and he nodded he didnt want to speak out loud in this solemn hall where the whisper of organ music was barely audible above the gentle hiss of chilled air curtains that wafted past every deceased hardly anyone in the great crowd spoke the visitors lingered at each of the occupied biers but then as they moved toward the back of the chamber they didnt linger some didnt even look for every tourist at the fair could not help thinking as he passed an empty platform that before the fair closed that night it would be occupied by someone but the rotunda of those who have gone before was only the anteroom to the many inspiring displays the hall had to offer even the children were fascinated young simon stood entranced before the great timepiece of living and dying watching the hands revolve swiftly to show how many were born and how many died in each minute with the bottom line always showing a few more persons alive in every minute despite everything the government and the efforts of patriotic citizens could dobut he was more interested really in the mechanism of the thing than in the facts it displayed millicent baxter and mrs millay were really thrilled by the display of opulent caskets and cerements and randolph baxter was proud to point out to mr katsubishi the working model of a crematorium with all of its escaping gases trapped and converted into valuable organic feedstocks and the girls emma and louisa stood hand in hand for a long time shuddering happily as they gazed at the refrigerated display cases that showed a hideous fourmonth embryo next to the corpse of a fat pretty twoyearold emma moved to put her arm around her mother and whispered mommy im so grateful you didnt abort me and millicent baxter fought back a quick and tender tear id never let you die looking like that she assured her daughter and they clung together for a long moment but randolph baxter was becoming noticeably ill at ease when they finally left the hall of life and death his wife took him aside and asked in concern is something the matter hon he shrugged irritably at the foreigners who were talking together in fast lowtoned japanese just look at their faces he complained and indeed both mr katsubishi and mrs millays expressions seemed to show more revulsion than respect millicent followed her husbands eyes and sighed there was a little annoyance in the sigh too theyre not americans she reminded her husband i guess they just dont understand she smiled distantly at the foreign pair and then looked around at her offspring well children who wants to come with me to the washrooms so we can get ready for the big fireworks they all did even randolph but he felt a need stronger than the urging of his bladder he remained behind with the foreigners excuse me he said somewhat formally but may i ask what you thought of the exhibit she glanced at the japanese well it was most interesting she said vaguely one doesnt wish to criticize of course and she stopped there no no please go on randolph encouraged she said i must say it did seem odd to well glory death in that way randolph baxter smiled and tried to make it a forgiving smile though he could feel that he was upset he said perhaps you miss the point of the hall of life and death in fact of the whole lottery fair you see some of the greatest minds in america have worked on this problem of surplus populationthink tanks and government agencieswhy three universities helped design this fair every bit of it is scientifically planned to begin with its absolutely free mrs millay left off her rapidfire sotto vode japanese translation to ask you mean free as far as money is concerned yes exactly of course one takes a small chance at every ticket window and in that sense there is a price for everything a very carefully computed price mrs millay for every hotdog every show every ride to get into the fair in the first place for instance costs one decimillthats one percent of a point zero zero zero one probability of receiving a lethal injection from the ticket cuff now thats not much of a risk is it he smiled and of course its absolutely painless too as you can see by just looking at the ones who have given their lives inside mr katsubishi listening intently to mrs millays translation in his ear pursed his lips and nodded thought fully mrs millay said brightly well we all have our own little national traits dont we now really mrs millay said randolph baxter smiling with an effort please try to understand everything is quite fair some things are practically free like the park benches and the rest rooms and so on why you could use some of them as much as a million times before you know your number would come up or you can get a firstclass meal in the cenotaph for just about a whole millipoint but even that means you can do it a thousand times on the average mr katsubishi listened to the end of mrs millays translation and then struggled to get out a couple of english words notus he managed pointing to himself and mrs millay certainly not baxter agreed youre foreign tourists so you buy your tickets in your own countries for cash and of course you dont have to risk your lives it wouldnt help the american population problem much if you did would it he smiled and your tour money helps pay the cost of the fair but the important thing to remember is that the lottery fair is entirely voluntary no one has to come of course he admitted with a self deprecatory grin i have to admit that i really like the job lotteries i guess im just a gambler at heart and when youve spent as much time on welfare as mrs baxter and i have those big jobs are just hard to resist and theyre better here than at the regular city raffles mrs millay cleared her throat good manners competed with obstinacy in her expression really mr baxter she said mr katsubishi and i understand that heavens weve had to do things in our own countries we certainly dont mean to criticize yours whats hard to understand i suppose is actually that fetus she searched his face with her eyes looking for understanding it just seems strange i mean that youd prefer to see a child born and then perhaps die in a lottery than to abort him ahead of time mr baxter did his very best to maintain a pleasant expression but he knew he was failing its a difference in our national philosophies i guess he said see we dont go in for your socalled birth control here no abortion no contraception we accept the gift of life when it is given we believe that every human being from the moment of conception on has a right to a lifealthough he added not necessarily a long one he eyed the abashed foreigners sternly for a moment then relented well he said glancing at his watch i wonder where my family can be theyll miss the fireworks if they dont get back i bet mrs baxters gone and let the children pick out souvenirsthe little dickenses have been after us about them all day anyway mrs millay mr katsubishi its been a real pleasure meeting the two of you and having this chance to exchange views but he broke off suddenly alarmed by the expression on mr katsubishis face as the man looked past him whats the matter he demanded roughly and then he turned and did not need an answer the answer was written on the strained haggard tearstreaked face of his wife as she ran despairingly toward him carrying in her hands a plastic cap a paperweight and a heliumfilled balloon in the shape of a pigs head but without emma and without simon and even without little louisa
