from the crypts of memory clark ashton smith aeons of aeons ago in an epoch whose marvellous worlds have crumbled and whose mighty suns are less than shadow i dwelt in a star whose course decadent from the high irremeable heavens of the past was even then verging upon the abyss in which said astronomers its immemorial cycle should find a dark and disastrous close ah strange was that gulfforgotten starhow stranger than any dream of dreamers in the present or than any vision that hath risen upon visionaries in their retrospection of the universal past there thru inestimable cycles of a history whose records were beyond the computation of savants the dead had come to infinitely outnumber the living and reared of a stone not destructible save in the enormous furnace of suns their cities rose beside those of the living like titan metropoli whose mighty precincts have begun to overgloom the vicinal villages and over all was the black funereal vault of the cryptic heavens a dome of infinite shadows wherein the dismal sun suspended like a sole enormous lamp failed to illumine and drawing back its fires from the face of the irresolvable ether threw a baffled and despairing beam on the vague remote horizons and shrouded vistas interminate of the visionary land we were a sombre melancholy people who dwelt beneath the palls twilight and silence thrown about the towering tombs and monuments of the past in our veins was the chill of the ancient night of time with a premonition of the lentor of lethe over us like invisible vampires brooded the innumerous hours on their sable and unremoving pinions the very skies were fraught with oppression and we breathed beneath them as in a sepulcher forever sealed with all its stagnancies of corruption and of darkness vaguely we lived and loved as in dreamsthe dim and mystic dreams that hover upon the verge of unfathomable sleep we felt for our women with their pale and spectral beauty the same desire that the dead may feel for the phantom lilies of hadean meads our days were spent in roaming through the ruins of lone and immemorial cities or in the vast and shadowy fanes from whose awful and everlasting glooms of elder mystery the simulachres of centuryforgotten gods looked forth with unalterable eyes on the hopeless heavens and saw but night and oblivion or wandering through ashen fields of perennial autumn we found the flowers of wan funebrial immortelles that wept with a melancholy dew by the flowing silence of acherontic waters and one by one we died and were lost in the dust of accumulated time we knew the years as a passing of shadows and death itself as the yielding of twilight unto night
