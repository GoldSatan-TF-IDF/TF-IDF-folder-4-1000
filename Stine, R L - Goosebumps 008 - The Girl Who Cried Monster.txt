i love to scare my little brother randy i tell him scary stories about monsters until he begs me to stop and im always teasing him by pretending to see monsters everywhere i guess thats why no one believed me the day i saw a real monster i guess thats why no one believed me until it was too late and the monster was right in my own house but id better not tell the ending of my story at the beginning my name is lucy dark im twelve i live with my brother randy who is six and my parents in a mediumsized house in a mediumsized town called timberland falls i dont know why its called timberland falls there are a few forests outside of town but no one cuts the trees down for timber and there arent any falls so why timberland falls its a mystery we have a redbrick house at the end of our street theres a tall overgrown hedge that runs along the side of our house and separates our yard from the killeens yard next door dads always talking about how he should trim the hedge but he never does we have a small front yard and a pretty big back yard with a lot of tall old trees in it theres an old sassafras tree in the middle of the yard its cool and shady under the tree thats where i like to sit with randy when theres nothing better to do and see if i can scare the socks off of him it isnt very hard randy scares easy he looks a lot like me even though hes a boy hes got straight black hair just like me only i wear mine longer hes short for his age like me and just a little bit chubby he has a round face rounder than mine and big black eyes which really stand out since we both have such pale white skin mom says randy has longer eyelashes than mine which makes me kind of jealous but my nose is straighter and my teeth dont stick out as much when i smile so i guess i shouldnt complain anyway on a hot afternoon a couple of weeks ago randy and i were sitting under the old sassafras tree and i was getting ready to scare him to death i really didnt have anything better to do as soon as summer came around this year and school let out most of my really good friends went away for the summer i was stuck at home and so i was pretty lonely randy is usually a total pain but at least he is somebody to talk to and someone i can scare i have a really goad imagination i can dream up the most amazing monsters and i can make them sound really real mom says with my imagination maybe ill be a writer when i grow up i really dont know about that i do know that it doesnt take a whole lot of imagination to frighten randy usually all i have to do is tell him theres a monster trying on his clothes upstairs in his closet and randy turns even whiter than normal and starts shaking all over the poor kid i can even make his teeth chatter its unbelievable i leaned back against the smooth part of the tree trunk and rested my hands on the grass and closed my eyes i was dreaming up a good story to tell my brother the grass felt soft and moist against my bare feet i dug my toes into the dirt randy was wearing denim shorts and a plain white sleeveless tshirt he was lying on his side plucking up blades of grass with one hand did you ever hear about the timberland falls toebiter i asked him brushing a spider off my white tennis shorts huh he kept pulling up blades of grass one by one making a little pile there was this monster called the timberland falls toebiter i told randy aw please lucy he whined you said you wouldnt make up any more monster stories no im not i told him this story isnt made up its true he looked up at me and made a face yeah sure no really i insisted staring hard into his round black eyes so hed know i was sincere this is a true story it really happened here in timberland falls randy pulled himself up to a sitting position i think ill go inside and read comic books he said tossing down a handful of grass randy has a big comic book collection but theyre all disney comics and archie comics because the superhero comics are too scary for him the toebiter showed up one day right next door i told randy i knew once i started the story he wouldnt leave at the killeens he asked his eyes growing wide yeah he arrived in the middle of the afternoon the toebiter isnt a night monster you see hes a day monster he strikes when the sun is high in the sky just like now i pointed up through the shimmering tree leaves to the sun which was high overhead in a clear summerblue sky a dday monster randy asked he turned his head to look at the killeens house rising up on the other side of the hedge dont be scared it happened a couple of summers ago i continued becky and lilah were over there they were swimming you know in that plastic pool their mom inflates for them the one that half the water always spills out and a monster came randy asked a toebiter i told him keeping my expression very serious and lowering my voice nearly to a whisper a toebiter came crawling across their back yard whered he come from randy asked leaning forward i shrugged no one knows you see the thing about toebiters is theyre very hard to see when they crawl across grass because they make themselves the exact color of the grass you mean theyre green randy asked rubbing his pudgy nose i shook my head theyre only green when they creep and crawl over the grass i replied they change their color to match what theyre walking on so you cant see them well how big is it randy asked thoughtfully big i said bigger than a dog i watched an ant crawl up my leg then flicked if off no one really knows how big because this monster blends in so well so what happened randy asked sounding a little breathless i mean to becky and lilah again he glanced over at the killeens grayshingle house well they were in their little plastic pool i continued you know splashing around and i guess becky was lying on her back and had her feet hanging over the side of the pool and the monster scampered over the grass nearly invisible and it saw beckys toes dangling in the air and and becky didnt see the monster randy asked i could see he was starting to get real pale and trembly toebiters are just so hard to see i said keeping my eyes locked on randys keeping my face very straight and solemn i took a deep breath and let it out slowly just to build up suspense then i continued the story becky didnt notice anything at first then she felt a land of tickling feeling she thought it was the dog licking at her toes she kicked a little and told the dog to go away but then it didnt tickle so much it started to hurt becky shouted for the dog to stop but the hurting got even worse it felt like the dog was chewing on her toes with very sharp teeth it started to hurt a whole lot so becky sat up and pulled her feet into the pool and when she looked down at her left foot she saw it i stopped and waited for randy to ask whwhat he asked finally in a shaky voice what did she see i leaned forward and brought my mouth close to his ear all the toes were missing from her left foot i whispered no randy screamed he jumped to his feet he was as pale as a ghost and he looked really scared thats not true i shook my head solemnly i forced myself not to crack a smile ask becky to take off her left shoe i told him youll see no youre lying randy wailed ask her i said softly and then i glanced down at my feet and my eyes popped wide with horror rrrandy look i stammered and pointed with a trembling hand down to my feet randy uttered a deafening scream when he saw what i was pointing at all the toes on my left foot were missing waaaaiiiii randy let out another terrified wail then he took off running full speed to the house crying for mom i took off after him i didnt want to get in trouble for scaring him again randy wait wait im okay i shouted laughing of course i had my toes buried in the dirt he shouldve been able to figure that out but he was too scared to think straight wait i called after him i didnt get to show you the monster in the tree he heard that he stopped and turned around his face still all twisted up in fright huh theres a monster up in the tree i said pointing to the sassafras tree wed just been sitting under a tree monster i saw it no way he screamed and started running again to the house ill show it to you i called cupping my hands around my mouth so hed hear me he didnt look back i watched him stumble up the steps to the back stoop and disappear into the house the screen door slammed hard behind him i stood staring at the back of the house waiting for randy to poke his frightened head out again but he didnt i burst out laughing i mean the toebiter was one of my best creations and then digging my toes into the dirt and pretending the monster had gotten me too what a riot poor randy he was just too easy a victim and now he was probably in the kitchen squealing on me to mom that meant that real soon id be in for another lecture about how it wasnt nice to scare my little brother and fill him full of scary monster stories but what else was there to do i stood there staring at the house waiting for one of them to call me in suddenly a hand grabbed my shoulder hard from behind gotcha a voice growled oh i cried out and nearly jumped out of my skin a monster i spun around and stared at the laughing face of my friend aaron messer aaron giggled his highpitched giggle till he had tears in his eyes i shook my head frowning you didnt scare me i insisted oh sure he replied rolling his blue eyes thats why you screamed for help i didnt scream for help i protested i just cried out a little in surprise thats all aaron chuckled you thought it was a monster admit it a monster i said sneering why would i think that because thats all you think about he said smugly youre obsessed oooh big word i teased him aaron is my only friend who stuck around this rammer his parents are taking him somewhere out west in a few months but in the meantime hes stuck like me just hanging out trying to fill the time aaron is about a foot taller than me but who he has curly red hair and freckles all over his face hes very skinny and he wears long baggy shorts that make him look even skinnier i just saw randy run into the house why was he crying like that aaron asked glancing to the house i could see randy at the kitchen window staring out at us i think he saw a monster i told aaron huh not monsters again aaron cried he gave me a playful shove get out of here lucy theres one up in that tree i said seriously pointing aaron turned around to look youre so dumb he said grinning no really i insisted theres a real ugly monster i think its trapped up there in that tree lucy stop it aaron said thats what randy saw i continued thats what made him run screaming into the house you see monsters everywhere aaron said dont you ever get tired of it im not kidding this time i told him my chin trembled and my expression turned to outright fear as i gazed over aarons shoulder at the broad leafy sassafras tree ill prove it to you yeah sure aaron replied with his usual sarcasm really go get that broom i motioned to the broom leaning against the back of the house huh what for aaron asked go get the broom i insisted well see if we can get the monster down from the tree uh why do we want to do that aaron asked he sounded very hesitant i could see that he was starting to wonder if i was being serious or not so youll believe me i said seriously i dont believe in monsters aaron replied you know that lucy save your monster stories for randy hes just a kid will you believe me if one drops out of that tree i asked nothing is going to drop out of that tree except maybe some leaves aaron said go get the broom and well see i said okay fine he went trotting toward the house i grabbed the broom out of his hand when he brought it over come on i said leading the way to the tree i hope the monster hasnt climbed away aaron rolled his eyes i cant believe im going along with this lucy i must be really bored you wont be bored in a second i promised if the tree monster is still up there we stepped into the shade of the tree i moved close to the trunk and gazed up into its leafy green branches whoa stay right there i put my hand on aarons chest holding him back it could be dangerous give me a break he muttered under his breath ill try to shake the branch and bring it down i said let me get this straight aaron said you expect me to believe that youre going to take the broom shake a tree branch and a monster is going to come tumbling down from up there uhhuh i could see that the broom handle wasnt quite long enough to reach im going to have to climb up a little i told aaron just watch out okay ooh im shaking im soooo scared aaron cried making fun of me i shinned up the trunk and pulled myself onto the lowest limb it took me a while because i had the broom in one hand see any scary monsters up there aaron asked smugly its up there i called down fear creeping into my voice its trapped up there its very angry i think aaron snickered youre so dumb i pulled myself up to a kneeling position on the limb then i raised the broom in front of me i lifted it up to the next branch higher higher then holding on tightly to the trunk with my free hand i raised the broom as far as it would go and pushed it against the tree limb success i lowered my eyes immediately to watch aaron he let out a deafening shriek of horror as the monster toppled from the tree and landed right on his chest well actually it wasnt a monster that landed with a soft crackly thud on aarons chest it was a ratty old birds nest that some blue jays had built two springs ago but aaron wasnt expecting it so it gave him a really good scare gotcha i proclaimed after climbing down from the tree he scowled at me his face was a little purple which made his freckles look really weird you and your monsters he muttered thats exactly what my mom said about ten minutes later aaron had gone home and id come into the kitchen and pulled a box of juice out of the fridge sure enough mom appeared in the doorway her eyes hard and steely her expression grim i could see right away that she was ready to give her dont scare randy lecture i leaned back against the counter and pretended to listen the basic idea of the lecture was that my stories were doing permanent harm to my delicate little brother that i should be encouraging randy to be brave instead of making him terrified that monsters lurked in every corner but mom i saw a real monster under the hedge this morning i said i dont really know why i said that i guess i just wanted to interrupt the lecture mom got really exasperated she threw up her hands and sighed she has straight shiny black hair like randy and me and she has green eyes cat eyes and a small feline nose whenever mom starts in on me with one of her lectures i always pictureher at a cat about to pounce dont get me wrong shes very pretty and shes a good mom too im going to discuss this with your dad tonight she said your dad thinks this monster obsession is just a phase youre going through but im not so sure life is just a phase im going through i said softly i thought it was pretty clever but she just glared at me then she reminded me that if i didnt hurry id be late for my reading rangers meeting i glanced at the clock she was right my appointment was for four oclock reading rangers is a summer reading program at the town library that mom and dad made me enroll in they said they didnt want me to waste the whole summer and if i joined this thing at the library at least id read some good books the way reading rangers works is i have to go see mr mortman the librarian once a week and i have to give a short report and answer some questions about the book i read that week i get a gold star for every book i report on if i get six gold stars i get a prize i think the prize is a book big deal right but its just a way to make you read i thought id read some of the scary mystery novels that all my friends are reading but no way mr mortman insists on everyone reading classics he means old books im going to skate over i told my mom and hurried to my room to get my rollerblades youd better fly over my mom called up to me hey she added a few seconds later it looks like rain she was always giving me weather reports i passed by randys room he was in there in the dark no lights the shades pulled playing super nintendo as usual by the time i got my rollerblades laced and tied i had only five minutes to get to the library luckily it was only six or seven blocks away i was in big trouble anyway i had managed to read only four chapters of huckleberry finn my book for the week that meant i was going to have to fake it with mr mortman i picked the book up from my shelf it was a new paperback i wrinkled up some of the pages near the back to make it look as if id read that far i tucked it into my backpack along with a pair of sneakers then i made my way down the stairs not easy in rollerblades and headed to the timberland falls town library the library was in a ramshackle old house on the edge of the timberland woods the house had belonged to some eccentric old hermit and when he died he had no family so he donated the house to the town they turned it into a library some kids said the house had been haunted but kids say that about every creepy old house the library did look like a perfect haunted house though it was three stories tall dark shingled with a dark pointy roof between two stone turrets the house was set back in the trees as if hiding there it was always in the shade always dark and cold inside the old floorboards creaked beneath the thin carpet the town had put down the high windows let in very little light and the old wooden bookcases reached nearly to the ceiling when i edged my way through the narrow aisles between the tall dark shelves i always felt as if they were about to close in on me i had this frightening feeling that the shelves would lean in on me cover me up and id be buried there in the darkness forever buried under a thousand pounds of dusty mildewy old books but of course thats silly it was just a very old house very dark and damp very creaky not as clean as a library should be lots of cobwebs and dust mr mortman did his best i guess but he was kind of creepy too the thing all of us kids hated the most about him was that his hands always seemed to be wet he would smile at you with those beady little black eyes of his lighting up on his plump bald head he would reach out and shake your hand and his hand was always sopping when he turned the pages of books hed leave wet fingerprints on the corners his desktop always had small puddles on the top moist handprints on the leather desk protector he was short and round with that shiny bald head and those tiny black eyes he looked a lot like a mole a wetpawed mole he spoke in a high scratchy voice nearly always whispered he wasnt a bad guy really he seemed to like kids he wasnt mean or anything and he really liked books he was just weird thats all he sat on a tall wooden stool that made him hover over his enormous desk he kept a deep aluminum pan on the side of his desk inside the pan were several little turtles moving around in about an inch of water my timid friends i heard him call them once sometimes hed pick up one of them and hold it in his pudgy fingers high in the air until it tucked itself into its shell then hed gently set it down a pleased smile on his pale flabby face he sure loved his turtles i guess they were okay as pets but they were kind of smelly i always tried to sit on the other side of the desk as far away from the turtle pan as i could get well i skated to the library as fast as i could i was only a few minutes late when i skated into the cool shade of the library driveway the sky was clouding over i sat down on the stone steps and pulled off the rollerblades then i quickly slid into my sneakers and carrying my rollerblades i walked through the front door making my way through the stacks the tall narrow shelves at the back of the main reading room i dropped the skates against the wall then i walked quickly through the aisles to mr mortmans desk against the back wall he heard my footsteps and immediately glanced up from the pile of books he was stamping with a big rubber stamp the ceiling light made his bald head shine like a lamp he smiled hi lucy he said in his squeaky voice be right with you i said hi and sat down in the folding chair in front of his desk i watched him stamp the books he was wearing a gray turtleneck sweater which made him look a lot like his pet turtles finally after glancing at the big loudly ticking clock on the wall he turned to me and what did you read for reading rangers this week lucy he leaned over the desk toward me i could see wet fingerprints on the dark desktop uh huckleberry finn i pulled the book from my backpack and dropped it into my lap yes yes a wonderful book mr mortman said glancing at the paperback in my lap dont you agree yes i said quickly i really enjoyed it i couldnt put it down that was sort of true i never picked it up so how could i put it down what did you like best about huckleberry finn mr mortman asked smiling at me expectantly uh the description i told him i had my reading rangers gold star in my tshirt pocket and i had a new book in my backpack frankenstein by mary shelley maybe ill read frankenstein out loud to randy i thought evilly that would probably make his teeth chatter forever the late afternoon sun was hidden behind spreading rain clouds i had walked nearly all the way home when i realized i had forgotten my rollerblades so i turned around and went back i wasnt sure how late the library stayed open mr mortman had seemed to be entirely alone in there i hoped he hadnt decided to close up shop early i really didnt want to leave my new rollerblades in there overnight i stopped and stared up at the old library deep in the shade it seemed to stare back at me its dark windows like black unblinking eyes i climbed the stone steps then hesitated with my hand on the door i had a sudden chill was it just from stepping into the deep shade no it was something else i had a funny feeling a bad feeling i get those sometimes a signal a moment of unease like something bad is about to happen shaking it off i pushed open the creaking old door and stepped into the musty darkness of the library shadows danced across the wall as i made my way to the main room a tree branch tapped noisily against the dustcovered pane of a high window the library was silent except for the creaking floorboards beneath my sneakers as i entered the main room i could hear the steady tickticktick of the wall clock the lights had all been turned off i thought i felt something scamper across my shoe a mouse i stopped short and glanced down just a dustball clinging to the base of a bookshelf whoa lucy i scolded myself its just a dusty old library nothing to get weird about dont let your wild imagination take off and lead you into trouble trouble i still had that strange feeling a gentle but insistent gnawing at my stomach a tug at my chest something isnt right something bad is about to happen people call them premonitions its a good vocabulary word for what i was feeling right then i found my rollerblades where i had left them against the wall back in the stacks i grabbed them up eager to get out of that dark creepy place i headed quickly back toward the entrance tiptoeing for some reason but a sound made me stop i held my breath and listened it was just a cough peering down the narrow aisle i could see mr mortman hovered over his desk well actually i could just see part of him one arm and some of his face when he leaned to the left i was still holding my breath the clock ticktickticked noisily from across the room behind his desk mr mortmans face moved in and out of bluepurple shadows the rollerblades suddenly felt heavy i lowered them silently to the floor then my curiosity got the better of me and i took a few steps toward the front mr mortman began humming to himself i didnt recognize the song the shadows grew deeper as i approached peering down the dark aisle i saw him holding a large glass jar between his pudgy hands i was close enough to see that he had a pleasant smile on his face keeping in the shadows i moved closer i like spying on people its kind of thrilling even when they dont do anything very interesting just knowing that youre watching them and they dont know theyre being watched is exciting humming to himself mr mortman held the jar in front of his chest and started to unscrew the top some juicy flies my timid friends he announced in his highpitched voice so the jar was filled with flies suddenly the room grew much darker as clouds rolled over the late afternoon sun the light from the window dimmed gray shadows rolled over mr mortman and his enormous desk as if blanketing him in darkness from my hidden perch among the shelves i watched him prepare to feed his turtles but wait something was wrong my premonition was coming true something weird was happening as he struggled to unscrew the jar lid mr mortmans face began to change his head floated up from his turtleneck and started to expand like a balloon being inflated i uttered a silent gasp as i saw his tiny eyes poke out of his head the eyes bulged bigger and bigger until they were as big as doorknobs the light from the window grew even dimmer the entire room was cast in heavy shadows the shadows swung and shifted i couldnt see well at all it was like i was watching everything through a dark fog mr mortman continued to hum even as his head bobbed and throbbed above his shoulders and his eyes bulged out as if on stems poking straight up like insect antennae and then his mouth began to twist and grow it opened wide like a gaping black hole on the enormous bobbing head mr mortman sang louder now an eerie frightening sound more like animal howling than singing he pulled off the lid of the jar and let it fall to the desk it clanged loudly as it hit the desktop i leaned forward struggling to see squinting hard i saw mr mortman dip his fat hand into the jar i could hear loud buzzing from the jar he pulled out a handful of flies i could see his eyes bulge even wider i could see the gaping black hole that was his mouth he held his hand briefly over the turtle cage i could see the flies black dots all over his hand in his palm on his short stubby fingers i thought he was going to lower his hand to the aluminum pun i thought he was going to feed the turtles but instead he jammed the flies into his own mouth i shut my eyes and held my hand over my mouth to keep from puking or screaming i held my breath but my heart kept racing the shadows lurched and jumped the darkness seemed to float around me i opened my eyes he was eating another handful of flies shoving them into his gaping mouth with his fingers swallowing them whole i wanted to shout i wanted to run mr mortman i realized was a monster the shadows seemed to pull away the sky outside the window brightened and a gray triangle of light fell over mr mortmans desk opening my eyes i realized id been holding my breath my chest felt as if it were about to burst i let the air out slowly and took another deep breath then without glancing again to the front of the room i turned and ran my sneakers thudded over the creaky floors but i didnt care i had to get out of there as fast as i could i bolted out the front door of the library onto the stone steps then down the gravel driveway i ran as fast as i could my arms flying wildly at my sides my black hair blowing behind me i didnt stop until i was a block away then i dropped to the curb and waited for my heart to stop pounding like a bass drum heavy rain clouds rolled over the sun again the sky became an eerie yellowblack a station wagon rolled past some kids in the back of it called to me but i didnt raise my head i kept seeing the shadowy scene in the library again and again mr mortman is a monster the words repeated nonstop in my mind it cant be i thought gazing up at the black clouds so low overhead i was seeing things that had to be it all the shadows in the dark library all the swirling darkness it was an optical illusion it was my wild imagination it was a daydream a silly fantasy no a loud voice in my head cried no lucy you saw mr mortmans head bulge you saw his eyes pop out and grow like hideous toadstools on his ballooning face you saw him reach into the fly jar you heard him humming so happily so hungrily you saw him jam the flies into his mouth not one handful but two and maybe hes still in there eating his fill it was dark lucy there were shadows but you saw what you saw you saw it all mr mortman is a monster i climbed to my feet i felt a cold drop of rain on top of my head mr mortman is a monster i said it out loud i knew i had to tell mom and dad as fast as i could the librarian is a monster thats what id tell them of course theyll be shocked who wouldnt be feeling another raindrop on my head then one on my shoulder i started jogging for home i had gone about half a block when i stopped the stupid rollerblades i had left them in the library again i turned back a gust of wind blew my hair over my face i pushed it back with both hands i was thinking hard trying to figure out what to do rain pattered softly on the pavement of the street the cold raindrops felt good on my hot forehead i decided to go back to the library and get my skates this time id make a lot of noise make sure mr mortman knew someone was there if he heard me coming i decided hed act normal he wouldnt eat flies in front of me he wouldnt let his eyes bulge and his head grow like that would he i stopped as the library came back into view i hesitated staring through the drizzling rain at the old building maybe i should wait and come back tomorrow with my dad wouldnt that be smarter no i decided i wanted my skates and i was going to get them ive always been pretty brave the time a bat flew into our house i was the one who yelled and screamed at it and chased it out with a butterfly net im not afraid of bats or snakes or bugs or monsters i said out loud as i walked up to the front of the library rain pattering softly all around me i kept telling myself to make a lot of noise make sure mr mortman knows youre there lucy call out to him tell him you came back because you left your skates he wont let you see that hes a monster if he knows youre there he wont hurt you or anything if you give him some warning i kept reassuring myself all the way up to the dark old building i climbed the stone steps hesitantly then taking a deep breath i grabbed the doorknob and started to go in i turned the knob and pushed but the door refused to open i tried again it took me a while to realize that it was locked the library was closed the rain pattered softly on the grass as i walked around to the front window it was high off the ground i had to pull myself up on the window ledge to look inside darkness total darkness i felt relieved and disappointed at the same time i wanted my skates but i didnt really want to go back in there ill get them tomorrow i said out loud i lowered myself to the ground the rain was starting to come down harder and the wind was picking up blowing the rain in sheets i started to run my sneakers squishing over the wet grass i ran all the way home i was totally drenched by the time i made my way through the front door my hair was matted down on my head my tshirt was soaked through mom dad are you home i cried i ran through the hallway nearly slipping on the smooth floor and burst into the kitchen a monster i cried huh randy was seated at the kitchen table snapping a big pile of string beans for mom he was the only one who looked up mom and dad were standing at the counter rolling little meatballs in their hands they didnt even turn around a monster i screamed again where randy cried did you get caught in the rain mom asked dont you say hi dad asked do you just explode into a room yelling dont i get a hi dad or anything hi dad i cried breathlessly theres a monster in the library lucy please mom started impatiently what kind of monster randy asked he had stopped snapping the ends off the beans and was staring hard at me mom finally turned around youre soaked she cried youre dripping all over the floor get upstairs and change into dry clothes dad turned too a frown on his face your mother just washed the floor he muttered im trying to tell you something i shouted raising my fists in the air no need to scream mom scolded get changed then tell us but mr mortman is a monster i cried cant you save the monster stuff till later i just got home and ive got the worst headache dad complained his eyes stared down at the kitchen floor small puddles were forming around me on the white linoleum im serious i insisted mr mortman hes really a monster randy laughed hes funnylooking randy its not nice to make fun of peoples looks mom said crossly she turned back to me see what youre teaching your little brother cant you set a good example but mom lucy please get into dry clothes dad pleaded then come down and set the table okay i was so frustrated i tilted my head back and let out an angry growl doesnt anyone here believe me i cried this really isnt the time for your monster stories mom said turning back to her meatballs larry youre making them too big she scolded my father theyre supposed to be small and delicate but i like big meatballs dad insisted no one was paying any attention to me i turned and stomped angrily out of the kitchen is mr mortman really a monster randy called after me i dont know and i dont care about anything i screamed back i was just so angry and upset they didnt have to ignore me like that all they cared about was their stupid meatballs up in my room i pulled off my wet clothes and tossed them on the floor i changed into jeans and a tank top is mr mortman really a monster randys question repeated in my head did i imagine the whole thing do i just have monsters on the brain it had been so dark and shadowy in the library with all the lights turned off maybe mr mortman didnt eat the flies maybe he pulled them out of the jar and fed them to his pet turtles maybe i imagined that he ate them maybe his head didnt swell up like a balloon maybe his eyes didnt pop out maybe that was just a trick of the darkness the dancing shadows the dim gray light maybe i need glasses maybe im crazy and weird lucy hurry down and set the table my dad called up the stairs okay coming as i made my way downstairs i felt all mixed up i didnt mention mr mortman at dinner actually mom brought him up what book did you choose to read this week she asked frankenstein i told her dad groaned more monsters he cried shaking his head dont you ever get enough monsters you see them wherever you go do you have to read about monsters too dad has a big booming voice everything about my dad is big he looks very tough with a broad chest and powerfullooking arms when he shouts the whole house shakes randy you did a great job with the string beans mom said quickly changing the subject after dinner i helped dad with the dishes then i went upstairs to my room to start reading frankenstein id seen the old movie of frankenstein on tv so i knew what it was about it was about a scientist who builds a monster and the monster comes to life it sounded like my kind of story i wondered if it was true to my surprise i found randy in my room sitting on my bed waiting for me what do you want i asked i really dont like him messing around in my room tell me about mr mortman he said i could tell by his face that he was scared and excited at the same time i sat down on the edge of the bed i realized i was eager to tell someone about what had happened in the library so i told randy the whole story starting with how i had to go back there because id left my rollerblades randy was squeezing my pillow against his chest and breathing really hard the story got him pretty scared i guess i was just finishing the part where mr mortman stuffed a handful of flies into his mouth randy gasped he looked sick lucy my dad burst angrily into the room what is your problem nothing dad i how many times do we have to tell you not to frighten randy with your silly monster stories silly i shrieked but dad this one is true he made a disgusted face and stood there glaring at me i expected fire to come shooting out of his nostrils at any minute i im not scared really randy protested coming to my defense but my poor brother was as white as the pillow he was holding and trembling all over this is your last warning dad said i mean it lucy im really angry he disappeared back downstairs i stared at the doorway where hed been standing im really angry too i thought im really angry that no one in this family believes me when im being serious i knew at that moment that i had no choice i had to prove that i wasnt a liar i had to prove that i wasnt crazy i had to prove to mom and dad that mr mortman was a monster whats that i asked aaron it was a week later i had to pass his house to get to the library for my reading rangers meeting i stopped when i saw aaron in the front yard he was tossing a blue disc then catching it when it snapped back at him its a sort of a frisbee on a long rubber band he said he tossed the disc and it snapped back fast he missed it and it flew behind him then snapped back again and hit him in the back of the head thats not how its supposed to work exactly he said blushing he started to untangle a knot in the thick rubber band can i play with you i asked he shook his head no its for one person see its a oneperson frisbee i asked yeah havent you seen the commercials on tv you play it by yourself you throw it and then you catch it but what if someone wants to play with you i demanded you cant aaron answered it doesnt work that way i thought it was pretty dumb but aaron seemed to be having a good time so i said goodbye and continued on to the library it was a beautiful sunny day everything seemed bright and cheerful golden and summer green the library as usual was bathed in blue shadows id only been back once since that day once very quickly to get my rollerblades i stopped at the curb staring up at it i felt a sudden chill the whole world seemed to grow darker here darker and colder just my imagination well see i thought well see today whats real and what isnt i pulled my backpack off my shoulders and swinging it by the straps made my way to the front door taking a deep breath i pushed open the door and stepped inside perched over his desk in the main reading room mr mortman was just finishing with another reading rangers member it was a girl i knew from school ellen borders i watched from the end of a long row of books mr mortman was saying goodbye he handed her a gold star then he shook ellens hand and i could see her try not to make a disgusted face his hand was probably sopping wet as usual she said something and they both laughed very jolly ellen said goodbye and headed toward the doorway i stepped out to greet her what book did you get i asked after we had said our hellos she held it up for me its called white fang she said its about a monster i guessed she laughed no lucy its about a dog i thought i saw mr mortmans head lift up when i said the word monster but i mightve imagined that i chatted a short while longer with ellen who was three books ahead of me this summer she had only one more to read to get her prize what a showoff i heard the front door close behind her as i took my seat next to mr mortmans desk and pulled frankenstein from my bookbag did you enjoy it mr mortman asked he had been studying his turtles but he turned to face me a friendly smile on his face he was wearing another turtleneck a bright yellow one this time i noticed that he wore a big purple ring on one of his pudgy pink fingers he twirled the ring as he smiled at me it was kind of hard i said but i bleed it i had read more than half of this one i would have finished it if it didnt have such tiny type did you enjoy the description in this book too mr mortman asked leaning closer to me over the desk my eye caught the big jar of flies on the shelf behind him it was very full well yeah i said i kind of expected more action what was your favorite part of the book mr mortman asked the monster i answered instantly i watched his face to see if he reacted to that word but he didnt even blink his tiny black eyes remained locked on mine the monster was really great i said i decided to test him wouldnt it be neat if there were real monsters mr mortman again he didnt blink most people wouldnt be too happy about that he said quietly twirling his purple ring most people like to get their scares in books or in movies they dont want their scares to be in real life he chuckled i forced myself to chuckle too i took a deep breath and continued my little test i was trying to get him to make a slip to reveal that he wasnt really human do you believe that real monsters exist i asked not very subtle i admit it but he didnt seem to notice do i believe that a scientist such as dr frankenstein could build a living monster mr mortman asked he shook his round bald head we can build robots but not living creatures that wasnt what i meant some other people came into the library a little girl with her whitehaired grandmother the little girl went skipping to the childrens book section the grandmother picked up a newspaper and carried it to an armchair across the room i was very unhappy to see them i knew that the librarian wouldnt change into a monster while they were here i was sure he only ate flies when the library was empty i was going to have to hide somewhere and wait for them to leave mr mortman reached into his desk drawer pulled out a gold star and handed it to me i thought he was going to shake my hand but he didnt have you read anne of green gables he asked picking up a book from the pile on his desk no i said does it have monsters in it he threw back his head and laughed his chins quivering i thought i caught a flash of recognition in his eyes a question a tiny moment of hesitation i thought my question brought something strange to his eyes but of course again it could have been my imagination i dont think youll find any monsters in this one he said still chuckling he stamped it with his rubber stamp and handed it to me the cover was moist from where his fingers had been i made an appointment for the same time next week then i walked out of the main reading room and pretended to leave the library i pulled open the front door and let it slam but i didnt go out instead i crept back keeping in the shadows i stopped at the back wall hidden by a long row of bookshelves where to hide i had to find a safe hiding place safe from mr mortmans beady eyes and safe from anyone else who might enter the library what was my plan well id been thinking about it all week but i really didnt have much of a plan i just wanted to catch him in the act thats all i wanted to see clearly i wanted to erase all doubts from my mind my plan was to hide until the library was empty to spy on mr mortman to watch him change into a monster and eat flies again then id know i wasnt crazy then id know my eyes hadnt been playing tricks on me on the other side of the room i could hear the little girls grandmother calling to mr mortman do you have any spelling books samantha only likes picture books but i want her to learn to spell grandma whisper samantha called harshly this is a library remember whisper my eyes searched the long dark shelves for a hiding place and there it was a low bookshelf along the floor near the back was empty it formed a narrow cave that i could crawl into trying to be as silent as i could i got down on my knees sat down on the shelf turned slid my body back and tucked myself in it wasnt really large enough to stretch out i had to keep my legs folded my head was pressed hard against the upright board not very comfortable i knew i couldnt stay like this forever but it was late afternoon maybe samantha and her grandmother would leave soon maybe i wouldnt have to stay tucked on the shelf like a moldy old book for very long my heart was pounding i could hear mr mortman talking softly to samantha i could hear the rustle of the old ladys newspaper i could hear the tickticktick of the big wall clock on the front wall i could hear every sound every creak and groan i suddenly had to sneeze my nose tickled like crazy there was so much dust down here i reached up and squeezed my nose hard between my thumb and forefinger somehow i managed to shut off the sneeze my heart was pounding even harder i could hear it over the tickticktick of the clock please leave i thought wishing samantha and her grandmother out of there please leave please leave please leave i dont know how long i can stay tucked on this dusty shelf my neck was already starting to hurt from being pressed against the shelf and i felt another sneeze coming on this book is too hard i need an easier one samantha was saying to mr mortman i heard mr mortman mutter something i heard shuffling feet footsteps were they coming this way were they going to see me no they turned and headed back to the childrens section on the side ive already read this one i heard samantha complain please leave please leave please leave it must have been only a few minutes later when samantha and her grandmother left but it seemed like hours to me my neck was stiff my back ached my legs were tingling both asleep i heard the front door close behind them the library was empty now except for mr mortman and me i waited and listened i heard the scrape of his tall stool against the floor then i heard his footsteps he coughed it suddenly grew darker he was turning off the lights its show time i thought hes closing up nows the time nows the time hell turn into a monster before my eyes i rolled silently off the shelf onto the floor then i pulled myself to a standing position holding onto a higher shelf i raised one leg then the other trying to get the circulation back as the overhead lights went out most of the library was blanketed in darkness the only light came from the late afternoon sunlight flooding through the window at the front of the room where was mr mortman i heard him cough again then he began to hum to himself he was closing up holding my breath i tiptoed closer to his desk i leaned my side against the shelves as i moved keeping in the shadows whoa i suddenly realized mr mortman wasnt at his desk i heard his footsteps behind me at the back of the main reading room then i heard his shoes thud across the floor of the front entryway i froze in place listening hard still holding my breath was he leaving no i heard a loud click the sound of a lock being turned he had locked the front door i hadnt planned on that no way that was definitely not part of my plan frozen in the dark aisle i realized that i was locked in with him now what maybe my plan wasnt exactly the best plan in the world maybe the whole idea was stupid you can bet i had plenty of doubts racing through my mind as i heard mr mortman return to the main reading room my plan of course was to prove to myself that i was right that he was a monster and then to run out of the library the plan wasnt to be locked in that dark creepy building with him unable to escape but here i was so far i was okay he had no idea that anyone else was here with him no idea that he was being spied on pressed against the tall shelves i crept along the narrow aisle until i was as close as i dared to go i could see his entire desk caught in a deep orange rectangle of light from the high window mr mortman stepped behind his desk humming softly to himself he straightened a stack of books then shoved it to a corner of the desk he pulled open his desk drawer and shuffled things around searching for something in there i crept a little closer i could see very clearly now the afternoon sunlight made everything orangeyred mr mortman tugged at the neck of his turtleneck he rolled some pencils off the desktop into the open desk drawer then he shut the drawer this is boring i thought this is very boring and normal i must have been wrong last week i must have imagined the whole thing mr mortman is just a funny little man he isnt a monster at all i sank against the tall shelf disappointed id wasted all this time hiding on that filthy shelf for nothing and now here i was locked in the library after closing time watching the librarian clean off his desk what a thrill ive got to get out of here i thought ive been really stupid but then i saw mr mortman reach for the fly jar on the shelf behind him i swallowed hard my heart gave a sudden lurch a smile crossed mr mortmans pudgy face as he set the big glass jar down in front of him then he reached across the desk and with both hands pulled the rectangular turtle pan closer dinnertime my timid friends he said in his high scratchy voice he grinned down at the turtles he reached into the pan and splashed the water a bit dinnertime friends he repeated and then as i stared without blinking stared with my jaw dropping lower and lower in disbelief his face began to change again his round head began to swell up his black eyes bulged his mouth grew until it became an open black pit the enormous head bobbed above the yellow turtleneck the eyes swam in front of the head the mouth twisted opening and closing like an enormous fish mouth i was right i realized mr mortman is a monster i knew i was right but no one would believe me theyll have to believe me now i told myself im seeing this so clearly its all so bright in the redorange light im seeing it im not imagining it theyll have to believe me now and as i gaped openmouthed at the gross creature the librarian had become he reached into the fly jar removed a handful of flies and shoved them hungrily into his mouth dinnertime he rasped talking as he chewed i could hear the buzz of the flies inside the jar they were alive the flies were alive and he was gobbling them up as if they were candy i raised my hands and pressed them against the sides of my face as i stared dinnertime another handful of flies some of them had escaped they buzzed loudly around his swollen bobbing head as he chewed and swallowed mr mortman grabbed at the flies in the air his tiny hands surprisingly quick he pulled flies out of the air one another another and popped them into his enormous gorge of a mouth mr mortmans eyes swam out in front of his face for a short terrifying moment the eyes stopped they were staring right at me i realized i had leaned too far into the aisle had he spotted me i jumped back with a gasp of panic the bulging black eyes like undulating toadstools remained in place for another second or two then they continued rolling and swimming about after a third handful of flies mr mortman closed the jar licking his black lips with a snakelike pencilthin tongue the buzzing stopped the room was silent again except for the ticking clock and my thundering heartbeats now what i thought is that it no dinnertime my timid friends the librarian said in a thin trembling voice the voice seeming to bob along with the enormous head he reached a hand into the pan and picked up one of the little greenshelled turtles i could see the turtles legs racing is he going to feed some flies to the turtles now i wondered mr mortman held the turtle higher studying it with his bulging rolling eyes he held it up to the sunlight the turtles legs continued to move then he popped the turtle into his mouth i heard the crack of the shell as mr mortman bit down he chewed noisily several times making a loud crunch with each chew then i saw him swallow once twice till he got it down id seen enough more than enough i turned away i began to make my way blindly back through the dark aisle i jogged quickly i didnt really care if he heard me or not i just had to get out of there out into the sunlight and fresh air away from the crunching sound that kept repeating in my ears the crunch of the turtle shell as mr mortman chewed it and chewed it chewed it alive i ran from the main reading room my heart thudding my legs feeling heavy as stone i was gasping for breath when i reached the front entry i ran to the door and grabbed the handle and then remembered the door was locked i couldnt get out i was locked in and then as i stood staring straight ahead at the closed door my hand gripping the brass knob i heard footsteps behind me rapid footsteps mr mortman had heard me i was trapped i froze in panic staring at the door until it became a dark blur in front of me mr mortmans footsteps grew louder behind me help i uttered a silent plea somebody kelp me the librarian would burst into the front entryway any second and there id be trapped at the door trapped like a rat or like a turtle and then what would he grab me up like one of his pets would he crunch me between his teeth there had to be a way out of there there had to be and then staring at the blur of the door it suddenly came clear to me it all came back in focus and i realized that maybe just maybe i wasnt trapped at all mr mortman had locked the door from the inside the inside that meant that maybe i could unlock it and open the door if the door locked with a key then i was stuck but if it was just an ordinary lock that you turned hey is someone out there mr mortmans raspy voice burst into my thoughts my eyes frantically searched the door i found the lock under the brass knob i reached for it please turn please turn please turn the lock turned in my hand with a soft click the prettiest sound i ever heard in a second i had pulled open the door in another second i was out on the stone steps then i was running as fast as i could running across the front lawn cutting through some shrubs diving through a hedge running for my life gasping for air i turned halfway down the block i could see mr mortman a shadowy figure in the library door he was standing in the doorway staring out not moving just standing there had he seen me did he know it was me spying on him i didnt want to know i just wanted to get away the late afternoon sun was ducking behind the trees making the shadows loner and dark i lowered my head and ran into the long blue shadows my sneakers thudding hard against the sidewalk i was out i was okay i had seen the monster but he hadnt seen me i hoped i ran until i got to aarons house he was still in the front yard he was sitting on the stump of an old tree his parents had removed i could see the blue frisbeetype thing in his lap he was struggling to untangle the long rubber band aaron had his head down concentrating on undoing the knots and didnt see me at first aaron mr mortman is a monster i cried breathlessly huh he looked up startled mr mortman hes a monster i repeated panting like a dog i put my hands on my knees and leaned forward trying to catch my breath lucy whats your problem aaron muttered returning his attention to the rubber band listen to me i screamed impatiently i didnt sound like myself i didnt recognize my shrill panicky voice this thing stinks aaron muttered its totally tangled aaron please i pleaded i was in the library i saw him he changed into a monster he ate one of his turtles aaron laughed yum he said did you bring me one aaron it isnt funny i cried still out of breath i i was so scared hes a monster he really is i thought i was locked in with him i thought tell you what aaron said still picking at the knots in the rubber band he held the blue plastic disc up to me if you can untangle this big knot ill let you play with it aaaaaagh i let out an angry scream why dont you listen to me lucy give me a break aaron said still holding the disc up to me i dont want to talk about monsters now its kind of babyish you know but aaron why dont you save that stuff for randy aaron suggested he waved the blue disc do you want to help me with this or not not i screamed then i added youre a lousy friend he looked a little surprised i didnt wait for him to say anything else i took off again heading for home i was really angry what was his problem anyway youre supposed to take a friend seriously youre not supposed to think automatically that your friend is just making up a story couldnt aaron see how frightened and upset i was couldnt he see that it wasnt a joke hes a total jerk i decided as my house finally came into view im never speaking to him again i ran up the driveway pulled open the screen door and burst into the house mom dad my heart was pounding so hard my mouth was so dry my cry was a hoarse whisper mom where are you i ran through the house until i found randy in the den he was lying on the floor his face two niches in front of the tv watching a bugs bunny cartoon where are mom and dad i cried breathlessly he ignored me just stared at his cartoon the colors from the tv danced over his face randy where are they i repeated frantically grocery shopping he muttered without turning around but i have to talk to them i said when did they leave when will they be back he shrugged without removing his eyes from the screen i dont know but randy leave me alone he whined im watching a cartoon but i saw a monster i screamed a real one his eyes went wide his mouth dropped open a real monster he stammered yes i cried did he follow you home randy asked turning pale i hope not i exclaimed i wheeled around and ran out of the den i glanced out the living room window as i hurried past no sign of my parents car so i ran up to my room i was so upset so angry and upset i took two steps into my room then stopped there in my bed under the covers lay a big hairy monster its gnarled brown head on my pillow its gaping toothless mouth twisted in an evil grin i grabbed the top of my dresser and uttered a loud gasp of shock the monster stared at me one round eye bigger than the other it didnt move off my pillow it uttered a highpitched giggle i mean i thought it giggled it took me a short while to realize that the giggling was coming from behind me i spun around to see randy just outside the door when he saw the terrified look on my face his giggle became a roar of laughter like it he asked stepping past me into the room and walking up to my bed i made it in art class huh randy picked up the lumpy brown monster head as soon as he picked it up i saw that the hair was brown yarn that the face was painted on its papiermвchй randy announced proudly neat huh i let out a long sigh and slumped onto the edge of the bed yeah neat i muttered unhappily i put the pillows under your covers to make it look like he had a body randy continued grinning his grin looked a lot like the grin on the monster head very clever i said bitterly listen randy i just had a really scary thing happen and im really not in the mood for jokes his grin grew wider he tossed the brown monster head at me i caught it and held it in my lap he motioned for me to toss it back but i didnt didnt you hear me i cried im very upset i saw a monster a real one in the library youre just embarrassed because my monster head fooled you randy said youre mad because i really scared you mr mortman is a monster i told him bouncing the monster head in my lap i saw him change into a monster his head grew big and his eyes popped out and his mouth twisted open stop it randy cried starting to look scared i saw him eat flies i continued handfuls of flies flies randy asked yuck and then i saw him pick up one of his pet turtles you know the ones he keeps in that pan on his desk i saw him pop it in his mouth and eat it randy shuddered he stared at me thoughtfully for a moment i thought maybe he believed me but then his expression changed and he shook his head no way lucy youre just mad because i scared you for once so now youre trying to scare me but it isnt going to work randy grabbed the monster head from my lap and started out the door i dont believe you about mr mortman but its true i protested shrilly im missing my cartoons he said just then i heard a knock at the front door mom i cried i leapt off the bed and went tearing to the stairs i shoved randy out of my way and practically flew down the steps taking them three at a time mom dad youre home i have to tell you i froze in front of the screen door it wasnt my parents it was mr mortman my first thought was to run my next thought was to slam the front door my next thought was to run back upstairs and hide in my room but it was too late to hide mr mortman had already seen me he was staring at me through the screen door with those beady black eyes an evil thinlipped smile on his pale round face he saw me i realized he saw me spying on him in the library he saw me running away he knows that i know his secret he knows that i know hes a monster and hes come to get me hes come to get rid of me to make sure his secret is safe lucy he called i stared at him through the screen i could see in his eyes that he knew it had been me in the library the sun had nearly gone down the sky behind him was sunsetpurple his face looked even paler than usual in the evening light lucy hi its me he said he was waiting for me to say something but i was frozen there in panic trying to decide whether to run or scream or both randy had stopped halfway down the stairs who is it he asked its mr mortman i replied softly oh that was what my little brother said he came the rest of the way down then walked past me on his way back to the den hi mr mortman i managed to say not moving any closer to the door then i blurted out my parents arent home i knew instantly that it was a dumb thing to say now the monster knew that randy and i were here alone why did i say that i asked myself how could i be so stupid i didnt come to see your parents mr mortman said softly i came to see you lucy he knows i thought he really knows im dead meat i swallowed hard i didnt know what to say my eyes searched the front hallway for a weapon something to hit him with when he broke through the screen door and came after me mr mortmans eyes narrowed his smile faded this is it i thought there was nothing around that i could use to fight him off a little glass flower vase thats all i could see i didnt think it would be too effective against a roaring monster lucy i believe this belongs to you mr mortman said he held up my blue canvas backpack huh i found it back in the stacks mr mortman said his smile returning i didnt know who had left it but i found your name and address on the tag here you you mean i stammered i always walk home after i close the library so i thought id bring it to you he said was this a trap i studied his face warily i couldnt tell what he was thinking i had no choice i pushed open the screen door and he handed me the backpack wow thanks i said that was really nice of you he straightened the sleeves of his yellow turtleneck well i figured youd probably want to get started on anne of green gables tonight he said yeah sure i replied uncertainly i guess you ran out of the library pretty quickly mr mortman said staring into my eyes uh yeah i had to get home i told him glancing back to the den the cartoon music floated into the hallway so you didnt wait around or anything after our appointment he asked does he know i wonder or is he just trying to find out if it was me or not no i said trying to keep my voice from shaking i ran right out i was in a hurry i i guess thats why i forgot my bag oh i see mr mortman replied thoughtfully rubbing his chins why i blurted out the question seemed to surprise him oh its nothing really he said i think someone was playing a trick on me staying in the library after closing really i asked opening my eyes wide and trying to sound as innocent as possible why would they do that to scare me mr mortman answered chuckling some kids dont have anything better to do than try to scare the kindly old librarian but youre not a kindly old librarian i thought youre a monster i got up to look around mr mortman continued and whoever it was hightailed it he chuckled again i wouldnt want to be locked in there overnight i said studying his face hoping my innocent act was working neither would i he exclaimed its a pretty creepy old building sometimes i get so scared from all the strange creaks and groans yeah sure i thought sarcastically behind him i saw my parents car turn into the driveway i breathed a silent sigh of relief thank goodness they were finally home guess ill say good night mr mortman said pleasantly he turned and watched as my parents rolled past him up the driveway heading to the back of the house thanks for bringing the bag i said eager to go greet mom and dad no problem see you next week he hurried away i went running to the kitchen mom was just coming in through the kitchen door carrying a brown grocery bag wasnt that mr mortman at the front door she asked surprised yeah i answered eagerly im so glad to see you mom i have to tell you what did he want mom interrupted he uh returned my backpack i left it at the library see i have to tell you about him mom he that was really nice of him mom said setting the grocery bag down on the counter how come you forgot it lucy i ran out of there really fast mom you see well that was really nice of mr mortman she interrupted again she started to remove things from the grocery bag he doesnt live in this direction i think he lives way over on the north side mom im trying to tell you something i cried impatiently my hands were balled into tight fists my heart was pounding mr mortman is a monster huh she turned away from the counter and stared at me hes a monster mom a real one i cried lucy lucy she shook her head you see monsters everywhere mom stop it lucy stop being dumb i hope you were polite to mr mortman moom enough go outside and help your father bring in the rest of the groceries so once again my wonderful parents refused to believe me i tried to describe what i had seen from my hiding place in the library but mom just shook her head dad said i had a great imagination even randy refused to be scared he told mom and dad how he had scared me with his stupid papiermвchй monster head i practically begged them to believe me but mom said i was just lazy she said i was making up the story about mr mortman so i could get out of the reading rangers program and wouldnt have to read any more books this summer when she said that i got really insulted of course i yelled something back and it ended up with all of us growling and snapping at each other followed by me storming up to my room slumped unhappily on my bed i thought hard about my predicament i could see that they were never going to believe me i had told too many monster stories played too many monster jokes so i realized i needed someone else to tell my parents about mr mortman i needed someone else to see mr mortman become a monster i needed someone else to believe the truth with me aaron if aaron came along with me and hid in the library and saw mr mortman eat flies and turtles with his bulging head then aaron could tell my parents and theyd believe aaron they had no reason not to believe aaron he was a serious nononsense guy my most serious nononsense mend aaron was definitely the answer to my problem aaron would finally make my parents realize the truth about mr mortman i called him immediately i told him i needed him to come hide in the library and spy on mr mortman when he asked at your next reading rangers meeting no i cant wait a whole week i said whispering into the phone even though my parents were downstairs and there was no one around how about tomorrow afternoon just before closing time around five its too dumb aaron insisted i dont think i want to ill pay you i blurted out how much he asked what a friend five dollars i said reluctantly i never save much of my allowance i wondered if i still had five dollars in my drawer well okay aaron agreed five dollars in advance and youll hide with me and then tell my parents everything you see i asked yeah okay but i still think its dumb he was silent for a moment and what if we get caught he asked after a while well be careful i said feeling a little chill of fear i spent most of the next day hanging around teasing randy i couldnt wait for the afternoon to roll around i was so excited and nervous i had it all worked out aaron and i would sneak into the main reading room without mr mortman knowing anyone had come in wed hide in the dark shelves just as i had done then when the librarian turned off the lights and closed up the library wed sneak up the aisle keeping in the shadows and watch him become a monster then we wouldnt run out the way i had done that was far too risky we would go back to our hiding places in the low shelves and wait for mr mortman to leave once he was gone aaron and i would let ourselves out of the library and hurry to my house to tell my parents what we had seen easy nothing to it i kept telling myself but i was so nervous so eager to get it over with i arrived at aarons house an hour early i rang the bell no answer i rang it again finally after a long wait aarons teenage brother burt pulled open the door he had on blue denim shorts and no shirt hi he said scratching his chest you looking for aaron yeah i nodded he isnt home huh i practically fell off the porch where is he i mean when will he be back dont know he went to the dentist burt said gazing past me to the street he did yeah he had an appointment with the orthodontist hes getting braces didnt he tell you no i said glumly i could feel my heart sink to my knees i was supposed to meet him guess he forgot burt said with a shrug you know aaron he never remembers stuff like that well thanks i muttered unhappily i said goodbye and trudged back down to the sidewalk that dirty traitor i felt really betrayed i had waited all day i was so psyched for spying on mr mortman i had counted on aaron and all the while he had a stupid orthodontist appointment i hope your braces really hurt i shouted out loud i kicked a small rock across the sidewalk i felt like kicking a lot of rocks i felt like kicking aaron i turned and headed home thinking all kinds of ugly thoughts i was at the bottom of my driveway when an idea popped into my head i didnt need aaron i suddenly realized i had a camera my parents had given me a really good camera last christmas if i sneaked into the library with the camera and took a few snapshots of mr mortman after he became a monster the photos would be all the proof i needed my parents would have to believe actual color snapshots forgetting my disappointment about aaron i hurried up to my room and pulled the camera off the shelf it already had film in it i had taken a bunch of shots at randys birthday party just before school let out i examined it carefully there were still eight or nine shots left on the roll that should be plenty to capture mr mortman at his ugliest i glanced at the clock on my desk it was still early a little after fourthirty i had half an hour before the library closed this has got to work i said out loud crossing my fingers on both hands then i strapped the camera around my neck and headed to the library i entered the library silently and crept to the doorway of the main reading room my plan was to sneak into the low shelf where i had hidden before but i quickly saw that it wasnt going to be as easy as i thought the library was very crowded there were several kids in the childrens book section there were people thumbing through the magazines one of the microfiche machines was being used against one wall and several aisles including the one with my special hiding place had people in them browsing and searching the shelves ill just have to wait them out i decided turning and pretending to search one of the back shelves i could see mr mortman standing behind his desk he was checking out a stack of books for a young woman opening the covers stamping the card then slamming the covers shut it was nearly five oclock just about closing time i crept along the back wall searching for another hiding spot near the corner i spotted a large wooden cabinet i recognized it as i stepped behind it and lowered myself from view it was the long tall cabinet that held the card catalogue it will hide me quite nicely i thought i hunched down behind the old cabinet and waited time dragged by every second seemed like an hour at fivefifteen mr mortman was still checking out books for people he announced closing time but some of the magazine readers seemed very reluctant to leave i felt myself getting more and more nervous my hands were ice cold the camera suddenly seemed to weigh a thousand pounds like a dead weight around my neck i removed it and dropped it to my lap it will all be worth it i kept repeating to myself it will all be worth it if i get a good clear shot of the monster i leaned against the back of the cabinet and waited my hand gripping the camera in my lap finally the room emptied out i climbed to my knees suddenly very alert as i heard the librarian go to lock the front door a few seconds later i heard him return to his desk i stood up and peered around the side of the cabinet he was busily shuffling papers straightening his desk for the night in a few minutes i hoped it would be feeding time monster time taking a deep breath i gripped the camera tightly in one hand and feeling my heart start to pound began to make my way silently toward mr mortmans desk at the front of the room everything seemed to be taking so long today was time really in slow motion or did everything seem so slow because my pulse was racing so fast i was so eager to get my proof and get out of there but mr mortman was taking his good old time he shuffled through a stack of papers reading some of them folding some of them in half and tossing them in the wire trash basket beside his desk he hummed to himself as he read through the entire stack finally he got to the bottom of the pile and tossed the final sheet away now i thought now youll start your monster routine wont you mr mortman but no he lifted a stack of books from his desk and carried them to the shelves humming loudly he began returning the books to their places i pressed myself into the shadows hoping he wouldnt come to my row i was near the far wall in front of the row of microfiche machines please lets get on with it i begged silently but when he finished with the first stack mr mortman returned to his desk and hoisted up another pile of books to replace im going to be late for dinner i realized with a growing sense of dread my parents are going to kill me the thought made me chuckle here i was locked inside this creepy old library with a monster and i was worried about getting scolded for being late for dinner i could hear mr mortman but i couldnt see him he was somewhere among the rows of shelves replacing books suddenly his humming grew louder i realized he was in the next aisle i could see him over the tops of the books on the shelf to my right and that meant he could see me gripped with panic i ducked and dropped to the floor had he heard me had he seen me i didnt move i didnt breathe he continued to hum to himself the sound grew fainter as he moved in the other direction letting out a silent sigh of relief i climbed back to my feet gripping the camera tightly in my right hand i peered around the side of the shelf i heard his shoes shuffling along the floor he reappeared his bald head shiny in the late afternoon sunlight from the window and made his way slowly to his desk the clock on the wall ticked noisily my hand gripping the camera was cold and clammy watching him shuffle things around inside his desk drawer i suddenly lost my nerve this is stupid i thought a really bad idea im going to be caught as soon as i step out to snap the picture hell see me hell chase after me he wont let me get out of the library with this camera he wont let me get out of here alive turn and run a voice inside my head commanded quick while you have the chance turn and run then another voice interrupted that one he isnt going to turn into a monster tonight lucy the voice said youre wasting your time youre getting yourself all nervous and scared for no reason my mind was spinning whirring with voices and frightening thoughts i leaned hard against the wooden shelf steadying myself i closed my eyes for a moment trying to clear my head how many shots can you take a voice in my head asked can you shoot off three or four before he realizes what is happening you only need one good shot another voice told me one good clear shot will be the proof you need youd better hope hes humming very loudly another voice said otherwise hell hear your camera shutter click turn and run another voice repeated turn and run you only need one good shot dont let him hear your shutter click i stepped forward and peered around the shelf mr mortman humming happily away was reaching for the fly jar yes i cried silently finally dinnertime my timid friends i heard him say in a pleasant singsong and as he started to unscrew the jar lid his head began to grow his eyes bulged his mouth twisted open and enlarged in a few seconds his monstrous head was bobbing above his shirt his snakelike tongue flicked out of his black mouth as he removed the jar lid and pulled out a handful of flies dinnertime my timid friends picture time i thought gathering my courage i raised the camera to my eye with a trembling hand i gripped it tightly with both hands to keep it from shaking then holding my breath i leaned as far forward as i could mr mortman was downing his first handful of flies chewing noisily humming as he chewed i struggled to center him in the viewfinder i was so nervous the camera was shaking all over the place im so glad hes humming i thought raising my finger to the shutter button he wont hear the camera click ill be able to take more than one shot okay okay he was still enjoying his first batch of tender flies now i told myself i was about to push the button when mr mortman suddenly turned away with a gasp i stopped myself just in time my pulse was pounding at my temples so hard i could barely see straight what was he doing he was reaching for another jar he set it down on his desk and unscrewed the lid i raised the camera again and squinted at him through the viewfinder what did he have in this jar something was fluttering in there it took me a while to realize they were moths white moths he closed his fist around one and shoved it hungrily into his mouth another moth fluttered out of the jar before he could close the lid mr mortmans eyes bulged like toadstools growing out of his balloonlike head his mouth twisted and coiled as he chewed the moth taking another deep breath and holding it i leaned forward as far as i could steadied the camera in front of my eye and snapped the shutter the flash i had forgotten about the flash i was so worried about the click of the shutter i had totally forgotten that my camera had automatic flash the instant flash of white light made mr mortman cry out angrily startled he raised his hands to cover his bulging eyes i stood frozen in the aisle frozen by carelessness frozen by my stupidity whos there he growled still covering his eyes i realized he hadnt seen me yet those big eyes must have been very sensitive to light the flash had momentarily blinded him he let out a monstrous roar that echoed off the four walls of the vast room somehow i revived my senses enough to pull myself back out of view whos there he repeated his voice a rasping snarl you wont get away i saw him lumbering in my direction as he lurched toward me his body swayed awkwardly as if his eyes were still blinded i gaped in horror as he approached he seemed steadier with each step his bulging eyes searched the rows of shelves he was breathing hard each breath a furious growl whos there whos there get going i told myself still gripping the camera in both hands get going what are you waiting for you wont get away the monster cried oh yes i will he was three rows away his eyes peering down the dark aisles searching searching he hadnt seen me i knew the light of the flash had startled him then blinded him he didnt know it was me now all i had to do was run all i had to do was get out of there with the proof safely in my hands so what was i waiting for he lumbered closer he was only a row away run i ordered my paralyzed legs run dont just stand there i spun around clumsily bumped into a shelf of books several books toppled to the floor run dont stop it was taking me so long to move i was so weighed down by my fear run lucy hes right behind you finally my legs started to cooperate holding the camera in one hand i began to run through the dark aisle toward the back of the room you wont get away the monster bellowed from the next aisle i hear you i know where you are uttering an animal cry of terror i ran blindly to the end of the aisle turned toward the doorway and crashed into a low book cart the cart toppled over as i fell on top of it i landed hard on my stomach and knees the camera bounced from my hand and slid across the floor ive got you now the monster growled moving quickly from the next aisle i scrambled to get up but my leg was caught in the cart the monster lumbered toward me panting loudly once again my fear tried to paralyze me i tried to push myself up with both hands but my body felt as if it weighed a thousand pounds im dead meat i thought finally i pushed myself up and freed myself from the cart dead meat dead meat the panting growling monster was only a few yards away now lurching out of a row of shelves i grabbed the camera and stumbled to the door my knee throbbing my head whirring ill never make it never and then i heard the loud electronic ringing at first i thought it was an alarm but then i realized it was the telephone i pulled myself into the doorway and turned the monster hesitated at the end of the aisle his bulbous black eyes floated up above his face his gaping mouth drooling green liquid twisted into an o of surprise he stopped short startled by the sudden interruption saved by the bell i thought happily i pulled open the heavy front door and burst out to freedom i ran for two blocks my sneakers slapping the pavement my heart refusing to slow its frantic beat i closed my eyes as i ran enjoying the feel of the warm fresh air on my face the warmth of the late afternoon sun the sweep of my hair flying behind me as i ran feeling free free and safe when i opened my eyes and slowed my pace i realized that i was gripping the camera so tightly my hands hurt my proof i had my proof one snapshot one snapshot that nearly cost me my life but i had it in the camera my proof that mr mortman was a monster i have to get it developed i said out loud fast i jogged the rest of the way home cradling the camera under my arm as my house came into view i had a chilling feeling that mr mortman would be waiting there that he would be waiting beside the front porch waiting to grab the camera from me to rob me of my proof i hesitated at the bottom of the driveway no one there was he hiding in the bushes around the side of the house i walked up the front lawn slowly youre being stupid i scolded myself how could mr mortman get here before you besides i wasnt even sure he had recognized me the lights were out in the library the room was dark the closest he had come was the aisle next to mine and he was blinded for a long while from the camera flash i started to breathe a little easier yes it was possible that the librarian didnt know who he was chasing it was possible that he never got a good look at me at all my dads car pulled up the drive as i reached the front porch i went tearing after him running around the side of the house to the back dad hi i called as he climbed out of the car hey hows it going he asked his suit was rumpled his hair was disheveled he looked tired dad can we get this film developed right away i demanded shoving the camera toward him whoa he cried i just got home lets talk about it at dinner okay no dad really i insisted i have to get this developed theres something very important on it he walked past me toward the house his shoes crunching over the gravel driveway i followed right behind still holding my camera up high please dad its really important really really important he turned chuckling what have you got a picture of that boy who moved across the street no i replied angrily im serious dad cant you take me to the mall theres that onehour developing place there whats so important he asked his smile fading he ran a hand over his head smoothing down his thick black hair i had the urge to tell him i had the urge to tell him i had a photo of the monster in there but i stopped myself i knew he wouldnt believe me i knew he wouldnt take me seriously and then he wouldnt drive me to the mall to get my film developed no way ill show it to you when its developed i said he held open the screen door we walked into the kitchen dad sniffed the air a couple of times expecting the aroma of cooking food mom came bursting in from the hallway to greet us dont sniff she told my dad theres nothing cooking were eating out tonight great i cried can we eat at the mall at that chinese restaurant you like i turned to my dad please please then i could get my film developed while we eat i could go for chinese food mom said thoughtfully then she turned her gaze on me why so eager to get your film developed its a secret dad said before i could reply she wont ten i couldnt hold it in any longer its a picture i snapped of mr mortman i told them excitedly its my proof that hes a monster mom rolled her eyes dad shook his head its proof i insisted maybe when you see the photo youll

chinese food my brother called down unhappily his standard reply ill get you the plain lo mein noodles you like mom called up to him just hurry were all hungry i pushed the button on my camera to rewind the roll of film im going to drop this at the onehour developing place before dinner i told them then we can pick it up after dinner no monster talk at dinner tonight promise mom said sternly i dont want you scaring your brother promise i said pulling the film roll out of the camera squeezing it between my fingers after dinner i told myself i wont have to talk about monsters ill show you one dinner seemed to take forever randy didnt stop complaining the whole time he said his noodles tasted funny he said the spareribs were too greasy and the soup was too hot he spilled his glass of water all over the table i barely paid any attention to what anyone said i was thinking about my snapshot i couldnt wait to see it and to show it td mom and dad i could just imagine the looks on their faces when they saw that i was right that i hadnt been making it up that mr mortman really was a monster i imagined both my parents apologizing to me promising theyd never doubt me again i feel so bad i imagined my dad saying im going to buy you that computer youve been asking for and a new bike i imagined mom saying please forgive us for doubting you and im sorry too i imagined randy saying i know ive been a real jerk and you can stay up till midnight every night from now on even on school nights i imagined dad saying suddenly my moms voice broke into my daydreams lucy i dont think you heard a word i said she scolded no i uh was thinking about something i admitted i picked up my chopsticks and raised a chunk of rice to my mouth she was thinking about monsters randy cried raising both hands up over the table squeezing his fingers as if he were a monster about to attack me no monster talk mom insisted sharply dont look at me i cried he said it not me i pointed an accusing finger at randy just finish your dinner dad said quietly he had sparerib grease all over his chin finally we were opening our fortune cookies mine said something about waiting for sunshine when the clouds part i never get those fortunes dad paid the check randy nearly spilled another glass of water as we were standing up i went running out of the restaurant i was so excited so eager i couldnt wait another second the little photo store was on the upper level i leapt onto the escalator grabbed the rail and rode to the top then i tore into the store up to the counter and called breathlessly to the young woman at the developing machine are my photos ready yet she turned startled by my loud voice i think so whats your name i told her she walked over to a rack of yellow envelopes and began slowly shuffling through them i tapped my fingers nervously on the countertop staring at the stack of yellow envelopes couldnt she hurry it up a little she shuffled all the way through the stack then turned back to me what did you say your name was again trying not to sound too exasperated i told her my name again i leaned eagerly on the countertop my heart pounding and stared at her as she began once again to shuffle through the yellow envelopes moving her lips as she read the names finally she pulled one out and handed it to me i grabbed it and started to tear it open that conies to fourteen dollars even she said i realized i didnt have any money ill have to get my dad i told her not letting go of the precious package i turned and dad appeared in the doorway mom and randy waited outside he paid i carried the envelope of photos out of the store my hands were shaking as i pulled it open and removed the snapshots lucy calm down mom said sounding worried i stared down at the snapshots all photos of randys birthday party i sifted through them quickly staring at the grinning faces of randys stupid mends where is it where is it where is it of course it was the very last photo the one on the bottom of the stack here it is i cried mom and dad leaned forward to see over my shoulder the other photos fell from my hand and scattered over the floor as i raised the photo to my face and gasped the photo was clear and sharp mr mortmans large desk stood in the center in a burst of bright light i could see papers on the desk the pan of turtles at the far corner a low pile of books behind the desk i could see the top of mr mortmans tall wooden stool and behind the stool the shelves were in clear focus even the glass jar of flies on the lower shelf but there was no monster no mr mortman no one no one in the snapshot at all he he was standing right there i cried beside the desk the room looks empty dad said staring down over my shoulder at the snapshot in my quivering hand theres no one there mom said turning her gaze on me he was there i insisted unable to take my eyes off the photo right there i pointed to where the monster had stood randy laughed let me see he pulled the photo from my hand and examined it i see him he declared hes invisible it isnt funny i said weakly i pulled the photo away from him i sighed unhappily i felt so bad i wanted to sink into a hole in the floor and never come out hes invisible randy repeated gleefully enjoying his own joke mom and dad were staring at me looks of concern on their faces dont you see i cried waving the photo in one hand dont you see this proves it this proves hes a monster he doesnt show up in photographs dad shook his head and frowned lucy havent you carried this joke far enough mom put a hand on my shoulder im starting to get worried about you she said softly i think youre really starting to believe in your own monster joke can we get ice cream randy asked i cant believe were doing this aaron complained just shut up you owe me i snapped it was the next evening we were crouched low hiding behind the low shrubs at the side of the library it was a crisp cool day the sun was already lowering itself behind the trees the shadows stretched long and blue over the library lawn i owe you aaron protested are you crazy you owe me i repeated you were supposed to come to the library with me yesterday remember you let me down he brushed a bug off his freckled nose can i help it if i had an orthodontist appointment he sounded funny his words were coming out all sticky he wasnt used to his new braces yet yes i insisted i counted on you and you let me down and you got me in all kinds of trouble what kind of trouble he dropped to the ground and sat crosslegged keeping his head low behind the evergreen shrub my parents said im never again allowed to mention mr mortman or the fact that hes a monster i told him good aaron said not good it means i really need you aaron i need you to see that im telling the truth and tell my parents my voice broke they think im crazy they really do he started to reply but he could see i was really upset so he stopped himself a cool breeze swept past making the trees all seem to whisper at us i kept my eyes trained on the library door it was fivetwenty past closing time mr mortman should be coming out any second so were going to follow mr mortman home aaron asked scratching the back of his neck and spy on him at his house why dont we just watch him through the library window the window is too high i replied we have to follow him he told me he walks home every evening i want you to see him turn into a monster i said staring straight ahead over the top of the bush i want you to believe me what if i just say i believe you aaron asked grinning then could we just go home ssshhh i pressed a hand over aarons mouth the library door was opening mr mortman appeared on the front steps aaron and i ducked down lower i peered through the branches of the shrub the librarian turned to lock the front door he was wearing a redandwhitestriped shortsleeved sportshirt and baggy gray slacks he had a red baseball cap on his bald head stay far behind i whispered to aaron dont let him see you good advice aaron said sarcastically we both shifted onto our knees and waited for mr mortman to head down the sidewalk he hesitated on the steps replacing the keys in his pants pocket then humming to himself he walked down the driveway and turned away from us whats he humming about aaron whispered he always hums i whispered back mr mortman was more than half a block away lets go i said climbing quickly to my feet keeping in the shadows of the trees and shrubs i began following the librarian aaron followed just behind me do you know where he lives aaron asked i turned back to him frowning if i knew where he lived we wouldnt have to follow him would we oh right following someone was a lot harder than i thought we had to cut through front yards some of them had barking dogs some had lawn sprinklers going some had thick hedges we somehow had to duck through at every street corner mr mortman would stop and look both ways for oncoming cars each time i was certain he was going to look over his shoulder too and see aaron and me creeping along behind him he lived farther from the library than i had thought after several blocks the houses ended and a bare flat field spread in front of us mr mortman cut through the field walking quickly swinging his stubby arms rhythmically with each step we had no choice but to follow him across the field there were no hiding places no shrubs to duck behind no hedges to shield us we were completely out in the open we just had to pray that he didnt turn around in the middle of the field and see us a block of small older houses stood beyond the field most of the houses were brick set close to the street on tiny front yards mr mortman turned onto a block of these houses aaron and i crouched behind a mailbox and watched him walk up to a house near the middle of the block he stepped onto the small front stoop and fiddled in his pocket for the keys were here i whispered to aaron we made it my friend ralph lives on this block i think aaron said who cares i snapped keep your mind on business okay we waited until mr mortman had disappeared through the front door of his house then crept closer his house was white clapboard badly in need of a paint job he had a small rectangle of a front yard with recently cut grass bordered by a single row of tall yellow tiger lilies aaron and i made our way quickly to the side of the house where there was a narrow strip of grass that led to the back the window near the front of the house was high enough for us to stand under and not be seen a light came on in the window that must be his living room i whispered aaron had a frightened expression his freckles seemed a lot paler than usual i dont like this he said the hard part was following him i assured aaron this part is easy we just watch him through the window but the window is too high aaron pointed out we cant see anything he was right staring up from beneath the window all i could see was the living room ceiling well have to stand on something i said huh what i could see aaron was going to be no help he was so frightened his nose was twitching like a bunny rabbits i decided if i could keep him busy maybe i could keep him from totally freaking and running away go in back see if theres a ladder or something i whispered motioning toward the back of the house another light came on this one in a back window probably the kitchen i figured it was also too high to see into wait what about that aaron asked i followed his gaze to a wheelbarrow tilted against the side of the house yeah maybe i said bring it over ill try to stand on it keeping his head and shoulders bent low aaron scampered over to the wheelbarrow he lifted it away from the house by the handles then pushed it under the front window hold it steady i said he grabbed the wooden handles gazing up at me fearfully you sure about this ill give it a try i said glancing up at the high window holding onto aarons shoulder i gave myself a boost onto the wheelbarrow he held firmly to the handles as i struggled to find my balance inside the metal basket part it its kind of tilty i whispered pressing one hand against the side of the house to steady myself im doing the best i can aaron grumbled there i think i can stand i said i wasnt very high off the ground but i wasnt at all comfortable a wheelbarrow is a difficult thing to stand on somewhere down the block a dog barked i hoped he wasnt barking because of aaron and me another dog closer to us quickly joined in and it became a barking conversation are you high enough can you see anything aaron asked one hand still pressed against the side of the house i raised my head and peered into the house through the bottom of the window yeah i can see some i called down theres a big aquarium in front of the window but i can see most of the living room and just as i said that mr mortmans face loomed inches from mine he was staring right at me i gasped and lost my balance i toppled to the ground knocking over the wheelbarrow landing hard on my knees and elbows ow what happened aaron cried alarmed he saw me i choked out waiting for the pain to stop throbbing huh aarons mouth dropped open we both gazed up at the window i expected to see mr mortman staring down at us but no no sign of him i climbed quickly to my feet maybe he was looking at his aquarium i whispered motioning for aaron to set up the wheelbarrow maybe he didnt see me whwhat are you going to do aaron stammered get back up of course i told him my legs were shaking as i climbed back onto the wheelbarrow i grabbed the window ledge and pulled myself up the sun had nearly gone down the darkness outside made it easier to see inside the house and i hoped harder for mr mortman to see out i didnt have the best view in the world i quickly realized the aquarium crowded with colorful tropical fish blocked my view of most of the room if only i were a little higher i thought i could see over it but if i had been higher i realized mr mortman would have seen me whats he doing aaron asked in a trembling whisper nothing hes wait mr mortman was staring down at the fish he stood only a few feet from me on the other side of the aquarium i froze pressing my hands against the side of the house he gazed down into his aquarium and a smile formed on his pudgy face he had removed the red baseball cap his bald head looked yellow in the living room lamplight his mouth moved he was saying something to the tropical fish in the aquarium i couldnt hear him through the glass then as he smiled down at his fish he began to change hes doing it i whispered to aaron hes turning into a monster as i watched mr mortmans head inflate and his eyes bulge out i was filled with all kinds of strange feelings i was terrified and i was fascinated it was exciting to be so close inches away from a real monster and i felt so happy and relieved that aaron would finally see for himself that i was telling the truth then as mr mortmans mouth grew wider and began to gyrate a twisting black hole on his swollen yellow face fear overtook me i froze there my face pressed against the window not blinking not moving i stared as he reached a hand into the aquarium his fat fingers wrapped around a slender blue fish he pulled it up and flipped it into his mouth i could see long yellow teeth inside the enormous mouth biting down chewing the wriggling fish then as i gaped in growing terror mr mortman pulled a black snail off the side of the aquarium glass holding its shell between his fingertips he stuffed the snail into his mouth his teeth crunched down hard on the shell cracking it a crack so loud i could hear it through the window glass my stomach churned i felt sick he swallowed the snail then reached to pull another one off the aquarium glass i think im going to toss my lunch i whispered down to aaron aaron i had forgotten all about him i was so fascinated by the monster so excited so terrified to watch him close up i had forgotten the whole purpose of being here aaron help me down i whispered quick still staring through the window i reached a hand down for aaron to take it aaron hurry help me down so you can climb up here you have to see this you have to see the monster he didnt reply aaron aaron i lowered my eyes from the window aaron had disappeared i felt a stab of panic in my chest my entire body convulsed in a tremor of cold fear where was he had he run away was aaron so frightened that he just took off without telling me or had something happened to him something really bad aaron aaron in my panic i forgot that i was inches away from a monster and started to shout aaron where are you ssh i heard a whisper from the back of the house aaron appeared making his way quickly toward me along the narrow strip of grass im right here lucy huh whered you go he pointed to the back i thought maybe i could find a ladder or something you know so i could see too you scared me to death i cried i returned my glance to the window mr mortman was sucking a slithering eel into his mouth like a strand of spaghetti quick aaron help me down i instructed still feeling shaken from the scare of his disappearance you have to see this you have to before he changes back he hes really a monster aarons mouth dropped open youre not joking just get up here i cried impatiently but as i tried to lower myself to the ground the wheelbarrow slid out from under me it toppled onto its side the handles scraping the side of the house my hands shot up to grab the windowsill i missed and fell heavily on top of the wheelbarrow ow i cried out as sharp pain cut through my side glancing up i saw the monsters startled face goggling down at me through the glass i scrambled to get up but the throbbing pain in my side took my breath away aaron help me but he was already running to the street his sneakers scraping the grass his arms stretched straight in front of him as if trying to grab onto safety ignoring the pain in my side i scrambled to my feet i took an unsteady step then another i shook my head trying to shake away my dizziness then i sucked in a deep breath and started to run following aaron toward the street i had gone about four or five steps when i felt mr mortmans surprisingly strong hands grab my shoulders from behind i tried to scream but no sound came out he held firmly onto my shoulders i could feel his hot wet hands through my tshirt i tried to pull away but he was too strong he spun me around his face was back to normal he squinted at me with those little black eyes as if he couldnt believe what he was seeing lucy he exclaimed in his scratchy voice he let go of my shoulders and stepped back i was panting loudly i was so frightened my chest felt about to explode how had he changed back from his monster form so quickly what was he going to do to me lucy good heavens i thought you were a burglar he said shaking his head he removed a white handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his perspiring forehead ssorry i stammered my voice came out in a choked whisper he balled up the handkerchief between his fat hands and jammed it back into his pocket what are you doing here well my heart was pounding so hard i could feel the blood pulse at my temples my side still ached from where i had fallen on the wheelbarrow i struggled to clear my mind i had to think of an answer to his question i had to well i started again thinking desperately i uh came to tell you that ill uh be a little late for my reading rangers appointment tomorrow he narrowed his eyes and stared at me thoughtfully but why were you looking through my window he demanded well i just think lucy think i didnt know if you were home or not i just was trying to see if you were there i mean so i could tell you about the appointment tomorrow staring into his face trying to sound sincere i took a step back in case i had to make a run for it did he believe me was he buying it i couldnt tell he continued to stare at me thoughtfully he rubbed his chins you really didnt have to come all the way out here he said softly did you ride your bike his eyes darted over the small front lawn no i uh walked i like to walk i replied awkwardly its getting dark he said maybe you should call your mom or dad to come pick you up why dont you come inside and use the phone come inside come inside the monsters house no way uh no thanks mr mortman i said taking another step backwards toward the street my parents dont mind if i walk home it isnt that far really no i insist he said an odd grin starting across his molelike face he motioned toward the house come on in lucy the phone is in the living room he urged come on i wont bite i shuddered id just seen him bite snails and eels there was no way i was going in that house i knew that if i went in chances are id never come out i ive got to go i said giving him a wave of one hand i could feel the fear creeping up my back running over my body i knew if i didnt get away from there that moment id be frozen by my terror unable to escape lucy mr mortman insisted no really bye mr mortman i waved again turned and started jogging to the street you really shouldnt have come all this way he called after me in his high scratchy voice really you shouldnt have i know i thought i know i shouldnt have i trotted along the street turned the corner and continued down the next block was i really getting away was he really letting me go i couldnt believe hed bought my lame excuse why was he letting me get away i slowed to a walk my side still ached i suddenly had a throbbing headache night had fallen passing cars had their headlights on a slender trail of dark cloud drifted over a pale halfmoon still low in the purplegray sky i was about to cross the street onto the broad empty field when hands grabbed my shoulders again i cried out more of a yelp than a scream and spun around expecting to see the monster aaron i cried i swallowed hard trying to force down my fear where i waited for you he said his voice trembled his hands were knotted into fists he looked about ready to burst into tears aaron ive been waiting all this time he said shrilly whereve you been ive been so scared i was back there i told him i was ready to call the police or something aaron said i was hiding down the block i you saw him i asked eagerly suddenly remembering why we had risked our lives tonight you saw mr mortman aaron shook his head no i didnt i was too far away but earlier i said through the window when he was a monster didnt you see him then didnt you see him eat the snails and the eels aaron shook his head again i didnt see anything lucy he said softly im sorry i wish i had big help i thought bitterly now what was i going to do mom you dont understand i cant go lucy im not giving you a choice youre going and thats that it was the next afternoon a stormy gray day and mom and i were in the kitchen arguing i was trying to tell her there was no way i could go to my reading rangers meeting at the library and she was insisting that i had to go mom youve got to believe me i pleaded i was trying not to whine but my voice kept creeping higher and higher mr mortman is a monster i cant go to the library anymore mom made a disgusted face and tossed down the dish towel shed been folding lucy your father and i have had it up to here with your silly monster stories she turned to face me her expression was angry the fact is lucy dear that you are a quitter you never stick with anything youre lazy thats your problem mr mortman is a monster i interrupted thats my problem well i dont care mom replied sharply i dont care if he turns into a drooling werewolf at night youre not quitting reading rangers youre going to your appointment this afternoon if i have to take you by the hand and walk you there myself gee would you i asked the idea flashed into my head that mom could hide in the stacks and see for herself when mr mortman turned into a monster but i guess she thought i was being sarcastic she just scowled and walked out of the kitchen and so an hour later i was trudging up the stone steps to the old library it was raining hard but i didnt take an umbrella i didnt care if i got drenched my hair was soaked and matted on my head i shook my head hard as i stepped into the entryway sending drops of water flying in all directions i shivered more from my fear from being back in this frightening place than from the cold i pulled off my backpack it was dripping wet too how can i face mr mortman i wondered as i made my way reluctantly into the main reading room how can i face him after last night he must surely suspect that i know his secret he couldnt have believed me last night could he i was so furious at my mom for forcing me to come here i hope he turns into a monster and chews me to bits i thought bitterly that will really teach mom a lesson i pictured mom and dad and randy sitting mournfully in our living room crying their eyes out wailing if only we had believed her if only we had listened holding my wet backpack in front of me like a shield i made my way slowly past the long rows of books to the front of the room to my relief there were several people in the library i saw two little kids with their mothers and a couple of other women browsing in the mystery book section great i thought starting to feel a little calmer mr mortman wont dare do anything while the library is filled with people the librarian was dressed in a green turtleneck today which really made him look like a big round turtle he was stamping a stack of books and didnt look up as i stepped close to the desk i cleared my throat nervously mr mortman it took him a long while to look up when he finally did a warm smile formed above his chins hi lucy give me a few minutes okay sure i said ill go dry off he seems very friendly i thought heading over to a chair at one of the long tables he doesnt seem angry at all maybe he really did believe my story last night maybe he really doesnt know that ive seen him turn into a monster maybe ill get out of here alive i sat down at the table and shook some more water from my hair i stared at the big round wall clock nervously waiting for him to call me up for our meeting the clock ticked noisily each second seemed to take a minute the kids with their mothers checked out some books and left i turned to the mystery section and saw that the two women had also cleared out the librarian and i were the only ones left mr mortman shoved a stack of books across his desk and stood up ill be right back lucy he said another friendly reassuring smile on his face then well have our meeting he stepped away from his desk and walking briskly headed to the back of the reading room i guessed he was going to the bathroom or something a jagged flash of white lightning flickered across the dark sky outside the window it was followed by a drumroll of thunder i stood up from the table and carrying my wet backpack by the straps started toward mr mortmans desk i was halfway to the desk when i heard the loud click i knew at once that he had locked the front door a few seconds later he returned walking briskly still smiling he was rubbing his pudgy white hands together as he walked shall we talk about your book he asked stepping up to me mr mortman you locked the front door i said swallowing hard his smile didnt fade his dark little eyes locked on mine yes of course he said softly studying my face his hands were still clasped together in front of him but why i stammered he brought his face close to mine and his smile faded i know why you were at my house last night he growled into my ear i know everything but mr mortman i im sorry he said in his throaty growl but i cant let you leave lucy i cant let you leave the library ohhh the sound escaped my lips a moan of total terror i stared at him without moving i guess i wanted to see if he was serious or not if he really meant what he said his eyes told me he did and as i stared at him his head began to inflate his tiny round eyes shot out of their sockets and grew into throbbing black bulbs ohhh again the terrified sound escaped my lips my entire body convulsed in a shudder of terror his head was throbbing now throbbing like a heart his mouth opened into a gaping gruesome leer and green spittle ran down his quivering chin move i told myself move lucy do something his disgusting grin grew wider his enormous head bobbed and throbbed excitedly he uttered a low growl of attack and reached out both arms to grab me no i shrieked i leaned back and with all my might swung the backpack into his flabby stomach it caught him by surprise he gasped as it took his breath away i let go of the backpack spun around and started to run he was right behind me i could hear his panting breath and low menacing growls i ran through a narrow aisle between two tall shelves a rumble of thunder from outside seemed to shake the room he was still behind me close closer he was going to catch me going to grab me from behind i reached the end of the row i hesitated i didnt know which way to turn i couldnt think he roared a monstrous animal sound i turned left and started to run along the back wall of the room another rumble of thunder ohh i realized to my horror that id made a mistake a fatal mistake i was running right into the corner there was no exit here no escape he roared again so loud that it drowned out the thunder i was trapped i knew it trapped with a desperate cry i ran blindly headlong into the card catalogue behind me i heard the monsters roar of laughter he knew he had won the card catalogue toppled over drawers came sliding out cards spilled at my feet scattering over the floor noooo the monster howled at first i thought it was a victory cry but then i realized it was an angry cry of protest with a moan of horror he stooped to the floor and began gathering up the cards staring in disbelief i plunged past him running frantically my arms thrashing wildly at my sides in that moment of terror i remembered the one thing that librarians hate most having cards from the card catalogue spilled on the floor mr mortman was a monster but he was also a librarian he couldnt bear to have those cards in disorder he had to try to replace them before chasing after me it took only seconds to run into the front entryway turn the lock pull open the door and flee out into the rain my sneakers slapped the pavement as i ran sending up splashes of rainwater i made my way to the street and was halfway up the block when i realized he was chasing after me a flash of lightning crackled to my left i cried out startled as a deafening burst of thunder shook the ground i glanced back to see how close the monster was and stopped with trembling hands i frantically brushed a glaze of rainwater from my eyes aaron i cried what are you doing here he ran up to me hunching against the cold rain he was breathing hard his eyes were wide and frightened i i was in the library he stammered struggling to catch his breath hiding i saw it i saw the monster i saw everything you did i was so happy i wanted to hug him a sheet of rain swept over us driven by a gust of wind lets get to my house i cried you can tell my parents now maybe theyll finally believe it aaron and i burst into the den mom looked up from the couch lowering the newspaper to her lap youre dripping on the rug she said wheres dad is he home yet i asked rainwater running down my forehead aaron and i were soaked from head to foot here i am he appeared behind us he had changed out of his work clothes whats all the excitement its about the monster i blurted out mr mortman he mom shook her head and started to raise a hand to stop me but aaron quickly came to my rescue i saw him too aaron exclaimed lucy didnt make it up its true mom and dad listened to aaron i knew they would he told them what he had seen in the library he told them how the librarian had turned into a monster and chased me into the corner mom listened intently to aarons story shaking her head i guess lucys story is true she said when aaron had finished yeah i guess it is dad said putting a hand gently on my shoulder well now that you finally believe me what are you going to do dad i demanded he gazed at me thoughtfully well invite mr mortman for dinner he said huh i goggled at him rainwater running down my face youll what he tried to gobble me up you cant invite him here i protested you cant lucy we have no choice dad insisted well invite him for dinner mr mortman arrived a few evenings later carrying a bouquet of flowers he was wearing limegreen trousers and a bright yellow shortsleeved sport shirt mom accepted the flowers from him and led him into the living room where dad randy and i were waiting i gripped the back of a chair tightly as he entered my legs felt rubbery and ray stomach felt as if id swallowed a heavy rock i still couldnt believe that dad had invited mr mortman into our house dad stepped forward to shake hands with the librarian weve been meaning to invite you for quite a while dad told him smiling we want to thank you for the excellent reading program at the library yes mom joined in its really meant a lot to lucy mr mortman glanced at me uncertainly i could see that he was studying my expression im glad he said forcing a tightlipped smile mr mortman lowered himself onto the couch mom offered him a tray of crackers with cheese on them he took one and chewed on it delicately randy sat down on the rug i was still standing behind the armchair gripping the back of it so tightly my hands ached i had never been so nervous in all my life mr mortman seemed nervous too when dad handed him a glass of iced tea mr mortman spilled a little on his trousers its such a humid day he said this iced tea hits the spot being a librarian must be interesting work mom said taking a seat beside mr mortman on the couch dad was standing at the side of the couch they chatted for a while as they talked mr mortman kept darting glances at me randy sitting crosslegged on the floor drummed his fingers on the carpet mom and dad seemed calm and perfectly at ease mr mortman seemed a little uncomfortable he had glistening beads of perspiration on his shiny round forehead my stomach growled loudly more from nervousness than from hunger no one seemed to hear it the three adults chatted a while longer mr mortman sipped his iced tea he leaned back on the couch and smiled at my mother it was so kind of you to invite me i dont get too many homecooked meals whats for dinner he asked you are my dad told him stepping in front of the couch what mr mortman raised a hand behind his ear i didnt hear you correctly what is for dinner you are dad repeated ulllp mr mortman let out a little cry and turned bright red he struggled to raise himself from the low couch but mom and dad were too fast for him they both pounced on him their fangs popped down and they gobbled the librarian up in less than a minute bones and all randy laughed gleefully i had a big smile on my face my brother and i havent gotten our fangs yet thats why we couldnt join in well thats that mom said standing up and straightening the couch cushion then she turned to randy and me thats the first monster to come to timberland falls in nearly twenty years she told us thats why it took us so long to believe you lucy you sure gobbled him up fast i exclaimed in a few years youll get your fengs mom said me too randy declared then maybe i wont be afraid of monsters anymore mom and dad chuckled then moms expression turned serious you both understand why we had to do that dont you we cant allow any other monsters in town it would frighten the whole community and we dont want people to get frightened and chase us away we like it here dad burped loudly pardon me he said covering his mouth later that night i was upstairs in randys room he was all tucked in and i was telling him a bedtime story and so the librarian hid behind the tall bookshelf i said in a low whispery voice and when the little boy named randy reached up to pull a book down from the shelf the librarian stuck his long arms through the shelf and grabbed the boy and lucy how many times do i have to tell you i glanced up to see mom standing in the doorway a frown on her face i dont want you frightening your little brother before bedtime mom scolded youll give him nightmares now come on lucy no more monster stories
