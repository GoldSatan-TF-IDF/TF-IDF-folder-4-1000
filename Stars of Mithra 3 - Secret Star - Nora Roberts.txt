chapter contents next the woman in the portrait had a face created to steal a mans breath and haunt his dreams it was perhaps as close to perfection as nature would allow eyes of laser blue whispered of sex and smiled knowingly from beneath thick black lashes the brows were perfectly arched with a flirty little mole dotting the downward point of the left one the skin was porcelainpure with a hint of warm rose beneath just warm enough that a man could fantasize that heat was kindling only for him the nose was straight and finely sculpted the mouth and oh the mouth was hard to ignore was curved invitingly appeared pillowsoft yet strong in shape a bold red temptation that beckoned as clearly as a sirens call framing that staggering face was a rich wild tumble of ebony hair that streamed over creamy bare shoulders glossy gorgeous generous the kind of hair even a strong man would lose himself in fisting his hands in all that black silk while his mouth sank deep and deeper into those soft smiling lips grace fontaine seth thought a study in the perfection of feminine beauty it was too damn bad she was dead he turned away from the portrait annoyed that his gaze and his mind kept drifting back to it hed wanted some time alone at the crime scene after the forensic team finished after the me took possession of the body the outline remained an ugly humanshaped silhouette marring the glossy chestnut floor it was simple enough to determine how shed died a nasty tumble from the floor above right through the circling railing now splintered and sharpedged and down beautiful face first into the lakesize glass table shed lost her beauty in death he thought and that was a damn shame too it was also simple to determine that shed been given some help with that last dive it was he mused looking around a terrific house the high ceilings offered space and half a dozen generous skylights gave light rosy hopeful beams from the dying sun everything curved the stairs the doorways the windows female again he supposed the wood was glossy the glass sparkling the furniture all obviously carefully selected antiques someone was going to have a tough time getting the bloodstains out of the dovegray upholstery of the sofa he tried to imagine how it had all looked before whoever helped grace fontaine off the balcony stormed through the rooms there wouldnt have been broken statuary or ripped cushions flowers would have been meticulously arranged in vases rather than crushed into the intricate pattern of the oriental rugs there certainly wouldnt have been blood broken glass or layers of fingerprint dust shed lived well he thought but then she had been able to afford to live well shed become an heiress when she turned twentyone the privileged pampered orphan and the wild child of the fontaine empire an excellent education a countryclub darling and the headache he imagined of the conservative and staunch fontaines of fontaine department stores fame rarely had a week gone by that grace fontaine didnt warrant a mention in the society pages of the washington post or a paparazzi shot in one of the glossies and it usually hadnt been due to a good deed the press would be screaming with this latest and last adventure in the life and times of grace fontaine seth knew the moment the news leaked and they would be certain to mention all of her escapades posing nude at nineteen for a centerfold spread the steamy and very public affair with a very married english lord the dalliance with a hot heartthrob from hollywood thered been other notches in her designer belt seth remembered a united states senator a bestselling author the artist who had painted her portrait the rock star who rumor had it had attempted to take his own life when she dumped him shed packed a lot of men into a short life grace fontaine was dead at twentysix it was his job to find out not only the how but the who and the why he had a line on the why already the three stars of mithra a fortune in blue diamonds the impulsive and desperate act of a friend and greed seth frowned as he walked through the empty house cataloging the events that had brought him to this place to this point since he had a personal interest in mythology had since childhood he knew something about the three stars they were the stuff of legends and had once been grouped in a gold triangle that had been held in the hands of a statue of the god mithra one stone for love he remembered skimming through details as he climbed the curved stairs to the second level one for knowledge and the last for generosity mythologically speaking whoever possessed the stars gained the gods power and immortality which was logically a crock of course wasnt it odd though he mused that hed been dreaming lately of flashing blue stones a dark castle shrouded in mist a room of glinting gold and there was a man with eyes as pale as death he thought trying to clear the hazy details and a woman with the face of a goddess and his own violent death seth shook off the uneasy sensation that accompanied his recalling the snippets of dreams what he required now were facts basic logical facts and the fact was that three blue diamonds weighing something over a hundred carats apiece were worth six kings ransoms and someone wanted them and didnt mind killing to gain possession he had bodies piling up like cordwood he thought dragging a hand through his dark hair in order of death the first had been thomas salvini part owner of salvini gem experts who had been contracted by the smithsonian institutions to verify and assess the three stones evidence pointed to the fact that verifying and assessing hadnt been quite enough for thomas salvini or his twin timothy over a million in cash indicated that theyd had other plans and a client who wanted the stars for himself added to that was the statement from one bailey james the salvinis stepsister and eyewitness to fratricide a gemologist with an impeccable reputation she claimed to have discovered her stepbrothers plans to copy the stones sell the originals and leave the country with the profits shed gone in to see her brothers alone he thought with a shake of his head without contacting the police and shed decided to face them down after she shipped two of the stones to her two closest friends separating them to protect them he gave a short sigh at the mysterious minds of civilians well shed paid for her impulse he thought walking in on a vicious murder barely escaping with her life and with her memory of the incident and everything before it blocked for days he stepped into graces bedroom his heavy lidded goldtoned eyes cooly scanning the brutally searched room and had bailey james gone to the police even then no shed chosen a pi right out of the phone book seths mouth thinned in annoyance he had very little respect and no admiration for private investigators through blind luck shed stumbled across a fairly decent one he acknowledged cade parris wasnt as bad as most and hed managed through more blind luck seth was certain to sniff out a trail and nearly gotten himself killed in the process which brought seth to death number two timothy salvini was now as dead as his brother he couldnt blame parris overmuch for defending himself from a man with a knife but taking the second salvini out left a dead end and through the eventful fourth of july weekend bailey jamess other friend had been on the run with a bounty hunter in a rare show of outward emotion seth rubbed his eyes and leaned against the door jamb mj oleary hed be interviewing her soon personally and hed be the one telling her and bailey james that their friend grace was dead both tasks fell under his concept of duty oleary had the second star and had been underground with the skip tracer jack dakota since saturday afternoon though it was only monday evening now mj and her companion had managed to rack up a number of points including three more bodies seth reflected on the foolish and unsavory bail bondsman whod not only set dakata up with the false job of bringing in mj but also moonlighted with blackmail the hired muscle whod been after mj had likely been part of some scam of his and had killed him then theyd had some very bad luck on a rainslicked road and that left him with yet another dead end grace fontaine was likely to be third he wasnt certain what her empty house her mangled possessions would tell him he would however go through it all inch by inch and step by step that was his style he would be thorough he would be careful and he would find the answers he believed in order he believed in laws he believed unstintingly in justice seth buchanan was a thirdgeneration cop and had worked his way up the rank to lieutenant due to an inherent skill for police work an almost terrifying patience and a hardedged objectivity the men under him respected him some secretly feared him he was well aware he was often referred to as the machine and took no offense emotion temperament the grief and the guilt civilians could indulge in had no place in the job if he was considered aloof even cold and controlled he saw it as a compliment he stood a moment longer in the doorway the mahoganyframed mirror across the wide room reflecting him he was a tall wellbuilt man muscles toned to iron under a dark suit jacket hed loosened his tie because he was alone and his nightwing hair was slightly disordered by the rake of his fingers it was full and thick with a slight wave he pushed it back from an unsmiling face that boasted a square jaw and tawny skin his nose had been broken years before when he was in uniform and it edged his face toward the rugged his mouth was hard firm and rare to smile his eyes the dark gold of an old painting remained cool under straight black brows on one widepalmed hand he wore the ring that had been his fathers on either side of the heavy gold were the words serve and protect he took both duties seriously bending he picked up a pool of red silk that had been tossed on the mountain of scattered clothing heaped on the aubusson carpet the callused tips of his fingers skimmed over it the red silk gown matched the short robe the victim had been wearing he thought he wanted to think of her only as the victim not as the woman in the portrait certainly not as the woman in those new and disturbing dreams that disrupted his sleep and he was irritated that his mind kept swimming back to that stunning face the woman behind it that quality was had been he corrected part of her power that skill in drilling into a mans mind until he was obsessed with her she would have been irresistible he mused still holding the wisp of silk unforgettable dangerous had she slipped into that little swirl of silk for a man he wondered had she been expecting company a private evening of passion and where was the third star had her unexpected visitor found it taken it the safe in the library downstairs had been broken open cleaned out it seemed logical that she would have locked something that valuable away yet shed taken the fall from up here had she run had he chased her why had she let him in the house the sturdy locks on the doors hadnt been tampered with had she been careless reckless enough to open the door to a stranger while she wore nothing but a thin silk robe or had she known him perhaps shed bragged about the diamond even shown it off to him had greed taken the place of passion an argument then a fight a struggle a fall then the destruction of the house as cover it was an avenue he decided he had her thick address book downstairs and would go through it name by name just as he and the team he assigned would go through the empty house in potomac maryland inch by inch but he had people to see now tragedy to spread and details to tie up he would have to ask one of grace fontaines friends or a member of her family to come in and officially identify the body he regretted more than he wanted to that anyone who had cared for her would have to look at that ruined face he let the silk gown drop took one last look at the room with its huge bed and trampled flowers the scatter of lovely old antique bottles that gleamed like precious gems he already knew that the scent here would haunt him just as that perfect face painted beautifully in oils in the room downstairs would it was full dark when he returned it wasnt unusual for him to put long late hours into a case seth had no life to speak of outside of the job had never sought to make one the women he saw socially or romantically were carefully even calculatingly selected most tolerated the demands of his work poorly and they rarely cemented a relationship because he knew how difficult and frustrating those demands of time energy and heart were on those who waited he expected complaints sulking even accusations from the women who felt neglected so he never made promises and he lived alone he knew there was little he could do here at the scene he should have been at his desk or at least he thought have gone home just to let his mind clear but hed been pulled back to this house no to this woman he admitted it wasnt the two stories of wood and glass however lovely that dragged at him it was the face in the portrait hed left his car at the top of the sweep of the drive and walked to the house sheltered by grand old trees and welltrimmed shrubs green with summer hed let himself in turned the switch that had the foyer chandelier blazing light his men had already started the tedious doortodoor of the neighborhood hoping that someone in another of the big exquisite homes would have heard something seen anything the medical examiner was slow understandably seth reminded himself it was a holiday and the staff was down to bare minimum official reports would take a bit longer but it wasnt the reports or lack of them that nagged at his mind as he wandered back inevitably to the portrait over the glazedtile hearth grace fontaine had been loved hed underestimated the depth friendship could reach but hed seen that depth and that shocked and racking grief in the faces of the two women hed just left there had been a bond between bailey james m j oleary and grace that was as strong as hed ever seen he regretted and he rarely had regrets that hed had to tell them so bluntly im sorry for your loss words cops said to euphemize the death they lived with often violent always unexpected he had said the words as he had too often in the past and watched the fragile blonde and the cateyed redhead simply crumble clutching each other they had simply crumbled he hadnt needed the two men who had ranged themselves as the womens champions to tell him to leave them alone with their grief there would be no questions no statements no answers that night nothing he could say or do would penetrate that thick curtain of grief grace fontaine had been loved he thought again looking into those spectacular blue eyes not simply desired by men but loved by two women what was behind those eyes what was behind that face that had deserved that kind of unquestioning emotion who the hell were you he murmured and was answered by that bold inviting smile too beautiful to be real too aware of your own beauty to be soft his deep voice rough with fatigue echoed in the empty house he slipped his hands in his pockets rocked back on his heels too dead to care and though he turned from the portrait he had the uneasy feeling that it was watching him measuring him he had yet to reach her next of kin the aunt and uncle in virginia who had raised her after the death of her parents the aunt was summering in a villa in italy and was for tonight out of touch villas in italy he mused blue diamonds oil portraits over fireplaces of sapphireblue tile it was a world far removed from his firmly middleclass upbringing and from the life hed embraced through his career but he knew violence didnt play favorites he would eventually go home to his tiny little house on its postagestamp lot crowded together with dozens of other tiny little houses it would be empty as hed never found a woman who moved him to want to share even that small private space but his home would be there for him and this house for all its gleaming wood and acres of gleaming glass its sloping lawn sparkling pool and trimmed bushes hadnt protected its mistress he walked around the stark outline on the floor and started up the stairs again his mood was edgy he could admit that and the best thing to smooth it out again was work he thought perhaps a woman with as eventful a life as grace fontaine would have noted those events and her personal feelings about them in a diary he worked in silence going through her bedroom carefully knowing very well that he was trapped in that sultry scent shed left behind hed taken his tie off tucked it in his pocket the weight from his weapon snug in his shoulder harness was so much a part of him it went unnoticed he went through her drawers without a qualm though they were largely empty now as their contents were strewn around the room he searched beneath them behind them and under the mattress he thought irrelevantly that shed owned enough clothing to outfit a goodsize modeling troupe and that shed leaned toward soft materials silks cashmeres satins thin brushed wools bold colors jewel colors with a bent toward blues with those eyes he thought as they crept back into his mind why not he caught himself wondering how her voice had sounded would it have fit that sultry face been husky and low another purr of temptation for a man he imagined it that way a voice as dark and sensual as the scent that hung on the air her body had fit the face fit the scent he mused stepping into her enormous walkin closet of course shed helped nature along there and he wondered why a woman would feel impelled to add silicone to her body to lure a man and what kind of peabrained man would prefer it to an honest shape he preferred honesty in women insisted on it which he supposed was one of the reasons he lived alone he scanned the clothes still hanging with a shake of his head even the killer had run out of patience here it seemed the hangers were swept back so that garments were crowded together but he hadnt bothered to pull them all out seth judged that the number of shoes totaled well over two hundred and one wall of shelves had obviously been fashioned to hold handbags these in every imaginable shape and size and color had been pulled out of their slots ripped open and searched a cupboard had held more sweaters scarves costume jewelry he imagined shed had plenty of the real sparkles as well some would have been in the now empty safe downstairs he was sure and she might have a lockbox at a bank that he would check on first thing in the morning shed enjoyed music he mused scanning the wireless speakers hed seen speakers in every room of the house and there had been cds tapes even old albums tossed around the living area downstairs shed had eclectic taste there everything from bach to the bs had she spent many evenings alone he wondered with music playing through the house had she ever curled up in front of that classy fireplace with one of the hundreds of books that lined the walls of her library snuggled up on the couch he thought wearing that little red robe with her milliondollar legs tucked up a glass of brandy the music on low the starlight streaming through the roof windows he could see it too well he could see her look up skim that fall of hair back from that staggering face curve those tempting lips as she caught him watching her set the book aside reach out a hand in invitation give that low husky purr of a laugh as she drew him down beside her he could almost taste it because he could he swore under his breath gave himself a moment to control the sudden upbeat of his heart rate dead or alive he decided the woman was a witch and the damn stones preposterous or not only seemed to add to her power and he was wasting his time completely wasting it he told himself as he rose he was covering ground best covered through rules and routine he needed to go back light a fire under the me push for an estimated time of death he needed to start calling the numbers in the victims address book he needed to get out of this house that smelled of this woman all but breathed of her and stay out of it he determined until he was certain he could rein in his uncharacteristic imaginings annoyed with himself irked by his own deviation from strict routine he walked back through the bedroom hed just started down the curve of the stairs when a movement caught his eye his hand reached for his weapon but it was already too late for that very slowly he dropped his hand stood where he was and stared down it wasnt the automatic pointed at his heart that stunned him motionless it was the fact that it was held steady as a rock in the hand of a dead woman well the dead woman said stepping forward into the halo of light from the foyer chandelier youre certainly a messy thief and a stupid one those shockingly blue eyes stared up at him why dont you give me one good reason why i shouldnt put a hole in your head before i call the police for a ghost she met his earlier fantasy perfectly the voice was a purr hot and husky and stunningly alive and for the recently departed she had a very warm flush of temper in her cheeks it wasnt often that seths mind clicked off but it had he saw a woman runwayfresh in white silk the glint of jewels at her ears and a shiny silver gun in her hand he pulled himself back roughly though none of the shock or the effort showed as he met her demand with an unsmiling response i am the police her lips curved a generous bow of sarcasm of course you are handsome who else would be creeping around a locked house when no ones at home but an overworked cop on his beat i havent been a beat cop for quite some time im buchanan lieutenant seth buchanan if youd aim your weapon just a little to the left of my heart ill show you my badge id just love to see it watching him she slowly shifted the barrel of the gun her heart was thudding like a jackhammer with a combination of fear and anger but she took another casual step forward as he reached two fingers into his pocket the badge looked real enough she mused what she could see of the identification with the gold shield on the flap that he held up and she began to get a very bad feeling a worse sinking in the stomach sensation than shed experienced when she pulled up to the drive saw the strange car and the lights blazing inside her empty house she flicked her eyes from the badge up to his again damned if he didnt look more like a cop than a crook she decided very attractive in a straightedged buttoneddown sort of fashion the solid body broad of shoulder and narrow of hip appeared ruthlessly disciplined eyes like that cool and clear and golden brown that seemed to see everything at once belonged to either a cop or a criminal either way she imagined they belonged to a dangerous sort of man dangerous men usually appealed to her but at the moment as she took in the oddity of the situation her mood wasnt receptive all right buchanan lieutenant seth why dont you tell me what youre doing in my house she thought of what she carried in her purse what bailey had sent her only days before and felt that unsettling sensation in her stomach deepen what kind of trouble are we in she wondered and just how do i slide out of it with a cop staring me down have you got a search warrant to go along with that badge she demanded no i dont hed have felt better considerably better if shed put the gun down altogether but she seemed content to hold it aiming it lower now no less steadily but lower still his composure had snapped back keeping his eyes on hers he came down the rest of the stairs and stood in the lofty foyer facing her youre grace fontaine she watched him tuck his badge back into his pocket while those unreadable cops eyes skimmed over her face memorizing features she thought irritated making mental note of any distinguishing marks just what the hell was going on yes im grace fontaine this is my property my home and as youre in it without a proper warrant youre trespassing as calling a cop seems superfluous maybe ill just call my lawyer he angled his head and unwillingly caught a whiff of that sirens scent of hers perhaps it was that and feeling its instant and unwelcome effect on his system that had him speaking without thought well ms fontaine you look damn good for a dead woman chapter contents prev next her response was to narrow her eyes arch a brow if thats some sort of cop humor im afraid youll have to translate it annoyed him that shed jarred the remark out of him it wasnt professional cautious he brought a hand up slowly tipped the barrel of the gun farther to the left do you mind he said then quickly before she could agree he twisted it neatly out of her hand pulled out the clip it wasnt the time to ask if she had a license to carry so he merely handed her back the empty gun and pocketed the clip its best to keep both hands on your weapon he said easily and with such sobriety that she suspected amusement lurked beneath and if you want to keep it not to get within reach thanks so much for the lesson in selfdefense obviously irritated she opened her bag and dumped the gun inside but you still havent answered my initial question lieutenant why are you in my house youve had an incident ms fontaine an incident more copspeak she blew out a breath was there a breakin she asked and for the first time took her attention off the man and glanced past him into the foyer a robbery she added then caught sight of an overturned chair and some smashed crockery through the archway in the living area swearing she started to push past him he curled a hand over her arm to stop her ms fontaine get your hand off me she snapped interrupting him this is my home he kept his grip firm im aware of that exactly when was the last time you were in it ill give you a damn statement after ive seen whats missing she managed another two steps and saw from the disorder in the living area that it hadnt been a neat or organized robbery well they did quite a job didnt they my cleaning service is going to be very unhappy she glanced down to where seths fingers were still curled around her arm are you testing my biceps lieutenant i do like to think theyre firm your muscle tones fine from what he could see of her in the filmy ivory slacks it appeared more than fine id like you to answer my question ms fontaine when were you home last here she sighed shrugged one elegant shoulder her mind was flitting around the annoying details that were the backwash of a robbery calling her insurance agent filing a claim giving statements wednesday afternoon i went out of town for a few days she was more shaken than she cared to admit that her house had been robbed and ransacked in her absence her things touched and taken by strangers but she slid him a smiling glance from under her lashes arent you going to take notes as a matter of fact i am shortly who was staying in the house in your absence no one i dont care to have people in my home when im away now if youll excuse me she gave her arm a quick hard jerk and strode through the foyer and under the arch good god the anger came first quick and intense she wanted to kick something no matter that it was broken and ruined already did they have to break what they didnt cart out she muttered she glanced up saw the splintered railing and swore again and what the devil did they do up there a lot of good an alarm system does if anyone can just she stopped her forward motion her voice trailing off as she saw the outline on the gleaming chestnut wood of the floor as she stared at it unable to tear her eyes away the blood drained out of her face leaving it painfully cold and stiff placing one hand on the back of the stained sofa for balance she stared down at the outline the diamond glitter of broken glass that had been her coffee table and the blood that had dried to a dark pool why dont we go into the dining room he said quietly she jerked her shoulders back though he hadnt touched her the pit of her stomach was cased in ice and the flashes of heat that lanced through her did nothing to melt it who was killed she demanded who died here up until a few minutes ago it was assumed you did she closed her eyes vaguely concerned that her vision was dimming at the edges excuse me she said quite clearly and walked across the room on numb legs she picked up a bottle of brandy that lay on its side on the floor fumbled open a display cabinet for a glass and poured generously she took the first drink as medicine he could see that in the way she tossed it back shuddered twice hard it didnt bring the color back to her face but he imagined it had shocked her system into functioning again ms fontaine i think it would be better if we talked about this in another room im all right but her voice was raw she drank again before turning to him why did you think it was me the victim was in your house dressed in a robe she met your general description her face had beendamaged by the fall she was your approximate height and weight your age your coloring her coloring grace thought on a wave of staggering relief not bailey or mj then i had no houseguest while i was gone she took a deep breath knowing the calm was there if only she could reach it i have no idea who the woman was unless it was one of the burglars how did she grace look up again at the broken railing the viciously sharp edges of wood she must have been pushed that has yet to be determined im sure it has i cant help you as to who she was lieutenant as i dont have a twin i can only she broke off her color draining a second time now her free hand fisted and pressed hard to her stomach oh no oh god he understood didnt hesitate who was she i it could have been shes stayed here before while i was away thats why i stopped leaving a spare key outside she might have had it copied though shed think nothing of that turning her gaze away from the outline she walked back through the debris sat on the arm of the sofa a cousin grace sipped brandy again slowly letting it ease warmth back into her system melissa bennington no i think she took the fontaine back a few months ago after the divorce im not sure she pushed a hand through her hair i wasnt interested enough to be sure of a detail like that she resembles you she offered a weak humorless smile its melissas mission to be me i went from finding it mildly flattering to mildly annoying in the last few years i found it pathetic theres a surface resemblance i suppose shes augmented it she let her hair grow dyed it my color there was some difference in build but she augmented that as well she shops the same stores uses the same salons chooses the same men we grew up together more or less she always felt i got the better deal on all manner of levels she made herself look back look down and felt a wash of grief and pity apparently i did this time around if someone didnt know you well could they mistake you a passing glance i suppose maybe a casual acquaintance no one who she broke off again got to her feet you think someone killed her believing her to be me mistaking her for me as you did thats absurd it was a breakin a burglary a terrible accident its possible he had indeed taken out his book to note down her cousins name now he glanced up met her eyes its also more than possible that someone came here mistook her for you and assumed she had the third star she was good he decided there was barely a flicker in her eyes before she lied i have no idea what youre talking about yes you do and if you havent been home since wednesday you still have it he glanced down at the bag she continued to hold i dont generally carry stars in my purse she sent him a smile that was shaky around the edges but its a lovely almost poetic thought now im very tired ms fontaine his voice was clipped and cool this victim is the sixth body ive dealt with today that traces back to those three blue diamonds her hand shot out gripped his arm mj and bailey your friends are fine he felt her grip go limp theyve had an eventful holiday weekend all of which could have been avoided if theyd contacted and cooperated with the police and its cooperation ill have from you now one way or the other she tossed her hair back where are they what did you do toss them in a cell my lawyer will have them out and your butt in a sling before you can finish reciting the miranda she started toward the phone saw it wasnt on the queen anne table no theyre not in a cell it goaded him the way she snapped into gear ready to buck the rules i imagine theyre planning your funeral right about now planning my her fabulous eyes went huge with distress oh my god you told them i was dead they think im dead where are they wheres the damn phone i have to call them she crouched to push through the rubble shoving at him when he took her arm again theyre not home either of them you said they werent in jail and theyre not he could see hed get nothing out of her until shed satisfied herself ill take you to them then were going to sort this out ms fontaine i promise you grace didnt speak as he drove her toward the tidy suburbs edging dc hed assured her that bailey and mj were fine and her instincts told her that lieutenant seth buchanan was saying nothing but the truth facts were his business after all she thought but she still gripped her hands together until her knuckles ached she had to see them touch them guilt was already weighing on her guilt that they should be grieving for her when shed spent the past few days indulging her need to be alone to be away to be somewhere else what had happened to them over the long weekend had they tried to contact her while she was out of reach it was painfully obvious that the three blue diamonds bailey had been assessing for the museum were at the bottom of it all as the afterimage of that stark outline on the chestnut floor flashed into her head grace shuddered once again melissa poor pathetic melissa but she couldnt think of that now she couldnt think of anything but her friends theyre not hurt she managed to ask no seth left it at that drove through the wash of streetlights and headlights her scent was sliding silkily through his car teasing his senses deliberately he opened his window and let the light damp breeze chase it away where have you been the last few days ms fontaine away weary she laid her head back shut her eyes its one of my favorite spots she jerked upright again when he turned down a treelined street then swung into the drive of a brick house she saw a shiny jaguar then an impossibly decrepit boat of a car but no spiffy mg no practical little compact their cars arent here she began tossing him a look of distrust and accusation but they are she climbed out and ignoring him hurried toward the front door her knock was brisk businesslike but her fist trembled the door opened and a man shed never seen before stared down at her his cool green eyes flickered with shock then slowly warmed his flash of a smile was blinding then he reached out laid a hand gently on her cheek youre grace yes i its absolutely wonderful to see you he gathered her into his arms one of which was freshly bandaged with such easy affection that she didnt have time to register surprise im cade he murmured his gaze meeting seths over graces head cade parris come on in bailey mj just in here theyll be fine as soon as they see you he took her arm felt the quick hard tremors in it but in the doorway of the living room she stopped laid a hand over his arm inside bailey and mj stood facing away hands linked their voices were low with tears wrenching through them a man stood a short distance away his hands thrust in his pockets and a look of helplessness on his bruised and battered face when he saw her his eyes the gray of storm clouds narrowed flashed then smiled grace took one shuddering breath exhaled it slowly well she said in a clear steady voice its gratifying to know someone would weep copiously over me both women whirled for a moment all three stared three pair of eyes brimming over to seths mind they all moved as once as a unit so that their leaping rush across the room to each other held an uncanny and undeniably feminine grace then they were fused together voices and tears mixing a triangle he thought frowning with three points that made a whole like the golden triangle that held three priceless and powerful stones i think they could use a little time cade said quietly and gestured to the other man lieutenant he motioned down the hall lifting his brows when seth hesitated i dont think theyre going anywhere just now with a barely perceptible shrug seth stepped back he could give them twenty minutes i need your phone theres one in the kitchen want a beer jack the third man grinned youre playing my song amnesia grace said a little time later she and bailey were huddled together on the sofa with mj sitting on the floor at their feet everything just blanked everything bailey kept her hold on graces hand tight afraid to break the link i woke up in this horrible little hotel room with no memory over a million in cash and the diamond i picked cades name out of the phone book parris she smiled a little funny isnt it im going to get you to france yet grace promised he helped me through everything the warmth in her tone had grace sharing a quick look with mj this was something to be discussed in detail later i started to remember piece by piece you and mj just flashes i could see your faces even hear your voices but nothing fit hes the one who narrowed it down to salvinis and when he took me there he broke in shortly before we did mj added jack could tell the rear locks had been picked we got inside bailey continued and her tearravaged eyes went glassy and i remembered i remembered it all then how thomas and timothy were planning to steal the stones copy them how id shipped one off to each of you to keep it from happening stupid so stupid no it wasnt grace slid an arm around baileys shoulders it makes perfect sense to me you didnt have time for anything else i should have called the police but i was so sure i could turn things around i was going into thomass office to have a showdown tell them it was over and i saw she trembled again the fight horrible the lightning flashing through the windows their faces then timothy grabbed the letter opener the knife the power went out but the lightning kept flashing and i could see what he was doing to thomas all the blood dont mj murmured rubbing a comforting hand on baileys knee dont go back there no bailey shook her head i have to he saw me grace he would have killed me he came after me i had grabbed the bag with their deposit money and i ran through the dark and i hid down under the stairs in this little cave under the stairs but i could see him hunting for me blood all over his hands i still dont remember how i got out got to that room grace couldnt bear to imagine it her quiet seriousminded friend pursued by a murderer the important thing is that you did get away and youre safe grace looked down at mj we all are she tried a bolstering grin and how did you spend your holiday on the run with a bounty hunter handcuffed to a bed in a cheap motel being shot at by a couple of creeps with a little detour up to your place in the mountains bounty hunter grace thought trying to keep pace the man named jack she supposed with the bronzetipped ponytail and the stormy gray eyes and the killer grin handcuffs cheap motels and shootings pressing fingertips to her eyes she latched on to the least disturbing detail you were at my place when its a long story mj gave a quick version of a handful of days from her first encounter with jack when hed tried to take her in believing her to be a bail jumper to the two of them escaping that setup and working their way back to the core of the puzzle we know someones pulling the strings mj concluded but we havent gotten very far on figuring that out yet the bail bondsmancumblackmailer who gave jack the fake paperwork on me is dead the two guys who came after us are dead the salvinis are dead and melissa grace murmured it was melissa bailey turned to grace in your house it must have been when i got home the cop was there the place was torn up and theyd assumed it was me it took a moment a carefully indrawn breath a steady exhale before she could finish shed fallen off the balcony or been pushed i was miles away when it happened where did you go mj asked her when jack and i got to your country place it was locked up tight i thought was sure youd just been there i could smell you i left late yesterday morning got an itch to be near the water so i drove down the eastern shore found a little bandb i did some antiquing rubbed elbows with tourists watched a fireworks display i didnt leave until late today i nearly stayed over another night but i called both of you from the bandb and got your machines i started feeling uncomfortable about being out of contact so i headed home she shut her eyes a moment bailey i hadnt been really thinking just before i left for the country we lost one of the children oh grace im sorry it happens all the time theyre bom with aids or a crack addiction or a hole in the heart some of them die but i cant get used to it and it was on my mind so i wasnt really thinking when i started back i started to think and i started to worry then the cop was there in my house he asked about the stone i didnt know what you wanted me to tell him weve told the police everything now bailey sighed neither cade nor jack seem to like this buchanan very much but they respect his abilities the two stones are safe now as we are im sorry for what you went through both of you im sorry i wasnt here it wouldnt have made any difference mj declared we were scattered all over one stone apiece maybe we were meant to be now were together grace took each of their hands in hers what happens next ladies seth stepped into the room skimmed his cool gaze over them then focused on grace ms fontaine the diamond she rose picked up the purse shed tossed carelessly on the end of the couch opening it she took out a velvet pouch slid the stone out into her palm magnificent isnt it she murmured studying the flash of bold blue light diamonds are supposed to be cold to the touch arent they bailey yet this has heat she lifted her eyes to seths as she crossed to him still how many lives is it worth she held her open palm out when his fingers closed around the stone she felt the jolt his fingers on her skin the shimmering blue diamond between their hands something clicked almost audibly she wondered if hed felt it heard it why else did those enigmatic eyes narrow or his hand linger the breath caught in her throat impressive isnt it she managed then felt the odd wave of emotion and recognition ebb when he took the stone from her hand he didnt care for the shock that had run up his arm and he spoke bitingly i imagine this ones out of even your price range ms fontaine she merely smiled no she told herself he couldnt have felt anything and neither had she just imagination and stress i prefer to decorate my body in something less obvious bailey rose the stars are my responsibility unless and until the smithsonian indicates otherwise she looked over at cade who remained in the doorway well put them in the safe all of them and ill speak with dr linstrum in the morning seth turned the stone over in his hand he imagined he could confiscate it and its mates they were after all evidence in several homicides but he didnt relish driving back to the station with a large fortune in his car parris was an irritant he reflected but he was an honest one and technically the stones were in bailey jamess keeping until the smithsonian relieved her of them he wondered just what the powers at the museum would have to say about the recent travels of the three stars but that wasnt his problem lock it up he said passing the stone off to cade and ill be talking with dr linstrum in the morning as well ms james cade took one quick threatening step forward look buchanan no quietly bailey stepped between them a cool breeze between two building storms lieutenant buchanans right cade its his business now that doesnt stop it from being mine he gave seth one last warning look watch your step he said then walked away with the stone thank you for bringing grace by so quickly lieutenant seth looked down at the extended and obviously dismissing hand bailey offered him heres your hat he thought whats your hurry im sorry you were disturbed ms james his gaze flicked over to mj ms oleary youll keep available were not going anywhere mjs chin angled a cocky gesture as jack crossed to her drive carefully lieutenant he acknowledged the second dismissal with a slight nod ms fontaine ill drive you back shes not leaving mj jumped in front of grace like a tiger defending her cub shes not going back to that house tonight shes staying here with us you may not care to go back home ms fontaine seth said coolly you may find it more comfortable to answer questions in my office you cant be serious he cut baileys protest off with a look i have a body in the morgue i take it very seriously youre a class act buchanan jack drawled but the sound was low and threatening why dont you and i go in the other room and talk about our options its all right grace stepped forward working up a believable smile its jack isnt it thats right he took his attention from buchanan long enough to smile at her jack dakota pleased to meet you miss april oh my misspent youth survives with a little laugh she kissed his bruised cheek i appreciate the offer to beat up the lieutenant for me jack but you look like youve already gone several rounds grinning now he stroked a thumb over his bruised jaw ive got a few more rounds in me i dont doubt it but sad to say the cops right she pushed her hair to her back and turned that smile several degrees cooler now on seth tactless but right he needs some answers i need to go back youre not going back to your house alone bailey insisted not tonight grace ill be fine but if its all right with your cade ill deal with this pick up a few things and come back she glanced over at cade as he came back into the room got a spare bed darling you bet why dont i go with you help you pick up your things and bring you back you stay here with bailey she kissed him as well a casual and already affectionate brush of lips im sure lieutenant buchanan and i will manage she picked up her purse turned and embraced both mj and bailey again dont worry about me after all im in the arms of the law she eased back shot seth one of those full candlepower smiles isnt that right lieutenant in a manner of speaking he stepped back and waited for her to walk to the door ahead of him she waited until they were in his car and pulling out of the drive i need to see the body she didnt look at him but lifted a hand to the four people crowded at the front door watching them drive away you need shell have to be identified wont she it surprised him that shed take the duty on yes then lets get it over with after afterwards ill answer your questions id prefer we handle that in your office she added using that smile again my house isnt ready for company fine shed known it would be hard shed known it would be horrible grace had prepared herself for it or shed thought she had nothing she realized as she stared down at what remained of the woman in the morgue could have prepared her it was hardly surprising that theyd mistaken melissa for her the face melissa had been so proud of was utterly ruined death had been cruel here and through her involvement with the hospital grace had reason to know it often was its melissa her voice echoed flatly in the chilly white room my cousin melissa fontaine youre sure yes we shared the same health club among other things i know her body as well as i know mine she has a sickleshaped birthmark at the small of her back just left of center and theres a scar on the bottom of her left foot small crescentshaped in the ball of her foot where she stepped on a broken shell in the hamptons when we were twelve seth shifted found the scar then nodded to the mes assistant im sorry for your loss yes im sure you are with muscles that felt like glass she turned her dimming vision passing over him excuse me she made it nearly to the door before she swayed swearing under his breath seth caught her pulled her out into the corridor and put her in a chair with one hand he shoved her head between her knees im not going to faint she squeezed her eyes tightly shut battling fiercely against the twin foes of dizziness and nausea could have fooled me im much too sophisticated for something as maudlin as a swoon but her voice broke her shoulders sagged and for a moment she kept her head down oh god shes dead and all because she hated me what doesnt matter shes dead bracing herself she sat up again let her head rest against the cold white wall her cheeks were just as colorless i have to call my aunt her mother i have to tell her what happened he gauged his woman studying the face that was no less staggeringly lovely for being bonewhite give me the name ill take care of it its helen wilson fontaine ill do it he didnt realize until her hand moved that hed placed his own over it he pulled back on every level and rose i havent been able to reach helen fontaine or her husband shes in europe i know where she is grace shook back her hair but didnt try to stand not yet i can find her the thought of making that call saying what had to be said squeezed her throat could i have some water lieutenant his heels echoed on tile as he strode off then there was silence a full damning silence that whispered of what kind of business was done in such places there were scents here that slid slyly under the potent odors of antiseptics and industrial cleaning solutions she was pitifully grateful when she heard his footsteps on the return journey she took the paper cup from him with both hands drinking slowly concentrating on the simple act of swallowing liquid why did she hate you what your cousin you said she hated you why family trait she said briefly she handed him back the empty cup as she rose id like to go now he took her measure a second time her color had yet to return her pupils were dilated the electricblue irises were glassy he doubted shed last another hour ill take you back to parriss he decided you can get your things in the morning come in to my office to make your statement i said id do it tonight and i say youll do it in the morning youre no good to me now she tried a weak laugh why lieutenant i believe youre the first man whos ever said that to me im crushed dont waste the routine on me he took her arm led her to the outside doors you havent got the energy for it he was exactly right she pulled her arm free as they stepped back into the thick night air i dont like you you dont have to he opened the car door waited any more than i have to like you she stepped to the door and with it between them met his eyes but the difference is if i had the energy or the inclination i could make you sit up and beg she got in sliding those long silky legs in not likely seth told himself as he shut the door with a snap but he wasnt entirely sure he believed it chapter contents prev next she felt like a weakling but she didnt go home shed needed friends not that empty house with the shadow of a body drawn on the floor jack had gone over fetched her bags out of her car and brought them to her for a day at least she was content to make do with that since she was driving in to meet with seth grace had made do carefully shed dressed in a summer suit shed just picked up on the shore the little short skirt and waistlength jacket in buttercup yellow werent precisely professional but she wasnt aiming for professional shed taken the time to catch her waterfall of hair back in a complicated french braid and made up her face with the concentration and determination of a general plotting a decisive battle meeting with seth again felt like battle her stomach was still raw from the call shed made to her aunt and the sickness that had overwhelmed her after it shed slept poorly but she had slept tucked into one of cades guest rooms secure that those who meant most to her were close by she would deal with the relatives later she thought easing her convertible into the lot at the station house it would be hard but she would deal with them for now she had to deal with herself and seth buchanan if anyone had been watching as she stepped from her car and started across the lot he would have seen a transformation subtly gradually her eyes went from weary to sultry her gait loosened eased into a lazy hipswinging walk designed to cross a mans eyes her mouth turned up slightly at the corners into a secret knowing female smile it wasnt really a mask but another part of her innate and habitual it was an image she could draw on at will she willed it now flashing a slow underthelashes smile at the uniform who stepped to the door as she did he flushed moved back and nearly hobbled the door in his hurry to open it for her why thank you officer heat rose up his neck into his face and made her smile widen she was right on target seth buchanan wouldnt see a pale trembling woman this morning hed see grace fontaine just hitting her stride she sauntered up to the sergeant on duty at the desk skimmed a fingertip along the edge excuse me yes maam his adams apple bobbed three times as he swallowed i wonder if you could help me im looking for a lieutenant buchanan are you in charge she skimmed her gaze over him you must be in charge commander ah yes no its sergeant he fumbled for the signin book the passes i hes youll find the lieutenant upstairs detective division to the left of the stairs oh she took the pen he offered and signed her name boldly thank you commander i mean sergeant she heard his little expulsion of breath as she turned and felt his gaze on her legs as she climbed the stairs she found the detective division easily enough one sweeping glance took in the fronttofront desks some manned some not the cops were in shirtsleeves in an oppressive heat that was barely touched by what had to be a faulty airconditioning unit a lot of guns she thought a lot of halfeaten meals and empty cups of coffee phones shrilling she picked her mark a man with a loosened tie feet on the desk a report of some kind in one hand and a danish in the other as she started through the crowded room several conversations stopped someone whistled softly it was like a sigh the man at the desk swept his feet to the floor swallowed danish maam about thirty she judged though his hairline was receding rapidly he wiped his crumbdusted fingers on his shirt rolled his eyes slightly to the left where one of his associates was grinning and pounding a fist to his heart i hope you can help me she kept her eyes on his and only his until a muscle began to twitch in his jaw detective yeah ah carter detective carter what can i do for you i hope im in the right place for effect she turned her head swept her gaze over the room and its occupants several stomachs were ruthlessly sucked in im looking for lieutenant buchanan i think hes expecting me gracefully she brushed a loose flutter of hair away from her face im afraid i just dont know the proper procedure hes in his office back in his office without taking his eyes from her he jerked a thumb belinski tell the lieutenant he has a visitor a miss its grace she slid a hip onto the corner of the desk letting her skirt hike up a dangerous inch grace fontaine is it all right if i wait here detective carter am i interrupting your work yes no sure its so exciting she brought the temperature of the overheated room up ten more degrees with a dazzling smile detective work you must have so many interesting stories by the time seth had finished the phone call he was on when he was notified of graces arrival shrugged back into the jacket hed removed as a concession to the heat and made his way into the bull pen carters desk was completely surrounded he heard a low throaty female laugh rise out of the center of the crowd and saw a half a dozen of his best men panting like puppies over a meaty bone the woman he decided was going to be an enormous headache i see all cases have been closed this morning and miraculously crime has come to a halt his voice had the desired effect several men jerked straight those less easily intimidated grinned as they skulked back to their desks deserted carter flushed from his neck to his receding sandy hairline ah grace that is miss fontaine to see you lieutenant sir so i see you finish that report detective working on it carter grabbed the papers hed tossed aside and buried his nose in them ms fontaine seth arched a brow gestured toward his office it was nice meeting you michael grace trailed a finger over carters shoulder as she passed hed feel the heat of that skimming touch for hours you can cut the power back now seth said dryly as he opened the door to his office you wont need it you never know do you she sauntered in moving past him close enough for them to brush bodies she thought she felt him stiffen just a little but his eyes remained level cool and apparently unimpressed miffed she studied his office the institutional beige of the walls blended depressingly into the dingy beige of the aging linoleum floor an overburdened departmentissue desk gray file cabinets computer phone and one small window didnt add any spark to the nononsense room so this is where the mighty rule she murmured it disappointed her that she found no personal touches no photos no sports trophies nothing she could hold on to no sign of the man behind the badge as she had in the bull pen she eased a hip onto the corner of his desk to say she resembled a sunbeam would have been a cliche and it would have been incorrect seth decided sunbeams were tame warm welcoming she was an explosive bolt of heat lightning hot fatal a blind man would have noticed those satiny legs in the snug yellow skirt seth merely walked around sat looked at her face youd be more comfortable in a chair im fine here idly she picked up a pen twirled it i dont suppose this is where you interrogate suspects no we have a dungeon downstairs for that under other circumstances she would have appreciated his dustdry tone am i a suspect ill let you know he angled his head you recover quickly ms fontaine yes i do you had questions lieutenant yes i do sit down in a chair her lips moved in what was nearly a pout a luscious comeonandkissme pout he felt the quick helpless pull of lust and damned her for it she moved sliding off the desk settling into a chair taking her time crossing those killer legs better where were you saturday between the hours of midnight and am so that was when it had happened she thought and ignored the ache in her stomach arent you going to read me my rights youre not charged you dont need a lawyer its a simple question i was in the country i have a house in western maryland i was alone i dont have an alibi do i need a lawyer now do you want to complicate this ms fontaine theres no way to simplify it is there but she flicked a hand in dismissal the thin diamond bracelet that circled her wrist shot fire all right lieutenant as uncomplicated as possible i dont want my lawyer for the moment why dont i just give you a basic rundown i left for the country on wednesday i wasnt expecting my cousin or anyone for that matter i did have contact with a few people over the weekend i bought a few supplies in the town nearby shopped at the gardening stand that would have been friday afternoon i picked up some mail on saturday its a small town the postmistress would remember that was before noon however which would give me plenty of time to drive back and of course there was the courier who delivered baileys package on friday and you didnt find that odd your friend sends you a blue diamond and you just shrug it off and go shopping i called her she wasnt in she arched a brow but you probably know that i did find it odd but i had things on my mind such as her lips curved but the smile wasnt reflected in her eyes im not required to tell you my thoughts i did wonder about it and worried a little i thought perhaps it was a copy but i didnt really believe that a copy couldnt have what that stone has baileys instructions in the package were to keep it with me until she contacted me so thats what i did no questions i rarely question people i trust he tapped a pencil on the edge of the desk you stayed alone in the country until monday when you drove back to the city no i drove down to the eastern shore on sunday i had a whim she smiled again i often do i stayed at a bedandbreakfast you didnt like your cousin no i didnt she imagined that quick shift of topic was an interrogation technique she was difficult to like and i rarely make the effort with difficult people we were raised together after my parents were killed but we werent close i intruded into her life into her space she compensated for it by being disagreeable i was often disagreeable in return as we got older she had a less successful talent with men than i apparently she thought by enhancing the similarities in our appearance shed have better success and did she i suppose it depends on your point of view melissa enjoyed men to combat the guilt coating her heart grace leaned back negligently in the chair she certainly enjoyed men which is one of the reasons she was recently divorced she preferred the species in quantity and how did her husband feel about that bobbies a she trailed off then relieved a great deal of her own tension with a quick delighted and very appealing laugh if youre suggesting that bobbie her ex tracked her down to my house murdered her trashed the place and walked off whistling you couldnt be more wrong hes a cream puff and he is i believe in england even as we speak he enjoys tennis and never misses wimbledon you can check easily enough which he would seth thought noting it down some people find murder distasteful on a personal level but not at a distance they just pay for a service this time she sighed we both know melissa wasnt the target lieutenant i was she was in my house restless she rose a graceful and feline movement walking to the tiny window she looked out on his dismal view shes made herself at home in my potomac house twice before when i was away the first time i tolerated it the second she enjoyed the facilities a bit too enthusiastically for my taste we had a spat about it she left in a huff and i removed the spare key i should have thought to change the locks but it never occurred to me shed go to the trouble of having copies made when was the last time you saw her or spoke with her grace sighed dates ran through her head people events meaningless social forays about six weeks ago maybe eight at the health club we ran into each other in the steam room didnt have much conversation we never had much to say to each other she was regretting that now seth realized going over in her head opportunities lost or wasted and it would do no good would she have opened the door to someone she didnt know if the someone was male and was marginally attractive yes weary of the interview she turned back look i dont know what else i can tell you what help i can possibly be she was a careless often arrogant woman she picked up strange men in bars when she felt the urge she let someone in that night and she died for it whatever she was she didnt deserve to die for that she brushed at her hair absently tried to clear her mind as seth simply sat waiting maybe he demanded she give him the stone she wouldnt have understood she paid for her trespassing for her carelessness and her ignorance and the stone is back with bailey where it belongs if you havent spoken to dr linstrum yet this morning i can tell you that bailey should be meeting with him right now i dont know anything else to tell you he kicked back for a moment his eyes cool and steady on her face if he discounted the connection with the diamonds it could play another way two women at odds all their lives one of them returns home unexpectedly to find the other in her home an argument escalating into a fight and one of them ends up taking a dive off a secondfloor balcony into a pool of glass the first woman doesnt panic she trashes her own home to cover herself then drives away puts distance between herself and the scene was she a skilled enough actress to fake that stark shock the raw emotion hed seen on her face the night before he thought she was but despite that the scene just didnt click there was the undeniable connection of the diamonds and he was dead sure that if grace fontaine had caused her cousins fall she would have been just as capable of picking up the phone and coolly reporting an accident all right thats all for now well her breath was a huff of relief that wasnt so bad all in all he stood up ill have to ask you to stay available she switched on the charm again a hot rosecolored light im always available handsome ask anyone she picked up her purse moved with him to the doorhow long before i can have my house dealt with id like to put things back to order as quickly as possible ill let you know he glanced at his watch when youre up to going through things and doing an inventory to see whats missing id like you to contact me im on my way over now to do just that his brow furrowed a moment as he juggled responsibilities he could assign a man to go with her but he preferred dealing with it himself ill follow you over police protection if necessary im touched why dont i give you a lift handsome ill follow you over he repeated suit yourself she began and grazed a hand over his cheek her eyes widened slightly as his fingers clamped on her wrist dont like to be petted she purred the words surprised at how her heart had jumped and started to race most animals do his face was very close to hers their bodies were just touching with the heat from the room and something even more sweltering between them something old and almost familiar he drew her hand down slowly kept his fingers on her wrist be careful what buttons you push excitement she realized with surprise it was pure primal excitement that zipped through her wasted advice she said silkily daring him i enjoy pushing new ones and apparently you have a few interesting buttons just begging for attention she skimmed her gaze deliberately down to his mouth just begging he could imagine himself shoving her back against the door moving fast into that heat feeling her go molten because he was certain she was aware of just how perfectly a man would imagine it he stepped back released her and opened the door to the din of the bull pen be sure to turn in your visitors badge at the desk he said he was a cool one grace thought as she drove an attractive successful unmarried shed slipped that bit of data out of an unsuspecting detective carter and selfcontained man a challenge and she decided as she passed through the quiet welldesigned neighborhood toward her home a challenge was exactly what she needed to get through the emotional upheaval shed have to face her aunt in a few hours and the rest of the relatives soon after there would be questions demands and she knew blame she would be the recipient of all of it that was the way her family worked and that was what shed come to expect from them ask grace take from grace point the finger at grace she wondered how much of that she deserved and how much had simply been inherited along with the money her parents left her it hardly mattered she thought since both were hers like it or not she swung into her drive her gaze sweeping over and up the house was something shed wanted the clever and unique design of wood and glass the gables the cornices the decks and the ruthlessly groomed grounds shed wanted the space the elegance that lent itself to entertaining the convenience to the city the proximity to bailey and mj but the little house in the mountains was something shed needed and that was hers and hers alone the relatives didnt know it existed no one could find her there unless she wanted to be found but here she thought as she set the brakes was the neat expensive home of one grace fontaine heiress socialite and party girl the former centerfold the radcliffe graduate the washington hostess could she continue to live here she wondered with death haunting the rooms time would tell for now she was going to concentrate on solving the puzzle of seth buchanan and finding a way under that seemingly impenetrable armor of his just for the fun of it she heard him pull in and in a deliberately provocative move turned tipped down her shaded glasses and studied him over the tops oh yes she thought he was very very attractive the way he controlled that lean and muscled body very economical no wasted movements he wouldnt waste them in bed either and she wondered just how long it would be before she could lure him there she had a hunch and she rarely doubted her hunches where men were concerned that there was a volcano bubbling under that calm and somewhat austere surface she was going to enjoy poking at it until it erupted as he crossed to her she handed him her keys oh but you have your own now dont you she tipped her glasses back into place well use mine this time who else has a set she skimmed the tip of her tongue over her top lip darkly pleased when she saw his gaze jerk down just for an instant but it was progress bailey and mj i dont give my keys to men id rather open the door for them myself or close it fine he dumped the keys back in her hand looking amused when her brows drew together open the door one step forward two steps back she mused then stepped up on the flagstone portico and unlocked her home shed braced for it but it was still difficult the foyer was as it had been largely undisturbed but her gaze was drawn up now helplessly to the shattered railing its a long way to fall she murmured i wonder if you have time to think to understand on the way down she wouldnt have no and that was better somehow i suppose not she stepped into the living area forced herself to look at the chalk outline well where to begin he got to your safe down here emptied it youll want to list what was taken out the library safe she moved through under an arch and into a wide room filled with light and books a great many of those books littered the floor now and an art deco lamp in the shape of an elongated womans body a small thing shed loved was cracked in two he wasnt subtle was he i say he was rushed and pissed off youd know best she walked to the safe noting the open door and the empty interior i had some jewelry quite a bit actually a few thousand in cash bonds stock certificates no theyre in my safedeposit box at the bank one doesnt need to take out stock certificates and enjoy the way they sparkle i bought a terrific pair of diamond earrings just last month she sighed shrugged gone now i have a complete list of my jewelry and photographs of each piece along with the insurance papers in my safety box replacing thems just a matter of she broke off made a small distressed sound and rushed from the room the woman could move when she wanted seth thought as he headed upstairs after her and she didnt lose any of that feline grace with speed he turned into her bedroom then into her walkin closet behind her he wouldnt have found it he couldnt have found it she repeated the words like a prayer as she twisted a knob on the builtin cabinet it swung out revealing a safe in the wall behind quickly her fingers not quite steady she spun the combination wrenched open the door her breath expelled in a whoosh as she knelt and took out velvet boxes and bags more jewelry he thought with a shake of his head how many earrings could one woman wear but she was opening each box carefully examining the contents these were my mothers she murmured with a catch of undiluted emotion in the words they matter the sapphire pin my father gave her for their fifth anniversary the necklace he gave her when i was born the pearls she wore these the day they married she stroked the creamy white strand over her cheek as if it were a loved ones hand i had this built for them didnt keep them with the others just in case she sat back on her heels her lap filled with jewelry that meant so much more than gold and pretty stones well she managed as her throat closed well theyre here theyre still here ms fontaine oh call me grace she snapped youre as stuffy as my uncle niles then she pressed a hand to her forehead trying to work away the beginnings of a tension headache i dont suppose you can make coffee yes i can make coffee then why dont you go down and do that little thing handsome and give me a minute here he surprised her and himself by crouching down first laying a hand on her shoulders you could have lost the pearls lost all of it you still wouldnt have lost your memories uneasy that hed felt compelled to say it he straightened and left her alone he went directly to the kitchen pushing through the mess to fill the coffeepot he set it up to brew and switched the machine on stuck his hands in his pockets then pulled them out what the hell was going on he asked himself he should be focused on the case and the case alone instead he felt himself being pulled tugged at by the woman upstairs by the various faces of that woman bold fragile sexy sensitive just which was she and why had he spent most of the night with her face lodged in his dreams he shouldnt even be here he admitted he had no official reason to be spending this time with her it was true he felt the case warranted his personal attention it was serious enough but she was only one small part of the whole and hed be lying to himself if he said he was here strictly on an investigation he found two undamaged cups there were several broken ones lying around good meissen china he noted his mother had a set she prized dearly he was just pouring the coffee when he sensed her behind him black thats fine she stepped in and winced as she took a visual inventory of the kitchen he didnt miss much did he i suppose he thought i might stick a big blue diamond in my coffee canister or cookie jar people put their valuables in a lot of odd places i was involved in a burglary case once where the victim saved her inhouse cash because shed kept it in a sealed plastic bag in the bottom of the diaper pail what selfrespecting bande man is going to paw through diapers she chuckled sipped her coffee whether or not it had been his purpose his telling of the story had made her feel better it makes keeping things in a safe seem foolish this one didnt take the silver or any of the electronics i suppose as you said he was in too much of a hurry and just took what he could stuff in his pockets she walked to the kitchen window and looked out melissas clothes are upstairs i didnt see her purse he might have taken that too or it could just be buried under the mess wed have found it if it had been here she nodded id forgotten youve already searched through my things she turned back leaned on the counter and eyed him over the rim of her cup did you go through them personally lieutenant he thought of the red silk gown some of it you have your own department store here id come by that naturally wouldnt i i have a weakness for things all manner of things you make excellent coffee lieutenant isnt there anyone who brews it for you in the morning no not at the moment he set his coffee aside that wasnt very subtle it wasnt intended to be its not that i mind competition i just like to know if i have any i still dont think i like you but that could change she lifted a hand to finger the tail of her braid why not be prepared im interested in closing a case not in playing games with you grace it was such a cool delivery so utterly dispassionate it kindled her spirit of competition i suppose you dont like aggressive women not particularly well then she smiled as she stepped closer to him youre just going to hate this in a slick and practiced move she slid a hand up into his hair and brought his mouth to hers chapter contents prev next the jolt lightning wrapped in black velvet stabbed through him in one powerful strike his head spun with it his blood churned his belly ached no part of his system was spared the rapid onslaught of that lush and knowing mouth her taste unexpected yet familiar plunged into him like hot spiced wine that rushed immediately to his head leaving him dazed and drunk and desperate his muscles bunched as if poised to leap and in leaping he would possess what was somehow already his it took a vicious twist of will to keep his arms locked at his side when they strained to reach out take relish her scent was as dark as drugging as her flavor even the low persuasive hum that sounded in her throat as she moved that glorious fantasy of a body against his was a tantalizing hint of what could be for a slow count of five he fisted his hands then relaxed them and let the internal war rage while his lips remained passive his body rigid in denial he wouldnt give her the satisfaction of response she knew it was a mistake even as she moved toward him reached for him shed known it shed made mistakes before and she tried never to regret what was done and couldnt be undone but she regretted this she deeply regretted that his taste was utterly unique and perfect for her palate that the texture of his hair the shape of his shoulders the strong wall of his chest all taunted her when shed only meant to taunt him to show him what she could offer if she chose instead swept into need rushed into it by that mating of lips she offered more than shed intended and he gave nothing back she caught his bottom lip between her teeth one quick sharp nip then masked an outrageous rush of disappointment by stepping casually back and aiming an amused smile at him my my youre a cool one arent you lieutenant his blood burned with every heartbeat but he merely inclined his head youre not used to being resistible are you grace no she rubbed a fingertip lightly over her lip in a movement that was both absent and provocative the essence of him clung stubbornly there insisting it belonged but then most of the men ive kissed havent had ice water in their veins its a shame she took her finger from her own up tapped it on his such a nice mouth such potential still maybe you just dont care for women the grin he flashed stunned her his eyes glowed with it in fascinating tones of gold his mouth softened with a charm that had a wicked and unpredictable appeal suddenly he was approachable nearly boyish and it made her heart yearn maybe he said youre just not my type she gave one short humorless laugh darling im every mans type well well just chalk it up to a failed experiment and move on telling herself it was foolish to be hurt she stepped to him again reached up to straighten the tie shed loosened he didnt want her to touch him not then not when he was so precariously perched on the edge youve got a hell of an ego there i suppose i do with her hands still on his tie she looked up into his eyes the hell with it she thought if they couldnt be lovers maybe they could be cautious friends the man who had looked at her and grinned would be a good solid friend so she smiled at him with a sweetness that was without art or guile lancing his heart with one clean blow but then men are generally predictable youre just the exception to the rule seth the one that proves it she brushed her hands down smoothing his jacket and said something more but he didnt hear it over the roaring in his ears his control broke he felt the snap like the twang of a sword violently broken over an armored knee in a movement he was hardly aware of he spun her around pressed her back against the wall and was ravaging her mouth her heart kicked in her chest drove the breath out of her body she gripped his shoulders as much for balance as in response to the sudden violent need that shot from him to her and fused them together she yielded utterly then locked her arms around his neck and poured herself back here was all her dazzled mind could think oh here at last his hands raced over her molded and somehow recognized each curve and the recognition seared through him as hot and real as the surge of desire he wanted that taste had to have it inside him to swallow it whole he assaulted her mouth like a man feeding after a lifelong fast filled himself with the flavors of her all of them dark ripe succulent she was there for him had always been there impossibly there and he knew that if he didnt pull back hed never be able to survive without her he slapped his hands on the wall on either side of her head to stop himself from touching to stop himself from taking fighting to regain both his breath and his sanity he eased out of the kiss stepped away she continued to lean back against the wall her eyes closed her skin luminous with passion by the time her lashes fluttered up and those slumberous blue eyes focused he had his control snapped back ruthlessly in place unpredictable she managed barely resisting the urge to press both hands to her galloping heart very i warned you about pushing the wrong buttons his voice was cool edging toward cold and had the effect of a backhand slap she flinched from it might have reeled if she hadnt been braced by the wall his eyes narrowed fractionally at the reaction hurt he wondered no that was ridiculous she was a veteran game player and knew all the angles yes you did she straightened pride stiffening her spine and forcing her lips to curve in a casual smile im just so resistant to warnings he thought she should be required by law to carry one danger woman ive got work to do i can give you another five minutes if you want me to wait while you pack some things oh you bastard she thought how can you be so cool so unaffected you toddle right along handsome ill be fine id prefer you werent in the house alone for the moment go pack some things its my home right now its a crime scene youre down to four and a half minutes fury vibrated through her in hot pulsing beats i dont need anything here she turned started out whirling back when he took her arm what you need clothes he said patient now for a day or two do you really think id wear anything that bastard might have touched thats a foolish and a predictable reaction his tone didnt soften in the least youre not a foolish or a predictable woman dont be a victim grace go pack your things he was right she could have despised him for that alone but the frustrated need still fisted inside her was a much better reason she said nothing at all simply turned again and walked away when he didnt hear the front door slam he was satisfied that shed gone upstairs to pack as hed told her to seth turned off the coffeemaker rinsed the cups and set them in the sink then went out to wait for her she was a fascinating woman he thought full of temperament energy and ego and she was undoing him knot by carefully tied knot how she knew exactly what strings to pull to do so was just one more mystery hed taken this case on he reminded himself riding a desk and delegating were only part of the job he needed to be involved and hed involved himself with this and therefore with her graces part of the whole was small but he needed to treat her with the same objectivity that he treated every other piece of the case with he looked up his gaze drawn to the portrait that smiled down so invitingly hed have to be more machine than man to stay objective when it came to grace fontaine it was midafternoon before he could clear his desk enough to handle a followup interview the diamonds were the key and he wanted another look at them he hadnt been surprised when his phone conversation with dr linstrum at the smithsonian resulted in a testimonial to bailey jamess integrity and skill the diamonds shed gone to such lengths to protect remained at salvini and in her care when seth pulled into the parking lot of the elegant corner building just outside dc that housed salvini he nodded to the uniformed cop guarding the main door and felt a faint tug of sympathy the heat was brutal lieutenant despite a soggy uniform the officer snapped to attention ms james inside yes sir the stores closed to the public for the next week he indicated the darkened showroom through the thick glass doors with a jerk of the head we have a guard posted at every en trance and ms james is on the lower level its easier access through the rear lieutenant fine whens your relief officer ive got another hour the cop didnt wipe his brow but he wanted to seth buchanan had a reputation for being a stickler fourhour rotations as per your orders sir bring a bottle of water with you next time well aware that the uniform sagged the minute his back was turned seth rounded the building after a brief conversation with the duty guard at the rear he pressed the buzzer beside the reinforced steel door lieutenant buchanan he said when bailey answered through the intercom id like a few minutes it took her some time to get to the door seth visualized her coming out of the workroom on the lower level winding down the short corridor passing the stairs where shed hidden from a killer only days before hed been through the building himself twice top to bottom he knew that not everyone could have survived what shed been through in there the locks clicked the door opened lieutenant she smiled at the guard silently apologizing for his miserable duty please come in she looked neat and tidy seth thought with her trim blouse and slacks her blond hair scooped back only the faint shadows under her eyes spoke of the strain shed been under i spoke with dr linstrum seth began yes i expect you did im very grateful for his understanding the stones are back where they started she smiled a little well theyre back where they were a few days ago who knows if theyll ever see rome again can i get you something cold to drink she gestured toward a softdrink machine standing brightly against a dark wall ill buy he plugged in coins id like to see the diamonds and have a few words with you all right she pressed the button for her choice and retrieved the can that clunked down the shoot theyre in the vault she continued to speak as she led the way ive arranged to have the security and alarm system beefed up weve had cameras in the showroom for a number of years but ill have them installed at the doors as well and for the upper and lower levels all areas thats wise he concluded that there was a practical streak of common sense beneath the fragile exterior youll run the business now she opened a door hesitated yes my stepfather left it to the three of us with my stepbrothers sharing eighty percent between them in the event any of us died without heirs the shares go to the survivors she drew in a breath i survived thats something to be grateful for bailey not guilty about yes thats what cade says but you see i once had the illusion at least that they were family have a seat ill get the stars he moved into the work area glanced at the equipment the long worktable intrigued he stepped closer examining the glitter of colored stones the twists of gold it was going to be a necklace he realized running a fingertip over the silky length of a closely linked chain something bold almost pagan i needed to get back to work she said from behind him to do somethingdifferent my own i suppose before i faced dealing with these again she set down a padded box that held the trio of diamonds your design he asked gesturing to the piece on the worktable yes i see the piece in my head i cant draw worth a lick but i can visualize i wanted to make something for mj and for grace to she sighed sat on the high stool well lets say to celebrate survival and this is the one for grace yes she smiled pleased that hed sensed it i see something more streamlined for mj but this is grace carefully she set the unfinished work in a tray slid the padded box containing the three stars between them they never lose their impact each time i see them it stuns how long before youre finished with them id just begun when when i had to stop she cleared her throat ive verified their authenticity they are blue diamonds still both the museum and the insurance carrier prefer more indepth verification ill be running a number of other tests beyond what ive already started or completed a metallurgist is testing the triangle but that will be given to me for further study in a day or two it shouldnt take more than a week altogether before the museum can take possession he lifted a stone from the bed knew as soon as it was in his hand that it was the one grace had carried with her he told himself that was impossible his untrained eye couldnt tell one stone from either of its mates yet he felt her on it in it will it be hard to part with them i should say no after the past few days but yes it will graces eyes were this color seth realized not sapphire but the blue of the rare powerful diamond worth killing for he said quietly looking at the stone in his hand dying for then annoyed with himself he set the stone down again your stepbrothers had a client yes they spoke of a client argued about him thomas wanted to take the money the initial deposit and run the money was being checked now but there wasnt much hope of tracing its source timothy told thomas he was a fool that hed never be able to run far or fast enough that he the client would find him hes not even human timothy said that or something like it they were both afraid terribly afraid and terribly desperate over their heads yes i think very much over their heads it would have to be a collector no one could move these stones for resale he glanced at the gems sparkling in their trays like pretty stars you acquire buy and sell to collectors of gems yes certainly not on a scale like the three stars but yes she skimmed her fingers absently through her hair a client might come to us with a stone or a request for one wed also acquire certain gems on spec with a particular client in mind you have a client list then names preferences yes and we have records of what a client had purchased or sold she gripped her hands together thomas would have kept it in his office timothy would have copies in his ill find them for you he touched her shoulder lightly before she could slide from the stool ill get them she let out a breath of relief she had yet to be able to face going upstairs into the room where shed seen murder thank you he took out his notebook if i asked you to name the top gem collectors your top clients what names come to mind off the top of your head oh concentrating she gnawed on her lip peter morrison in london sylvia smythesimmons of new york henry and laura muller here in dc matthew wolinski in california and i suppose charles van horn here in dc too though hes new to it we sold him three lovely stones over the last two years one was a spectacular opal i coveted im still hoping hell let me set it for him i have this design in my head she shook herself trailed off when she realized why he was asking lieutenant i know these people ive dealt with them personally the mullers were friends of my stepfathers mrs smythe simmons is over eighty none of them are thieves he didnt bother to glance up but continued to write then well be able to check them off the list taking anything or anyone at face value is a mistake in an investigation ms james weve had enough mistakes already with mine standing out accepting that fact she nudged her untouched soft drink over the table i should have gone to the police right away i should have turned the information at the very least my suspicions over to the authorities several people would still be alive if i had its possible but its not a given now he did glance up noted the haunted look in those soft brown eyes compassion stirred did you know your stepbrother was being blackmailed by a secondrate bail bondsman no she murmured did you know that someone was pulling the strings pulling them hard enough to turn your stepbrother into a killer she shook her head bit down hard on her lip the things i didnt know were the problem werent they i put the two people i love most in terrible danger then i forgot about them amnesia isnt a choice its a condition and your friends handled themselves they still are in fact i saw ms fontaine just this morning she doesnt look any the worse for wear to me bailey caught the disdainful note and turned to face him you dont understand her i would have thought a man who does what you do for a living would be able to see more clearly than that he thought he caught a faint hint of pity in her voice and resented it ive always thought of myself as clearsighted people are rarely clearsighted when it comes to grace they only see what she lets them see unless they care enough to look deeper she has the most generous heart of any person ive ever known bailey caught the quick flicker of amused disbelief in his eyes and felt her anger rising against it furious she pushed off the stool you dont know anything about her but youve already dismissed her can you conceive of what shes going through right now her cousin was murdered and in her stead shes hardly to blame for that easy to say but shell blame herself and so will her family its easy to blame grace you dont no because i know her and i know shes dealt with perceptions and opinions just like yours most of her life and her way of dealing with it is to do as she chooses because whatever she does those perceptions and opinions rarely change right now shes with her aunt i imagine and taking the usual emotional beating her voice heated became rushed as emotions swarmed tonight therell be a memorial service for melissa and the relatives will hammer at her the way they always do why should they because thats what they do best running out of steam she turned her head looked down at the three stars love knowledge generosity she thought why did it seem there was so little of it in the world maybe you should take another look lieutenant buchanan hed already taken too many he decided and he was wasting time she certainly inspires loyalty in her friends he commented im going to look for those lists you know the way dismissing him bailey picked up the stones to carry them back to the vault grace was dressed in black and had never felt less like grieving it was six in the evening and a light rain was beginning to fall it promised to turn the city into a massive steam room instead of cooling it off the headache that had been slyly brewing for hours snarled at the aspirin shed already taken and leaped into full vicious life she had an hour before the wake one she had arranged quickly and alone because her aunt demanded it helen fontaine was handling grief in her own way as she did everything else in this case it was by meeting grace with a cold damning and dry eye cutting off any offer of support or sympathy and demanding that services take place immediately and at graces expense and instigation they would be coming from all points grace thought as she wandered the large empty room with its banks of flowers thick red drapes deep pile carpeting because such things were expected such things were reported in the press and the fontaines would never give the public media a bone to pick except of course for grace herself it hadnt been difficult to arrange for the funeral home the music the flowers the tasteful canapes only phone calls and the invocation of the fontaine name were required helen had brought the photograph herself the large color print in a shining silver frame that now decorated a polished mahogany table and was flanked with red roses in heavy silver vases that melissa had favored there would be no body to view grace had arranged for melissas body to be released from the morgue had already written the check for the cremation and the urn her aunt had chosen there had been no thanks no acknowledgment none had been expected it had been the same from the moment helen became her legal guardian shed been given the necessities of life fontainestyle gorgeous homes in several countries to live in perfectly prepared food tasteful clothing an excellent education and shed been told endlessly how to eat how to dress how to behave who could be selected as a friend and who could not reminded incessantly of her good fortune unearned in having such a family behind her tormented ruthlessly by the cousin she was there tonight to mourn for being orphaned dependent for being grace shed rebelled against all of it every aspect every expectation and demand shed refused to be malleable biddable predictable the ache for her parents had eventually dimmed and with it the childs desperate need for love and acceptance shed given the press plenty to report wild parties unwise affairs unrestricted spending when that didnt ease the hurt shed found something else something that made her feel decent and whole and shed found grace for tonight she would be just what her family had come to expect and she would get through the next endless hours without letting them touch her she sat heavily on a sofa with overstuffed velvet seats her head pounded her stomach clutched closing her eyes she willed herself to relax she would spend this last hour alone and prepare herself for the rest but shed barely taken the second calming breath when she heard footsteps muffled on the thick patterned carpet her shoulders turned to rock her spine snapped straight she opened her eyes and saw bailey and mj she let her eyes close again on a pathetic rush of gratitude i told you not to come yeah like we were going to listen to that mj sat beside her took her hand cade and jack are parking the car bailey flanked her other side took her other hand how are you holding up better tears stung her eyes as she squeezed the hands clasped in hers a lot better now on a sprawling estate not so many miles from where grace sat with those who loved her a man stared out at the hissing rain everyone had failed he thought many had paid for their failures but retribution was a poor substitute for the three stars a delay only he comforted himself the stars were his they were meant to be his he had dreamed of them had held them in his hands in those dreams sometimes the hands were human sometimes not but they were always his hands he sipped wine watched the rain and considered his options his plans had been delayed by three women that was humiliating and they would have to be made to pay for that humiliation the salvinis were dead bailey james the fools hed hired to retrieve the second star were dead m j oleary the man hed sent with instructions to acquire the third star at any cost was dead grace fontaine and he smiled that had been indiscreet as hed disposed of the lying fool himself telling him thered been an accident that the woman had fought him run from him and fallen to her death telling him hed searched every comer of the house without finding the stone that failure had been irritating enough but then to discover that the wrong woman had died and that the fool had stolen money and jewels without reporting them well such disloyalty in a business associate could hardly be tolerated smiling dreamily he took a sparkling diamond earring out of his pocket grace fontaine had worn this on her delectable lobe he mused he kept it now as a goodluck charm while he considered what steps to take next there were only days left before the stars would be in the museum extracting them from those hallowed halls would take months if not years of planning he didnt intend to wait perhaps he had failed because he had been overcautious had kept his distance from events perhaps the gods required a more personal risk a more intimate involvement it was time he decided to step out of the shadows to meet the women who had kept his property from him facetoface he smiled again excited by the thought delighted with the possibilities when the knock sounded on the door he answered with great cheer and good humor enter the butler in stern formal black ventured no farther than the threshold his voice held no inflection i beg your pardon ambassador your guests are arriving very well he sipped the last of his wine set the empty crystal flute on a table ill be right down when the door closed he moved to the mirror examined his flawless tuxedo the wink of diamond studs the gleam of the thin gold watch at his wrist then he examined his face the smooth contours the pampered pale gold skin the aristocratic nose the firm if somewhat thin mouth he brushed a hand over the perfectly groomed mane of silverthreaded black hair then slowly smilingly met his own eyes pale almost translucent blue smiled back his guests would see what he did a perfectly groomed man of fiftytwo erudite and educated well mannered and suave they wouldnt know what plans and plots he held in his heart they would see no blood on his hands though it had been only twentyfour short hours since he used them to kill he felt only pleasure in the memory only delight in the knowledge that he would soon dine with the elite and the influential and he could kill any one of them with a twist of his hands with perfect immunity he chuckled to himself a low seductive sound with shuddering undertones tucking the earring back in his pocket he walked from the room the ambassador was mad chapter contents prev next seths first thought when he walked into the funeral parlor was that it seemed more like a tedious cocktail party than like a memorial service people stood or sat in little cliques and groups many of them nibbling on canapes or sipping wine beneath the strains of a muted chopin etude voices murmured there was an occasional roll or tinkle of laughter he heard no tears lights were respectfully dimmed and set off the glitter and gleam of gems and gold the fragrance of flowers mixed and merged with the scents worn by both men and women he saw faces both elegant and bored he saw no grief but he did see grace she stood looking up into the face of a tall slim man whose golden tan set off his golden hair and bright blue eyes he held one of her hands in his and smiled winningly he appeared to be speaking quickly persuasively she shook her head once laid a hand on his chest then allowed herself to be drawn into an anteroom seths lip curled in automatic disdain a funeral was a hell of a place for a flirtation buchanan jack dakota wandered over he scanned the room stuck his hands in the pockets of the suit coat he wished fervently was still in his closet instead of on his back some party seth watched two women air kiss apparently doesnt seem like one a sane man would want to crash i have business he said briefly which could have waited until morning he reminded himself he should have let it wait it annoyed him that hed made the detour that hed been thinking of grace more that hed been unable to lock her out of his head he pulled a copy of a mug shot out of his pocket handed it to jack recognize him jack scanned the picture considered slicklooking dude he thought vaguely european in looks with the sleek black hair dark eyes and refined features nope looks like a poster boy for some wussy cologne you didnt see him during your amazing weekend adventures jack took one last harder look handed the shot back nope whats his connection his prints were all over the house in potomac jacks interest rose he the one who killed the cousin seth met jacks eyes coolly that has yet to be determined dont give me the cop stand buchanan whatd the guy say he stopped by to sell vacuum cleaners he didnt say anything he was too busy floating facedown in the river with an oath jacks gaze whipped around the room again he relaxed fractionally when he spotted mj huddled with cade the morgue must be getting crowded you got a name seth started to dismiss the question he didnt care for professions that stood a step back from the police but there was no denying that the bounty hunter and the private investigator were involved and there was no avoiding the connection he told himself carlo monturri doesnt ring a bell either seth hadnt expected it would but the police on several continents knew the name hes out of your league dakota his type keeps a fancy lawyer on retainer and doesnt use the local bail bondsman to get sprung as he spoke seths eyes moved around the room as a cops did sweeping corner to corner taking in details body language atmosphere before he took his last swim he was expensive hired muscle he worked alone because he didnt like to share the fun connections in the area were working on it seth saw grace come out of the anteroom the man who was with her had his arm draped over her shoulders pulled her close in an ultimate embrace kissed her the flare of fury kindled in seths gut and bolted up to his heart excuse me grace saw him the moment he started across the room she murmured something to the man beside her dislodged him then dismissed him straightening her spine she fixed on an easy smile lieutenant we didnt expect you i apologize for intruding in your he flicked a glance toward the golden boy who was helping himself to a glass a wine grief the sarcasm slapped but she didnt flinch i assume you have a reason for coming by id like a moment of your time in private of course she turned to lead him out and came facetoface with her aunt aunt helen if you could tear yourself away from entertaining your suitors helen said coldly i want to speak to you excuse me grace said to seth and stepped into the anteroom again seth debated moving off giving them privacy but he stayed where he was two paces from the doorway he told himself murder investigations didnt allow for sensitivity though they kept their voices low he heard both women clearly enough i assume you have melissas things at your home helen began i dont know i havent been able to go through the house thoroughly yet helen said nothing for a moment simply studied her niece through cold blue eyes her face was smooth and showed no ravages of grief in the carefully applied makeup her hair was sleek lightened to a tasteful ash blond her hands were freshly manicured and glittered with the diamond wedding band she continued to wear though shed shared little but her husbands name in over a decade and a squarecut sapphire given to her by her latest lover i sincerely doubt melissa came to your home without a bag i want her things grace all of her things youll have nothing of hers i never wanted anything of hers aunt helen didnt you there was a crackle in the voice a whip flicking did you think she wouldnt tell me of your affair with her husband grace merely sighed it was new ground but sickeningly familiar melissas marriage had failed publicly therefore it had to be someone elses fault it had to be graces fault i didnt have an affair with bobbie before during or after their marriage and whom do you think i would believe you or my own daughter grace tilted her head twisted a smile on her face why your own daughter of course as always youve always been a liar and a sneak youve always been ungrateful a burden i took on out of family duty who never once gave anything back you were spoiled and willful when i opened my door to you and you never changed graces stomach roiled viciously in defense she smiled shrugged deliberately careless she smoothed a hand over the hair sleeked into a coiled twist at the nape of her neck no i suppose i didnt ill just have to remain a disappointment to you aunt helen my daughter would be alive if not for you grace willed her heart to go numb but it ached and it burned yes youre right i warned her about you told her time and again what you were but you continually lured her back playing on her affection affection aunt helen with a half laugh grace pressed her fingers to the throb in her left temple surely even you dont believe she ever had an ounce of affection for me she took her cue from you after all and she took it well how dare you speak of her in that tone after youve killed her in the pampered face helens eyes burned with loathing all of your life youve envied her used your wiles to influence her now your unconscionable lifestyle has killed her youve brought scandal and disgrace down on the family name once again grace went stiff this wasnt grief she thought perhaps grief was there buried deep but what was on the surface was venom and she was weary of being struck by it thats the bottom line isnt it aunt helen the fontaine name the fontaine reputation and of course the fontaine stock your child is dead but its the scandal that infuriates you she absorbed the slap without a wince though the blow printed heat on her cheek brought blood stinging to the surface she took one long deep breath that should end things appropriately between the two of us she said evenly ill have melissas things sent to you as soon as possible i want you out of here helens voice shook for the first time whether in grief or in fury grace couldnt have said you have no place here youre right again i dont i never did grace stepped out of the alcove the color that had drained out of her face rose slightly when she met seths eyes she couldnt read them in that brief glance and didnt want to without breaking stride she continued past him and kept walking the drizzle that misted the air was a relief she welcomed the heat after the overchilled artificial air inside and the heavy stifling scent of funeral flowers her heels clicked on the wet pavement as she crossed the lot to her car she was fumbling in her bag for her keys when seth clamped a hand on her shoulder he said nothing at first just turned her around studied her face it was white again but for the red burn from the slap the eyes a dark contrast and swimming with emotion he could feel the tremors of that emotion under the palm of his hand she was wrong humiliation was one more blow to her overwrought system she jerked her shoulder but his hand remained in place is that part of your investigative technique lieutenant eavesdropping on private conversations did she realize he wondered that her voice was raw her eyes were devastated he wanted badly to lift a hand to that mark on her face cool it erase it she was wrong he said again and she was cruel you arent responsible of course i am she spun away jabbing her key at the door lock after three shaky attempts she gave up and they dropped with a jingling splash to the wet pavement as she turned into his arms oh god shuddering she pressed her face into his chest oh god he didnt want to hold her wanted to refuse the role of comforter but his arms came around her before he could stop them and one hand reached up to brush the smooth twist of her hair you didnt deserve that grace you did nothing to deserve that it doesnt matter yes it does he found himself weakening drawing her closer trying to will her trembling away it always does im just tired she burrowed into him while the rain misted her hair there was strength here was all she could think a haven here an answer here im just tired her head lifted their mouths met before either of them realized the need was there the quiet sound in her throat was of relief and gratitude she opened her battered heart to the kiss locking her arms around him urging him to take it she had been waiting for him and too dazed to question why she offered herself to him surely comfort and pleasure and this allconsuming need were reason enough his mouth was firm the one shed always wanted on hers his body was hard and solid a perfect match for hers here he is she thought with a ragged sigh of joy she trembled still and he could feel his own muscles quiver in response he wanted to gather her up carry her out of the rain to someplace quiet and dark where it was only the two of them to spend years where it would only be the two of them his heart pounded in his head masking the slick sound of traffic over the rainwet street beyond the lot its fast demanding beat muffled the warning straggling to sound in the corner of his brain telling him to step back to break away hed never wanted anything more in his life than to bury himself in her and forget the consequences swamped with emotions and needs she held him close take me home she murmured against his mouth seth take me home make love with me i need you to touch me i want to be with you her mouth met his again in a desperate plea she hadnt known herself capable of every cell in his body burned for her every need hed ever had coalesced into one and it was only for her the almost vicious focus of it left him vulnerable and shaky and furious he put his hands on her shoulders drew her away sex isnt the answer for everyone his voice wasnt as cool as hed wanted but it was rigid enough to stop her from reaching for him again sex she thought as she struggled to clear her dazzled mind did he really believe shed been speaking about something as simple as sex then she focused on his face the hard set of his mouth the faint annoyance in his eyes and realized he did her pride might have been tattered but she managed to hold on to a few threads well apparently its not for you reaching up she smoothed her hair brushed away rain or if it is youre the type who insists on being the initiator she made her lips curve though they felt cold now and stiff it would have been just fine and dandy if youd made the move but when i do it makes me what would the term be loose i dont believe its a term i used no youre much too controlled for insults she bent down scooped up her wet keys then stood jingling them in her hand while she studied him but you wanted me right back seth youre not quite controlled enough to have masked that little detail i dont believe in taking everything i want why the hell not she gave a short mirthless laugh were alive arent we and you of all people should know how distressingly short life can be i dont have to explain to you how i live my life no you dont but its obvious youre perfectly willing to question how i live mine her gaze skimmed past him back toward the lights glinting in the funeral home im quite used to that i do exactly what i choose without regard for the consequences im selfish and selfinvolved and careless she lifted a shoulder as she turned and unlocked her door as for feelings why should i be entitled to them she slipped into her car flipped him one last look her mouth might have curved with seductive ease but the sultry smile didnt reach her eyes or mask the misery in them well maybe some other time handsome he watched her drive off into the rain there would be another time he admitted if for no other reason than that he hadnt shown her the picture hadnt he thought had the heart to add to her unhappiness that night feelings he mused as he headed to his own car she had them had plenty of them he only wished he understood them he got into his car wrenched his door shut he wished to god he understood his own for the first time in his life a woman had reached in and clamped a hand on his heart and she was squeezing seth told himself he wasnt postponing meeting with grace again the morning after the memorial service had been hellish with work and when he did carve out time to leave his office hed headed toward mjs it was true he could have assigned this followup to one of his men despite the fact that the chief of police had ordered him to head the investigation and give every detail his personal attention mick marshall the detective who had taken the initial call on the case could have done this next pass with m j oleary seth was forced to admit that he wanted to talk to her personally and hoped to slide a few details out of her on grace fontaine mjs was a cozy inviting neighborhood pub that ran to dark woods gleaming brass and thickly padded stools and booths business was slow but steady in midafternoon a couple of men who looked to be college age were sharing a booth a duet of foamy mugs and an intense game of chess an older man sat at the bar working a crossword from the morning paper and a trio of women with department store shopping bags crowding the floor around them huddled over drinks and laughter the bartender glanced at seths badge and told him hed find the boss upstairs in her office he heard her before he saw her look pal if id wanted candy mints id have ordered candy mints i ordered beer nuts i want them here by six yeah yeah i know my customers get me the damn nuts pronto she sat behind a crowded desk with a battered top her short cap of red hair stood up in spikes seth watched her rake her fingers through it again as she hung up the phone and pushed a pile of invoices aside if that was her idea of filing he thought it suited the rest of the room it was barely big enough to turn around in crowded with boxes files papers and one ratty chair on which sat an enormous and overflowing purse ms oleary she looked up her brow still creased in annoyance it didnt clear when she recognized her visitor just what i needed to make my day perfect a cop listen buchanan im behind here as you know i lost a few days recently then ill try to be quick he stepped inside pulled the picture out of his pocket and tossed it onto the desk under her nose look familiar she pursed her lips gave the slickly handsome face a slow careful study is this the guy jack told me about the one who killed melissa the melissa fontaine case is still open this man is a possible suspect do you recognize him she rolled her eyes pushed the photo back in seths direction no looks like a creep did grace recognize him he angled his head slightly his only outward sign of interest does she know many men who look like creeps too many mj muttered jack said you came by the memorial service last night to show grace this picture she was occupied yeah it was a rough night for her mj rubbed her eyes apparently though she seemed to have been handling it well enough initially he glanced down at the photo again thought of the man hed seen her kiss this looks like her type mjs hand dropped her eyes narrowed meaning just that seth tucked the photo away if ones going by type this one doesnt appear on the surface too far a step from the one she was cozy with at the service cozy with the narrowed eyes went hot angry green flares grace wasnt cozy with anyone about sixone a hundred and seventy blond hair blue eyes fivethousanddollar italian suit lots of teeth it only took her a moment at any other time she would have laughed but the cool disdain on seths face had her snarling you stupid son of a bitch that was her cousin julian and he was hitting her up for money just like he always does seth frowned backtracked played the scene through his mind again her cousin and that would be the victims stepbrother melissas stepbrother her fathers son from a previous and the deceaseds stepbrother was asking grace for money at his stepsisters memorial this time she appreciated the coating of disgust over his words yeah hes slime why should the ambience stop him from shaking her down most of them squeeze her for a few bucks now and then she rose geared up and youve got a hell of a nerve coming in here with your attitude and your superior morals ace she wrote that pansyfaced jerk a check for a few thousand to get him off her back just like she used to pass bucks to melissa and some of the others i was under the impression the fontaines were wealthy wealths relative especially if you live the high life and your allowance from your trust fund is overdrawn or if youve played too deep in monte carlo and grace has more of the green stuff than most of them because her parents didnt blow the bucks that just bums the relatives she muttered who do you think paid for that wake last night it wasnt the dearly departeds mama or papa graces witch of an aunt put the arm on her then put the blame on her and she took it because she thinks its easier to take it and go her own way you dont know anything about her he thought he did but the details he was collecting bit by bit werent adding up very neatly i know that shes not to blame for what happened to her cousin yeah try telling her that i know that when we realized shed left and we got back to cades she was in her room crying and there was nothing any of us could do to help her and all because those bastards she has the misfortune to be related to go out of their way to make her feel rotten not just her relatives he thought with a quick twinge of guilt hed had a part in that it seems shes more fortunate in her friends than in her family thats because were not interested in her money or her name because we dont judge her we just love her now if thats all ive got work to do i need to speak with ms fontaine seths voice was as stiff as mjs had been passionate would you know where i might find her her lips curled she hesitated a moment knowing grace wouldnt appreciate the information being passed along but the urge to see the cops preconceptions slapped down was just too tempting sure try saint agness hospital pediatrics or maternity her phone rang so she snatched it up youll find her she said yeah oleary she barked into the phone and turned her back on seth he assumed she was visiting the child of a friend but when he asked at the nurses station for grace fontaine faces lit up i think shes in the intensive care nursery the nurse on duty checked her watch its her usual time there do you know the way baffled seth shook his head no he listened to the directions while his mind turned over a dozen reasons why grace fontaine should have a usual time in a nursery since none of them slipped comfortably into a slot he headed down corridors he could hear the high sound of babies crying behind a barrier of glass and perhaps he stopped for just a moment outside the window of the regular nursery and his eyes might have softened just a little as he scanned the infants in their clearsided beds tiny faces some slack in sleep others screwed up into wrinkled balls of fury a couple stood beside him the man with his arm over the womans robed shoulders ours is third from the left joshua michael delvecchio eight pounds five ounces hes one day old hes a beaut seth said which one is yours the woman asked seth shook his head shot one more glance through the glass im just passing through congratulations on your son he continued on resisting the urge to look back at the new parents lost in their own private miracle two turns down the corridor away from the celebration was a smaller nursery here machines hummed and nurses walked quietly and behind the glass were six empty cribs grace sat beside one cuddling a tiny crying baby she brushed away tears from the pale little cheek rested her own against the smooth head as she rocked it struck him to the core the picture she made her hair was braided back from her face and she wore a shapeless green smock over her suit her face was soft as she soothed the restless infant her attention was totally focused on the eyes that stared tearfully into hers excuse me sir a nurse hurried up this is a restricted area absently his eyes still on grace seth reached for his badge im here to speak with ms fontaine i see ill tell her youre here lieutenant no dont disturb her he didnt want anything to spoil that picture i can wait whats wrong with the baby shes holding peters an aids baby ms fontaine arranged for him to have care here ms fontaine he felt a fist lodge in his gut its her child biologically no the nurses face softened slightly i think she considers them all hers i honestly dont know what wed do without her help not just the foundation but her the foundation the falling star foundation ms fontaine set it up a few years ago to assist critically ill and terminal children and their families but its the handson that really matters she gestured back toward the glass with a nod of her head no amount of financial generosity can buy a loving touch or sing a lullaby he watched the baby calm drift slowly to sleep in graces arms she comes here often as often as she can shes our angel youll have to excuse me lieutenant thank you as she walked away he stepped closer to the isolation glass grace started toward the crib it was then that her eyes met his he saw the shock come into them first even she wasnt skilled enough to disguise the range of emotions that raced over her face surprise embarrassment annoyance then she smoothed the expressions out gently she laid the baby back into the crib brushed a hand over his cheek she walked through a side door and disappeared it was several minutes before she came out into the corridor the smock was gone now she was a confident woman in a flamered suit her mouth carefully tinted to match well lieutenant we meet in the oddest places before she could complete the casual greeting shed practiced while she tidied her makeup he took her chin firmly in his hand his eyes locked intently on hers probed youre a fake he said it quietly stepping closer youre a fraud who the hell are you whatever i like he unnerved her that long intense and alltoopersonal study with those goldenbrown eyes and i dont believe this is the place for an interrogation id like you to let me go now she said steadily i dont want any scenes here im not going to cause a scene she lifted her brows i might deliberately she pushed his hand away and started down the corridor if you want to discuss the case with me or have any questions regarding it well do it outside i wont have it brought in here it was breaking your heart he murmured holding that baby was breaking your heart its my heart almost viciously she punched a finger at the button for the elevator and its a tough one seth ask anyone your lashes are still wet this is none of your business her voice was low and vibrating with fury absolutely none of your business she stepped into the crowded elevator faced front she wouldnt speak to him about this part of her life she promised herself just the night before shed opened herself to him only to be pushed away refused she wouldnt share her feelings again and certainly not her feelings about something as vital to her as the children he was a cop just a cop hadnt she spent several miserable hours the night before convincing herself that was all he was or could be to her whatever he stirred in her would have to be stopped or if not stopped at least suppressed she would not share with him she would not trust him she would not give to him by the time she reached the lobby doors she was steadier hoping to shake him quickly she started toward the lot seth merely took her arm steered her away over here he said and headed toward a grassy area with a pair of benches i dont have time make time youre too upset to drive in any case dont tell me what i am apparently thats just what ive been doing and apparently ive missed several steps thats not usual for me and i dont care for it sit down i dont want sit down grace he repeated i apologize annoyed she sat on the bench found her sunglasses in her bag and slipped them on for he sat beside her removed the shielding glasses and looked into her eyes for not letting myself look beneath the surface for not wanting to look and for blaming you because i dont seem able to stop wanting to do this he took her face in his hands and captured her mouth with his chapter contents prev next she didnt move into him not this time her emotions were simply too raw to risk though her mouth yielded beneath his she lifted a hand and laid it on his chest as if to keep him at a safe distance and still her heart stumbled this time she was holding back he sensed it felt it in the press of her hand against him not refusing but resisting and with a knowledge that came from somewhere too deep to measure he gentled the kiss seeking not only to seduce but also to soothe and still his heart staggered dont it made her throat ache her mind haze her body yearn and it was all too much she pulled away from him and stood staring out across the little patch of grass until she thought she could breathe again what is it with timing seth wondered aloud that makes it so hard to get right i dont know she turned then to look at him he was an attractive man she decided the dark hair and hard face the odd tint of gold in his eyes but shed known many attractive men what was it about this one that changed everything and made her world tilt you bother me lieutenant buchanan he gave her one of his rare smiles slow and full and rich thats a mutual problem ms fontaine you keep me up at night like a puzzle where the pieces are all there but they change shape right before your eyes and even when you put it all together or think you have it doesnt stay the same im not a mystery seth you are the most fascinating woman ive ever met his lips curved again when she lifted her brows that isnt entirely a compliment along with fascination comes frustration he stood but didnt step toward her why were you so upset that i found you here saw you here its private her tone was stiff again dismissive i go to considerable trouble to keep it private why because i prefer it that way your family doesnt know about your involvement here the fury that seared through her eyes was burningcold my family has nothing to do with this nothing this isnt a fontaine project one of their charitable sops for good press and a tax deduction its mine yes i can see that he said calmly her family had hurt her even more than hed guessed and more he thought than she had acknowledged why children grace because theyre the innocents it was out before she realized she meant to say it then she closed her eyes and sighed innocence is a precious and perishable commodity yes it is falling star your foundation is that how you see them stars that burn out and fall too quickly it was her heart he was touching simply by understanding by seeing what was inside it has nothing to do with the case why are you pushing me on this because im interested in you she sent him a smile half inviting half sarcastic are you you didnt seem to be when i asked you to bed but you see me holding a sick baby and you change your tune she walked toward him slowly trailed a fingertip down his shut well if its the maternal type that turns you on lieutenant dont do that to yourself again his voice was quiet controlled he took her hand stopped her from backtracking the trail of her finger its foolish and its irritating you werent playing games in there you care yes i do i care enormously and that doesnt make me a hero and it doesnt make me any different than i was last night she drew her hand away and stood her ground i want you i want to go to bed with you that irritates you sera not the sentiment but the bluntness of the statement isnt it games youd prefer that id pretend reluctance and let you conquer he only wished it was something just that ordinary maybe i want to know who you are before we end up in bed i spent a long time looking at your face that portrait of you in your house and looking i wondered about you now i want you but i also want all those pieces to fit you might not like the finished product no he agreed i might not then again she thought considering she angled her head i have a thing tonight a cocktail party hosted by a major contributor to the hospital i cant afford to skip it why dont you take me then well see what happens next he weighed the pros and cons knew it was a step that would have ramifications he might not be able to handle smoothly she wasnt simply a woman and he wasnt simply a man whatever was between them had a long reach and a hard grip do you always think everything through so carefully she asked as she watched him yes but in her case it didnt seem to matter he realized i cant guarantee my evenings will be free until this case is closed he shifted times and meetings and paperwork in his head but if i can manage it ill pick you up eights soon enough if youre not there by quarter after ill assume you were tied up no complaints he thought no demands most of the women hed known shifted to automatic sulk mode when his work took priority ill call if i cant make it whatever she sat again relaxed now i dont imagine you came by to see my secret life or to make a tentative date for a cocktail party she slipped her sunglasses back on sat back why are you here he reached inside his jacket for the photo grace caught a brief glimpse of his shoulder holster and the weapon snug inside it and wondered if hed ever had occasion to use it i imagine your time is taken up mainly with administration duties she took the picture from him but continued to look at seras face you wouldnt participate in many what busts she thought she caught a faint glint of humor in his eyes but his mouth remained sober i like to keep my hand in yes she murmured easily able to imagine him whipping the weapon out i suppose you would she shifted her gaze scanned the face in the photo this time the humor was in her eyes ah joe cool or more likely juan or jeanpaul cool you know him not personally but certainly as a type he likely speaks the right words in three languages plays a steely game of baccarat enjoys his brandy and wears black silk underwear his rolex along with his monogrammed gold cufflinks and diamond pinkie ring would have been gifts from admirers intrigued seth sat beside her again and what are the right words youre the most beautiful woman in the room i adore you my heart sings when i look into your eyes your husband is a fool and darling you must stop buying me gifts been there with some variations only ive never been married and i dont buy trinkets for users his eyes are cold she added but a lot of women lonely women would only see the polish thats all they want to see she took a quick short breath this is the man who killed melissa isnt it he started to give her the standard response but she looked up then and he was close enough to read her eyes through the amber tint of her glasses i think it is his prints were all over the house some of the surfaces were wiped but he missed a lot which leads me to think he panicked either because she fell or because he wasnt able to find what hed come for and youre leaning toward the second choice because this isnt the type of man to panic because hed killed a woman no he isnt she couldnt have given him what hed come for she wouldnt have known what he was talking about no that doesnt make you responsible if you indulge yourself by thinking it does youd have to blame bailey too grace opened her mouth closed it again breathed deep thats clever logic lieutenant she said after a moment so i shed my sackcloth and ashes and blame this man have you found him hes dead he took the photo back tucked it away and my clever logic leads me to believe that whoever hired him decided to fire him permanently i see she felt nothing no satisfaction no relief so were nowhere the three stars are under twentyfourhour guard you mj and bailey are safe and the museum will have its property in a matter of days and a lot of people have died sacrifices to the god from what ive read about mithra it isnt blood he wants love knowledge and generosity she said quietly powerful elements the diamond i held it has vitality maybe thats the same as power does he want them because theyre beautiful priceless ancient or because he truly believes in the legend does he believe that if he has all of them in their triangle hell possess the power of the god and immortality people believe what they choose to believe whatever reason he wants them hes killed for them staring out across the grass he stepped over one of his own rules and shared his thoughts with her money isnt the driving force hes laid out more than a million already he wants to own them to hold them in his hands whatever the cost its more than coveting he said quietly as a murky scene swam into his mind a marble altar a golden triangle with three brilliantly blue points a dark man with pale eyes and a bloody sword and you dont think hell stop now you think hell try again baffled and uneasy with the image he shook it off turned back to logic and instinct oh yeah seths eyes narrowed went flat hell try again seth made it to cades at his final meeting of the day with the chief of police had gone past seven and that had barely given him time to get home change and drive out again hed told himself half a dozen times that hed be better off staying at home putting the reports and files away and having a quiet evening to relax his mind the press conference set for nine sharp the next morning would be a trial by fire and he needed to be sharp yet here he was sitting in his car feeling ridiculously nervous and unsettled hed tracked a homicidal junkie through a condemned tenement without breaking a sweat with a steady pulse hed interrogated cold vicious killers but now as the white ball of the sun dipped low in the sky he was as jittery as a schoolboy he hated cocktail parties the inane conversations the silly food the buffed faces all feigning enthusiasm or ennui depending on their style but it wasnt the prospect of a few hours socializing with strangers that unnerved him it was spending time with grace without the buffer of the job between them hed never had a woman affect him as she did and he couldnt deny at least to himself that he had been deeply uniquely affected from the moment he saw her portrait it didnt help to tell himself she was shallow spoiled a woman used to men falling at her feet it hadnt helped before he discovered she was much more than that and it was certainly no good now he couldnt claim to understand her but he was beginning to uncover all those layers and contrasts that made her who and what she was and he knew they would be lovers before the night was over he saw her step out of the house a charge of electric blue from the short strapless dress molded to her body the long luxurious fall of ebony hair the endless and perfect legs did she shock every mans system seth wondered just the look of her or was he particularly specifically vulnerable he decided either answer would be hard to live with and got out of his car her head turned at the sound of his door and that heartstopping face bloomed with a smile i didnt think you were going to make it she crossed to him unhurried and touched her mouth to his im glad you did id said id call if i wouldnt be here so you did but she hadnt counted on it shed left the address of the party inside just in case but shed resigned herself to spending the evening without him she smiled again smoothed a hand down the lapel of his suit i never wait by the phone were going to georgetown shall we take my car or yours ill drive knowing she expected him to make some comment on her looks he deliberately kept silent as he walked around the car to open her door she slipped in her legs sliding silkily inside he wanted his hands there right there where the abbreviated hem of her dress kissed her thighs where the skin would be tender as a ripened peach and smooth as white satin he closed the door walked back around the car and got behind the wheel where in georgetown was all he said it was a beautiful old house with soaring ceilings heavy antiques and deep warm colors the lights blazed down on important people people of influence and wealth who carried the scent of power under their perfumes and colognes she belonged seth thought shed melded with the whole from the moment she stepped through the door to exchange sophisticated cheek brushes with the hostess yet she stood apart in the midst of all the sleek black the fussy pastels she was a bright blue flame daring anyone to touch and be burned like the diamonds he thought unique potent irresistible lieutenant buchanan isnt it seth shifted his gaze from grace and looked at the short balding man who was built like a boxer and dressed in savile row yes mr rossi counsel for the defense if the defense has deep enough pockets unoffended rossi chuckled i thought i recognized you ive crossed you on the stand a few times youre a tough nut ive always believed id have gotten tremaine off or at least hung the jury if id have been able to shake your testimony he was guilty as sin rossi agreed readily but id have hung that jury as rossi started to rehash the trial seth resigned himself to talking shop across the room grace took a glass from a passing waiter and listened to her hostesss gossip with half an ear she knew when to chuckle when to lift a brow purse her lips make some interesting comment it was all routine she wanted to leave immediately she wanted to get seth out of that dark suit she wanted her hands on him all over him lust was creeping along her skin like a hot rash sips of champagne did nothing to cool her throat and only added to the bubbling in her blood my dear sarah gregor how lovely to see you grace shifted sipped smiled at the sleek dark man with the creamy voice who bent gallantly over their hostesss hand mediterranean she judged by the charm of the accent fiftyish but fit youre looking particularly wonderful tonight he said lingering over her hand and your hospitality as always is incomparable and your guests he turned smiling pale silveryblue eyes on grace perfect gregor sarah simpered fluttered then turned to grace i dont believe youve met gregor grace hes fatally charming so be very careful ambassador devane id like to present grace fontaine a dear friend i am honored he lifted graces hand and his lips were warm and soft and enchanted ambassador grace slipped easily into the role i thought ambassadors were old and stodgy all the ones ive met have been that is up until now ill just leave you with grace gregor i see we have some late arrivals im sure im in delightful hands with obvious reluctance he released graces fingers are you perhaps a connection of niles fontaine hes an uncle yes ah i had the pleasure of meeting your uncle and his charming wife in capri a few years ago we have a mutual hobby coins yes uncle niles has quite a collection hes mad for coins grace brushed her hair back lifted it off her bare shoulder and where are you from ambassador devane gregor please in such friendly surroundings then i might be permitted to call you grace of course her smile warmed to suit the new intimacy i doubt you would have heard of my tiny country we are only a small dot in the sea known chiefly for our olive oil and wine terresa now i am flattered again that such a beautiful woman would know my humble country its a beautiful island i was there briefly two years ago and very much enjoyed it terresa is a small jewel in the sea dramatic cliffs to the west lush vineyards in the east and sandy beaches as fine as sugar he smiled at her took her hand again the connection was as unexpected as the woman and he found himself compelled to touch and to keep you must promise to return to allow me to show you the country as it should be seen i have a small villa in the west and the view would almost be worthy of you id love to see it how difficult it must be to spend the summer in muggy washington when you could be enjoying the sea breezes of terresa not at all difficult now he skimmed a thumb over her knuckles i find the treasures of your country more and more appealing perhaps you would consider joining me one evening do you enjoy the opera very much then you must allow me to escort you perhaps he broke off a flicker of annoyance marring his smooth features as seth stepped up to them ambassador gregor devane of terresa allow me to introduce lieutenant seth buchanan you are military devane said offering a hand cop seth said shortly he didnt like the ambassadors looks not one bit when he saw devane with grace hed had a fast turbulent impulse to reach for his weapon but strangely his instinctive movement hadnt been up to his gun but lower on the side where a man would carry a sword ah the police devane blinked in surprise though he already had a full dossier on seth buchanan how fascinating i hope youll forgive me for saying its my fondest wish never to require your services smoothly devane slipped a glass from a passing tray handed it to seth then took one for himself but perhaps we should drink to crime without it youd be obsolete seth eyed him levelly there was recognition inexplicable and utterly adversarial when their eyes locked pale silver to dark gold i prefer drinking to justice of course to the scales shall we say and their constant need for balancing gregor drank then inclined his head youll excuse me lieutenant buchanan ive yet to greet my host i was he turned to grace and kissed her hand again beautifully distracted from my duty it was a pleasure to meet you gregor i hope to see you again he looked deeply into her eyes held the moment very soon the moment he turned away grace shivered there had been something almost possessive in that last long stare what an odd and charming man she murmured energy was shooting through seth the need to do battle his system sparked with it do you usually let odd and charming men drool over you in public it was small of her grace supposed but she enjoyed a kick of satisfaction at the annoyance in seths tone of course since i so dislike them drooling over me in private she turned into him so that their bodies brushed lightly then slanted a look up from under that thick curtain of lashes you dont plan to drool do you he could have damned her for shooting his system from slow burn up to sizzle finish your drink he said abruptly and say your goodbyes were going grace gave an exaggerated sigh oh i do love being dominated by a strong man were about to put that to the test he took her halffinished drink set it aside lets go devane watched them leave studied the way seth pressed a hand to the small of graces back to steer her through the crowd he would have to punish the cop for touching her grace was his property now devane thought as he gritted his teeth painfully tight to suppress the rage she was meant for him hed known it from the moment he took her hand and looked into her eyes she was perfect flawless it wasnt just the three stars that were fated for him but the woman who had held one perhaps caressed it as well she would understand their power she would add to it along with the three stars of mithra devane vowed grace fontaine would be the treasure of his collection she would bring the stars to him and then she would belong to him forever as she stepped outside grace felt another shudder sprint down her spine she hunched her shoulder blades against it looked back through the tall windows filled with light she could see the guests mingling and she saw devane quite clearly for a moment she would have sworn their eyes met but this time there was no charm an irrational sense of fear lodged in her stomach had her turning quickly away again when seth pulled open the car door she got in without complaint or comment she wanted to go to get away from those brilliantly lit windows and the man who seemed to watch her from beyond them briskly she rubbed the chill from her arms you wouldnt be cold if youd worn clothes seth stuck the key in the ignition the single remark issued with cold and savage control made her chuckle and chased the chill away why lieutenant and here i was wondering how long you would let me keep on what i am wearing not a hell of a lot longer he promised and pulled out into the street good determined to see mat he kept that promise she squirmed over and began to nibble his ear lets break some laws she whispered i could already charge myself with intent she laughed again quick breathless and had him hard as iron he wasnt sure how he managed to handle the car much less drive it through traffic out of dc and back into maryland she worked his tie off undid half the buttons of his shirt her hands were everywhere and her mouth teased his ear his neck his jaw while she murmured husky promises suggestions the fantasies she wove with unerring skill had the blood beating painfully in his loins he pulled to a jerky stop in his driveway then dragged her across the seat she lost one shoe in the car and the other halfway up the walk as he half carried her her laughter dark wild damning roared in his head he all but broke his own door down to get her inside the instant they were he pushed her back against the wall and savaged her mouth he wasnt thinking couldnt think it was all primal violent need in the darkened hallway he hiked up her skirt with impatient hands found the thin lacy barrier beneath and ripped it aside he freed himself then gripping her hips plunged into her where they stood she cried out not in protest not in shock at the almost brutal treatment but in pure overwhelming pleasure she locked herself around him let him drive her ruthlessly crest after torrential crest and met him thrust for greedy desperate thrust it was mindless and hot and vicious and it was all that mattered sheer animal need violent animal release her body shattered went limp as she felt him pour into her he slapped his hand against the wall to keep his balance struggled to slow his breathing clear his fevered brain they were no more than a step inside his door he realized and hed mounted her like a rutting bull there was no point in apologies he thought theyd both wanted fast and urgent no wanted was too tame a word he decided theyd craved it the way starving animals craved meat but hed never treated a woman with less care or so completely ignored the consequences i meant to get you out of that dress he managed and was pleased when she laughed well get around to it theres something else i didnt get around to he eased back studied her face in the dim light is that going to be a problem she understood no and though it was rash and foolish she felt a twinge of regret that there would be no quickening of life inside her as a result of their carelessness i take care of myself i didnt want this to happen he took her chin in his hand i should have been able to keep my hands off you her eyes glimmered in the dark confident and amused i hope you dont expect me to be sorry you didnt i want them on me again i want mine on you while they are he lifted her chin a little higher no one elses are i dont share her lips curved slowly as she kept his gaze neither do i he nodded accepting lets go upstairs he said and swept her into his arms chapter contents prev next he switched on the light as he carried her into his room this time he needed to see her to know when her eyes clouded or darkened to witness those flickers of pleasure or shock this time he would remember mans advantage over the animal and that the mind and heart could play a part she got a sense of a room of average size simple buffcolored curtains at the windows cleanlined furniture without color a large bed with a navy spread tucked in with precise military tidiness there were paintings on the walls mat she told herself she would study later when her heart wasnt skipping scenes both urban and rural were depicted in misty dreamy watercolors that made a personal contrast to the practical room but all thoughts of art and decor fled when he set her on her feet beside the bed she reached out undid the final buttons of his shirt while he shrugged out of his jacket her brows lifted when she noted he wore his shoulder holster even to a cocktail party habit he said simply and took it off hung it over a chair he caught the look in her eye is it a problem no i was just thinking how it suits you and wondering if you look as sexy putting it on as you do taking it off then she turned scooped her hair over her shoulder i could use some help he let his gaze wander over her back instead of reaching for the zipper he drew her against him and lowered his mouth to her bare shoulder she sighed tipped her head back thats even better round one took the edge off he murmured then slid his hands around her waist and up until they cupped her breasts i want you whimpering wanting weak his thumbs brushed the curves just above the bold blue silk focused on the sensation she reached back linked her arms around his neck her body began to move timed to his strokes but when she tried to turn he held her in place she moaned shifted restlessly when his fingers curved under her bodice the backs teasing her nipples making them heat and ache i want to touch you whimpering he repeated and ran his hands down her dress to the hem then beneath wanting and cupped her weak pierced her the orgasm flooded her one long slow wave that swamped the senses the whimper hed waited for shuddered through her lips he toed off his shoes then lowered her zipper inch by inch his fingers barely brushed her skin as he spread the parted material eased it down her body until it pooled at her feet he turned her stepped back she wore only a garter in the same hot blue as the dress with stockings so sheer they appeared to be little more than mist her body was a fantasy of generous curves and satin skin her hair fell like wild black rain over her shoulders too many men have told you youre beautiful for it to matter that i say it just tell me you want me that matters i want you grace he stepped to her again took her into his arms but instead of the greedy kiss shed expected he gave her one to slowly drown in her arms clutched around him then went limp at this new assault to the senses kiss me again she murmured when his lips wandered to her throat just like that again so his mouth met hers let her sink a second time with a dreamy hum of pleasure she slipped his shirt away let her hands explore it was lovely to be savored to be given the gift of a slow kindling flame to feel the control slip out of her hands into his and to trust he let himself learn her body inch by generous inch pleasured them both by possessing those full firm breasts first with hands then with mouth he lowered his hands flicked the hooks of her stocking free one by one hearing her quick catch of breath each time then slid his hands under the filmy fabric to flesh warm smooth he lowered her to the bed felt her body yield beneath his soft willing her lips answered his eager generous they watched each other in the light moved together first a sigh then a groan she found muscle the rough skin of an old scar and the taste of man shifting she drew his slacks down feasted on his chest as she undressed him when he took her breasts again pulled her closer to suckle her arms quivered and her hair drifted forward to curtain them both she felt the heat rising sliding through her blood like a fever until her breath was short and shallow she could hear herself saying his name over and over as he patiently built her toward the edge her eyes went cobalt fascinating him her pillowsoft lips trembled her glorious body quaked even as the need for release clawed at him he continued to savor until he finally shifted her to her back and with his eyes locked on hers buried himself inside her she arched upward her hands fisting in the sheets her body stunned with pleasure seth her breath expelled in a rush burned her lungs its never not like this seth before she could speak again he closed her mouth with his and took her when sleep came grace dreamed she was in her garden in the mountains with the woods thick and green and cool surrounding her the hollyhocks loomed taller than her head and bloomed in deep rich reds and clear shimmering whites a hummingbird shimmering sapphire and emerald drank from a trumpet flower cosmos and coneflowers dahlias and zinnias made a cheerful wave of mixed colors pansies turned their exotic little faces toward the sun and smiled here she was happy at peace with herself alone but never lonely here there was no sound but the song of the breeze through the leaves the hum of bees the faint music of the creek bubbling over rocks she watched deer walk quietly out of the woods to drink from the slowmoving creek their hooves lost in the lowlying mist that hugged the ground the dawn light shimmered like silver sparkled off the soft dew caught rainbows in the mist content she walked through her flowers fingers brushing blooms scents rising up to please her senses she saw the glint among the blossoms the bright beckoning blue and stooping plucked the stone from the ground power shimmered in her hand it was a clean flowing sensation pure as water potent as wine for a moment she stood very still her hand open the stone resting in her palm danced with the morning light hers to guard she thought to protect and to give when she heard the rustle in the woods she turned smiling it would be him she was certain shed waited for him all her life wanted so desperately to welcome him to walk into his arms and know they would wrap around her she stepped forward the stone warming her palm the faint vibrations from it traveling like music up her arm and toward her heart she would give it to him she thought she would give him everything she had everything she was for love had no boundaries all at once the light changed hazed over the air went cold and whipped with the wind by the creek the deer lifted their heads alert alarmed then turned as one and fled into the sheltering trees the hum of bees died into a rumble of thunder and lightning snaked over the dingy sky there in the darkened wood close too close to where her flowers bloomed something moved stealthily her fingers clutched reflexively closing fast over the stone and through the leaves she saw eyes bright greedy and watching the shadows parted and opened the path to her no frantic grace pushed at the hands that held her i wont give it to you its not for you easy seth pulled her up stroked her hair just a nightmare shake it off now watching me she moaned it pressed her face into his strong bare shoulder drew in his scent and was soothed hes watching me in the woods watching me no youre here with me her heart was pounding hard enough to bring real concern seth tightened his grip as if to slow it and block the tremors that shook her its a dream theres no one here but me ive got you dont let him touch me ill die if he touches me i wont he tipped her face back ive got you he repeated and wanned her trembling lips with his seth relief shuddered through her as she clutched at him i was waiting for you in the garden waiting for you okay im here now to protect he thought and then to cherish shaken by the depth of that he eased her backward brushed the tumbled hair away from her face must have been a bad one do you have a lot of nightmares what disoriented trapped between the dream and the present she only stared at him do you want the light he didnt wait for an answer but reached around her to switch on the bedside lamp grace turned her face away from the glare pressed her fisted hand against her heart relax now come on he took her hand started to open her fingers no she jerked it back he wants it wants what the star hes coming for it and for me hes coming who i donti dont know baffled now she looked down at her hand slowly opened it i was holding the stone she could still feel the heat the weight i had it i found it it was a dream the diamonds are locked in a vault theyre safe he tipped a finger under her chin until her eyes met his youre safe it was a dream saying it aloud brought both relief and embarrassment im sorry its all right he studied her saw that her face was white her eyes were fragile something moved inside him shifted urged his hand to reach out stroke that pale cheek youve had a rough few days havent you it was just that the quiet understanding in his voice that had her eyes filling she closed them to will back the tears and took careful breaths the pressure in her chest was unbearable im going to get some water he simply reached out and drew her in shed hidden all that fear and grief and weariness inside her very well he realized until now why dont you let it go her breath hitched tore i just need to let it go he repeated and settled her head on his shoulder she shuddered once then clung then wept he offered no words he just held her at eight the next morning seth dropped her off at cades shed protested the hour at which he shook her out of sleep tried to curl herself into the mattress hed dealt with that by simply picking her up carrying her into the shower and turning it on cold hed given her exactly thirty minutes to pull herself together then packed her into the car the gestapo could have taken lessons from you she commented as he pulled up behind mjs car my hairs still wet i didnt have the hour to spare it must take to dry all that i didnt even have time to put my makeup on you dont need it i suppose thats your idea of a compliment no its just a fact she turned to him looking arousing rumpled and erotic in the strapless dress you on the other hand look all pressed and tidy i didnt take twenty minutes in the shower shed sung in the shower he remembered unbelievably offkey thinking of it made him smile go away ive got work to do she pouted then reached for her purse well thanks for the lift lieutenant then laughed when he pushed her back against the seat and gave her the long thorough kiss shed been hoping for that almost makes up for the one miserly cup of coffee you allowed me this morning she caught his bottom lip between her teeth and her eyes sparkled into his i want to see you tonight ill come by if i can ill be here she opened the door shot him a look over her shoulder if i can unable to resist he watched her every sauntering step toward the house the minute she closed the front door behind her he shut his eyes my god he thought he was in love with her and it was totally impossible inside grace all but danced down the hall she was in love and it was glorious it was new and fresh and the first it was what shed been waiting for her entire life her face glowed as she stepped into the kitchen and found bailey and cade at the table sharing coffee good morning troops she all but sang it as she headed to the coffeepot good morning to you cade tucked his tongue in his cheek i like your pajamas laughing she carried her cup to the table then leaned down and kissed him full on the mouth i just adore you bailey i just adore this man youd better snap him up quick before i get ideas bailey smiled dreamily into her coffee then looked up eyes shining and damp were getting married in two weeks what grace bobbled her mug sloshed coffee dangerously close to the rim what she repeated and sat heavily he wont wait why should i reaching over the table cade took baileys hand i love you married grace looked down at their joined hands a perfect match she thought and let out a shaky sigh thats wonderful thats incredibly wonderful laying a hand over theirs she stared into cades eyes and saw exactly what she needed to see youll be good to her it wasnt a question it was acceptance after giving his hand a quick squeeze she sat back well a wedding to plan and a whole two weeks to do it that ought to make us all insane its just going to be a small ceremony bailey began here at the house im going to say one word cade put a plea in his voice elopement no with a shake of her head bailey drew back picked up her mug im not going to start our life together by insulting your family theyre not human you cant insult the inhuman muffy will bring the beasts with her dont call your niece and nephew beasts wait a minute grace held up a hand her brows knit muffy is that muffy parris westlake shes your sister guilty grace managed to suppress most of the snort of laughter that would make doro parris lawrence your other sister she rolled her eyes picturing the two annoying and selfimportant washington hostesses bailey run for your life go to vegas you and cade can get married by a nice elvisimpersonator judge and have a delightful quiet life in the desert change your names never come back see pleased cade slapped a hand on the table she knows them stop it both of you bailey refused to laugh though her voice trembled with it well have a small dignified ceremony with cades family she smiled at grace and mine keep working on her cade rose ive got a couple things to do before i go into the office grace picked up her coffee again i dont know his family well she told bailey ive managed to avoid that little pleasure but i can tell you from what i do know youve got the cream of the crop i love him so much grace i know its all happened quickly but what does time have to do with it because she knew they were both about to get teary she leaned forward we have to discuss the important the vital aspects of this situation bailey she took a deep breath when do we go shopping mj staggered in to the sound of laughter and scowled at both of them i hate cheerful people in the morning she poured coffee tried to inhale it then turned to study grace well well she said dryly apparently you and the cop got to know each other last night well enough that i know hes more than a badge and an attitude irritated she pushed her mug aside what have you got against him other than the fact hes cold and arrogant superior and stiff nothing at all jack says they call him the machine small wonder i always find it interesting grace said coolly when people only skim the surface then judge another human being all those traits you just listed describe a man you dont know mj drink your coffee bailey rose to get the cream you know youre not fit to be around until youve had a half a gallon mj shook her head fisted a hand on a hip covered with a tattered tshirt and equally tattered shorts just because you slept with him doesnt mean you know him either youre usually a hell of a lot more careful than that grace you might let other people assume you pop into bed with a new guy every other night but we know better what the hell were you thinking of i was thinking of me she shot back i wanted him i needed him hes the first man whos ever really touched me and im not going to let you stand there and make something beautiful into something cheap no one spoke for a moment bailey stood near the table the creamer in one hand mj slowly straightened from the counter whistled out a breath youre falling for him staggered she raked a hand through her hair youre really falling for him ive already hit the ground with a splat so what im sorry mj struggled to adjust she didnt have to like the man she told herself she just had to love grace there must be something to him if he got to you are you sure youre okay with it no im not sure im okay with it temper drained and doubt snuck in i dont know why its happened or what to do about it i just know it is it wasnt just sex she remembered how he had held her while she cried how hed left the light on for her without her having to ask ive been waiting for him all my life i know what that means bailey set the creamer down took graces hand exactly so do i with a sigh mj stepped forward whats happening to us were three sensible women and suddenly were guarding ancient mythical stones running from bad guys and falling headlong into love with men weve just met its crazy its right bailey said quietly you know it feels right yeah mj laid her hand over theirs i guess it does it wasnt easy for grace to go back into her house this time though she wasnt alone mj and jack flanked her like bookends man scanning the wreck of the living area mj hissed out a breath i thought they did a number on my place of course youve got a lot more toys to play with then her gaze focused on the splintered railing and the outline below you dont want to do this now grace the police cleared the scene i have to get started on it sometime mj shook her head where ill start in the bedroom grace managed a smile im about to make my dry cleaner a millionaire ill see what i can do with the railing jack told her juryrig something so its safe until you have it rebuilt id appreciate it go on up mj suggested ill get a broom and a bulldozer she waited until grace was upstairs before she turned to jack im going to do this down here get rid of things her gaze wandered to the outline she shouldnt have to handle that he leaned down to kiss her forehead youre a standup pal mj yeah thats me she inhaled sharply lets see if we can dig up the stereo or the tv out of this mess i could use some racket in here it took most of the afternoon before grace was satisfied that the house was cleared out enough to call in her cleaning service she wanted every room scrubbed before she lived there again and she was determined to do just that to live to be at home to face whatever ghosts remained to prove to herself that she could she separated from mj and jack and went shopping for the first replacements then because the entire day had left her feeling raw she stopped by salvinis she needed to see bailey and she needed to see the stars once she was buzzed in she found bailey up in her office on the phone with a smile bailey gestured her in yes dr linstrum im faxing the report to you now and ill bring you the original personally before five i can complete the final tests youve ordered tomorrow she listened a moment ran a finger down the soapstone elephant on her desk no im fine i appreciate your concern and your understanding the stars are my priority ill have full copies of all the reports for your insurance carrier by end of business day friday yes thank you goodbye youre working very quickly grace commented despite all that happened hardly any time was lost and everyone will feel more comfortable when the stones are in the museum i want to see them again bailey she let out a little laugh its silly but i really need to i had this dream last night nightmare really what kind of dream grace sat on the edge of the desk and told her though her voice was steady her fingers tapped with nerves i had dreams too bailey murmured im still having them so is mj uneasy grace shifted like mine similar enough to be more than coincidence she rose held out a hand for graces lets go take a look youre not breaking any laws are you as they walked downstairs together bailey sent her an amused look i think after what ive already done this is a minor infraction she tried to block it but a shudder escaped as they descended the last flight of steps under which shed once hidden from a killer are you going to be all right here instinctively grace hooked an arm around baileys shoulder i hate thinking of what happened and now thinking of you working here remembering it its getting better grace ive had my stepbrothers cremated or rather cade took care of the arrangements he wouldnt let me handle any of it good for him you dont owe them anything bailey you never did were your family we always will be i know she passed into the vault room and approached the massive reinforcedsteel doors the security system was complex and intricate and even with the ease of long practice it took bailey three full minutes to disengage maybe i ought to have one of these installed in my house grace said lightly that bastard popped my library safe like it was a gumball machine he must have fenced the jewelry fast i hate losing the pieces you made for me ill make you more in fact bailey picked up a square velvet box lets start now curious grace opened the box to a pair of heavy gold earrings the smooth crescentshaped gold was studded with stones in deep dark hues of emerald ruby and sapphire bailey theyre beautiful id just finished them beforewell before as soon as i had i knew they were yours its not my birthday i thought you were dead baileys voice shook then strengthened when grace looked up i thought i would never see you again so lets consider these a celebration of the rest of our lives grace removed the simple studs in her ears began to replace them with baileys gift when im not wearing them ill keep them with my mothers jewelry the things that matter most they look perfect on you i knew they would bailey turned took the heavy padded box from its shelf in the vault holding it between them she opened it grace let out a long uneven sigh i honestly thought one would be gone i would drive up to the mountains and find it in my garden sitting on the ground beneath the flowers it was so real bailey reaching out grace took a stone her stone i felt it in my hand just as i do now it pulsed in my hand like a heart she laughed a little but the sound was hollow my heart thats what it seemed like i didnt realize that until now it was like holding my own heart theres a link a little pale bailey took another stone from the box i dont understand it but i know it this is the star i had if mj was here shed have picked hers i never thought i believed in this sort of thing grace turned the stone in her hand i was wrong its incredibly easy to believe it to know it are we protecting them bailey or are they protecting us i like to think its both they brought me cade gently she replaced her stone touched a fingertip to the second star in its hollow brought mj jack her face softened i opened up the showroom for them a little while ago she told grace jack dragged her in and bought her a ring a ring grace lifted a hand to her heart as it swelled an engagement ring an engagement ring she argued the whole time kept telling him not to be a jerk she didnt need any ring he just ignored her and pointed to this lovely green tourmaline squarecut with diamond baguettes i designed it a few months ago thinking mat it would make a wonderful nontraditional engagement ring for the right woman he knew she was the right woman hes perfect for her grace brushed a tear from her lashes and beamed i knew it as soon as i saw them together i wish youd seen them today there she is grumbling rolling her eyes insisting all this fuss is a waste of time and effort then he put that ring on her finger she got this big sloppy grin on her face you know the one yeah and she could see it perfectly im so happy for her for you its like all that love was there waiting and the stones she looked down at them again they opened the door for it and you grace have they opened the door for you i dont know if im ready for that nerves suddenly sprang to her fingertips she laid the stone back in its bed seth certainly wouldnt be i dont think hed believe in magic of any sort and as for love even if that door is wide open and the opportunity is there hes not a man to fall easily easy or not bailey closed the lid replaced the box when youre meant to fall you fall hes yours grace i saw that in your eyes this morning well grace swallowed the nerves i think i may wait awhile to let him in on that chapter contents prev next there were flowers waiting for her when grace returned to cades a gorgeous crystal vase was filled with long spears of paperwhite longstemmed roses her heart thudded foolishly into her throat as she snatched up the card tore open the envelope then it deflated and sank not from seth she noted of course it had been silly of her to think that hed have indulged in such a romantic and extravagant gesture the card read simply until we meet again gregor the ambassador with the oddly compelling eyes she mused and leaned forward to sniff at the tender justopening blooms it had been sweet of him she told herself a bit overthetop as there were easily three dozen roses in the vase but sweet and she was irritated to realize that if they had been from seth she would have mooned over them like a starstruck teenager would likely have pressed one between the pages of a book even shed a few tears she berated herself for being six times a fool if these appalling highs and lows were side effects of being in love grace thought she could have waited quite a bit longer to experience the sensation she was just about to toss the card on the table when the phone rang she hesitated as both cades and jacks cars were in the drive but when the phone rang the third time she picked it up parris residence is grace fontaine available the crisp tones of a welltrained secretary sounded in her ear ambassador devane calling yes this is she one moment please ms fontaine lips pursed thoughtfully grace flipped the edge of the card against her palm the man certainly had had no trouble tracking her down grace mused and just how was she going to handle him grace his voice flowed through the phone how delightful to speak with you again gregor she flipped her hair behind her shoulder edged a hip onto the table how extravagant of you ive just walked in to your roses she tipped one down sniffed again theyre glorious merely a token i was disappointed not to have more time with you last evening you left so early she thought of the wild ride to seths the wilder sex i had a previous engagement perhaps we can make up for it tomorrow evening i have a box at the theater tosca its such a beautiful tragedy theres nothing i would enjoy more than sharing it with you then a late supper perhaps it sounds lovely she rolled her eyes toward the flowers oh dear she thought this would never do im so terribly sorry gregor but im not free with no regret whatsoever she set the card aside actually im involved with someone quite seriously for me in any case she thought then she looked through the glass panels of the front door and her face lit up with surprise and pleasure when she saw seths car pull in i see she was too busy trying to steady her abruptly dancing pulse to notice how his voice had chilled your escort of last evening yes im terribly flattered gregor and if i were any less involved id leap at the invitation i hope youll forgive me and understand struggling not to squirm with delight she crooked her finger in invitation as seth stepped up to the door of course if your circumstances change i hope youll reconsider i certainly will with a sultry smile she walked her fingers up seths chest and thank you again gregor so much for the flowers theyre divine it was my pleasure he said and his hands balled into bonewhite fists as he hung up the receiver humiliated he thought snapping his teeth together grinding them viciously rejected for a suitful of muscles and a badge she would pay he promised himself taking her photo from his file and gently tapping a wellmanicured finger against it she would pay dearly and soon with the ambassador completely forgotten the moment the connection was broken grace tipped her face up to seths hello handsome he didnt toss her but looked at the flowers then at the card shed tossed carelessly beside them another conquest apparently she heard the cold distance in his tone and wasnt certain whether to be flattered or annoyed she opted for a different tack altogether and purred the ambassador was interested in an evening at the opera and whatever the spurt of jealousy infuriated him it was a new experience and one he detested it left him helpless made him want to drag her out to his car by the hair cart her off lock her up where only he could see and touch and taste but more there was fear for her a bonedeep sense of danger it seems the ambassador and you move quickly no she realized the temper was going to come there was no stopping it she eased off the table her smile an icy dare i move however it suits me you should know yes he dipped his hands into his pockets to keep them off her i should i do crushed she angled her chin aimed those laser blue eyes which am i now lieutenant the whore or the goddess the ivory princess atop the pedestal or the tramp ive been them all it just depends on the man and how he chooses to look im looking at you he said calmly and i dont know what i see let me know when you make up your mind she started to move around him came up short when he took her arm dont push me she tossed her head so that her hair flew out settled i could say the same grace she drew in one hot deep breath shoved his hand aside if youre interested i gave the ambassador my regrets and told him i was involved with someone she flashed a frigid smile and swung toward the stairs that apparently was my mistake he scowled after her considered striding up the stairs of a house that wasnt his own and finishing the confrontation one way or the other appalled he pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger and tried to squeeze off the bitter headache plaguing him his day had been grueling and had ended ten long hours after it began with him staring at the group of photos on his board photos of the dead who were wailing for him to find the connection and he was already furious with himself because hed already begun to run a search for data on gregor devane he couldnt be sure if he had done so due to a basic cops hunch or a mans territorial instinct or the dreams it was a question and a conflict hed never had to face before but one answer was clear as glass hed been out of line with grace he was still standing by the foyer table frowning at the steps and weighing his options when cade strolled in from the rear of the house buchanan more than a little surprised to see the homicide lieutenant standing in his foyer scowling cade stopped scratched his jaw ah i didnt know you were here he had no business being there seth reminded himself sorry grace let me in oh after one beat cade pinpointed the source of the heat still flashing in the air oh he said again and wisely controlled a grin fine something i can do for you no im just leaving have a spat seth turned his head met cades obviously amused eyes blandly excuse me just a wild stab in the dark what did you do to tick her off though seth didnt answer cade noted that his gaze shifted briefly to the roses oh yeah guess you didnt send them huh if some guy sent bailey three dozen white roses id probably have to stuff them down his throat one at a time it was the gleam of appreciation that flashed briefly in seths eyes that made cade decide to revise his stance maybe he could like lieutenant seth buchanan after all want a beer the casual and friendly invitation threw seth off balance i no i was leaving come on out back jack and i already popped a couple of tops were going to fire up the grill and show the women how real men cook cades grin spread charmingly besides oiling yourself with a couple of brews will make it easier for you to crawl youre going to crawl anyway so you might as well be comfortable seth hissed out a breath why the hell not grace stayed stubbornly in her room for an hour she could hear laughter music and the silly whack of mallets striking balls as people played an enthusiastic game of croquet she knew seths car was still in the drive and had promised herself she wouldnt go back down until it was gone but she was feeling deprived and hungry since shed already changed into shorts and a thin cotton shirt she paused at the mirror only long enough to freshen her lipstick spritz on some perfume just to make him suffer she told herself then sauntered downstairs and out onto the patio steaks were smoking on the grill with cade at the helm wielding an enormous barbecue fork bailey and jack were arguing over the croquet match and mj was sulking at a picnic table while she nibbled on potato chips jack knocked me out of the game she complained and gestured with her beer i still say he cheated any time you lose grace pointed out as she picked up a chip its because someone cheated then she slid her gaze to seth hed taken off his tie she noted and his jacket he still wore his holster she imagined that was because he didnt feel comfortable hanging his gun over a tree branch he too had a beer in his hand and was watching the game with apparent interest you still here yeah hed had two beers but didnt think crawling was going to be any more comfortable with the lubricant ive been invited to dinner isnt that cozy grace spied what she recognized as a pitcher of mjs special margaritas and poured herself a glass the taste was tart icy and perfect in dismissal she wandered over to the grill to kibitz i know what im doing cade was saying and shifted to guard his territory as seth joined them i marinated these vegetable kabobs personally go away and leave this to a man i was merely asking if you preferred your mushrooms blackened cade sent her a withering look get her off my back seth an artist cant work with critics breathing down his neck and picking on his mushrooms lets go over here seth took her elbow and was braced for her jerk he kept his grip firm and hauled her away into the rose garden i dont want to talk to you grace said furiously you dont have to talk ill talk but it took him a minute apologies didnt come easily to a man who made it a habit not to make mistakes im sorry i overreacted she said nothing simply folded her arms and waited you want more he nodded didnt bother to sigh i was jealous an atypical reaction for me and i handled it poorly i apologize grace shook her head thats the weakest excuse for an apology ive ever heard not the words seth the delivery but fine ill accept it in the same spirit it was offered what do you want from me he demanded frustrated enough to raise his voice and grab her arms what the hell do you want that she tossed back her head just that a little emotion a little passion you can take your cardboardstiff apology and stuff it just like you can stuff the cold deliberate and dispassionate routine you gave me over the flowers that icy control doesnt cut it with me if you feel something whatever the hell it is then let me know she sucked in her breath stunned when he yanked her against him savaged her mouth with heat and anger and need she twisted once and was hauled roughly back then was left weak and singed and shaken by the time he drew away is that enough for you he hauled her to her toes his fingers digging in his eyes werent dispassionate now werent cool but turbulent human enough emotion enough passion i dont like to lose control you cant afford to lose control on the job her breath was heaving and her heart was flying this isnt the job no but it was supposed to be he willed his grip to loosen you were supposed to be i cant get you out of my head damn it grace i cant get you out she laid a hand on his cheek felt the muscle twitch its the same for me maybe the only difference right now is that i want it to be that way for how long he wondered but he didnt say it come home with me id love to she smiled stroked her fingers back into his hair but i think wed better stay for dinner at least otherwise wed break cades heart after dinner then it wasnt difficult at all he discovered to bring her hands to his lips linger over them then look into her eyes i am sorry but grace yes if devane calls you again or sends flowers her lips twitched yes ill have to kill him with a delighted laugh she threw her arms around seths neck now were talking that was nice with a satisfied sigh grace sank down in the seat of seths car and watched the moon shimmer in the sky i like seeing the four of them together but its funny its as if i blinked and everyone took this huge giant step forward red light green light confused grace turned her head to look at him what the game the kids game you know the person whos it has to say green light turn his back everybody can go forward but then he says red light and spins around if he sees anybody move they have to go back to the start when she gave a baffled laugh it was his turn to look didnt you ever play games like that when you were a kid no i was given the proper lessons lectured on etiquette and was instructed to take brisk daily walks for exercise sometimes i ran she said softly remembering fast and hard until my heart was bumping in my chest but i guess i always had to go back to the start annoyed with herself she shook her shoulders my doesnt that sound pathetic it wasnt really it was just structured she scooped back her hair smiled at him so what other games did young seth buchanan play the usual didnt she know how heartbreaking it was to hear that wistfulness in her voice then see that quick careless shrug as she pushed it all aside didnt you have friends of course then she looked away no it doesnt matter i have them now the best of friends do you know any one of the three of you can it runs through the blood she murmured are you close were family he said simply then thought of hers and remembered that such things werent simple they were precious yes were close he was the oldest she mused he would have taken his generational placement seriously and when his father died his responsibilities as man of the house with equal weight it was hardly a wonder then that authority responsibility duty sat so naturally on him she thought of the weapon he wore touched a fingertip to the leather strap have you ever she lifted her gaze to his have you ever had to yes but i can still look myself in the eye in the morning she accepted that without question but the next subject was more difficult you have a scar just here her memory of it was perfect as she touched her finger just under his right shoulder now you were shot five years ago one of those things there was no point in relaying the details the bust gone wrong the shouts and the electric buzz of terror the insult of the bullet and the bright stupefying pain most police work is routine paperwork tedium repetition but not all no not all he wanted to see her smile again wanted to prolong what had evolved into a sweet and intimate interlude in a darkened car just conversation without the sizzle of sex youve got a tattoo on your incredibly perfect bottom she laughed then and tossed her hair back i didnt think youd noticed i noticed why do you have a tattoo of a winged horse on your butt grace it was an impulse one of those wildgirl things i dragged mj and bailey into they have winged horses on their no and what they do have is their little secret i wanted the winged horse because it was free you couldnt catch it unless it wanted to be caught she lifted a hand to his face changed the mood subtly i never wanted to be caught before he nearly believed her lowering his head he met her lips with his let the kiss spin out it was quiet without urgency the slow meeting of tongues the lazy change of angles and depths easy sips testing nibbles her body shifted fluidly her hands sliding up his chest to link at the nape of his neck a purr sounded in her throat its been a long time since i necked in the front seat of a car he nudged her hair aside so that his mouth could find that sweet sensitive curve between neck and shoulder want to try the back seat her laugh was low and delighted absolutely the need had snuck up on him crept into his bloodstream to stagger his heart well go inside her breath was a bit unsteady as she leaned back grinned at him in the shimmer of moonlight chicken his eyes narrowed fractionally making her grin widen theres a perfectly good bed in the house she made a soft clucking noise then chuckling rubbed her lips over his lets pretend she whispered pressing her body to his sliding it against his were on a dark deserted road and youve told me the cars broken down he said her name an exasperated sound against her tempting lips it was only another challenge to her i pretend i believe you because i want to stay i want you to persuade me youll say you just want to touch me and ill pretend i believe that too she took his hand laid it on her breast and felt the quick thrill when his fingers flexed even though i know thats not all you want its not all you want is it seth what he wanted was that dark slippery slide into her his hands moved under her shirt found flesh were not going to make it into the back seat he warned her she only laughed he wasnt sure if he felt smug or stunned by his own behavior when he finally unlocked his front door had he been this randy as a teenager he wondered that ridiculously reckless or was it only grace who made such things as making desperate love in his own driveway one more adventure she stepped inside lifted the hair off her neck then let it fall in a gesture that simply stopped his heart my place should be ready by tomorrow the next day at the latest well have to go there we can skinnydip in my pool its so hot out now youre so beautiful she turned surprised at the mix of resentment and desire in his voice he stood just inside the door as if he might turn at any moment and leave her its a dangerous weapon lethal she tried to smile arrest me you dont like to be told he let out a half laugh you dont like to be told youre beautiful i didnt do anything to earn how i look she said it he realized as if beauty were more of a curse than a gift and in that moment he felt a new level of understanding he stepped forward took her face gently in his hands looked deep and long well maybe your eyes are a little too close together her hitch of laughter was pure surprise they are not and your mouth i think it might be just a hair off center let me check he measured it with his own lingering over the kiss when her lips curved yeah just a hair but it does throw things off now that i really look and lets see he turned her head to each side paused to consider yep the left profiles weak are you getting a double chin there she slapped his hand away torn between insult and laughter i certainly am not i really should check that too i dont know if i want to take this whole thing any further if youre getting a double chin he grabbed her tugging her head back gently by the hair so that he could nibble freely under her jaw she giggled a young foolish sound and squirmed stop that you idiot she let out a shriek when he hauled her up into his arms youre no lightweight either by the way her eyes went to slits okay buster thats all im leaving it was a delight to watch him grin that quick boyish flash of humor i forgot to tell you he said as he headed for the stairs my cars broken down im out of gas the cat ate my homework im just going to touch you hed made it up two steps when the phone rang damn he brushed his lips absently over her brow i have to get that its all right ill remember where you were though he set her down she didnt think her feet hit the floor love was a cushy buffer but her smile faded as she saw his eyes change suddenly they were flat again unreadable she knew as she walked across the room toward him that hed shifted seamlessly from man to cop where his voice was cool again controlled is the scene secured he swore lightly barely a whisper under the breath get it secured im on my way as he hung up his eyes skimmed over her focused im sorry grace i have to go she moistened her lips is it bad i have to go was all hed say ill call for a blackandwhite to take you back to cades cant i wait here for you i dont know how long ill be it doesnt matter she offered a hand but wasnt sure she could reach him id like to wait i want to wait for you no woman ever had that thought passed quickly through his mind distracting him if you get tired of waiting call the precinct ill leave word there for a uniform to drive you home if you call in all right but she wouldnt call in she would wait seth she moved into him brushed her lips against his ill see you when you get back chapter contents prev next alone grace switched on the television settled on the sofa five minutes later she was up and wandering the house he didnt go in for knickknacks she mused probably thought of them as dustcatchers no plants no pets the living room furniture was simple masculine and good quality the sofa was comfortable of generous size and a deep hunter green she would have spruced it up with pillows burgundy navy copper the coffee table was a square of heavy oak highly polished and dustfree she decided he had a weekly housekeeper she just couldnt picture seth wielding a polishing rag there was a bookcase under the side window and crouching she scanned the titles it pleased her that they had read many of the same books there was even a gardening book shed studied herself that she could see she decided yes she could see seth working out in the yard turning the earth planting something that would last there was art in this room as well she moved closer certain the watercolor portraits grouped on the wall were the work of the same artist who had done the cityscape and rural scene in his bedroom she searched for the signature first and found marilyn buchanan looped in the lower corner sister mother cousin she wondered someone he loved and who loved him she shifted her gaze and studied the first painting seths father grace realized with a jolt it had to be the resemblance was there in the eyes clear intense tawny the jaw squared off almost chiseled the artist had seen strength a touch of sadness and honor a whisper of humor around the mouth and an innate pride in the set of the head all were evident in the threequarter profile view that had the subject staring off at something only he could see the next portrait was a woman perhaps in her forties it was a pretty face but the artist hadnt hidden the faint and telltale lines of age the touches of gray in the dark curling hair the hazel eyes looked straight ahead with humor and with patience and there was seths mouth grace thought smiling easily his mother she concluded how much strength was contained inside those quiet gray eyes grace wondered how much was required to stand and accept when everyone you loved faced danger daily whatever the amount this woman possessed it there was another man young twentysomething with a cocky grin and daredevil eyes shades darker than seths attractive sexy with a dark shock of hair falling carelessly over his brow his brother certainly the last was of a young woman with a shoulderlength sweep of dark hair the tawny eyes alert the sculpted mouth just curved in the beginnings of a smile lovely with more of seths seriousness about her than the young man his sister she wondered if she would ever meet them or if she would know them only through their portraits seth would take the woman he loved to them she thought and let the little slice of hurt pass through her he would want to need to bring her into his mothers home watch how she melded and mixed with his family it was a door hed have to open on both sides in welcome not just because it was traditional she realized but because it would matter to him but a lover no she decided it wasnt necessary to share a lover with family hed never take a woman with whom he shared only sex home to meet his mother grace closed her eyes a moment stop feeling sorry for yourself she ordered briskly you cant have everything you want or need so you make the best of what there is she opened her eyes again once more scanned the portraits good faces she thought a good family but where grace wondered was seths portrait there had to be one what had the artist seen had she painted him with that cool cops stare that surprisingly beautiful smile the alltoorare flash of that grin determined to find out she left the television blaring and went on the hunt in the next twenty minutes she discovered that seth lived tidily kept a phone and notepad in every room used the second bedroom as a combination guest room and office had turned the tiny third bedroom into a minigym and liked deep colors and comfortable chairs she found more watercolors but no portrait of the man she circled the guest room curious that here and only here hed indulged in some whimsy recessed shelves held a collection of figures some carved in wood others in stone dragons griffins sorcerers unicorns centaurs and a single winged horse of alabaster caught soaring in midnight here the paintings reflected the magical a misty landscape where a turreted castle rose silver into a pale rosecolored sky a shadowdappled lake where a single white deer drank there were books on arthur on irish legends the gods of olympus and those who had ruled rome and there on the small cherrywood desk was a globe of blue crystal and a book on mithra the god of light it made her tremble clutch her arms had he picked up the book because of the case or had it already been here she touched a hand to the slim volume and was certain it was the latter one more link between them she realized forged before theyd even met it was so easy for her to accept that even to be grateful but she wondered if he felt the same she went downstairs oddly at home after her selfguided tour it made her smile to see their coffee cups from that morning still in the sink a little touch of intimacy she found a bottle of wine in the refrigerator poured herself a glass and took it with her into the living room she went back to the bookcase thinking of curling up on the couch with the tv for company and a book to pass the time then a chill washed over her so quick so intense the wine shook in her hand she found herself staring out the window her breath coming short her other hand clutched on the edge of the bookcase someone watching it pounded in her brain a frightened whispering voice that might have been her own someone watching but she saw nothing but the dark the shimmer of moonlight the quiet house across the street stop it she ordered herself theres no one there theres nothing there but she straightened and quickly twitched the curtains closed her hands were shaking she sipped wine tried to laugh at herself the latebreaking bulletin on the television had her turning slowly a family of four in nearby bethesda murdered she knew where seth had gone now and could only imagine what he was dealing with she was alone devane sat in his treasure room stroking an ivory statue of the goddess venus hed come to think of it as grace as his obsession festered and grew he imagined grace and himself together immortal through time she would be his most prized possession his goddess and the three stars would complete his collection of the priceless of course she would have to be punished first he knew what had to be done what would matter most to her and the other two women were not blameless they had complicated his plans caused him to fail they would have to die of course after he had the stars after he had grace they would die and their deaths would be her punishment now she was alone it would be so easy to take her now to bring her here shed be afraid at first he wanted her to be afraid it was part of her punishment eventually he would woo her win her own her they would have after all several lifetimes to be together in one of them he would take her back to terresa he would make her a queen a god could settle for no less than a queen take her tonight the voice that spoke louder and louder in his head every day taunted him he couldnt trust it devane steadied his breathing shut his eyes he would not be rushed every detail had to be in place grace would come to him when he was prepared and she would bring him the stars seth downed one last cup of sludgy coffee and rubbed at the ache at the back of his neck his stomach was still raw from what hed seen in that neat suburban home he knew civilians and rookie cops believed the vets became immune to the results of violent death the sights the smells the meaningless waste it was a lie no one could become used to seeing what hed seen if they could they shouldnt wear a badge the law needed to retain its sense of disgust of horror for murder what drove a man to take the lives of his own children of the woman hed made them with and then his own thered been no one left in that neat suburban home to answer that question he knew it would haunt him seth scrubbed his hands over his face felt the knots of tension and fatigue he rolled his shoulders once twice then squared them before cutting through the bull pen toward the locker room mick marshall was there rubbing his sore feet his wiry red hair stood up like a bush that needed trimming from a face lined with weariness his eyes were shadowed his mouth was grim lieutenant he pulled his socks back on you didnt have to come in on this detective hell i heard the gunshots from my own living room he picked up one of his shoes but just rested his elbows on his knees two blocks over jesus my kids played with those kids how the hell am i going to explain this how well did you know the father didnt really its just like they always say lieutenant he was a quiet guy polite kept to himself he gave a short humorless laugh they always do mulrooneys taking the case you can assist if you want now go home get some sleep go in and kiss your kids yeah mick scraped his fingers through his hair listen lieutenant i got some data on that devane guy seths spine tingled anything interesting depends on what floats your boat hes fiftytwo never married inherited a big fat pile from his old man including this big vineyard on that island that terresa grows olives too runs some cattle the gentleman farmer oh hes got more going than that lots of interests spread out all over hell and back shipping communications importexport lots of fingers in lots of pies generating lots of dough he was made ambassador to the us three years ago seems to like it here he bought some nifty place on foxhall road big mansion likes to entertain people dont like to talk about him though they get real nervous money and power make some people nervous yeah i havent gotten a lot of information yet but there was a woman about five years ago opera singer pretty big deal if youre into that sort of thing italian lady seems like they were pretty tight then she disappeared disappeared seths waning interest snapped back how thats the thing she just went poof italian police cant figure it she had a place in milan left all her things clothes jewelry the works she was singing at that opera house there in the middle of a run you know didnt show for the evening performance she went shopping on that afternoon had a bunch of things sent back to her place but she never went back they figure kidnapping they did but then there was no ransom call no body no sign of her in nearly five years she was mick screwed up his face in thought thirty supposed to be at the top of her form and a hell of a looker she left a big pile of lire in her accounts its still there devane was questioned yeah seems he was on his yacht in the ionian sea soaking up rays and drinking ouzo when it all went down a halfdozen guests on board with him the italian cop i talked to big opera fan by the way he didnt think devane seemed shocked enough or upset enough he smelled something but couldnt make anything stick still the guy offered a reward five million lire for her safe return no one ever collected id say that was fairly interesting keep digging and seth thought hed start doing some digging himself one more thing mick cracked his neck from side to side and i thought this was interesting too the guys a collector he has a little of everything coins stamps jewelry art antiques statuary he does it all but hes also reputed to have a unique and extensive gem collection rivals the smithsonians devane likes rocks oh yeah and get this two years ago more or less he paid three mil for an emerald big rock sure but its price spiked because it was supposed to be a magic rock the very idea made micks lips curl merlin was supposed to have you know conjured it up for arthur seems to me a guy whod buy into that would be pretty interested in three big blue rocks and all that god and immortality stuff that goes with them i just bet he would and wasnt it odd seth mused that devanes name hadnt been on baileys list a collector whose us residence was only miles from salvini yet hed never done business with them no the lack was too odd to believe get me what youve got when you go on shift mick id like to talk to that italian cop personally i appreciate the extra time you put into this mick blinked seth never failed to thank his men for good work but it was generally mechanical there had been genuine warmth this time on a personal level sure no sweat but you know lieutenant even if you can tie this guy to the case hell bounce diplomatic immunity we cant touch him lets tie him first then well see seth glanced over distracted when a locker slammed open nearby as a cop was coming on shift get some sleep he began then broke off there taped to the back of the locker was grace young laughing and naked her head was tossed back and that teasing smile that feminine confidence that silky power sparkled in her eyes her skin was like polished marble her curves were generous with only that rainfall of hair artfully draped to drive a man insane covering her mick turned his head saw the centerfold and winced cade had filled him in on the lieutenants relationship with grace and all mick could think was that someone very likely the cop currently standing at his locker whistling moronically was about to die ah lieutenant mick began with some brave thought of saving his associates me seth merely held up a hand cut mick off and walked to the locker the cop changing his shirt glanced over lieutenant bradley seth said and continued to study the glossy photo shes something else isnt she one of the guys on day shift said shed been in and looked just as good in person did he you bet i dug this out of a pile of magazines in my garage none the worse for wear bradley mick whispered the name and buried his head in his hands the guy was dead meat seth took a long breath resisted the urge to rip the photo down female officers share this locker room bradley this is inappropriate where was the tattoo seth thought hazily what had she been when she posed for this nineteen twenty find somewhere else to hang your art yes sir seth turned away then shot one last look over his shoulder and shes better in person much better bradley mick said as seth strode out you just dodged one major bullet dawn was breaking when seth let himself into the house hed gone by the book on the case in bethesda it would close when the forensic and autopsy reports confirmed what he already knew a man of thirtysix who made a comfortable living as a computer programmer had gotten up from his sofa where he was watching television loaded his revolver and ended four lives in the approximate space of ten minutes for this crime seth could offer no justice he could have headed home two hours earlier but hed made use of the time difference in europe to make calls ask questions gather data he was slowly putting together a picture of gregor devane a man of wealth he had never sweated for one who enjoyed prestige and power who traveled in exalted circles and had no family there was no crime in any of that seth thought as he closed his front door behind him there was no crime in sending white roses to a beautiful woman or in once being involved with one whod disappeared but wasnt it interesting that devane had been involved with another woman a frenchwoman a prima ballerina of great beauty whod been considered the finest dancer of the decade and who had been found dead of a drug overdose in her paris home the verdict had been suicide though those closest to her insisted she had never used drugs she had been fiercely disciplined about her body devane had been questioned in that matter as well but only as a matter of form he had been dining at the white house at the very hour the young dancer slipped into a coma and then into death still seth and the italian detective agreed it was quite a fascinating coincidence a collector seth mused switching off lights automatically an acquirer of beautiful things and beautiful women a man who would pay double the value of an emerald to possess a legend as well he would see how many more threads he could tie and he would he decided have an official chat with the ambassador he stepped into the living room started to hit the next switch and saw grace curled upon the couch hed assumed shed gone home but there she was curled into a tight protective ball on his couch sleeping what the hell was she doing here he wondered waiting for you just as she said she would as no woman had waited before as hed wanted no woman to wait emotion thudded into his chest flooded into his heart it undid him he realized this irrational love his heart wasnt safe here wasnt even his own any longer he wanted it back wanted desperately to be able to turn away leave her and go back to his life it terrified him that he wouldnt couldnt she was bound to get bored before too much longer to lose interest in a relationship he imagined was fueled by impulse and sex on her part would she just drift away he wondered or end it cleanly it would be clean he decided that would be her way she wasnt as hed once wanted to believe callous or cold or calculating she had a very giving heart but he thought it was also a restless one moving over he crouched in front of her studied her face there was a faint line between her brows she didnt sleep easily he realized what dreams chased her he asked himself what worries nagged her poor little rich girl he thought still running until youre out of breath and theres nothing to do but go back to the start he stroked a thumb over her brow to smooth it then slid his arms under her come on baby he murmured time for bed no she pushed at him struggled dont more nightmares concerned he gathered her close its seth its all right ive got you watching me she turned her face into his shoulder outside everywhere watching me shhh no ones here he carried her toward the steps realizing now why every light in the house had been blazing shed been afraid to be alone in the dark yet shed stayed no ones going to hurt you grace i promise seth she surfaced to the sound of his voice and her heavy eyes opened and focused on his face seth she said again she touched a hand to his cheek then her lips you look so tired we can switch you can carry me she slid her arms around him pressed her cheek warm to his i heard on the news the family in bethesda you didnt have to wait seth she eased back met his eyes i wont talk about it he said flatly dont ask you wont talk about it because it troubles you to talk about it or because you wont share those troubles with me he set her down beside the bed turned away and peeled off his shirt im tired grace i have to be back in a few hours i need to sleep all right she rubbed the heel of her hand over her heart where it hurt the most ive already had some sleep ill go downstairs and call a cab he hung his shirt over the back of a chair sat to take off his shoes if thats what you want its not what i want but it seems its what you want she barely lifted a brow when he heaved his shoe across the room then he stared at it as if it had leaped there on its own i dont do things like that he said between his teeth i never do things like that why not it always makes me feel better and because he looked so exhausted and so baffled by himself she relented walking to him she stepped in close to where he sat and began to knead the stiff muscles of his shoulders you know what you need around here lieutenant she dipped her head to kiss the top of his besides me of course you need to get yourself a bubble tub something you can sink down into thatll beat all these knots out of you but for now well see what i can do about them her hands felt like glory smoothing out the knotted muscles in his shoulders why thats one of your favorite questions isnt it come on lie down let me work on this rock you call a back i just need to sleep umhmm taking charge she nudged him back climbed onto the bed to kneel beside him roll over handsome i like this view better he managed a half smile toyed with the ends of her hair why dont you come here im too tired to fight you off ill keep that in mind she gave him a push roll over big boy with a grunt he rolled over on his stomach then let out a second grunt when she straddled him and those wonderful hands began to press and stroke and knead you being you would consider a regular massage an indulgence but thats where youre wrong she pressed down with the heels of her hands worked forward to knead with her fingertips you give your body relief it works better for you i get one every week at the club stefan could do wonders for you stefan he closed his eyes and tried not to think about another man with his hands all over her figures hes a professional she said dryly and his wife is a pediatric therapist shes wonderful with the children at the hospital he thought of the children and that was what weakened him that and her soothing hands her quiet voice sunlight filtered a warm red through his closed lids but he could still see the kids were in bed her hands froze for a moment then with a long quiet breath she moved them again up and down his spine over his shoulder blades up to the tight length of his neck and she waited the youngest girl had a doll one of those raggedy anns an old one she was still holding it there were disney posters all over the walls all those fairy tales and happy endings the way its supposed to be when youre a kid the older girl had one of those teen magazines beside the bed the kind tenyearolds read because they cant wait to be sixteen they never woke up never knew neither one of them would get to be sixteen she said nothing there was nothing that could be said but leaning down she touched her lips to the back of his shoulder and felt him let loose a long ragged breath it twists you when its kids i dont know a cop who can deal with it without having it twist his guts the mother was on the stairs looks like she heard the shots starting running up to her kids after he went back to the living room sat down on the sofa and finished it she curled herself into him hugged herself to his back and just held on try to sleep she murmured stay please i will she closed her eyes listened to his breathing deepen ill stay but he woke alone as sleep was clearing he wondered if hed dreamed the meeting at dawn yet he could smell her on the air on his own skin where shed curled close he was still stretched crosswise over the bed and he tilted his wrist to check the watch hed neglected to take off whatever else was going on inside him his internal clock was still in working order he gave himself an extra two minutes under the shower to beat back fatigue and when shaving promised himself to do nothing more than vegetate on his next personal day he pretended it wasnt going to be another hot humid hazy day while he knotted his tie then he swore scooped fingers though his justcombed hair remembering hed neglected to set the timer on his coffeemaker the minutes it would take to brew it would not only set his teeth on edge they would eat into his schedule but the one thing he categorically refused to do was start the day with the poison that simmered at the cop shop his mind was so focused on coffee that when the scent of it wafted like a sirens call as he came down the stairs he thought it was an illusion not only was the pot full of gloriously rich black liquid grace was sitting at his kitchen table reading the morning paper and nibbling on a bagel her hair was scooped back from her face and she appeared to be wearing nothing more than one of his shirts good morning she smiled up at him then shook her head are you human how can you look so official and intimidating on less than three hours sleep practice i thought youd gone i told you id stay coffees hot i hope you dont mind that i helped myself no he stood exactly where he was i dont mind if its all right with you ill just loiter over coffee awhile before i get dressed ill get myself back to cades and change i want to drop by the hospital later this morning then im going home its time i did the cleaning crew should be finished by this afternoon so i thought she trailed off as he just continued to stare at her what is it she gave an uncertain smile and rubbed at her nose keeping his eyes on hers he took the phone from the wall and punched in a number on memory this is buchanan he said i wont be in for a couple hours im taking personal time he hung up held out a hand come back to bed please she rose and put her hand in his when clothes were scattered carelessly on the floor the sheets turned back the shades pulled to filter the beat of the sun he covered her he needed to hold to touch to indulge himself for one hour with the flow of emotion she caused in him only an hour yet he didnt hurry instead he lingered over slow deep drugging kisses that lasted eons loitered over long smooth soft caresses that stretched into forever she was there for him simply there open giving offering a seemingly endless supply of warmth she sighed shakily as he stroked her to helpless response moving over her tenderly his patience infinite each time their mouths met with that slow slide of tongue her heart shuddered in her breast there were the soft slippery sounds of intimacy the quiet murmurs of lovers drifting into sighs and moans both of them were lost mired in thick layers of sensation the air around them like syrup causing movement to slow and pleasure to last her breath sighed out as he trailed lazily down her body with hands and mouth as her own hands stroked over his back then his shoulders she opened for him arching up in welcome then shuddering as his tongue brought on a long rolling climax and because he needed it as much as she she let her hands fall limply let him take her wherever he chose her blood beat hot and the heat brought a dew of roused passion to her skin his hands slicked over her skin like silk tell me you want me he trailed slow openmouthed kisses up her torso yes she gripped his hips urged him i want you tell me you need me his tongue slid over her nipple yes she moaned again when he suckled gently i need you tell me you love me but that he demanded only in his mind as he brought his mouth to hers again sank into that wet willing promise now he kept his eyes open and on hers yes she rose to meet him now he glided inside her filling her so slowly so achingly that they both trembled he saw her eyes swim with tears and found the urge for tenderness stronger than any other he kissed her again softly moved inside her one slow beat at a time the sweetness of it had a tear spilling over trailing down her glowing cheek her lips trembled and he felt her muscles contract and clutch him dont close your eyes he whispered it sipped the tear from her cheek i want to see your eyes when i take you over she couldnt stop it the tenderness stripped her her vision blurred with tears and the blue of her eyes deepened to midnight she said his name then murmured it again against his lips and her body quivered as the next long undulating wave swamped her i cant let me have you he was falling falling falling and he buried his face in her hair let me have all of you chapter contents prev next in the nursery grace was rocking an infant the baby girl was barely big enough to fill the crook of her arm from elbow to wrist but the tiny infant watched her steadily with the deeply blue eyes of a newborn the hole in her heart had been repaired and her prognosis was good youre going to be fine carrie your mama and papa are so worried about you but youre going to be just fine she stroked the babys cheek and thought hoped carrie smiled a little grace was tempted to sing her to sleep but knew the nursing staff rolled their eyes and snickered whenever she tried a lullaby still the babies were rarely critical of her admittedly poor singing voice so she half sang half murmured until carries baby owls eyes grew heavy even when she slept grace continued to rock it was selfserving now she knew anyone who had ever rocked a baby understood that it soothed the adult as well as the child and here with an infant dozing in her arms and her own eyes heavy she could admit her deepest secret she pined for children of her own she longed to carry them inside her to feel the weight the movement within to push them into life with that last sharp pang of childbirth to hold them to her breast and feel them drink from her she wanted to walk the floor with them when they were fretful to watch them sleep to raise them and watch them grow she thought closing her eyes as she rocked to care for them to comfort them in the night even to watch them take that first wrenching step away from her motherhood was her greatest wish and her most secret desire when she first involved herself with the pediatric wing shed worried that she was doing so to assuage that gnawing ache inside her but she knew it wasnt true the first time she held a sick child in her arms and gave comfort shed understood that her commitment encompassed so much more she had so much to give such an abundance of love that needed to be offered and here it could be accepted without question without judgment here at least she could do something worthwhile something that mattered carrie matters she murmured kissing the top of the sleeping babys head before she rose to settle her in her crib and one day soon youll go home strong and healthy you wont remember that i once rocked you to sleep when your mama couldnt be here but i will she smiled at the nurse who came in stepped back she seems so much better shes a tough little fighter youve got a wonderful touch with the babies ms fontaine the nurse picked up charts began to make notes ill try to give you an hour or so in a couple of days and youll be able to reach me at home again if you need to oh the nurse looked up peered over the top of wireframed glasses the murder at graces home and the ensuing investigation were hot topics at the hospital are you sure youll be comfortable at home im going to make sure im comfortable grace gave carrie a final look then stepped out into the hall she just had time she decided to stop by the pediatric ward and visit the older children then she could call seths office and see if he was interested in a little dinner for two at her place she turned and nearly walked into devane gregor she fixed a smile on her face to mask the sudden odd bumping of her heart what a surprise is someone ill he stared at her unblinking ill what was wrong with his eyes she wondered that they seemed so pale and unfocused we are in the hospital she said keeping the smile on her face and vaguely concerned she laid a hand on his arm are you all right he snapped back appalled for a moment his mind seemed to have switched off hed only been able to see her to smell her quite well he assured her momentarily distracted i didnt expect to see you either of course that was a lie hed planned the meeting meticulously he took her hand bowed over it kissed her fingers it is of course a pleasure to see you anywhere ive come by here as our mutual friends interested me in the care children receive here children and their welfare are a particular interest of mine really her smile warmed immediately mine too would you like a quick tour with you as my guide how could i not he turned signaled to two men who stood stiffly several paces back bodyguards he told grace tucking her hand into the crook of his arm and patting it distressingly necessary in todays climate tell me why am i so fortunate as to find you here today as she usually did she covered the truth and kept her privacy the fontaines donated significantly to this particular wing i like to stop in from time to time to see what the hospitals doing with it she flashed a twinkling look and you just never know when you might run into a handsome doctor or ambassador she strolled along explaining various sections and wondering how much she might with a little time and charm wheedle out of him for the children general pediatrics is on the floor above since this section houses maternity they wouldnt want kids zooming down the corridors while mothers are in labor or resting yes children can be quite boisterous he detested them its one of my deepest regrets that i have none of my own but having never found the right woman he gestured with his free hand as i grow older im resigned to having no one to carry on my name gregor youre in your prime a strong vital man who can have as many children as he likes for years yet ah he looked into her eyes again but there is still the right woman to be found she felt a shiver of discomfort at his pointed statements and intense gaze im sure youll find her we have some preemies here she stepped closer to the glass so tiny she said softly so defenseless its a pity when theyre flawed she frowned at his choice of words some of them need more time under controlled conditions and medical care to fully develop but i wouldnt call them flawed another error he thought with an inner sense of irritation he could not seem to keep his mind sharp with her scent invading his senses ah my english is sometimes awkward you must forgive me she smiled again wanting to ease his obvious discomfort your english is wonderful is it clever enough to convince you share a quiet lunch with me as friends he said lacing his smile with regret with similar interests she glanced as he did at the babies it was tempting she admitted he was a charming man a wealthy and influential one she might with careful campaigning persuade him to assist her in setting up an international branch of falling star an ambition that had been growing in her lately i would love to gregor but right now im simply swamped i was just on my way home when i ran into you i have to check on some repairs that seemed the simplest way to explain it but id love to have a rain check one id hope to cash in very soon theres something concerning our similar interests that id love to have your advice on and your input i would love to be of any service whatsoever he kissed her hand again tonight he thought he would have her tonight and there would be no more need for this charade thats so kind of you because she felt guilty for her disinterest and coolness in the face of his interest she kissed his cheek i really must run do call me about that rain check next week perhaps for lunch with a final flashing smile she dashed off as he watched her his fisted fingers dug crescents into his palms fighting for control he nodded to one of the silent men who waited for him follow her only he ordered and wait for instructions cade didnt think of himself as a whiner and considering how well he tolerated his own family he believed himself one of the most patient most amiable of men but he was certain that if grace had him shift one more piece of furniture from one end of her enormous living area to the other he would break down and weep it looks great hmm she stood one hand on her hip the fingers of the other tapping against her lip the gleam in her eye was enough to strike terror in cades heart and had his already aching muscles crying out in protest really fabulous a hundred percent get the camera i see a cover of house and garden here youre wheedling cade she said absently maybe the conversation pit did look better facing the other way his moan was pitiful and only made her lips twitch of course that would mean the coffee table and those two accent pieces would have to shift and the palm tree isnt it a beauty would have to go there the beauty weighed fifty pounds if it weighed an ounce cade abandoned pride and whined i still have stitches he reminded her ah whats a few stitches to a big strong man like you she fluttered at him patted his cheek and watched his ego war with his sore back giving in she let loose a long rolling laugh gotcha its fine darling absolutely fine you dont have to carry another cushion you mean it his eyes went puppylike with hope its done not only is it done but youre going to sit down put up your feet while i go get you an icy beer that i stocked in my fridge just for tall handsome private investigators youre a goddess so ive been told make yourself at home ill be right back when grace came back bearing a tray she saw that cade had taken her invitation to heart he sat back on the thick cobaltblue cushions of her new ushaped sofa arrangement his feet propped on the mirrorbright surface of the ebony coffee table his eyes shut i really did wear you out didnt i he grunted opened one eye then both popped open in appreciation when she set the loaded tray on the table food he said and sprang for it she had to laugh as he dived into her offer of glossy green grapes brie and crackers the heap of caviar on ice with toast points its the least i can do for such an attractive moving man settling beside him she picked up the glass of wine shed poured for herself i owe you cade with his mouth halffull he scanned the living room nodded damn straight i dont just mean the manual labor you gave me a safe haven when i needed one and most of all i owe you for bailey you dont owe me for bailey i love her i know so do i ive never seen her happier she was just waiting for you leaning over grace kissed his cheek i always wanted a brother now with you and jack i have two instant family they fit too dont they she commented mj and jack as if theyve always been a team they keep each other on their toes its fun to watch it is and speaking of jack i thought he was going to give you a hand with our little redecorating project cade scooped caviar onto a piece of toast he had a skip to trace a what a bail jumper to bring in he didnt think it was going to take him long cade swallowed sighed he doesnt know what hes missing ill give him the chance to find out she smiled i still have plans for a couple of the rooms upstairs it gave cade his opening you know grace i wonder if youre rushing this a little its going to take some time to put a house this size back in shape bailey and i would like you to stay at our place for a while their place grace mused already it was their place its more than livable here cade mj and i talked about it she continued she and jack are going to her apartment its time we all got back to our routines but mj wasnt going to be alone cade thought and thoughtfully sipped his beer theres still somebody pulling the strings out there somebody who wants the three stars i dont have them grace reminded him i cant get them theres no reason to bother with me at this point i dont know how much reason has to do with it grace i dont like you being here alone just like a brother delighted with him she gave his arm a squeeze listen cade ive got a new alarm system and im considering buying a big mean ugly dog she started to mention the pistol she had in her nightstand and the fact that she knew how to use it but thought that would only worry him more ill be fine what does buchanan think i havent asked him hes going to come by later so i wont really be alone satisfied with that cade handed her a grape youve got him worried her lips curved as she popped the grape into her mouth do i i dont know him well i dont think anyone does hes i guess selfcontained would be the word doesnt let a lot show on the surface but when i walked in yesterday after youd gone upstairs he was just standing there looking up after you now cade grinned there was plenty on the surface then it was pretty illuminating seth buchanan human being then he winced tipped back his beer sorry i didnt mean to its all right i know exactly what you mean hes got an almost terrifying self control and that impenetrable aura of authority it seems to me that youve managed to dent the armor in my opinion thats just what he needed youre just what he needed i hope he thinks so it turns out hes just what i needed im in love with him with a half laugh she shook her head and sipped her wine i cant believe i told you that i rarely tell men my secrets brothers are different she smiled at him yes they are i hope seth appreciates just how lucky he is i dont think seth believes in luck she suspected seth didnt believe in the three stars of mithra either and she had discovered that she did in a very short time shed simply opened her mind stretched her imagination and accepted they had magic and they had power she had been touched by both as had bailey and mj and the men who were linked to them grace had no doubt that whoever wanted that magic that power would stop at nothing to gain them it wouldnt matter when they were in the museum he would still crave them still plot to possess them but he could no longer reach the stones through her that part of her connection she thought with relief was over she was safe in her own home and would learn to live there again starting now she dressed carefully in a long white dress of thin watered silk that left her shoulders bare and fluted with her ankles beneath the flowing silk she wore only skin creamed and scented she left her hair loose scooped back at the sides with silver combs her mothers sapphire drops at her ears gleaming like twin stars on impulse shed clasped a thick silver bracelet high on her forearm a touch of pagan when she looked into the mirror after dressing shed felt an odd jolt as if she could see herself in the glass with the faint ghost of someone else merged with her but shed laughed it off chalked it up to nerves and anticipation and busied herself completing her preparations she filled the rooms shed redone with candles and flowers pleased with the welcome they offered on the table by the window facing her side garden she arranged the china and crystal for her meticulously plotted dinner for two the champagne was iced the music was on low and the lights were romantically dimmed all she needed was the man seth saw the candles in the windows when he pulled up in the drive fatigue layered over frustration and had him in the dim light of the car rubbing gritty eyes and there were candles in the windows he was forced to admit that for the first time in his adult life he didnt have a handle on himself or on the world around him he certainly didnt have a handle on the woman who had lit those candles and who was waiting in that soft flickering light hed moved on devane on pure instinct and part of that instinct he knew was territorial nothing could have been more out of character for him perhaps that was why he was feeling slightly out of himself out of control grace had become a center a focal point or was it an obsession hadnt he come here because he couldnt keep away just as he had dug into devanes background because the man roused some primal defense mechanism maybe that was how it started seth admitted but his cops instincts were still honed devane was dirty and with a little more time a little more digging he would link the man with the deaths surrounding the diamonds without the diplomatic block seth thought he had enough already to bring the man in for questioning devane liked to collect and he collected the rare the precious and frequently those items that held some whiff of magic and gregor devane had financed an expedition the year before to search for the legendary stars a rival archaeologist had found them first and the washington museum had acquired them devane had lost more than two million dollars on the hunt and the stars had slipped through his fingers and the rival archeologist had met with a tragic and fatal accident three months after the find in the jungles of costa rica seth didnt believe in coincidence the man who had kept devane from possessing the diamonds was dead and so seth had discovered was the head of the expedition devane had put together no he didnt believe in coincidence devane had been a resident of dc for nearly two years on and off without ever meeting grace now directly after graces connection with the stars the man was not only at the same social function but happened to make a play for her life simply wasnt that tidy a little more time seth promised himself rubbing his temples to clear the headache hed find the solid connection link devane to the salvinis to the bail bondsman to the men who had died in a crashed van to carlo monturri he needed only one link and then the rest of the chain would fall into place but at the moment he needed to get out of the stuffy car go inside and face what was happening to his personal life with a short laugh seth climbed out of the car a personal life wasnt that part of the problem hed never had one hadnt allowed himself one now a matter of days after hed met grace it was threatening to swallow him he needed time there too he told himself time to step back gain some distance for a more objective look hed allowed things to move too fast to get out of control that would have to be fixed a man who fell in love overnight couldnt trust himself it was time to reassert some logic they were dynamically different in backgrounds in lifestyles and in goals physical attraction was bound to fade or certainly stabilize he could already foresee her easing back once the initial excitement peaked shed grow restless certainly annoyed with the demands on his work he would be neither willing nor able to spin her through the social whirl that was such an intricate part of her life she was bound to look toward someone else who would a beautiful woman vital soughtafter flattered at every turn wouldnt be content to light a candle in the window for many nights hed be doing them both a favor by slowing down stepping back as he lifted a hand to the gleaming brass knocker he refused to hear the mocking voice inside his head that called him a liar and a coward she answered the knock quickly as if shed only been waiting for it she stood in the doorway soft light filtering through the long flow of white silk the power of her pure and pagan stopped his breath though he kept his arms at his sides she moved into him and ripped at his heart with a welcoming kiss its good to see you grace skimmed her fingers along his cheekbones under his shadowed eyes youve had a long one lieutenant come in and relax i havent got a lot of time ive got work he waited saw the flicker of disappointment in her eyes it helped justify what he was determined to do but then she smiled took his hand well lets not waste what time youve got standing in the foyer you havent eaten have you why didnt she ask him why he couldnt stay he wondered irrationally irritated why wasnt she complaining no good sit down and have a drink can you have a drink or are you officially on duty she walked into the living area as she spoke then drew the chilling champagne from its silver bucket i dont suppose one glass would matter in any case and i wont tell she released the cork with an experts twist and a muffled celebratory pop ive just put the canapes out so help yourself she gestured toward the silver tray on the coffee table before moving off with a quiet slippery rustle of silk to pour two flutes tell me what you think i worked poor cade to death pushing things around in here but i wanted to get at least the living space in order again quickly it looked as if it had been clipped from a glossy magazine on perfect living nothing was out of place everything was gleaming and lovely bold colors mixed with whites and blacks tasteful knickknacks and artwork that appeared to have been selected with incredible care over a long period of time yet shed done it in days or hours that seth supposed was the power of wealth and breeding yet the room didnt look calculated or cold it looked generous and welcoming soft surfaces soft edges with touches that were so grace everywhere antique bottles in jewel tones a china cat curled up for a nap a lush thriving fern in a copper pot and flowers candlelight he looked up noted the unbroken gleam of wood circling the balcony i see youve had it repaired somethings wrong was all she could think as she stepped forward and handed him his glass yes i wanted that done as soon as possible that and the new security system i think youll approve ill take a look at it if you like id like it better if youd relax while you can why dont i bring dinner in you cooked now she laughed i wouldnt do that to you but im an expert at ordering in and at presentation try to unwind ill be right back as she glided out he looked down at the tray a silver bowl of glossy black caviar little fancy bites of elegant finger foods he turned his back on them and carrying his glass walked over to study her portrait when she came back wheeling an antique cart he continued to look at her painted face he was in love with you wasnt he the artist grace drew a careful breath at that cool tone yes he was he knew i didnt love him i often wished i could have charles is one of the kindest gentlest men i know did you sleep with him a chill snaked up her spine but she kept her hands steady as she set plates on the candle and flowerdecked table no it wouldnt have been fair and i care about him too much youd rather sleep with men you dont care about she hadnt seen it coming grace realized how foolish of her not to have seen this coming no but i wont sleep with men who i could hurt like that i would have hurt charles by being his lover so i stayed his friend and the wives he did turn now eyes narrowed as he studied the woman instead of the portrait like the woman who was married to that earl you were mixed up with didnt you worry about hurting her grace picked up her wine again quite deliberately cocked her head she had never slept with the earl hed mentioned or with any other married man but she had never bothered to argue with public perception nor would she bother to deny it now why would i i wasnt married to her and the guy who tried to kill himself after you broke your engagement she touched the glass to her lips swallowed frothy wine that burned like shards of glass in her throat overly dramatic of him wasnt it i dont think youre in the mood for caesar salad and steak diane are you lieutenant rich food doesnt set well during interrogations no ones interrogating you grace oh yes you are but you neglected to read me my rights her frigid anger helped justify his own it wasnt the men he knew it wasnt the men hed very deliberately tossed in her face that scraped at him it was the fact that they didnt matter to him that somehow nothing seemed to matter but her its odd youre so sensitive about answering questions about men grace you hadnt troubled to hide your track record i expected better from you she said it softly so he barely heard then shook her head smiled coolly foolish of me no ive never troubled to hide anything unless it mattered the men didnt matter for the most part do you want me to tell you that youre different would you believe me if i did he was afraid he would terrified he would it isnt necessary weve moved too fast grace im not comfortable with it i see she thought she did now perfectly youd like to slow things down she set her glass aside knowing her hand would start to shake it appears youve taken a couple of those giant steps while ive had my back turned i really should have played that game as a child so id be more alert for sudden moves this isnt a game no i suppose it isnt she had her pride but she also had her heart and she had to know how could you have made love with me like that this morning seth and do this tonight how could you have touched me the way you have the way no one ever has and hurt me like this it was because of what had swamped him that morning he realized the helplessness of his need im not trying to hurt you no that only makes it worse youre doing both of us a favor arent you isnt that how youve worked it out break things off before they get too messy too late her voice broke but she managed to shore it up again its already messy damn it he took a step toward her then stopped dead when her head whipped up and those hot blue eyes scorched him dont even think about touching me now when those thoughts are still in your head you go your tidy way lieutenant and ill go mine i dont believe in slowing down you either go forward or you stop furious with herself she lifted a hand and flicked a tear off her cheek apparently weve stopped chapter contents prev next he stood there wondering what in the hell he was doing here was the woman he loved who by some wild twist of fate might actually love him here was a chance for that life hed never allowed himself the family the home the woman he was pushing them all away with both hands and couldnt seem to stop grace i want to give us both time to consider what were doing where this is going no you dont she tossed back her hair with one angry jerk of her head do you think because ive only known you a matter of days that i dont understand how your head works ive been more intimate with you than ive been with anyone in my life i know you she managed a deep ragged breath what you want is to get that wheel back under your hands that control button back under your thumb this whole thing has run away from you and you just cant let that happen that may be true was true he realized was absolutely mortifyingly true but it doesnt change the point im in the middle of an investigation and im not as objective as i need to be because im involved with you after its done after its done what she demanded we pick up where you left off i dont think so lieutenant what happens when youre in the middle of the next investigation and the next do i strike you as someone whos going to wait around until you have the time and the room to continue an onagain offagain relationship with me no his spine stiffened im a cop and my work takes priority i dont believe ive ever asked you to change that in fact i found your dedication to your work admirable attractive even heroic her smile was thin and brief but thats irrelevant and so is this conversation she turned away picked up her wine again you know the way out no shed never asked him to change anything never questioned his work what the hell had he done this needs to be discussed thats your style not mine do you actually think you can stand here in my home her voice began to hitch and jerk in my home and break my heart dump me and expect a civilized conversation i want you out she slammed her glass down snapping the fragile stem of the glass splattering wine right now where had the panic come from he wondered his beeper went off and was ignored were not leaving it this way exactly this way she corrected do you think im stupid do you think i dont see that you walked in here tonight looking to pick a fight so that it would end exactly this way do you think i dont know now that no matter how much i gave you youd hold back from me question analyze dissect everything well analyze this i was willing to give more whatever you wanted to take now you can spend the rest of your life wondering just what you lost here tonight as his beeper sounded again she swept by him wrenched open the front door youll have to answer that call of duty elsewhere lieutenant he stepped to her but though his arms ached he resisted the need to reach out when im done with this im coming back you wont be welcome he could feel himself step up to a line hed never crossed that isnt going to matter im coming back she said nothing at all simply shut the door in his face and turned the lock with a hard audible click she leaned back against the door her breath shallow now and hot as pain swept through her it was worse now that the door was closed now that she had shut him out and the candles still flickered the flowers still bloomed she saw that every step shed taken that day and the day before all they way back to the moment shed walked into her own home and seen him coming down the stairs toward her had been leading to this moment of blind grief and loss shed been powerless to stop it she thought to change what she was what had come before or what would come after it was only fools who believed they controlled their own destiny as shed once believed she controlled hers and shed been a fool to indulge in those pathetic fantasies dreams where they had belonged together where theyd made a life together a home and children together where shed believed she was only waiting for him to finally make all those longings that had always always been one handspan out of her reach come true the mythical power of the stones she thought with a half laugh love knowledge and generosity their magic had been cruel to her giving her that tantalizing glimpse of her every desire then wrenching it away again and leaving her alone the knock on the door had her closing her eyes how dare he come back she thought how dare he after hed smashed all her dreams her hopes her needs and how dare she still love him in spite of it well he wouldnt see her cry she promised herself and straightened to scrub her hands over her damp cheeks he wouldnt see her crawl he wouldnt see her at all because she wouldnt let him in resolutely she headed for the phone he wouldnt be pleased when she called and reported an intruder she mused but it would make her point she picked up the receiver just as the sound of shattering glass had her whirling toward her terrace doors she had time to see the man burst through them time to hear her alarm scream in warning she even had time to struggle as thick arms grabbed her then the cloth was over her face smelling sickeningly of chloroform and she had time only to think of seth before her world spun and went black seth was barely three miles away when the next call came through he jerked up his phone snarled into it buchanan lieutenant detective marshall again i just heard an automatic come through on dispatch suspected breakin east lark lane potomac what for one stunning moment his mind went blank grace i recognized the address from the homicide her alarm systems been triggered she didnt answer the checkin call im five minutes from there he was already swinging around in a fast tiresquealing turn get the two closest blackandwhites on the scene now im already on it lieutenant but seth had already tossed the phone aside it was a new system seth told himself fighting for calm and logic new systems often had glitches she was upset not answering her phone ignoring the confusion it would be just like her she was even now defiantly pouring herself another glass of champagne cursing him maybe shed even set off the alarm herself just so hed come streaking back with his stomach encased in ice and his heart paralyzed it would be just like her and that was one more lie he thought as he careened around a corner it was nothing like her at all the candles were still burning in her windows he tried to be relieved by that as he stood on the brakes in her driveway and bolted out of his car dinner would still be warm the music would still be playing and grace would be there standing under her portrait furious with him he beat on the door foolishly wildly before he snapped himself back she wouldnt answer she was too angry to answer when the first patrol car pulled up he turned flashed his badge check the east side he ordered ill take the west he turned on his heel started around the side he caught the glimmer of the blue water in her pool in the moonlight and the thought slid in and out of his mind that theyd never used it together never slipped into that cool water naked then he saw the broken glass his heart simply stopped his weapon was in his hand and he was through the shattered door with no thought to procedure someone was shouting her name racing from room to room in blind panic it couldnt be him yet he found himself on the stairs short of breath ice cold dizzy with fear and watching a uniformed cop bend to pick up a scrap of cloth smells like chloroform lieutenant the officer hesitated took a step toward the man clinging to the banister lieutenant he couldnt speak his voice was gone and every sweaty hour of training with it seths dulled gaze shifted focused on the face the portrait slowly and with great effort he widened his vision again pulled on the mask of control search the house every inch of it his eyes locked on the second uniform call in for backup now then make a sweep of the grounds move center grace came to slowly with a roll of nausea and a blinding headache a nightmare still black at the edges circled dully like a vulture patiently waiting to drop she squeezed her eyes tighter rolled her head on the pillow then cautiously opened them where the thought was dull foolish not my room she realized and struggled to fight off the clinging mists that clouded her brain it was satin beneath her cheek she knew the cool slippery feel of satin against the skin white satin like a brides dress baffled she skimmed her hand over the thick luxurious spread of the huge canopied bed she could smell jasmine and roses and vanilla all white scents cool white scents the walls of the room were ivory and had a sheen like silk for a moment she thought she was in a coffin a huge elaborate coffin and her heart beat thick and fast she made herself sit up almost afraid that her head would hit the lid and she would find herself screaming and clawing for freedom as she smothered but there was nothing only that fragrant air and she took a long unsteady breath of it she remembered now the crash of glass the big man in black with thick arms she wanted to panic and forced herself to take another of those jerky breaths carefully hampered by her spinning head she slid her legs over the edge of the bed until her feet sank into thick virginal white carpet she swayed nearly retched then forced her feet over that sea of white to the door she went slippery with panic when the knob resisted her her breath came in ragged gulps as she fought and tugged on the knob of faceted crystal then she turned her back leaned against it and made herself survey what she understood now was her prison white on white on white blinding to the eye a dainty queen anne chair brocaded in white filmy lace curtains hung like ghosts heaps of white pillows on a curved white chaise there were edges of gold that only enhanced the avalanche of white elegant furniture in pale wood smothered in that snowfall she went to the windows first shuddered when she found them barred the slices of night beyond them silvered by the moon she saw nothing familiar a long roll of lawn meticulously planted flowers and shrubs tall shielding trees wheeling she saw another door bolted for it nearly wept when the knob turned easily but beyond was a lustrous bath whitetiled the frostedglass windows barred the angled skylight a soaring ten feet above the floor and on the long gleaming counter were jars bottles creams powders all her own preferences her scents her lotions her stomach knotted greasily ransom she told herself it was a kidnapping someone who believed her family could be forced to pay for her safe return but she knew that was a lie the stars she leaned weakly against the jamb pressed her lips together to keep the whimper silent shed been taken because of the three stars they would be her ransom her knees trembled as she turned away ordered herself to calm down to think clearly there had to be a way out there always was her alarm had gone off she remembered seth couldnt have been far away would he have gotten the report come back it didnt matter he would have gotten it soon enough whatever had happened between them he would do everything in his power to find her from duty if nothing else in the meantime she was on her own but mat didnt mean she was defenseless she took two stumbling steps back when the lock on her door clicked then forced herself to stop straighten the door opened and two men stepped inside one she recognized quickly enough as her abductor the other was smaller wiry dressed in formal black with a face as giving as rock ms fontaine he said in a voice both british and cultured if youd come with me please a butler she realized and had to swallow a bubble of hysteria she knew the type too well and she assumed an amused and annoyed expression why hes ready to see you now when she made no move to obey the bigger man stepped in towering over her then jerked a thumb toward the doorway charming she said dryly she took a step forward calculating how quickly she would have to move the butler inclined his head impassively youre on the third floor he told her even if you could somehow reach the main level on your own there are guards they are under order not to harm you unless its unavoidable if youll pardon me i would advise against risking it she would risk it she thought and a great deal more but not until she had at least an even chance of success without so much as a flick of a glance at the man beside her she followed the butler out of the room and down a gently lit corridor the house was old she calculated but beautifully restored at least three stories so it was large a glimpse at her watch told her it had been less than two hours since she was drugged time enough to drive some distance she imagined but the view through the bars hadnt been countryside shed seen lights city lights houses through the trees a neighborhood she decided exclusive wealthy but a neighborhood where there were houses there were people and where there were people there was help she was led down a wide curving staircase of gleaming oak and saw the guard at the landing his gun holstered but visible down another hallway antiques paintings artwork her eye was expert enough to recognize the monet on the wall the porcelain vase from the han dynasty on a pedestal the nok terracotta head from nigeria her host she thought had excellent and eclectic taste the treasures she saw small and large spanned continents and centuries a collector she realized with a chill now he had her and was hoping to trade her for the three stars of mithra with what grace considered absurd formality under the circumstances the butler approached tall double doors opened them and with seamless expertise bowed slightly from the waist miss grace fontaine seeing no immediate alternative she stepped through the open doors into an enormous dining room with a frescoed ceiling and a dazzling trio of chandeliers she scanned the long mahogany table the georgian candelabra gaily lit and spaced at precise intervals down its length and focused on the man who rose and smiled charmingly her worlds overlapped reality and fear gregor grace elegant in his tux diamonds winking he crossed to her took her numb hand in his how delightful to see you he tucked her arm through his patted it affectionately i dont believe youve dined he knew where she was seth had no doubt of it but his first fiery urge to rush to the elegant estate in dc and tear it apart singlehandedly had to be suppressed he could get her killed he was certain ambassador gregor devane had killed before the call that interrupted his scene with grace had been confirmation of yet another woman who had once been linked to the ambassador a beautiful german scientist who had been found murdered in her home in berlin the apparent victim of a bungled burglary the dead woman had been an anthropologist who had a keen interest in mithraism for six months during the previous year she had been romantically linked with gregor devane then she was dead and none of her research notes on the three stars of mithra had been recovered he knew devane was responsible just as he knew devane had grace but he couldnt prove it and he didnt have probable cause to sway any judge to issue a search warrant into the home of a foreign ambassador once more he stood in graces living room once more he stared up at her portrait and imagined her dead but this time he wasnt thinking like a cop he turned as mick marshall stepped beside him we wont find anything here to link him in twelve hours the diamonds will be turned over to the museum hes going to use her to see that doesnt happen im going to stop him mick looked up at the portrait what do you need no no cops lieutenantseth if youre right and hes got her youre not going to get her out alone you need to put together a team you need a hostage negotiator theres no tune we both know mat his eyes werent flat and cool now werent cops eyes they were full of storms and passions hell kill her his heart was coated with a sheet of ice but it beat with fiery heat inside the casing shes smart shell play whatever game she needs to in order to stay alive but if she makes the wrong move hell kill her i dont need a psychiatric profile to see into his head hes a sociopath with a god complex and an obsession he wants those diamonds and what he believes they represent right now he wants grace but if she doesnt serve his purpose shell end up like the others thats not going to happen mick he reached into his pocket took out his badge and held it out this time he wouldnt go by the book couldnt afford to play by the rules you take this for me hang on to it i may want it back youre going to need help mick insisted youre going to need men no cops seth repeated and pushed his badge into micks reluctant hand not this time you cant go in solo its suicide professional and literal seth cast one last glance at the portrait i wont be alone center she wouldnt tremble grace promised herself she wouldnt show him how frightened she was instead she brushed her hair from her shoulder with a careless hand do you always have your dinner companions abducted from their homes and drugged ambassador you must forgive the clumsiness considerately he drew out a chair for her it was necessary to be quick i trust youre suffering no ill effects other than great annoyance no she sat skimmed her gaze over the dish of marinated mushrooms a silent servant placed before her they reminded her painfully of the noisefilled cookout at cades and a loss of appetite oh you must at least sample the food he sat at the head of the table picked up his fork it was gold and heavy and had once slipped between the lips of an emperor ive gone to considerable trouble to have your favorites prepared his smile remained genial but his eyes went cold eat grace i detest waste since youve gone to such lengths she forced down a bite ordered her hand not to shake her stomach not to revolt i hope your room is comfortable i had to have it prepared for you rather quickly youll find appropriate clothing in the armoire and bureau youve only to ask if theres something else you wish i prefer windows without bars and doors without locks temporary precautions i promise you once youre at home here his hand covered hers the grip tightening cruelly when she attempted to pull away and i do very much want you to be at home here such measures wont be necessary she didnt wince as the bones in her hands ground together when she stopped the resistance his fingers relaxed stroked once then slid away and just how long do you intend to keep me here he smiled picked up her wineglass held it out to her eternity you and i grace are destined to share eternity under the table her aching hand shook and went clammy thats quite some time she started to set her wine down untouched then caught the hard glint in his eye and sipped im flattered but confused its pointless to pretend you dont understand you held the star in your hand you survived death and you came to me ive seen your face in my dreams yes she could feel her blood drain slowly as if leeched out of her veins looking into his eyes she remembered the nightmares the shadow in the woods watching ive seen you in mine youll bring me the stars grace and the power i understand why i failed now every step was simply another on the path that brought us here together well possess the stars and i will possess you dont worry he said when she flinched youll come to me a willing bride but my patience has limits beauty is my weakness he continued and skimmed a fingertip down her bare arm toyed idly with the thick silver bracelet she wore and perfection my greatest delight you my dear have both understand youll have no choice should my patience run out my household staff is well trained fear was a bright icy flash but her voice was steady with disgust and would turn a deaf ear and blind eye to rape i dont enjoy that word during dinner he gave a sulky little shrug and signaled for the next course a woman of your appetites will grow hungry soon enough and one of your intelligence will undoubtedly see the wisdom of an amiable partnership its not sex you want gregor she couldnt bear to look down at the tender pink salmon on her plate its subjugation im so poor at subjugation you misunderstand me he forked up fish and ate with enjoyment i intend to make you a goddess and subject to no one and i will have everything no mortal man will come between us he smiled again certainly not lieutenant buchanan the man is becoming a nuisance hes probing into my affairs where he has no business probing ive seen him devanes voice trailed off to a whisper and there was a hint of fear in it in the night in my dreams he comes back he always comes back no matter how often i kill him then his eyes cleared and he sipped wine the color of melted gold now hes stirring up old business and looking for new she could feel the alarming beat of her pulse in her throat at her wrists in her temples hell be looking for me very soon now possibly ill deal with him when and if the time comes that could have been tonight had he not left you so abruptly oh i have considered just what will be done about the lieutenant but i prefer to wait until i have the stars its possible thoughtfully devane picked up his napkin dabbed at his lips i may spare him once i have what belongs to me if you wish it i can be magnanimous under the right circumstances her heart was in her throat now filling it blocking it if i do what you want youll leave him alone its possible well discuss it but im afraid i developed an immediate dislike for the man and i am still annoyed with you dear grace for rejecting my own invitation for such an ordinary man she didnt hesitate couldnt afford to while her mind whirled with fear for seth she made her lips curve silkily gregor surely you forgive me for that i was so crushed when you didnt press your case a woman after all enjoys a more determined pursuit i dont pursue i take obviously she pouted it was horrid of you to have manhandled me that way and frightened me half to death i may not forgive you for it be careful how deep you play the game his voice was low with warning and she thought with interest im not green no she skimmed a hand over his cheek before she rose but maturity has so many advantages her legs were watery but she roamed the cavernous room her gaze traveling quickly toward windows exits escape you have such a beautiful home so many treasures she angled her head hoped the challenge she issued was worth the risk i do love things but i warn you gregor i wont be any mans pretty toy she walked to him slowly skimming a fingertip down her throat between her breasts while the silk she wore whispered around her and when im backed into a corner i scratch seductively she laid a hand on the table leaned toward him you want me she breathed it purred it watching his eyes darken sliding her fingers toward the knife beside his plate to touch me to have me her fingers closed over the handle gripped hard not in a hundred lifetimes she said as she struck she was fast and she was desperate but hed shifted to draw her to him and the knife struck his shoulder instead of his heart as he cried out in shock and rage she whirled grabbing one of the heavy chairs she smashed the long window and sent glass raining out but when she leaped forward strong arms grabbed her from behind she fought viciously her breath panting out the fragile silk she wore ripped then she froze when the knife she had used was pressed against her throat she didnt bother to struggle against the arms that held her as devane leaned his face close to hers his eyes were mad with fury i could kill you for that but it would be too little and too quick i would have made you my equal i would have shared that with you now ill just take what i choose from you until i tire of you youll never get the stars she said steadily and youll never get seth ill have exactly what i choose and youll help me she started to shake her head flinched as the blade nicked ill do nothing to help you but you will if you dont do exactly as i tell you i will pick up the phone with one single word from me bailey james and m j oleary will die tonight it will only take a word he saw the wild fear come into her eyes the helpless terror that hadnt been there for her own life i have men waiting for that word if i give it there will be a terrible and tragic explosion in the night at cade parriss home another at a small neighborhood pub just before closing and as one last twist a third explosion will destroy the home and the single occupant of a certain lieutenant buchanans residence their fate is in your hands grace and the choice is yours she wanted to call his bluff but staring into his eyes she understood that he wouldnt hesitate to do as he threatened no he longed to do it their lives meant nothing to him and everything to her what do you want me to do bailey was fighting against panic when the phone rang she stared at it as if it were a snake that had rattled into life with a silent prayer she lifted the receiver hello bailey grace her fingers went whiteknuckled as she whirled seth shook his head held up a hand in caution are you all right for the moment listen very carefully bailey my life depends on it do you understand no yes stall she knew shed been ordered to stall grace im so frightened for you what happened where are you i cant go into that now you have to be calm bailey you have to be strong you were always the calm one like when we took that art history exam in college and i was so intimated by professor greenbalm and you were so cool you have to be cool now bailey and you have to follow my instructions i will ill try she looked helplessly at seth as he signaled her to stretch it out just tell me if youre hurt not yet but he will hurt me hell kill me bailey if you dont do what he wants get him what he wants i know im asking a great deal he wants the stones you have to go get them you cant take cade you cant call the police string it out bailey reminded herself keep grace talking you dont want me to call seth no he isnt important hes just another cop you know he doesnt matter youre to wait until exactly then youre to leave the house go to salvini bailey youve got to go to salvini leave mj out of it just like we used to understand bailey nodded kept her eyes on seths yes i understand once you get to salvini put the stones in a briefcase wait there youll get a call with the next set of instructions youll be all right you know how you used to like to sneak out of the dorm at night and go out driving alone after curfew just think of it that way exactly that way bailey and youll be fine if you dont hell take everything away from me do you understand yes grace i love you she managed before the phone went dead nothing cade said tightly as he stared down at the tracing equipment hes got it jammed the signals all over the board it wouldnt home in she wants me to go to salvini bailey said quietly youre not going anywhere cade said interrupting her but bailey laid a hand on his arm looked toward mj no she meant that part you understood yeah mj pressed her fingers to her eyes tried to think past the terror she was pumping in as much as she could bailey and grace never left me out of anything so she wanted me along she wants us out of here but she was stringing him about the stones bailey never jumped curfew she was giving you signals jack said trying to punch in what she could manage she knew wed understand he must have told her something would happen to us if she didnt cooperate bailey reached out for mjs hand she wanted us to contact seth thats why she said you didnt matter because we know you do seth dragged a hand through his hair a rare wasted motion he had no choice but to trust their instincts no choice but to trust graces sense of survival all right she wants me to know whats happening and wants you out of the house yes she wants us out of the house thinks well be safer at salvini youll be safer at the precinct seth told her and thats where both of you are going no baileys voice remained calm she wants us at salvini she made a point of it seth studied her and gauged his options he could have them taken into protective custody that was the logical step or he could let the game play out that was a risk but it was the risk that fit salvini then but detective marshall will arrange for guards youll stay put until you hear differently mj bristled you expect us to just sit around and wait while grace is in trouble thats exactly what youre going to do seth said coolly shes risking her life to see that youre safe im not going to disappoint her hes right mj jack lifted a brow as she snarled at him go ahead and fume but youre outnumbered here you and bailey follow instructions seth noted with some surprise that mj closed her mouth gave one brisk nod in assent what was the business about the art history exam bailey bailey sucked in air professor greenbalms first name was gregory gregory gregor close enough seth looked at the two men he needed we dont have a lot of time chapter contents prev grace doubted very much that she would live through the night there were so many things she hadnt done she had never shown bailey and mj paris as they had always planned she would never see the willow shed planted on her country hillside grow tall and bend gracefully over her tiny pond she had never had a child the unfairness clawed at her along with the fear she was only twentysix years old and she was going to die shed seen her sentence in devanes eyes and she knew he intended to kill those she loved as well he wouldnt be satisfied with anything less than erasing all the lives that had touched what his obsessed mind considered his all she could hang on to now was the hope that bailey had understood her im going to show you what you could have had his arm bandaged a fresh tuxedo covering the damage devane led her through a concealed panel and down a welllit set of stone stairs that were polished like ebony hed taken a painkiller his eyes were glassy with it and vicious they were the eyes that had stared out of the woods in her nightmares and as he walked down the curve of those glossy black stairs she felt the tug of some deep memory by torchlight then she thought hazily down and down with the torches flickering and the stars glittering in their home of gold on a white stone and death waiting the harsh breathing of the man beside her devanes someone elses it was a hot secret sound that chilled the skin a room she thought struggling to grip the slippery chain of memories a secret room of white and gold and she had been locked in it for eternity she stopped at the last curve not so much in fear as in shock not here she thought frantically but somewhere else not her but part of her not him but someone like him devanes fingers dug into her arm but she barely felt the pain seth the man with seths eyes dressed as a warrior coated with dust and the dents of battle hed come for her and for the stars and died for it no the stairway spun and she gripped the cool wall for balance not again not this time theres little choice devane jerked her forward pulled her down the remaining steps he stopped at a thick door gestured impatiently for his guard to step back holding graces arm in a bruising grip he drew out a heavy key fit it in an old lock that for reasons grace couldnt fathom made her think of alices rabbit hole i want you to see what could have been yours what i would have shared with you at his rough shove she stumbled inside and stood blinking in shock no not the rabbit hole she realized her dazzled eyes wide and stunned ali babas cave gold gleamed in mountains jewels winked in rivers paintings she recognized as works of the masters crowded together on the walls statues and sculpture some as small as the faberge eggs perched on gold stands others soaring to the ceiling were jammed inside furs and sweeps of silk ropes of pearls carvings and crowns were jammed into every available space mozart played brilliantly on hidden speakers it was she realized not a fairytale cave at all it was merely a spoiled boys elaborate and greedy clubhouse here he could hide his possessions from the world keep them all to himself and chortle over them she imagined and how many of these toys had he stolen she wondered how many had he killed for she wouldnt die here she promised herself and neither would seth if this was indeed history overlapping she wouldnt allow it to repeat itself she would fight with whatever weapons she had you have quite a collection gregor but your presentation could use some work the first weapon was mild disdain laced with amusement even the precious loses impact when crammed together in such a disorganized manner its mine all of it a lifetimes work here like that spoiled boy he snatched up a goblet of gold thrust it out to her for admiration queen guinevere sipped from this before she cuckolded arthur he should have cut out her heart for that grace turned the cup in her hand and felt nothing it was empty not only of wine she mused but of magic and here he grabbed a parr of ornate diamond earrings thrust them into graces face another queen marie antoinette wore these while her country plotted her death you might have worn them while you plotted mine with deliberate scorn she dismissed the offering and turned away no thank you i have an arrow the goddess diana hunted with the girdle worn by juno her heart thrummed like a harp but she only chuckled do you really believe that theyre mine furious with her reaction he pushed his way through his collection laid a hand over the cold marble slab hed had built ill have the stars soon they will be the apex of my collection ill set them here with my own hands and ill have everything they wont help you they wont change you she didnt know where the words came from or the knowledge behind them but she saw his eyes flicker in surprise your fates already sealed theyll never be yours its not meant not this time theyre for the light and for the good youll never see them here in the dark his stomach jittered there was power in her words in her eyes when she should have been cowed and frightened it unnerved him by sunrise ill have them here ill show them to you his breath was short and shallow as he approached her and ill have you ill keep you as long as i wish do with you what i wish the hand against her cheek was cold made her think wildly of a snake but she didnt cringe away youll never have the stars and youll never have me even if you hold us youll never have us that was true before but its only more true now and that will eat away at you day after day until theres nothing left of you but madness he struck her hard enough to knock her back against the wall to have pain spinning in her head your friends will die tonight he smiled at her as if he were discussing a small mutual interest youve already sent them to oblivion im going to let you live a long time knowing that he took her by the arm and pulling open the door dragged her from the room hell have surveillance cameras seth said as they prepared to scale the wall at the rear of devanes dc estate hes bound to have guards patrolling the grounds so well be careful jack checked the point of his knife stuck it in his boot then examined the pistol hed tucked in his belt and well be quiet we stick together until we reach the house cade went over the plan in his head i find security disarm it failing that set the whole damn business off we could get lucky in the confusion itll bring the cops if things dont go well you could be dealing with a lot more than a bust for a b and e jack issued a pithy oneword opinion on that lets go get her out he shot seth one quick grin as he boosted himself up man i hope he doesnt have dogs i really hate when they have dogs they landed on the soft grass on the other side it was possible their presence was detected from that moment it was a risk they were willing to take like shadows they moved through the starstruck night slipping through the heavy dark amid the sheltering trees before on his quest for the stars and the woman hed come alone and perhaps that arrogance had been his defeat baffled by the sudden thought the quick spurt of what some might have called vision seth pushed the feeling aside he could see the house through the trees the glimmer of lights in windows which room was she in how badly was she frightened was she hurt had he touched her baring his teeth he bit off the thoughts he had to focus only on getting inside finding her for the first time in years he felt the weight of his weapon at his side knew he intended to use it he gave no thought to rules to his career to the life hed built step by deliberate step he saw the guard pass by only a yard beyond the verge of the grove when jack tapped his shoulder and signaled seth met his eyes nodded seconds later jack sprang at the man from behind and with a quick twist rammed his head into the trunk of an oak and then dragged the unconscious body into the shadows one down he breathed and tucked his newly acquired weapon away theyll have regular checkin cade murmured we cant know how soon theyll miss his contact then lets move seth signaled jack to the north cade to the south staying low they rushed those gleaming lights the guard who escorted grace back to her room was silent at least two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle she calculated but shed seen his eyes flicker down over her bodice scan the ripped silk that exposed flesh at her side she knew how to use her looks as a weapon deliberately she tipped her face up to his let her eyes fill helplessly im so frightened so alone she risked touching a hand to his arm you wont hurt me will you please dont hurt me ill do anything you want he said nothing but his eyes were keen on her face when she moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue keeping the movement slow and provocative anything she repeated her voice husky intimate youre so strong so in charge did he even speak english she wondered what did it matter the communication was clear enough at the door to her prison she turned flashed a smoldering look sighed deeply dont leave me alone she murmured im so afraid of being alone i need someone taking a chance she lifted a fingertip rubbed it over his lips he doesnt have to know she whispered no one has to know its our secret though it revolted her she took his hand placed it on her breast the flex of his fingers chilled her skin but she made herself smile invitingly as he lowered his head and crushed her mouth dont think of it dont think she warned herself as his hands roamed her its not you hes not touching you inside she hoped he interpreted her quick shudder as desire come inside with me well be alone he opened the door his eyes still hungry on her face on her body she would either win here she thought or lose everything she let out a teasing laugh as he grabbed for her the moment the door was locked behind him oh theres no hurry now handsome she tossed her hair back glided out of his reach no need to rush such a lovely friendship i want to freshen up for you still he said nothing but his eyes were narrowing with impatience suspicion still smiling she reached for the heavy cutcrystal atomizer on the bureau a womans weapon she thought coldly as she gently spritzed her skin the air i prefer using all of my senses her fingers tightened convulsively on the bottle as she swayed toward him she jerked the bottle up and sprayed perfume directly into his leering eyes he hissed in shock grabbed instinctively for his stinging eyes putting all her strength behind it she smashed the crystal into his face and her knee into his groin he staggered but didnt go down there was blood on his face and beneath it his skin had gone a pasty shade of white he was fumbling for his gun and frantic she kicked out aiming low again this time he went to his knees but his hands were still reaching for the gun snapped to his side sobbing now she heaved up a footstool upholstered in white tasseled in gold she rammed it into his already bleeding face then lifting it high crashed it onto his head desperately she scrabbled to unstrap his gun her clammy hands slipping off leather and steel when she held it in two shaking hands prepared to do whatever was necessary she saw that he was unconscious her breath tore out of her lungs in a wild laugh i guess im just not that kind of girl too frightened for caution she yanked the keys free of his clip stabbed one after the other at the lock until it gave and raced like a deer fleeing wolves down the corridor through the golden light a shadow moved at the head of the stairs and with a low keening moan she lifted the gun thats the second time youve pointed a weapon in my direction her vision grayed at the sound of seths voice clamping down hard on her lip she cleared it as he stepped out of the shadows and into the light you you came it wasnt armor he wore she thought dizzily but black shirt slacks shoes it wasnt a sword he carried but a gun it wasnt a memory it was real her dress was torn bloody her face was bruised her eyes were glassy with shock hed killed two men to get this far and seeing her this way he thought it hadnt been enough not nearly enough its all right now he resisted the urge to rush to her grab her close she looked as though she might shatter at a touch were going to get you out no ones going to hurt you hes going to kill them she forced air in and out of her lungs hes going to kill them no matter what i do hes insane theyre not safe from him were none of us safe from him he killed you before she ended on a whisper hell try again he took her arm to steady her gently slipped the gun from her hand where is he grace theres a room through a panel in the library down the stairs just like before lifetimes ago do you remember spinning between images she pressed a hand to her head hes there with his toys all the glittering toys i stabbed him with a dinner knife good girl how much of the blood was hers he could detect no wound other than the bruises on her face and arms come on now come with me he led her down the stairs there was the guard shed seen before but he wasnt standing now averting her eyes she stepped around him gestured she was steadier now the past didnt always run in a loop she knew sometimes it changed people made it change its back there the third door down on the left she cringed when she caught a movement but it was jack melting out of a doorway its clear he said to seth take her out his eyes said everything as he nudged her into jacks arms take care of her im trusting you jack hitched her against his side to keep his weapon hand free youre okay honey no she shook her head hes going to kill them he has explosives something at the house at the pub you have to stop him the panel ill show you she wrenched away from jack staggered like a drunk toward the library here she turned a rosette in the carving of the chair rail i watched him the panel slid smoothly open jack get her out call in a ill deal with him she was floating just under the surface of thick warm water hell have to kill him she said faintly as seth disappeared into the opening this time he cant fail he knows what he has to do yes he always does and the room spun once wildly jack im sorry she managed before she spun with it he hadnt locked the door seth noted arrogant bastard so sure no one would trespass on his sacred ground with his weapon lifted seth eased the heavy door open blinked once at the bright gleam of gold he stepped inside focused on the man sitting in a thronelike chair in the center of all the glory its done devane devane wasnt surprised hed known the man would come you risk a great deal his smile was cold as a snakes his eyes mad as a hatters you did before you remember dont you dreamed of it didnt you you came to steal from me before to take the stars and the woman you had a sword then heavy and unjeweled something vague and quick passed through seths mind a stone castle a stormy sky a room of great wealth a woman beloved on an altar a triangle wrenched from the hands of the god adorned with diamonds as blue as stars i killed you devane laughed softly left your body for the crows that was then seth stepped forward this is now devanes smile spread i am beyond you he lifted his hand and the gun he held in it two shots were fired so close together they sounded as one the room shook echoed settled and went back to gleaming slowly seth stepped closer looked down at the man who lay facedown on a hill of gold now you are seth murmured youre beyond me now she heard the shots for one unspeakable moment everything inside her stopped heart mind breath blood then it started again a tidal wave of feeling that had her springing off the bench where jack had put her the air heaving in and out of her lungs and she knew because she felt because her heart could beat that it hadnt been seth whod met the bullet if he had died she would have known some piece of her heart would have broken off from the whole and shattered still she waited her eyes on the house because she had to see the stars wheeled overhead the moon shot light through the trees somewhere in the distance a night bird began to call out with hope and joy then he walked out of the house whole tears clogged her throat and were swallowed they stung her eyes and were willed away she had to see him clearly the man she had accepted that she loved and couldnt have he walked to her his eyes dark and cool his gait steady hed already regained control she realized already tucked whatever hed had to do away in some compartment where it wouldnt interfere with what had to be done next she wrapped her arms around herself hands clamped tight on her forearms shed never know that one gesture that turning into herself and not him was what stopped him from reaching for her so he stood with an armspan of distance between them and looked at the woman he accepted that he loved and had pushed away she was pale and even now he could see the quick trembles that ripped through her but he wouldnt have said she was fragile even now with death shimmering between them she wasnt fragile her voice was strong and steady its over yeah its over he was going to kill them thats over too his need to touch her to hold on was overwhelming he felt that his knees were about to give way but she turned shifted her body away and looked out into the dark i need to see them bailey and mj i know you need my statement god his control wavered enough for him to press his fingers against burning eyes it can wait why i want it over i need to put it behind me she steadied herself again then turned slowly and when she faced him his hands were at his sides and his eyes clear i need to put it all behind me her meaning was clear enough seth thought he was part of that all grace youre hurt and youre in shock an ambulance is on the way i dont need an ambulance dont tell me what the hell you need fury swarmed through him buzzed in his head like a nest of mad hornets i said the damn statement can wait youre shaking for gods sake sit down when he reached out to take her arm she jerked back her chin snapping up her shoulders hunching dont touch me just dont if he touched her she might break if she broke she would weep and weeping she would beg the words were a knife in the gut the deep and desperate blue of her eyes a blow to the face because he felt his fingers tremble he stuffed them into his pockets took a step back all right sit down please had he thought she wasnt fragile she looked as if she would shatter into pieces with one hard thought she was sheet pale her eyes enormous blood and bruises marked her face and there was nothing he could do nothing she would let him do he heard the distant wail of sirens and footsteps from behind him cade his face grim walked to grace tucked a blanket hed brought from the house over her shoulders seth watched as she turned into him how her body seemed to go fluid and flow into the arms cade offered her he heard the fractured sob even as she muffled it against cades shoulder get her out of here his fingers burned to reach out stroke her hair to take something away with him get her the hell out of here he walked back into the house to do what needed to be done the birds sang their morning song as grace stepped out into her garden the woods were quiet and green and safe shed needed to come here to her country escape to come alone to be alone bailey and mj had understood in a few days she thought she would go into town call see if theyd like to come up bring jack and cade she would need to see them soon but she couldnt bear to go back yet not yet she could still hear the shots the quick jolt of them shuddering through her as jack had taken her outside shed known it was devane and not seth who had met the bullet shed simply known she hadnt seen seth again that night it had been easy to avoid him in the confusion that followed shed answered all the questions the local police had asked made statements to the government officials shed stood up to it then quietly demanded that cade or jack take her to salvini take her to bailey and mj and the three stars stepping down onto her blooming terraces she brought it back into her head and her heart the three of them standing in the near dark of a nearempty room she with her torn and bloody dress each of them had taken a point of the triangle had felt the sing of power seen the flicker of impossible light and had known it was done its as if weve done this before bailey had murmured but it wasnt enough then it was lost and so were we its enough now mj had looked up met each of their eyes in turn like a cycle complete a chain with the links forged its weird but its right a museum instead of a temple this time regret and relief had mixed within grace as they set the stars down again a promise kept and i suppose destinies fulfilled shed turned to both of them embraced them another triangle ive always loved you both needed you both can we go somewhere the three of us the tears had come then flooding i need to talk shed told them everything poured out heart and soul hurt and terror until she was empty and she supposed because it was them shed healed a little now she would heal on her own she could do it here grace knew and closing her eyes she just breathed then because it always soothed she set down her gardening basket and began to tend her blooms she heard the car coming the rumble of wheels on gravel and her brow creased in mild irritation her neighbors were few and far between and rarely intruded she wanted no company but her plants and she stood her flowers flowing at her feet determined to politely and firmly send the visitor away again her heart kicked once hard when she saw that the car was seths she watched in silence as it stopped in the middle of her lane and he got out and started toward her she looked like something out of a misty legend herself he thought her hair blowing in the breeze the long loose skirt of her dress fluttering and flowers in a sea around her his nerves jangled and his stomach clutched when he saw the bruise marring her cheek youre a long way from home seth she spoke without expression as he stopped two steps beneath her youre a hard woman to find grace thats the way i prefer it i dont care for company here obviously both to give himself time to settle and because he was curious he scanned the land the house perched on the hill the deep secrets of the woods its a beautiful spot yes remote his gaze shifted back to hers so quickly so intensely he nearly made her jolt peaceful youve earned some peace thats why im here she lifted a brow and why are you here i needed to talk to you grace i intended to see you when i came back she said quickly we didnt talk much that night i suppose i was more shaken up than i realized i never even thanked you it was worse he realized that cool polite voice was worse than a shouted curse you dont have anything to thank me for you saved my life and i believe the lives of the people i love i know you broke rules even the law to find me to get me away from him im grateful the palms of his hands went clammy she was making him see it again feel it again all that rage and terror id have done anything to get you away from him yes i think i know that she had to look away it hurt too much to look into his eyes shed promised herself sworn to herself she wouldnt be hurt again and i wonder if any of us had a choice in what happened over that short intense period of time or she added with a ghost of a smile if you choose to believe what happened over centuries i hope you havent that your career wont suffer because of what you did for me his eyes went dark flat the jobs secure grace im glad he had to leave she thought he had to leave now before she crumbled i still intend to write a letter to your superiors and you might know i have an uncle in the senate i wouldnt be surprised when the smoke clears if you got a promotion out of it his throat was raw he couldnt clear it look at me damn it when her gaze shot back to his face he curled his hands into fists to keep from touching her do you think that matters yes i do it matters seth certainly to me but for now im taking a few days so if youll excuse me i want to get to my gardening before the heat of the day do you think this ends it she leaned over took up her clippers and snipped off wilted blooms they faded all too quickly she thought and that left an ache in the heart i think you already ended it dont turn away from me he took her arm hauled her toward him as panic and fury spiraled through him you cant just turn away i cant he broke off his hand lifting to lie on the bruise on her cheek oh god grace he hurt you its nothing she stepped back quickly nearly flinching and his hand fell heavily to his side bruises fade and hes gone you saw to that hes gone and its over the three stars are where they belong and everythings back in its place everythings as it was meant to be is it he didnt step to her couldnt bear to see her shrink back from him again i hurt you and you wont forgive me for it not entirely she agreed fighting to keep it light but saving my life goes a long way to stop it he said in a voice both ragged and quiet just stop it undone he whirled away pacing nearly trampling her bedding plants he hadnt known he could suffer like this the ice in the belly the heat in the brain he spoke looking out into her woods into shadows and cool green shade do you know what it did to me knowing he had you knowing it hearing your voice on the phone the fear in it i dont want to think about it i dont want to think about any of that i cant do anything but think of it and see you every time i close my eyes i see you the way you stood there in that hallway blood on your dress marks on your skin not knowing not knowing what hed done to you and remembering half remembering some other time when i couldnt stop him its over she said again because her legs were turning to water leave it alone you might have gotten away without me he continued you took out a guard twice your size you might have pulled it off without any help from me you might not have needed me at all and i realized that was part of my problem all along believing being certain i needed you so much more than you could possibly need me being afraid of that stupid to be afraid of that he said as he came up the steps again once you understand real fear the fear of knowing you could lose the most important thing in your life in one single heartbeat nothing else can touch you he gathered her to him too desperate to heed her resistance and with a shuddering gulp of air buried his face in her hair dont push me away dont send me away this isnt any good it hurt to be held by him yet she wished she could go on being held just like this with the sun warm on her skin and his face pressed into her hair i need you i need you he repeated and turned his urgent mouth to hers the hammer blow of emotion struck and she buckled it swirled from one of them to the other in an unbridled storm left her heart shaken and weak she closed her eyes slid her arms around him need would be enough she promised herself she would make it enough for both of them there was too much inside her that she ached to give for her to turn him away i wont send you away her hands stroked over his back soothed the tension im glad youre here i want you here she drew back brought his hand to her cheek come inside seth come to bed his fingers tightened on hers then gently lifted her head up it made him ache to realize she believed there was only that he wanted from her that hed let her think it grace i didnt come here to take you to bed i didnt come here to start where we left off why had he been so resistant to seeing what was in her eyes he wondered why had he refused to believe what was so blatantly real so generously offered to him i came here to beg the third star is generosity he said almost to himself you didnt make me beg i didnt come here for sex grace or for gratitude confused she shook her head what do you want seth why did you come he wasnt sure hed fully realized why until just now to hear you tell me what you want what you need peace she gestured i have that here friendship i have that too and thats it thats enough its been enough all my life he caught her face in his hands before she could step away if you could have more what do you want grace wanting what you cant have only makes you unhappy tell me he kept his eyes focussed on hers straight out for once just say what you want family children i want children and a man who loves me who wants to make that family with me her lips curved slowly but the smile didnt reach her eyes surprised id want to spoil my figure spend a few years of my life changing diapers no he slid his hands down to her shoulders firming his grip she was poised to move he noted to run no im not surprised really well she moved her shoulders as if to shrug off the weight of his touch if youre going to stay lets go inside im thirsty grace i love you he watched her smile slide away from her face felt her body go absolutely still what what did you say to me i love you saying it he realized was power true power i fell in love with you before id seen you fell in love with an image a memory a wish i cant be sure which it is or if it was all of them i dont know if it was fate or choice or luck but it was so fast so hard so deep i wouldnt let myself believe and i wouldnt let myself trust and i turned you away because you let yourself do both i came here to tell you that his hands slid down her arms and clasped hers grace im asking you to believe in us again to trust in us again and to marry me you she had to take a step back had to press a hand to her heart you want to marry me im asking you to come back with me today i know its oldfashioned but i want you to meet my family the pressure in her chest all but burst her heart you want me to meet your family i want them to meet the woman i love the woman i want to have a life with the life ive been waiting to start waiting for her to start he brought her hand to his cheek held it there while his eyes looked deep into hers the woman i want to make children with oh the weight on her chest released in a flood poured out of her until her heart was in her swimming eyes dont cry it seemed he would beg after all grace please dont dont tell me i left it too late awkwardly he brushed at her tears with his thumbs dont tell me i ruined it i love you so much she closed her fingers around his wrists watched the emotion leap into his eyes ive been so unhappy waiting for you i was so sure id missed you again somehow not this time he kept his hands on her face kissed her gently not ever again no not ever again she murmured against his lips say yes he asked her i want to hear you say yes yes to everything she held him close in the flowerscented morning where the stars slept behind the sky and felt the last link of an endless chain fall into place seth he kept his eyes shut his cheek on her hair and his smile bloomed slow and easy grace were where were supposed to be can you feel it she drew a deep breath all of us are where we belong now she lifted her face found his mouth waiting and now he said quietly it begins
