risen from the ranks horatio alger jr author of ragged dick tattered tom luck and pluck brave and bold series to thomas e barry of the boston bar this volume inscribed with friendly regard preface risen from the ranks contains the further history of harry walton who was first introduced to the public in the pages of bound to rise those who are interested in learning how far he made good the promise of his boyhood may here find their curiosity gratified for the benefit of those who may only read the present volume a synopsis of harrys previous life is given in the first chapter in describing harrys rise from the ranks i have studiously avoided the extraordinary incidents and pieces of good luck which the story writer has always at command being desirous of presenting my heros career as one which may be imitated by the thousands of boys similarly placed who like him are anxious to rise from the ranks it is my hope that this story suggested in part by the career of an eminent american editor may afford encouragement to such boys and teach them that where there is a will there is always a way new york october risen from the ranks or harry waltons success chapter i harry walton i am sorry to part with you harry said professor henderson you have been a very satisfactory and efficient assistant and i shall miss you thank you sir said harry i have tried to be faithful to your interests you have been so said the professor emphatically i have had perfect confidence in you and this has relieved me of a great deal of anxiety it would have been very easy for one in your position to cheat me out of a considerable sum of money it was no credit to me to resist such a temptation as that said harry i am glad to hear you say so but it shows your inexperience nevertheless money is the great tempter nowadays consider how many defalcations and breaches of trust we read of daily in confidential positions and we are forced to conclude that honesty is a rarer virtue than we like to think it i have every reason to believe that my assistant last winter purloined at the least a hundred dollars but i was unable to prove it and submitted to the loss it may be the same next winter cant i induce you to change your resolution and remain in my employ i will advance your pay thank you professor henderson said harry gratefully i appreciate your offer even if i do not accept it but i have made up mind to learn the printing business you are to enter the office of the centreville gazette i believe yes sir how much pay will you get i shall receive my board the first month and for the next six months have agreed to take two dollars a week and board that wont pay your expenses it must said harry firmly you have laid up some money while with me havent you yes sir i have fifty dollars in my pocketbook besides having given eighty dollars at home that is doing well but you wont be able to lay up anything for the next year perhaps not in money but i shall be gaining the knowledge of a good trade and you like that better than remaining with me and learning my business yes sir well perhaps you are right i dont fancy being a magician myself but i am too old to change i like moving round and i make a good living for my family besides i contribute to the innocent amusement of the public and earn my money fairly i agree with you sir said harry i think yours is a useful employment but it would not suit everybody ever since i read the life of benjamin franklin i have wanted to learn to be a printer it is an excellent business no doubt and if you have made up your mind i will not dissuade you when you have a paper of your own you can give your old friend professor henderson an occasional puff i shall be glad to do that said harry smiling but i shall have to wait some time first how old are you now sixteen then you may qualify yourself for an editor in five or six years i advise you to try it at any rate the editor in america is a man of influence i do look forward to it said harry seriously i should not be satisfied to remain a journeyman all my life nor even the half of it i sympathize with your ambition harry said the professor earnestly and i wish you the best success let me hear from you occasionally i should be very glad to write you sir i see the stage is at the door and i must bid you goodby when you have a vacation if you get a chance to come our way mrs henderson and myself will be glad to receive a visit from you goodby and with a hearty shake of the hand professor henderson bade farewell to his late assistant those who have read bound to rise and are thus familiar with harry waltons early history will need no explanation of the preceding conversation but for the benefit of new readers i will recapitulate briefly the leading events in the history of the boy of sixteen who is to be our hero harry walton was the oldest son of a poor new hampshire farmer who found great difficulty is wresting from his few sterile acres a living for his family nearly a year before he had lost his only cow by a prevalent disease and being without money was compelled to buy another of squire green a rich but mean neighbor on a six months note on very unfavorable terms as it required great economy to make both ends meet there seemed no possible chance of his being able to meet the note at maturity beside mr walton was to forfeit ten dollars if he did not have the principal and interest ready for squire green the hardhearted creditor was mean enough to take advantage of his poor neighbors necessities and there was not the slightest chance of his receding from his unreasonable demand under these circumstances harry the oldest boy asked his fathers permission to go out into the world and earn his own living he hoped not only to do this but to save something toward paying his fathers note his ambition had been kindled by reading the life of benjamin franklin which had been awarded to him as a school prize he did not expect to emulate franklin but he thought that by imitating him he might attain an honorable position in the community harrys request was not at first favorably received to send a boy out into the world to earn his own living is a hazardous experiment and fathers are less sanguine than their sons their experience suggests difficulties and obstacles of which the inexperienced youth knows and possesses nothing but in the present case mr walton reflected that the little farming town in which he lived offered small inducements for a boy to remain there unless he was content to be a farmer and this required capital his farm was too small for himself and of course he could not give harry a part when be came of age on the whole therefore harrys plan of becoming a mechanic seemed not so bad a one after all so permission was accorded and our hero with his little bundle of clothes left the paternal roof and went out in quest of employment after some adventures harry obtained employment in a shoeshop as pegger a few weeks sufficed to make him a good workman and he was then able to earn three dollars a week and board out of this sum be hoped to save enough to pay the note held by squire green against his father but there were two unforeseen obstacles he had the misfortune to lose his pocketbook which was picked up by an unprincipled young man by name luke harrison also a shoemaker who was always in pecuniary difficulties though he earned much higher wages than harry luke was unable to resist the temptation and appropriated the money to his own use this harry ascertained after a while but thus far had succeeded in obtaining the restitution of but a small portion of his hardearned savings the second obstacle was a sudden depression in the shoe trade which threw him out of work more than most occupations the shoe business is liable to these sudden fluctuations and suspensions and the most industrious and ambitious workman is often compelled to spend in his enforced weeks of idleness all that he had been able to save when employed and thus at the end of the year finds himself through no fault of his own no better off than at the beginning finding himself out of work our hero visited other shoe establishments in the hope of employment but his search was in vain chance in this emergency made him acquainted with professor henderson a wellknown magician and conjurer whose custom it was to travel through the fall and winter from town to town giving public exhibitions of his skill he was in want of an assistant to sell tickets and help him generally and he offered the position to our hero at a salary of five dollars a week it is needless to say that the position was gladly accepted it was not the business that harry preferred but he reasoned justly that it was honorable and was far better than remaining idle he found professor henderson as he called himself a considerate and agreeable employer and as may be inferred from the conversation with which this chapter begins his services were very satisfactory at the close of the six months he had the satisfaction of paying the note which his father had given and so of disappointing the selfish schemes of the grasping creditor this was not all he met with an adventure while travelling for the professor in which a highwayman who undertook to rob him came off second best and he was thus enabled to add fifty dollars to his savings his financial condition at the opening of the present story has already been set forth though i have necessarily omitted many interesting details to be found in bound to rise i have given the reader all the information required to enable him to understand the narrative of harrys subsequent fortunes chapter the printing office jotham anderson editor and publisher of the centreville gazette was sitting at his desk penning an editorial paragraph when the office door opened and harry walton entered goodmorning mr anderson said our hero removing his hat goodmorning my friend i believe you have the advantage of me replied the editor our hero was taken aback it didnt occur to him that the engagement was a far less important event to the publisher than to himself he began to be afraid that the place had not been kept open for him my name is harry walton he explained i was travelling with prof henderson last winter and called here to get some bills printed oh yes i remember you now i agreed to take you into the office said the editor to harrys great relief yes air you havent changed your mind then you still want to be a printer yes sir you have left the professor i suppose i left him yesterday what did he pay you five dollars a week he offered me six if i would stay with him of course you know that i cant pay you any such wages at present yes sir you agreed to give me my board the first month and two dollars a week for six months afterward that is all you will be worth to me at first it is a good deal less than you would earn with professor henderson i know that sir but i am willing to come for that good i see you are in earnest about printing and that is a good sign i wanted you to understand just what you had to expect so that you need not be disappointed i shant be disappointed sir said harry confidently i have made up my mind to be a printer and if you didnt receive me into your office i would try to get in somewhere else then no more need be said when do you want to begin i am ready any time where is your trunk at the tavern you can have it brought over to my house whenever you please the hotelkeeper will send it over for you he is our expressman come into the house now and i will introduce you to my wife the editors home was just across the street from his printing office followed by harry he crossed the street opened the front door and led the way into the sittingroom where a pleasantlooking lady of middle age was seated my dear he said i bring you a new boarder she looked at harry inquiringly this young man her husband explained is going into the office to learn printing i have taken a contract to make a second benjamin franklin of him then youll do more for him than you have been able to do for yourself said mrs anderson smiling you are inclined to be severe mrs anderson but i fear you are correct however i can be like a guidepost which points the way which it does not travel can you show harry walton for that is his name where you propose to put him i am afraid i must give you a room in the attic said mrs anderson our house is small and all the chambers on the second floor are occupied i am not at all particular said harry i have not been accustomed to elegant accommodations if you will follow me upstairs i will show you your room pausing on the third landing mrs anderson found the door of a small but comfortable bedroom there was no carpet on the floor but it was painted yellow and scrupulously clean a bed two chairs a bureau and washstand completed the list of furniture i shall like this room very well said our hero there is a closet said the lady pointing to a door in the corner it is large enough to contain your trunk if you choose to put it in there i hope you dont smoke oh no indeed said harry laughing i havent got so far along as that mr andersons last apprentice he is a journeyman now was a smoker he not only scented up the room but as he was very careless about lights i was continually alarmed lest he should set the house on fire finally i got so nervous that i asked him to board somewhere else is he working for mr anderson now yes you probably saw him in the office i saw two young men at the case the one i speak of is the youngest his name is john clapp there is no danger of my smoking i dont think it would do me any good besides it is expensive and i cant afford it i see we think alike said mrs anderson smiling i am sure we will get along well together i shall try not to give you any trouble said our hero and his tone which was evidently sincere impressed mrs anderson still more favorably you wont find me very hard to suit i hope i suppose you will be here to supper if it will he quite convenient my trunk is at the tavern and i could stay there till morning if you wished oh no come at once take possession of the room now if you like and leave an order to have your trunk brought here thank you what is your hour for supper halfpast five thank you i will go over and speak to mr anderson a minute the editor looked up as harry reappeared well have you settled arrangements with mrs anderson he asked yes sir i believe so i hope you like your room it is very comfortable it wont take me long to feel at home there did she ask you whether you smoked yes sir i thought she would thats where clapp and she fell out harrys attention was drawn to a thin sallow young man of about twenty who stood at a case on the opposite side of the room mrs anderson was afraid i would set the house on fire said the young man thus referred to yes she felt nervous about it however it is not surprising an uncle of hers lost his house in that way i suppose you dont smoke walton no sir clapp smokes for his health you see how stout and robust he is said the editor a little satirically it doesnt do me any harm said clapp a little testily oh well i dont interfere with you though i think you would be better off if you should give up the habit ferguson dont smoke this was the other compositor a man of thirty whose case was not far distant from clapps i cant afford it said ferguson nor could clapp if he had a wife and two young children to support smoking doesnt cost much said the younger journeyman so you think but did you ever reckon it up no dont you keep any accounts no i spend when i need to and i can always tell how much i have left whats the use of keeping accounts you can tell how you stand i can tell that without taking so much trouble you see we must all agree to disagree said mr anderson i am afraid clapp isnt going to be a second benjamin franklin who is asked clapp our young friend here said the editor oh is he queried the other with a sneer itll be a great honor im sure to have him in the office come no chaffing clapp said mr anderson harry hastened to disclaim the charge for clapps sneer affected him disagreeably i admire franklin he said but there isnt much danger of my turning out a second edition of him professional already i see walton said the editor when shall i go to work mr anderson whenever you are ready i am ready now you are prompt you wont be in such a hurry to go to work a week hence said clapp i think i shall said harry i am anxious to learn as fast as possible oh i forgot you want to become a second franklin i shant like him thought our hero he seems to try to make himself disagreeable mr ferguson will give you some instruction and set you to work said his employer harry was glad that it was from the older journeyman that he was to receive his first lesson and not from the younger chapter iii harry stumbles upon an acquaintance after supper harry went round to the tavern to see about his trunk a group of young men were in the barroom some of whom looked up as he entered among these was luke harrison who was surprised and by no means pleased to see his creditor harry recognized him at the same instant and said how are you luke is that you walton said luke what brings you to centreville professor henderson isnt here is he no i have left him oh youre out of a job are you asked luke in a tone of satisfaction for we are apt to dislike those whom we have injured and for this reason he felt by no means friendly no im not said harry quietly ive found work in centreville gone back to pegging have you whose shop are you in i am in a different business you dont say what is it asked luke with some curiosity im in the office of the centreville gazette im going to learn the printing business you are why ive got a friend in the office john clapp he never told me about your being there he didnt know i was coming i only went to work this afternoon so you are the printers devil said luke with a slight sneer i believe so answered our hero quietly do you get good pay not much at first however i can get along with what money i have and what is due me luke harrison understood the last allusion and turned away abruptly he had no wish to pay up the money which he owed harry and for this reason was sorry to see him in the village he feared if the conversation were continued harry would be asking for the money and this would be disagreeable at this moment john clapp entered the barroom he nodded slightly to harry but walked up to luke and greeted him cordially there were many points of resemblance between them and this drew them into habits of intimacy will you have something to drink harrison said clapp i dont mind if i do answered luke with alacrity they walked up to the bar and they were soon pledging each other in a fiery fluid which was not very likely to benefit either of them meanwhile harry gave directions about his trunk and left the room so youve got a new devil in your office said luke after draining his glass yes he came this afternoon how did you hear he told me do you know him asked clapp in some surprise yes i know him as well as i want to what sort of a fellow is he oh hes a sneak one of your pious chaps that wants to be an angel and with the angels stand then hes made a mistake in turning devil said clapp good for you said luke laughing youre unusually brilliant tonight clapp so hes a saint is he he set up for one but i dont like his style myself hes as mean as dirt why i knew him several months and he never offered to treat in all that time hes as much afraid of spending a cent as if it were a dollar he wont have many dollars to spend just at present hes working for his board oh hes got money saved up said luke fellows like him hang on to a cent when they get it i once asked him to lend me a few dollars just for a day or two but he wouldnt do it i hate such mean fellows so do i will you have a cigar ill treat this time said luke who thought it polite to take his turn in treating once to his companions four or five times thank you from what you say i am sorry anderson has taken the fellow into the office you neednt have much to say to him i shant trouble myself much about him i didnt like his looks when i first set eyes on him i suppose old mother anderson will like him she couldnt abide my smoking and he wont trouble her that way so hes too mean to buy the cigars he said he couldnt afford it thats what it comes to by the way clapp when shall we take another ride i can get away nest monday afternoon at three all right ill manage to get off at the same time well go to whiston and take supper at the hotel it does a fellow good to get off now and then it wont cost more than five dollars apiece altogether well get the carriage charged the fact is im little low on funds so am i but it wont matter griffin will wait for his pay while harrys character waa being so unfavorably discussed he was taking a walk by himself observing with interest the main features of his new home he had been here before with professor henderson but had been too much occupied at that time to get a very clear idea of centreville nor had it then the interest for him which it had acquired since he went upon a hill overlooking the village and obtained an excellent view from its summit it was a pleasant wellbuilt village of perhaps three thousand inhabitants with outlying farms and farmhouses along the principal streets the dwellings and stores were closely built so as to make it seem quite citylike it was the shire town of the county and being the largest place in the neighborhood country people for miles around traded at its stores farmers wives came to centreville to make purchases just as ladies living within a radius of thirty miles visit new york and boston for a similar purpose altogether therefore centreville was quite a lively place and a town of considerable local importance the fact that it had a weekly paper of its own contributed to bring it into notice nor was that all situated on a little hillock was a building with a belfry which might have been taken for a church but for a playground near by which indicated that it had a different character it was in fact the prescott academy so called from the name of its founder who had endowed it with a fund of ten thousand dollars besides erecting the building at his own expense on land bought for the purpose this academy also had a local reputation and its benefits were not confined to the children of centreville there were about twenty pupils from other towns who boarded with the principal or elsewhere in the town and made up the whole number of students in attendance about eighty on an average standing on the eminence referred to harrys attention was drawn to the academy and he could not help forming the wish that he too might share in its advantages there is so much to learn and i know so little he thought but he did not brood over the poverty which prevented him from gratifying his desire he knew it would do no good and he also reflected that knowledge may be acquired in a printing office as well as within the walls of an academy or college as soon as i get well settled he said to himself i mean to get some books and study a little every day that is the way franklin did i never can be an editor thats certain without knowing more than i do now before i am qualified to teach others i must know something myself looking at the village which lay below him harry was disposed to congratulate himself on his new residence it looks like a pleasant place he said to himself and when i get a little acquainted i shall enjoy myself very well i am sure of course i shall feel rather lonely just at first he was so engrossed by his thoughts that he did not take heed to his steps and was only reminded of his abstraction by his foot suddenly coming in contact with a boy who was lying under a tree and pitching headfirst over him holloa exclaimed the latter what are you about you didnt take me for a football did you i beg your pardon said harry jumping up in some confusion i was so busy thinking that i didnt see you i hope i didnt hurt you nothing serious didnt you hurt yourself i bumped my head a little but it only struck the earth if it had been a stone it might have been different i had no idea there was any one up here except myself it was very kind of you to bow so low to a perfect stranger said the other his eyes twinkling humorously i suppose it would only be polite for me to follow your example ill excuse you said harry laughing thank you that takes a great burden off my mind i dont like to be outdone in politeness but really i shouldnt like to tumble over you my head may be softer than yours theres one thing clear we ought to know each other as youve taken the trouble to come up here and stumble over me i really feel as if we ought to strike up a friendship what do you say with all my heart said our hero chapter iv oscar vincent allow me to introduce myself said the stranger boy my name is oscar vincent from boston at present a student at the prescott academy at your service as he spoke he doffed his hat and bowed showing a profusion of chestnut hair a broad open brow and an attractive face lighted up by a pleasant smile harry felt drawn to him by a feeling which was not long in ripening into friendship imitating the others frankness he also took off his hat and replied let me introduce myself in turn as harry walton junior apprentice in the office of the centreville gazette sometimes profanely called printers devil good said oscar laughing how do you like the business i think i shall like it but i have only just started in it i went into the office for the first time today i have an uncle who started as you are doing said oscar he is now chief editor of a daily paper in boston is he said harry with interest did he find it hard to rise he is a hard worker i have heard him say that he used to sit up late of nights during his apprenticeship studying and improving himself that is what i mean to do said harry i dont think he was as lazy as his nephew said oscar i am afraid if i had been in his place i should have remained in it are you lazy asked harry smiling at the others frankness a little so that is i dont improve my opportunities as i might father wants to make a lawyer of me so he has put me here and i am preparing for harvard i envy you said harry there is nothing i should like so much as entering college i daresay i shall like it tolerably well said oscar but i dont hanker after it as the boy said after swallowing a dose of castor oil ill tell you what i should like better what asked harry as the other paused i should like to enter the naval academy and qualify myself for the naval service i always liked the sea doesnt your father approve of your doing this he wouldnt mind my entering the navy as an officer but he is not willing to have me enter the merchant service then why doesnt he send you to the naval academy because i cant enter without receiving the appointment from a member of congress our member can only appoint one and there is no vacancy so as i cant go where i want to i am preparing for harvard are you studying latin and greek yes have you studied them long about two years i was looking over my greek lesson when you playfully tumbled over me will you let me look at your book i never saw a greek book i sometimes wish i never had said oscar but thats when i am lazy harry opened the book a greek reader in the middle of an extract from xenophon and looked with some awe at the unintelligible letters can you read it can you understand what it means he asked looking up from the book soso you must know a great deal oscar laughed i wonder what dr burton would say if he heard you he said who is he principal of our academy he gave me a blowing up for my ignorance today because i missed an irregular greek verb im not exactly a dunce but i dont think i shall ever be a greek professor if you speak of yourself that way what will you think of me i dont know a word of latin of greek or any language except my own because you have had no chance to learn theres one language i know more about than latin or greek english i mean french i spent a year at a french boardingschool three years since what have you been in france yes an uncle of mine in fact the editor was going over and urged father to send me i learned considerable french but not much else i can speak and understand it pretty well how i wish i had had your advantages said harry how did you like your french schoolmates they wouldnt come near me at first because i was an american they thought i carried a revolver and a dirkknife and was dangerous that is their idea of american boys when they found i was tame and carried no deadly weapons they ventured to speak with me and after that we got along pretty well how soon do you expect to go to college a year from next summer i suppose i shall be ready by that time you are going to stay in town i suppose yes if i keep my place oh youll do that then we can see something of each other you must come up to my room and see me come almost any evening i should like to do you live in dr bartons family no i hope not why not oh the doctor has a way of looking after the fellows that room in the house and of keeping them at work all the time that wouldnt suit me i board at mrs greysons at the southeast corner of the church common have you got anything to do this evening nothing in particular then come round and take a look at my den or sanctum i ought to call it as i am talking to a member of the editorial profession not quite yet said harry smiling oh well thatll come in due time will you come shant i be disturbing you not a bit my greek lesson is about finished and thats all ive got to do this evening come round and we will sit over the fire and chat like old friends thank you oscar said harry irresistibly attracted by his bright and lively acquaintance i shall enjoy calling i have made no acquaintances yet and i feel lonely i have got over that said oscar i am used to being away from home and dont mind it the two boys walked together to oscars boardingplace it was a large house of considerable pretension for a village and oscars room was large and handsomely furnished but what attracted harrys attention was not the furniture but a collection of over a hundred books ranged on shelves at one end of the room in his fathers house it had always been so difficult to obtain the necessaries of life that books had necessarily been regarded as superfluities and beyond a dozen volumes which harry had read and reread he was compelled to depend on such as he could borrow here again his privileges were scanty for most of the neighbors were as poorly supplied as his father what a fine library you have oscar he exclaimed i have a few books said oscar my father filled a couple of boxes and sent me he has a large library this seems a large library to me said harry my father likes reading but he is poor and cannot afford to buy books he said that in a matteroffact tone without the least attempt to conceal what many boys would have been tempted to hide oscar noted this and liked his new friend the better for it yes he said books cost money and one hasnt always the money to spare have you read all these books not more than half of them i like reading better than studying i am afraid i am reading the waverley novels now have you read any of them so i never saw any of them before if you see anything you would like to read i will lend it to you with pleasure said oscar noticing the interest with which harry regarded the books will you said harry eagerly i cant tell you how much obliged i am i will take good care of it oh i am sure of that here try ivanhoe ive just read it and its tiptop thank you i will take it on your recommendation what a nice room you have yes its pretty comfortable father told me to fix it up to suit me he said he wouldnt mind the expense if i would only study i should think anybody might study in such a room as this and with such a fine collection of books im rather lazy sometimes said oscar but i shall turn over a new leaf some of these days and astonish everybody tonight as i have no studying to do ill tell you what well do did you ever pop corn sometimes ive got some corn here and maam greyson has a popper stay here alone a minute and ill run down and get it oscar ran down stairs and speedily returned with a cornpopper now well have a jolly time said he draw up that armchair and make yourself at home if xenophon or virgil or any of those greek and latin chaps call well tell em we are transacting important business and cant be disturbed what do you say they wont be apt to call on me said harry i havent the pleasure of knowing them it isnt always a pleasure i can assure you harry pass over the cornpopper chapter v a young f f b as the two boys sat in front of the fire popping and eating the corn and chatting of one thing and another their acquaintance improved rapidly harry learned that oscars father was a boston merchant in the calcutta trade with a countingroom on long wharf oscar was a year older than himself and the oldest child he had a sister of thirteen named florence and a younger brother charlie now ten they lived on beacon street opposite the common though harry had never lived in boston be knew that this was a fashionable street and he had no difficulty in inferring that mr vincent was a rich man he felt what a wide gulf there was socially between himself and oscar one the son of a very poor country farmer the other the son of a merchant prince but nothing in oscars manner indicated the faintest feeling of superiority and this pleased harry i may as well say however that our hero was not one to show any foolish subserviency to a richer boy he thought mainly of oscars superiority in knowledge and although the latter was far ahead of harry on this score he was not one to boast of it harry in return for oscars confidence acquainted him with his own adventures since he had started out to earn his own living oscar was most interested in his apprenticeship to the ventriloquist it must have been jolly fun he said i shouldnt mind travelling round with him myself can you perform any tricks a few said harry show me some thats a good fellow if you wont show others professor henderson wouldnt like to have his tricks generally known i could show more if i had the articles he uses but i can do some without go ahead professor im all attention not having served an apprenticeship to a magician as harry did i will not undertake to describe the few simple tricks which he had picked up and now exhibited for the entertainment of his companion it is enough to say that they were quite satisfactory and that oscar professed his intention to puzzle his boston friends with them when his vacation arrived about halfpast eight a knock was heard at the door come in called out oscar the door was opened and a boy about his own age entered his name was fitzgerald fletcher he was also a boston boy and the son of a retail merchant doing business on washington street his father lived handsomely and was supposed to be rich at any rate fitzgerald supposed him to be so and was very proud of the fact he generally let any new acquaintances understand very speedily that his father was a man of property and that his family moved in the first circles of boston society he cultivated the acquaintance of those boys who belonged to rich families and did not fail to show the superiority which he felt to those of less abundant means for example he liked to be considered intimate with oscar as the social position of mr vincent was higher than that of his own family it gave him an excuse also for calling on oscar in boston he had tried to ingratiate himself also with oscars sister florence but had only disgusted her with his airs so that he could not flatter himself with his success in this direction oscar had very little liking for him but as schoolfellows they often met and fitzgerald often called upon him on such occasions he treated him politely enough for it was not in his nature to be rude without cause fitz was elaborately dressed feeling that handsome clothes would help convey the impression of wealth which he was anxious to establish in particular he paid attention to his neckties of which he boasted a greater variety than any of his schoolmates it was not a lofty ambition but such as it was he was able to gratify it how are you fitz said oscar when he saw who was his visitor draw up a chair to the fire and make yourself comfortable thank you oscar said fitzgerald leisurely drawing off a pair of kid gloves i thought i would drop in and see you all right will you have some popped corn no thank you answered fitzgerald shrugging his shoulders i dont fancy the article dont you then you dont know whats good fancy passing round popped corn at a party in boston said the other how people would stare would they i dont know about that i think some would be more sensible and eat but i beg your pardon i havent introduced you to my friend harry walton harry this is a classmate of mine fitzgerald fletcher esq of boston fitzgerald did not appear to perceive that the title esq was sportively added to his name he took it seriously and was pleased with it as a recognition of his social superiority he bowed ceremoniously to our hero and said formally i am pleased to make your acquaintance mr walton thank you mr fletcher replied harry bowing in turn i wonder who he is thought fitzgerald he had no idea of the true position of our young hero or he would not have wasted so much politeness upon him the fact was that harry was well dressed having on the suit which had been given him by a friend from the city it was therefore fashionably cut and had been so well kept as still to be in very good condition it occurred to fitz to give him the short name he received from his schoolfellows that it might be a boston friend of oscars just entering the academy this might account for his not having met him before perhaps he was from an aristocratic boston family his intimacy with oscar rendered it probable and it might be well to cultivate his acquaintance on this hint he spoke are you about to enter the academy mr walton no i should like to do so but cannot you are one of oscars friends from the city i suppose then oh no i am living in centreville who can he be thought fitz with considerable less cordiality in his manner he continued impelled by curiosity i dont think i have met you before no i have only just come to the village oscar understood thoroughly the bewilderment of his visitor and enjoyed it he knew the weakness of fitz and he could imagine how his feelings would change when be ascertained the real position of harry my friend he explained is connected with the centreville gazette in what capacity asked fitz in surprise he is profanely termed the printers devil isnt that so harry i believe you are right said our hero smiling he had a suspicion that this relation would shock his new acquaintance indeed ejaculated fitz pursing up his lips and i was about to say turning up his nose but nature had saved him the little trouble of doing that what in the world brings him here then he thought but there was no need of saying it for both oscar and harry read it in his manner strange that oscar vincent from one of the first families of boston should demean himself by keeping company with a low printer boy harry and i have had a jolly time popping corn this evening said oscar choosing to ignore his schoolmates changed manner indeed i cant see what fun there is in it oh youve got no taste has he harry his taste differs from ours said our hero politely i should think so remarked fitz with significant emphasis was that all you had to amuse yourself in using the singular pronoun he expressly ignored the presence of the young printer no that wasnt all my friend harry has been amusing me with some tricks which he learned while he was travelling round with professor henderson the ventriloquist and magician really he is quite accomplished said fitz with a covert sneer pretty company oscar has taken up with he thought how long were you in the circus business he asked turning to harry i never was in the circus business excuse me i should say travelling about with the ventriloquist about three months i was with him when he performed here last winter ah indeed i didnt go my father doesnt approve of my attending such common performances i only attend firstclass theatres and the italian opera thats foolish said oscar you miss a good deal of fun then i went to professor hendersons entertainment and i now remember seeing you there harry you took money at the door didnt you yes now i understand what made your face seem so familiar to me when i saw it this afternoon by the way i have never been into a printing office if i come round to yours will you show me round i should be very glad to oscar but perhaps you had better wait till i have been there a little while and learned the ropes i know very little about it yet wont you come too fitz asked oscar you must really excuse me drawled fitz i have heard that a printing office is a very dirty place i should be afraid of soiling my clothes especially that stunning cravat do you like it i flatter myself its something a little extra said fitz who was always gratified by a compliment to his cravats then you wont go i havent the slightest curiosity about such a place i assure you then i shall have to go alone let me know when you are ready to receive me harry i wont forget oscar i wonder he allows such a low fellow to call him by his first name thought fitz really he has no proper pride well he said rising i must be going whats your hurry fitz ive got to write a letter home this evening besides i havent finished my greek goodevening oscar goodevening fitz goodevening mr fletcher said harry evening ejaculated fitz briefly and without a look at the low printerboy he closed the door and went down stairs chapter vi oscar becomes a professor i am afraid your friend wont thank you for introducing me to him said harry after fitz had left the room fitz is a snob said oscar he makes himself ridiculous by putting on airs and assuming to be more than he is his father is in a good business and may be rich i dont know about that but that isnt much to boast of i dont think we shall be very intimate said harry smiling evidently a printers apprentice is something very low in his eyes when you are an influential editor he will be willing to recognize you let that stimulate your ambition it isnt easy for a halfeducated boy to rise to such a position i feel that i know very little if i can help you any harry i shall be very glad to do it im not much of a scholar but i can help you a little for instance if you wanted to learn french i could hear your lessons and correct your exercises will you said harry eagerly there is nothing i should like better then ill tell you what ill do you shall buy a french grammar and come to my room two evenings a week and recite what you get time to study at home wont it give you a great deal of trouble oscar not a bit of it i shall rather like it until you can buy a grammar i will lend you mine ill set you a lesson out of it now he took from the bookshelves a french grammar and inviting harry to sit down beside him gave him some necessary explanations as to the pronunciation of words according to the first lesson it seems easy said harry i can take more than that it is the easiest of the modern languages to us at least on account of its having so many words similar to ours what evening shall i come oscar tuesday and friday will suit me as well as any and remember harry i mean to be very strict in discipline and by the way how will it do to call myself professor ill call you professor if you want me to well leave all high titles to fitz and i wont use the rod any oftener than it is absolutely necessary all right professor vincent said harry laughing ill endeavor to behave with propriety i wonder what they would say at home said oscar if they knew i had taken up the profession of teacher strange as it may seem to you harry i have the reputation in the homecircle of being decidedly lazy how do you account for it great men are seldom appreciated you hit the nail on the head that time glad i am not the nail by the way henceforth i will submit with resignation to injustice and misconstruction since i am only meeting with the common fate of great men what time is it oscar nearly ten then i will bid you goodnight and harry rose to go i cant tell how much i am obliged to you for your kind offer just postpone thanks till you find out whether i am a good teacher or not i am sure of that i am not so sure but i will do what i can for you goodnight ill expect you friday evening i shall see fitz tomorrow shall i give him your love never mind said harry smiling im afraid it wouldnt be appreciated perhaps not as harry left his lively companion he felt that he had been most fortunate in securing his friendship not only that he found him very agreeable and attractive but he was likely to be of great use to him in promoting his plans of selfeducation he had too much good sense not to perceive that the only chance he had of rising to an influential position lay in qualifying himself for it by enlarging his limited knowledge and improving his mind i have made a good beginning he thought after i have learned something of french i will take up latin and i think oscar will be willing to help me in that too the next morning he commenced work in the printing office with a few hints from ferguson he soon comprehended what he had to do and made very rapid progress youre getting on fast harry said ferguson approvingly i like it said our hero i am glad i decided to be a printer i wish i wasnt one grumbled clapp the younger journeyman dont you like it not much its hard work and poor pay i just wish i was in my brothers shoes he is a bookkeeper in boston with a salary of twelve hundred a year while i am plodding along on fifteen dollars week you may do better some day said ferguson dont see any chance of it if i were in your place i would save up part of my salary and by and by have an office and perhaps a paper of my own why dont you do it then sneered clapp because i have a family to support from my earnings you have only yourself it doesnt help me any i cant save anything out of fifteen dollars a week you mean you wont said ferguson quietly no i dont i mean i cant how do you expect i get along then i have a wife and two children to support and only get two dollars a week more than you perhaps you get into debt no i owe no man a dollar said ferguson emphatically that isnt all i save two dollars a week so that i actually support four on fifteen dollars a week your salary what do you say to that i dont want to be mean said clapp nor i i mean to live comfortably but of course i have to be economical oh hang economy said clapp impatiently the old man used to lecture me about economy till i got sick of hearing the word it is a good thing for all that persisted ferguson youll think so some day even if you dont now i guess you mean to run opposition to young franklin over there sneered clapp indicating harry who had listened to the discussion with not a little interest i think he and i will agree together pretty well said ferguson smiling franklins a good man to imitate if there are going to be two franklins in the office it will be time for me to clear out returned clapp you can do better how is that become franklin no you dont catch me imitating any old fogy like that as far as i know anything about him he was a mean stingy old curmudgeon exclaimed clapp with irritation thats rather strong language clapp said mr anderson looking up from his desk with a smile it doesnt correspond with the general estimate of franklins character i dont care said clapp doggedly i wouldnt be like franklin if i could i have too much selfrespect ferguson laughed and harry wanted to but feared he should offend the younger journeyman who evidently had worked himself into a bad humor i dont think youre in any danger said ferguson who did not mind his fellowworkmans little ebullitions of temper clapp scowled but did not deign to reply partly perhaps because he knew that there was nothing to say from the outset ferguson took a fancy to the young apprentice hes got good solid ideas said he to mr anderson when harry was absent he isnt so thoughtless as most boys of his age he looks ahead i think you are right in your judgment of him said mr anderson he promises to be a faithful workman he promises more than that said ferguson mark my words mr anderson that boy is going to make his mark some day it is a little too soon to say that isnt it no i judge from what i see he is industrious and ambitious and is bound to succeed the world will hear of him yet mr anderson smiled he liked what he had seen of his new apprentice but he thought ferguson altogether too sanguine hes a good faithful boy he admitted but it takes more than that to rise to distinction if all the smart boys turned out smart men theyd be a drug in the market but ferguson held to his own opinion notwithstanding time will show which was right the next day ferguson said harry come round to my house and take tea tonight ive spoken to my wife about you and she wants to see you thank you mr ferguson said harry i shall be very glad to come ill wait till you are ready and you can walk along with me all right i will be ready in five minutes they set out together for fergusons modest home which was about half a mile distant as they passed up the village street harrys attention was drawn to two boys who were approaching them one he recognized at once as fitzgerald fletcher he had an even more stunning necktie than when harry first met him and sported a jaunty little cane which he swung in his neatly gloved hand i wonder if hell notice me thought harry at any rate i wont be wanting in politeness goodafternoon mr fletcher he said as they met fitzgerald stared at him superciliously and made the slightest possible nod who is that asked ferguson it is a boy who has great contempt for printers devils and low apprentices answered harry i was introduced to him two evenings ago but he evidently doesnt care about keeping up the acquaintance who is that fitz asked his companion in turn its a low fellow a printers devil answered fitz shortly how do you happen to know him oscar vincent introduced him to me oscars a queer fellow he belongs to one of the first families in boston one of my set you know and yet he actually invited that boy to his room hes rather a goodlooking boy the printer think so drawled fitz hes low all apprentices are i mean to keep him at a distance chapter vii a pleasant evening this is my house said ferguson pausing at the gate harry looked at it with interest it was a cottage containing four rooms and a kitchen in the ell part there was a plot of about a quarter of an acre connected with it everything about it was neat though very unpretentious it isnt a palace said ferguson but he added cheerfully its a happy home and from all ive read that is more than can be said of some palaces step right in and make yourself at home they entered a tiny entry and mrs ferguson opened the door of the sittingroom she was a pleasantlooking woman and her face wore a smile st welcome hannah said ferguson this is our new apprentice harry walton i am glad to see you she said offering her hand my husband has spoken of you you are quite welcome if you can put up with humble fare that is what i have always been accustomed to said harry beginning to feel quite at home where are the children hannah two children a boy and a girl of six and four years respectively bounded into the room and answered for themselves they looked shyly at harry but before many minutes their shyness had worn off and the little girl was sitting on his knee while the boy stood beside him harry was fond of children and readily adapted himself to his young acquaintances supper was soon ready a plain meal but one that harry enjoyed he could not help comparing fergusons plain but pleasant home with clapps mode of life the latter spent on himself as much as sufficed his fellowworkman to support a wife and two children yet it was easy to see which found the best enjoyment in life how do you like your new business asked mrs ferguson as she handed harry a cup of tea i like all but the name said our hero smiling i wonder how the name came to be applied to a printers apprentice any more than to any other apprentice said mrs ferguson i never heard said her husband it seems to me to be a libel upon our trade but there is one comfort if you stick to the business youll outgrow the name that is lucky i shouldnt like to be called the wife of a i wont pronounce the word lest the children should catch it what is it mother asked willie with his mouth full it isnt necessary for you to know my boy do you know mr clapp asked harry i have seen him but never spoke with him i never asked him round to tea said ferguson i dont think he would enjoy it any better than i his tastes are very different from mine and his views of life are equally different i should think so said harry now i think you and i would agree very well clapp dislikes the business and only sticks to it because he must get his living in some way as for me if i had a sum of money say five thousand dollars i would still remain a printer but in that case i would probably buy out a paper or start one and be a publisher as well as a printer thats just what i should like said harry who knows but we may be able to go into partnership some day and carry out our plan i would like it said harry but i am afraid it will be a good while before we can raise the five thousand dollars we dont need as much mr anderson started on a capital of a thousand dollars and now he is in comfortable circumstances then theres hopes for us at any rate i cherish hopes of doing better some day i shouldnt like always to be a journeyman i manage to save up a hundred dollars a year how much have we in the savings bank hannah between four and five hundred dollars with interest it has taken me four years to save it up in five more if nothing happens i should be worth a thousand dollars journeymen printers dont get rich very fast i hope to have saved up something myself in five years said harry then our plan may come to pass after all you shall be editor and i publisher i should think you would prefer to be an editor said his wife i am diffident of my powers in the line of composition said ferguson i shouldnt be afraid to undertake local items but when it comes to an elaborate editorial i should rather leave it in other hands i always liked writing said harry of course i have only had a schoolboys practice but i mean to practise more in my leisure hours suppose you write a poem for the gazette walton harry smiled i am not ambitious enough for that he replied i will try plain prose do so said ferguson earnestly our plan may come to something after all if we wait patiently it will do no harm to prepare yourself as well as you can after a while you might write something for the gazette i think mr anderson would put it in shall i sign it p d asked harry p d stands for doctor of philosophy i dont aspire to such a learned title p d also stands for printers devil i see well joking aside i advise you to improve yourself in writing i will that is the way franklin did i remember he wrote an article and slipped it under the door of the printing office not caring to have it known that he was the author shall i give you a piece of pie mr walton said mrs ferguson thank you me too said willie extending his plate willie is always fond of pie said his father in a printing office pi is not such a favorite when supper was over mr ferguson showed harry a small collection of books about twentyfive in number neatly arranged on shelves it isnt much of a library he said but a few books are better than none i should like to buy as many every year but books are expensive and the outlay would make too great an inroad upon my small surplus i always thought i should like a library said harry but my father is very poor and has fewer books than you as for me i have but one book besides the schoolbooks i studied and that i gained as a school prize the life of franklin if one has few books he is apt to prize them more said ferguson and is apt to profit by them more have you read the history of china asked harry who had been looking over his friends books no i have never seen it why there it is said our hero in two volumes take it down said ferguson laughing harry did so and to his surprise it opened in his hands and revealed a checkerboard you see appearances are deceitful can you play checkers i never tried you will easily learn shall i teach you the game i wish you would they sat down and harry soon became interested in the game which requires a certain degree of thought and foresight you will make a good player after a while said his companion you must come in often and play with me thank you i should like to do so it may not be often for i am taking lessons in french and i want to get on as fast as possible i did not know there was any one in the village who gave lessons in french oh hes not a professional teacher oscar vincent one of the academy boys is teaching me i am to take two lessons a week on tuesday and friday evenings indeed that is a good arrangement how did it come about harry related the particulars of his meeting with oscar hes a capital fellow he concluded very different from another boy i met in his room i pointed him out to you in the street oscar seems to be rich but he doesnt put on any airs and he treated me very kindly that is to his credit its the sham aristocrats that put on most airs i believe you will make somebody walton you have lost no time in getting to work i have no time to lose i wish i was in oscars place he is preparing for harvard and has nothing to do but to learn i heard a lecturer once who said that the printing office is the poor mans college and he gave a great many instances of printers who had risen high in the world particularly in our own country well that is encouraging i should like to have heard the lecture i begin to think harry that i should have done well to follow your example when i was in your position i might have studied too but i didnt realize the importance as i do now i read some useful books to be sure but that isnt like studying it isnt too late now ferguson shook his head now i have a wife and children he said i am away from them during the day and the evening i like to pass socially with them perhaps you would like to be divorced said his wife smiling then you would get time for study i doubt if that would make me as happy hannah i am not ready to part with you just yet but our young friend here is not quite old enough to be married and there is nothing to prevent his pursuing his studies so harry go on and prepare yourself for your editorial duties harry smiled thoughtfully for the first time he had formed definite plans for his future why should not fergusons plans be realized if i live long enough he said to himself i will be an editor and exert some influence in the world at ten oclock he bade goodnight to mr and mrs ferguson feeling that he had passed a pleasant and what might prove a profitable evening chapter viii fletchers views on social position you are getting on finely harry said oscar vincent a fortnight later you do credit to my teaching as you have been over all the regular verbs now i will give you a lesson in translating i shall find that interesting said harry with satisfaction here is a french reader said oscar taking one down from the shelves it has a dictionary at the end i wont give you a lesson you may take as much as you have time for and at the same time three or four of the irregular verbs you are going about three times as fast as i did when i commenced french perhaps i have a better teacher than you had said harry smiling i shouldnt wonder said oscar that explains it to my satisfaction well now the lesson is over sit down and well have a chat oh by the way theres one thing i want to speak to you about weve got a debating society at our school it is called the clionian society most of the students belong to it how would you like to join i should like it very much do you think they would admit me i dont see why not ill propose you at the next meeting thursday evening then the nomination will lie over a week and be acted upon at the next meeting i wish you would i never belonged to a debating society but i should like to learn to speak its nothing when youre used to it its only the first time you know that troubles you by jove i remember how my knees trembled when i first got up and said mr president i felt as if all eyes were upon me and i wanted to sink through the floor now i can get up and chatter with the best of them i dont mean that i can make an eloquent speech or anything of that kind but i can talk at a minutes notice on almost any subject i wish i could oh you can after youve tried a few times well then its settled ill propose you at the next meeting how lucky i am to have fallen in with you oscar i know what you mean im your guide philosopher and friend and all that sort of thing i hope youll have proper veneration for me its rather a new character for me would you believe it harry at home i am regarded as a rattlebrained chap instead of the dignified professor that you know me to be isnt it a shame great men are seldom appreciated at home oscar i know that i shall have to get a certificate from you certifying to my being a steady and erudite young man ill give it with the greatest pleasure holloa theres a knock come in shouted oscar the door opened and fitzgerald fletcher entered the room how are you fitz said oscar sit down and make yourself comfortable you know my friend harry walton i believe i believe i had the honor to meet him here one evening said fitzgerald stiffly slightly emphasizing the word honor i hope you are well mr fletcher said harry more amused than disturbed by the manner of the aristocratic visitor thank you my health is good said fitzgerald with equal stiffness and forthwith turned to oscar not deigning to devote any more attention to harry our hero had intended to remain a short time longer but under the circumstances as oscars attention would be occupied by fletcher with whom he was not on intimate terms he thought he might spend the evening more profitably at home in study if youll excuse me oscar he said rising i will leave you now as i have something to do this evening if you insist upon it harry i will excuse you come round friday evening thank you do you have to work at the printing office in the evening fletcher deigned to inquire no i have some studying to do reading and spelling i suppose sneered fletcher i am studying french indeed returned fletcher rather surprised how can you study it without a teacher i have a teacher who is it professor vincent said harry smiling you didnt know that i had developed into a french professor did you fitz well its so and whether its the superior teaching or not i cant say but my scholar is getting on famously it must be a great bore to teach said fletcher not at all i like it every one to his taste said fitzgerald unpleasantly goodnight oscar goodnight mr fletcher said harry and made his exit youre a strange fellow oscar said fletcher after harrys departure very likely but what particular strangeness do you refer to now no one but you would think of giving lessons to a printers devil i dont know about that no one i mean that holds your position in society i dont know that i hold any particular position in society your family live on beacon street and move in the first circles i am sure my mother would be disgusted if i should demean myself so far as to give lessons to any vulgar apprentice i dont propose to give lessons to any vulgar apprentice you know whom i mean this walton is only a printers devil i dont know that that is any objection to him it isnt morally wrong to be a printers devil is it what a queer fellow you are oscar of course i dont mean that i daresay hes well enough in his place though he seems to be very forward and presuming but you know that hes not your equal he is not my equal in knowledge but i shouldnt be surprised if he would be some time youd be astonished to see how fast he gets on i daresay but i mean in social position it seems to me you cant think of anything but social position well its worth thinking about no doubt as far as it is deserved but when it is founded on nothing but money i wouldnt give much for it of course we all know that the higher classes are more refined than printers devils and vulgar apprentices i suppose put in oscar laughing yes well if refinement consists in wearing kid gloves and stunning neckties i suppose the higher classes as you call them are more refined do you mean me demanded fletcher who was noted for the character of his neckties well i cant say i dont i suppose you regard yourself as a representative of the higher classes dont you to be sure i do said fletcher complacently so i supposed then you see i had a right to refer to you now listen to my prediction twentyfive years from now the boy whom you look down upon as a vulgar apprentice will occupy a high position and you will be glad to number him among your acquaintances speak for yourself oscar said fletcher scornfully i speak for both of us then i say i hope i can command better associates than this friend of yours you may but i doubt it you seem to be carried away by him said fitzgerald pettishly i dont see anything very wonderful about him except dirty hands then you have seen more than i have of course a fellow who meddles with printers ink must have dirty hands faugh said fletcher turning up his nose at the same time he regarded complacently his own fingers which he carefully kept aloof from anything that would soil or mar their aristocratic whiteness the fact is fitz said oscar argumentatively our upper ten as we call them spring from just such beginnings as my friend harry walton my own father commenced life in a printing office but as you say he occupies a high position at present really said fletcher a little taken aback for he knew that vincents father ranked higher than his own i daresay your own ancestors were not always patricians fletcher winced he knew well enough that his father commenced life as a boy in a country grocery but in the mutations of fortune had risen to be the proprietor of a large drygoods store on washington street none of the family cared to look back to the beginning of his career they overlooked the fact that it was creditable to him to have risen from the ranks though the rise was only in wealth for mr fletcher was a purseproud parvenu who owed all the consideration he enjoyed to his commercial position fitz liked to have it understood that he was of patrician lineage and carefully ignored the little grocery and certain country relations who occasionally paid a visit to their wealthy relatives in spite of the rather frigid welcome they received oh i suppose there are exceptions fletcher admitted reluctantly your father was smart so is harry walton i know what he is aiming at and i predict that he will be an influential editor some day have you got your greek lesson asked fletcher abruptly who did not relish the course the conversation had taken yes then i want you to translate a passage for me i couldnt make it out all right half an hour later fletcher left vincents room what a snob he is thought oscar and oscar was right chapter ix the clionian society on thursday evening the main school of the academy building was lighted up and groups of boys varying in age from thirteen to nineteen were standing in different parts of the room these were members of the clionian society whose weekly meeting was about to take place at eight oclock precisely the president took his place at the teachers desk with the secretary at his side and rapped for order the presiding officer was alfred dewitt a member of the senior class and now nearly ready for college the secretary was a member of the same class by name george sanborn the secretary will read the minutes of the last meeting said the president when order had been obtained george sanborn rose and read his report which was accepted are any committees prepared to report asked the president the finance committee reported through its chairman recommending that the fee for admission be established at one dollar and that each member be assessed twentyfive cents monthly mr president said fitzgerald fletcher rising to his feet i would like to say a word in reference to this report mr fletcher has the floor then mr president i wish to say that i disagree with the report of the committee i think a dollar is altogether too small it ought to be at least three dollars and i myself should prefer five dollars again sir the committee has recommended for the monthly assessment the ridiculously small sum of twentyfive cents i think it ought to be a dollar mr president i should like to ask the gentleman his reason said henry fairbanks chairman of the finance committee why should we tax the members to such an extent when the sums reported are sufficient to defray the ordinary expenses of the society and to leave a small surplus besides mr president returned fletcher i will answer the gentleman we dont want to throw open the society to every one that can raise a dollar we want to have an exclusive society mr president said oscar vincent rising i should like to ask the gentleman for how many he is speaking he certainly is not speaking for me i dont want the society to be exclusive there are not many who can afford to pay the exorbitant sums which he desires fixed for admission fee and for monthly assessments and i for one am not willing to exclude any good fellow who desires to become one of us but does not boast as heavy a purse as the gentleman who has just spoken these remarks of oscar were greeted with applause general enough to show that the opinions of nearly all were with him mr president said henry fairbanks though i am opposed to the gentlemans suggestion does he offer it as an amendment i have no possible objection to his individually paying the increased rates which he recommends and i am sure the treasurer will gladly receive them laughter and applause greeted this hit and fletcher once more arose somewhat vexed at the reception of his suggestion i dont choose he commenced the gentleman will address the chair interrupted the president mr president i dont choose to pay more than the other members though i can do it without inconvenience but as i said i dont believe in being too democratic i am not in favor of admitting anybody and everybody into the society mr president said james hooper i congratulate the gentleman on the flourishing state of his finances for my own part i am not ashamed to say that i cannot afford to pay a dollar a month assessment and were it required i should be obliged to offer my resignation so much the better thought fitzgerald for as hooper was poor and went coarsely clothed he looked down upon him fortunately for himself he did not give utterance to his thought does mr fletcher put his recommendation into the form of an amendment asked the president i do be kind enough to state it then fletcher did so but as no one seconded it no action was of course taken nominations for membership are now in order said the president i should like to propose my friend henry walton who is henry walton asked a member mr president may i answer the gentleman asked fitzgerald fletcher rising to his feet as the nominee is not to be voted upon this evening it is not in order mr president said oscar i should be glad to have the gentleman report his information mr fletcher may speak if he desires it but as the name will be referred to the committee on nominations it is hardly necessary mr president i merely wish to inform the society that mr walton occupies the dignified position of printers devil in the office of the centreville gazette mr president said oscar may i ask the indulgence of the society long enough to say that i am quite aware of the fact i will add that mr walton is a young man of excellent abilities and i am confident will prove an accession to the society i cannot permit further remarks on a matter which will come in due course before the committee on nominations said the president the next business in order is the debate of the debate and the further proceedings i shall not speak as they are of no special interest but after the meeting was over groups of members discussed matters which had come up during the evening fletcher approached oscar vincent and said i cant see oscar why you are trying to get that printers devil into our society because hes a good fellow and smart enough to do us credit if there were any bootblacks in centreville i suppose youd be proposing them said fletcher with a sneer i might if they were as smart as my friend walton you are not very particular about your friends said fletcher in the same tone i dont ask them to open their pocketbooks and show me how much money they have i prefer to associate with gentlemen so do i yet you associate with that printers devil i consider him a gentleman fletcher laughed scornfully you have strange ideas of a gentleman he said i hold the same said james hooper who had come up in time to hear the last portion of the conversation i dont think a full purse is the only or the chief qualification of a gentleman if labor is to be a disqualification then i must resign all claims to be considered a gentleman as i worked on a farm for two years before coming to school and in that way earned the money to pay my expenses here fletcher turned up his nose but did not reply hooper was a good scholar and influential in the society but in fletchers eyes he was unworthy of consideration look here fletcher what makes you so confoundedly exclusive is your ideas asked henry fairbanks because i respect myself said fletcher in rather a surly tone then you have one admirer said fairbanks what do you mean by that asked fletcher suspiciously nothing out of the way i believe in selfrespect but i dont see how it is going to be endangered by the admission of oscars friend to the society am i expected to associate on equal terms with a printers devil i cant answer for you as for me if he is a good fellow i shall welcome him to our ranks some of our most eminent men have been apprenticed to the trade of printer i believe after all it is the name that has prejudiced you no it isnt i have seen him henry walton yes where in oscars room well i dont like his appearance whats the matter with his appearance asked oscar he looks low thats where i must decidedly contradict you fitz and i shall appeal confidently to the members of the society when they come to know him as they soon will for i am sure no one else shares your ridiculous prejudices harry walton in my opinion is a true gentleman without reference to his purse and he is bound to rise hereafter take my word for it theres plenty of room for him to rise said fletcher with a sneer that is true not only of him but of all of us i take it do you refer to me oh no said oscar with sarcasm i am quite aware that you are at the pinnacle of eminence even if you do flunk in greek occasionally fitzgerald had failed in the greek recitation during the day and that in school parlance is sometimes termed a flunk he bit his lip in mortification at this reference and walked away leaving oscar master of the situation you had the best of him there vincent said george sanborn he has gone off in disgust i like to see fletcher taken down said henry fairbanks i never saw a fellow put on so many airs he is altogether too aristocratic to associate with ordinary people yes said oscar he has a foolish pride which i hope he will some time get rid of he ought to have been born in england and not in a republic if he had been born in england he would have been unhappy unless he had belonged to the nobility said alfred dewitt look here boys said tom carver what do you say to mortifying fitzs pride have you got a plan in view tom if so out with it yes you know the pedler that comes into town about once a month to buy up rags and sell his tinwares i have seen him well what of him he is coming early next week some of us will see him privately and post him up as to fitzs relations and position and hire him to come up to school and inquire for fitz representing himself as his cousin of course fitz will deny it indignantly but he will persist and show that he knows all about the family good splendid exclaimed the boys laughing wont fitz be raving theres no doubt about that well boys ill arrange it all if youll authorize me go ahead tom you can draw upon us for the necessary funds fletcher had retired to his room angry at the opposition his proposal had received and without any warning of the humiliation which awaited him chapter x the tinpedler those of my readers who live in large cities are probably not familiar with the travelling tinpedler who makes his appearance at frequent intervals in the country towns and villages of new england his stock of tinware embraces a large variety of articles for culinary purposes ranging from milkpans to nutmeggraters these are contained in a wagon of large capacity in shape like a box on which he sits enthroned a merchant prince unlike most traders he receives little money most of his transactions being in the form of a barter whereby be exchanges his merchandise for rags white and colored which have accumulated in the household and are gladly traded off for bright tinware behind the cart usually depend two immense bags one for white the other for colored rags which in time are sold to paper manufacturers it may be that the very paper on which this description is printed was manufactured from rags so collected abner bickford was the proprietor of such an establishment as i have described no one at first sight would have hesitated to class him as a yankee he was long in the limbs and long in the face with a shrewd twinkle in the eye a long nose and the expression of a man who respected himself and feared nobody he was unpolished in his manners and knew little of books but he belonged to the same resolute and hardy type of men who in years past sprang to arms and fought bravely for an idea he was strong in his manhood and would have stood unabashed before a king such was the man who was to mortify the pride of fitzgerald fletcher tom carver watched for his arrival in centreville and walking up to his cart accosted him goodmorning mr bickford goodmornin young man youve got the advantage of me i never saw you before as i know of i am tom carver at your service glad to know you where do you live maybe your wife would like some tinware this mornin said abner relaxing his gaunt features into a smile she didnt say anything about it when i came out said tom entering into the joke maybe youd like a tindipper for your youngest boy maybe i would if youve got any to give away i see youve cut your eyeteeth is there anything else i can do for you im in for a trade i dont know unless i sell myself for rags anything for a trade ill give you two cents a pound thats too cheap i came to ask your help in a trick we boys want to play on one of our number sho you dont say so that aint exactly in my line ill tell you all about it theres a chap at our school the academy you know whos awfully stuck up hes all the time bragging about belonging to a first family in boston and turning up his nose at poorer boys we want to mortify him just so said abner nodding drive ahead well we thought if youd call at the school and ask after him and pretend he was a cousin of yours and all that it would make him mad oh i see said abner nodding he wouldnt like to own a tinpedler for his cousin no said tom he wants us to think all his relations are rich i wouldnt mind at all myself he added it suddenly occurring to him that abners feelings might be hurt good said abner i see you aint one of the stuckup kind ive got some relations in boston myself that are rich and stuck up i never go near em whats the name of this chap youre talkin about fletcher fitzgerald fletcher fletcher repeated abner whew well thats a joke whats a joke asked tom rather surprised why he is my relation a sort of second cousin why my mother and his father are own cousins so dont you see were second cousins thats splendid exclaimed tom i can hardly believe it its so my mothers name was fletcher roxanna fletcher afore she married jim fletcher this boys father used to work in my grandfathers store up to hampton but he got kinder discontented and went off to boston where hes been lucky and they do say hes mighty rich now i never go nigh him cause i know he looks down on his country cousins and i dont believe in pokin my nose in where i aint wanted then you are really and truly fitzs cousin if thats the boys name seems to me its a kinder queer one i spose its a fustclaas name sounds rather stuck up wont the boys roar when they hear about it are you willing to enter into our plan well said abner ill do it i cant abide folks thats stuck up id rather own a cousin like you thank you mr bickford when do you want me to come round how long do you stay in town well i expect to stop overnight at the tavern i cant get through in one day then come round to the academy tomorrow morning about halfpast eight school dont begin till nine but the boys will be playing ball alongside then well give you an introduction to your cousin thatll suit me well enough ill come tom carver returned in triumph and communicated to the other boys the arrangement be had made with mr bickford and his unexpected discovery of the genuine relationship that existed between fitz and the tinpedler his communication was listened to with great delight and no little hilarity and the boys discussed the probable effect of the projected meeting fitz will be perfectly raving said henry fairbanks theres nothing that will take down his pride so much hell deny the relationship probably said oscar how can he hell do it see if he dont it would be death to all his aristocratic claims to admit it suppose it were yourself oscar id say how are you cousin hows the the business answered oscar promptly i believe you would oscar theres nothing of the snob about you i hope not yet your family stands as high as fletchers thats a point i leave to others to discuss said oscar my father is universally respected i am sure but he rose from the ranks he was once a printers devil like my friend harry walton wouldnt it be ridiculous in me to turn up my nose at walton just because be stands now where my father did thirty years ago it would be the same thing as sneering at father give us your hand oscar said henry fairbanks youve got no nonsense about you i like you im not sure whether your compliment is deserved henry said oscar but if i have any nonsense it isnt of that kind do you believe fitz has any suspicion that he has a cousin in the tin business no i dont believe he has he must know he has poor relations living in the country but he probably thinks as little as possible about them as long as they dont intrude themselves upon his greatness i suppose he is satisfied and as long as no one suspects that he has any connection with such plebeians of course what sort of a man is this tinpedler tom asked oscar hes a pretty sharp fellow not educated or polished you know but he seems to have some sensible ideas he said he had never seen the fletchers because he didnt want to poke his nose in where he wasnt wanted he showed his good sense also by saying that he had rather have me for a cousin than fitz that isnt a very high compliment id say the same myself thank you oscar your compliment exalts me you wont mind my strutting a little and tom humorously threw back his head and strutted about with mock pride to be sure said oscar you dont belong to one of the first families of boston like our friend fitz no i belong to one of the second families you cant blame me for i cant help it no i wont blame you but of course i consider you low i am afraid tom i havent got any cousins in the tin trade like fitz poor fitz he little dreams of his impending trial if he did i am afraid he wouldnt sleep a wink tonight i wish i thought as much of myself as fitz does said henry fairbanks you can see by his dignified pace and the way he tosses his head how well satisfied he is with being fitzgerald fletcher esq ill bet five cents he wont strut round so much tomorrow afternoon said tom after his interview with his new cousin but hush boys not a word more of this theres fitz coming up the hill i wouldnt have him suspect whats going on or he might defeat our plans by staying away chapter xi fitz and his cousin the next morning at eight the boys began to gather in the field beside the seminary they began to play ball but took little interest in the game compared with the tragedy in real life as tom jocosely called it which was expected soon to come off fitz appeared upon the scene early in fact one of the boys called for him and induced him to come round to school earlier than usual significant glances were exchanged when he made his appearance but fitz suspected nothing and was quite unaware that he was attracting more attention than usual punctually at halfpast eight abner bickford with his tincart appeared in the street and with a twitch of the rein began to ascend the academy hill look there said tom carver the tinpedlers coming up the hill wonder if he expects to sell any of his wares to us boys do you know him fitz i answered fitzgerald with a scornful look what should i know of a tinpedler toms mouth twitched and his eyes danced with the anticipation of fun by this time mr bickford had brought his horse to a halt and jumping from his box approached the group of boys who suspended their game we dont want any tinware said one of the boys who was not in the secret want to know perhaps you havent got tin enough to pay for it never mind ill buy you for old rags at two cents a pound he has you there harvey said tom carver can i do anything for you sir is your name fletcher asked abner not appearing to recognize tom why he wants you fitz said harvey in surprise this gentlemans name is fletcher said tom placing his hand on the shoulder of the astonished fitzgerald not fitz fletcher said abner interrogatively my name is fitzgerald fletcher said the young bostonian haughtily but i am at a loss to understand why you should desire to see me abner advanced with hand extended his face lighted up with an expansive grin why cousin fitz he said heartily do you mean to say you dont know me sir said fitzgerald drawing back you are entirely mistaken in the person i dont know you i guess its you that are mistaken fitz said the pedler familiarly why dont you remember cousin abner that used to trot you on his knee when you was a baby give us your hand in memory of old times you must be crazy said fitzgerald his cheeks red with indignation and all the more exasperated because he saw significant smiles on the faces of his schoolcompanions i spose you was too young to remember me said abner i haint seen you for ten years sir said fitz wrathfully you are trying to impose upon me i am a native of boston of course you be said the imperturbable pedler cousin jim thats your father went to boston when he was a boy and they do say hes worked his way up to be a mighty rich man your father is rich aint he my father is wealthy and always was said fitzgerald no he wasnt cousin fitz said abner when he was a boy he used to work in grandfathers store up to hampton but he got sort of discontented and went to boston did you ever hear him tell of his cousin roxanna thats my mother i see that you mean to insult me fellow said fitz pale with passion i dont know what your object is in pretending that i am your relation if you want any pecuniary help hear the boy talk said the pedler bursting into a horse laugh abner bickford dont want no pecuniary help as you call it my tincartll keep me i guess you neednt claim relationship with me said fitzgerald scornfully i havent any low relations thats so said abner emphatically but i aint sure whether i can say that for myself do you mean to insult me how can i i was talkin of my relations you say you aint one of em i am not then you neednt go for to put on the coat but youre out of your reckoning i guess i remember your mother very well she was susan baker is that true fitz ye es answered fitz reluctantly i told you so said the pedler triumphantly perhaps he is your cousin after all said henry fairbanks i tell you he isnt said fletcher impetuously how should he know your mothers name then fitz asked tom some of you fellows told him said fitzgerald i can say for one that i never knew it said tom nor i nor i we used to call her sukey baker said abner she used to go to the deestrict school along of mother they was in the same class i havent seen your mother since you was a baby how many children has she got i must decline answering your impertinent questions said fitzgerald desperately he began to entertain for the first time the horrible suspicion that the pedlers story might be true that he might after all be his cousin but he resolved that he never would admit it never where would be his pretentious claims to aristocracy where his pride if this humiliating discovery were made judging of his schoolfellows and himself he feared that they would look down upon him you seem kind o riled to find that i am your cousin said abner now fitz thats foolish i aint rich to be sure but im respectable i dont drink nor chew and ive got five hundred dollars laid away in the bank youre welcome to your five hundred dollars said fitz in what was meant to be a tone of withering sarcasm am i well id orter be considerin i earned it by hard work seems to me youve got high notions fitz your mother was kind of flighty and ive heard mine say cousin jim thats your father was mighty sot up by gettin rich but seems to me you ought not to deny your own flesh and blood i dont know who you refer to sir why you dont seem to want to own me as your cousin of course not youre only a common tinpedler well i know im a tinpedler but that dont change my bein your cousin i wish my father was here to expose your falsehood hold on there said abner youre goin a leetle too far i dont let no man nor boy neither charge me with lyin if he is my cousin i dont stand that nohow there was something in abners tone which convinced fitzgerald that he was in earnest and that he himself must take care not to go too far i dont wish to have anything more to say to you said fitz i say boys said abner turning to the crowd who had now formed a circle around the cousins i leave it to you if it aint mean for fitz to treat me in that way if he was to come to my house that aint the way id treat him come fitz said tom you are not behaving right i would not treat my cousin that way he isnt my cousin and you know it said fitz stamping with rage i wish i wasnt said abner if i could have my pick id rather have him indicating tom but blood cant be wiped out were cousins even if we dont like it are you quite sure you are right about this relationship asked henry fairbanks gravely fitz here says he belongs to one of the first families of boston well i belong to one of the first families of hampton said abner with a grin nobody dont look down on me i guess you hear that fitz said oscar be sensible and shake hands with your cousin yes shake hands with your cousin echoed the boys you all seem to want to insult me said fitz sullenly not i said oscar and ill prove it will you shake hands with me sir that i will said abner heartily i can see that youre a young gentleman and i wish i could say as much for my cousin fitz oscars example was followed by the rest of the boys who advanced in turn and shook hands with the tinpedler now fitz its your turn said tom i decline said fitz holding his hands behind his back how much he looks like his marm did when she was young said abner well boys i cant stop no longer i didnt think cousin fitz would be so stuck up just because his fathers made some money goodmornin three cheers for fitzs cousin shouted tom they were given with a will and mr bickford made acknowledgment by a nod and a grin remember me to your mother when you write cousin fitz he said at parting fitz was too angry to reply he walked off sullenly deeply mortified and humiliated and for weeks afterward nothing would more surely throw him into a rage than any allusion to his cousin the tinpedler one good effect however followed he did not venture to allude to the social position of his family in presence of his schoolmates and found it politic to lay aside some of his airs of superiority chapter xii harry joins the clionian society a week later harry walton received the following note centreville may th dear sir at the last meeting of the clionian society you were elected a member the next meeting will be held on thursday evening in the academy building yours truly george sanborn secretary mr harry walton our hero read this letter with satisfaction it would be pleasant for him to become acquainted with the academy students but he thought most of the advantages which his membership would afford him in the way of writing and speaking he had never attempted to debate and dreaded attempting it for the first time but he knew that nothing desirable would be accomplished without effort and he was willing to make that effort what have you there walton asked clapp noticing the letter which he held in his hand you can read it if you like said harry humph said clapp so you are getting in with the academy boys why shouldnt he said ferguson oh theyre a stuckup set i dont find them so that is with one exception said harry they are mostly the sones of rich men and look down on those who have to work for a living clapp was of a jealous and envious disposition and he was always fancying slights where they were not intended if i thought so said harry i would not join the society but as they have elected me i shall become a member and see how things turn out it is a good plan harry said ferguson it will be a great advantage to you i wish i had a chance to attend the academy for a couple of years said our hero thoughtfully i dont said clapp whats the good of studying latin and greek and all that rigmarole it wont bring you money will it yes said ferguson education will make a man more competent to earn money at any rate in many cases i have a cousin who used to go to school with me but his father was able to send him to college he is now a lawyer in boston making four or five times my income but it isnt for the money alone that an education is worth having there is a pleasure in being educated so i think said harry i dont see it said clapp i wouldnt be a bookworm for anybody theres walton learning french what good is it ever going to do him i can tell you better by and by when i know a little more said harry i am only a beginner now dr franklin would never have become distinguished if he had been satisfied with what he knew as an apprentice said ferguson oh if youre going to bring up franklin again ive got through said clapp with a sneer i forgot that walton was trying to be a second franklin i dont see much chance of it said harry goodhumoredly i should like to be if i could clapp seemed to be in an illhumor and the conversation was not continued he had been up late the night before with luke harrison and both had drank more than was good for them in consequence clapp had a severe headache and this did not improve his temper come round thursday evening harry said oscar vincent and go to the society with me i will introduce you to the fellows it will be less awkward you know thank you oscar i shall be glad to accept your escort when thursday evening came oscar and harry entered the society hall arm in arm oscar led his companion up to the secretary and introduced him i am glad to see you mr walton said he will you sign your name to the constitution that is all the formality we require except a slight pecuniary disbursement added oscar how much is the entrance fee asked harry one dollar you win pay that to the treasurer oscar next introduced our hero to the president and some of the leading members all of whom welcomed him cordially goodevening mr fletcher said harry observing that young gentleman near him goodevening sir said fletcher stiffly and turned on his heel without offering his hand fletcher dont feel well whispered oscar he had a visit from a poor relation the other day a tinpedler and it gave such a shock to his sensitive system that he hasnt recovered from it yet i didnt imagine mr fletcher had such a plebeian relative said harry nor did any of us the interview was rich it amused us all but what was sport to us was death to poor fitz you have only to make the most distant allusion to a tinpedler in his hearing and he will become furious then i will be careful oh it wont do any harm the fact was the boy was getting too overbearing and putting on altogether too many airs the lesson will do him good or ought to here the society was called to order and oscar and harry took their seats the exercises proceeded in regular order until the president announced a declamation by fitzgerald fletcher mr president said fletcher rising i must ask to be excused i have not had time to prepare a declamation mr president said tom carver under the circumstances i hope you will excuse mr fletcher as during the last week he has had an addition to his family there was a chorus of laughter loud and long at this sally all were amused except fletcher himself who looked flushed and provoked mr fletcher is excused said the president unable to refrain from smiling will any member volunteer to speak in his place it will be a pity to have our exercises incomplete fletcher was angry and wanted to be revenged on somebody a bright idea came to him he would place the printers devil whose admission to the society he resented in an awkward position he rose with a malicious smile upon his face mr president he said doubtless mr walton the new member who has done us the honor to join our society will be willing to supply my place we shall certainly be glad to hear a declamation from mr walton though it is hardly fair to call upon him at such short notice cant you speak something harry whispered oscar dont do it unless you are sure you can get through harry started in surprise when his name was first mentioned but he quickly resolved to accept his duty he had a high reputation at home for speaking and he had recently learned a spirited poem familiar no doubt to many of my young readers called shamus obrien it is the story of an irish volunteer who was arrested for participating in the irish rebellion of and is by turns spirited and pathetic harry had rehearsed it to himself only the night before and he had confidence in a strong and retentive memory at the presidents invitation he rose to his feet and said mr president i will do as well as i can but i hope the members of the society will make allowance for me as i have had no time for special preparation all eyes were fixed with interest upon our hero as he advanced to the platform and bowing composedly commenced his declamation it was not long before that interest increased as harry proceeded in his recitation he lost all diffidence forgot the audience and entered thoroughly into the spirit of the piece especially when in the trial scene shamus is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty harry surpassed himself and spoke with a spirit and fire which brought down the house this is the passage my lord if you ask me if in my lifetime i thought any treason or did any crime that should call to my cheek as i stand alone here the hot blush of shame or the coldness of fear though i stood by the grave to receive my deathblow before god and the world i would answer you no but if you would ask me as i think it like if in the rebellion i carried a pike an fought for ould ireland from the first to the close an shed the hearts blood of her bitterest foes i answer you yes and i tell you again though i stand here to perish its my glory that then in her cause i was willing my veins should run dhry an that now for her sake i am ready to die after the applause had subsided harry proceeded and at the conclusion of the declamation when he bowed modestly and left the platform the hall fairly shook with the stamping in which all joined except fletcher who sat scowling with dissatisfaction at a result so different from his hopes he had expected to bring discomfiture to our hero instead he had given him an opportunity to achieve a memorable triumph you did yourself credit old boy said oscar seizing and wringing the hand of harry as the latter resumed his seat why you ought to go on the stage thank you said harry i am glad i got through well isnt fitz mad though he thought youd break down look at him harry looked over to fletcher who with a sour expression was sitting upright and looking straight before him he dont look happy does he whispered oscar comically harry came near laughing aloud but luckily for fletchers peace of mind succeeded in restraining himself he wont call you up again in a hurry see if he does continued oscar i am sure we have all been gratified by mr waltons spirited declamation said the president rising we congratulate ourselves upon adding so fine a speaker to our society and hope often to have the pleasure of hearing him declaim there was a fresh outbreak of applause after which the other exercises followed when the meeting was over the members of the society crowded around harry and congratulated him on his success these congratulations he received so modestly as to confirm the favorable impression he had made by his declamation by jove old fellow said oscar as they were walking home i am beginning to be proud of you you are doing great credit to your teacher thank you professor said harry dont compliment me too much or i may become vain and put on airs if you do ill get fitz to call and remind you that you are only a printers devil after all chapter xiii vacation begins at the academy not long after his election as a member of the clionian society the summer term of the prescott academy closed the examination took place about the tenth of june and a vacation followed lasting till the first day of september of course the clionian society which was composed of academy students suspended its meetings for the same length of time indeed the last meeting for the season took place during the first week in june as the evenings were too short and too warm and the weather was not favorable to oratory at the last meeting an election was held of officers to serve for the following term the same president and vicepresident were chosen but as the secretary declined to serve another term harry walton considerably to his surprise found himself elected in his place fitzgerald fletcher did not vote for him indeed he expressed it as his opinion that it was a shame to elect a printers devil secretary of the society why is it said oscar printing is a department of literature and the clionian is a literary society isnt it of course it is a literary society but a printers devil is not literary hes as literary as a tinpedler said tom carver maliciously fletcher turned red but managed to say and what does that prove we dont object to you because you are connected with the tin business do you mean to insult me demanded fletcher angrily what have i to do with the tin business oh i beg pardon its your cousin thats in it i deny the relationship said fletcher and i will thank you not to refer again to that vulgar pedler really fitz you speak rather roughly considering hes your cousin but as to harry walton hes a fine fellow and he has an excellent handwriting and i was very glad to vote for him fitzgerald walked away not a little disgusted as well at the allusion to the tinpedler as at the success of harry walton in obtaining an office to which he had himself secretly aspired he had fancied that it would sound well to put secretary of the clionian society after his name and would give him increased consequence at home as to the tinpedler it would have relieved his mind to hear that mr bickford had been carried off suddenly by an apoplectic fit and notwithstanding the tie of kindred he would not have taken the trouble to put on mourning in his honor harry walton sat in oscar vincents room on the last evening of the term he had just finished reciting the last french lesson in which he would have oscars assistance for some time to come you have made excellent progress said oscar it is only two months since you began french and now you take a long lesson in translation that is because i have so good a teacher but do you think i can get along without help during the summer no doubt of it you may find some difficulties but those you can mark and i will explain when i come back or ill tell you what is still better write to me and ill answer shall i write in french i wish you would oscar then i will im rather lazy with the pen but i can find time for you besides it will be a good way for me to keep up my french shall you be in boston all summer oscar no our family has a summer residence at nahant a seashore place twelve miles from boston then i hope father will let me travel about a little on my own account i want to go to saratoga and lake george that would be splendid i wish you could go with me harry thank you oscar but perhaps you can secure fletchers company that will be much better than that of a printers devil like myself it may show bad taste but i should prefer your company notwithstanding your low employment thank you oscar i am much obliged fitz has been hinting to me how nice it would be for us to go off somewhere together but i dont see it in that light i asked him why he didnt secure board with his cousin the tinpedler but that made him angry and he walked away in disgust but i cant help pitying you a little harry why on account of my occupation partly all these warm summer days you have got to be working at the case while i can lounge in the shade or travel for pleasure shant you have a vacation i dont expect any i dont think i could well be spared however i dont mind it i hope to do good deal of studying while you are gone and i shant do any neither would i perhaps in your position but theres a good deal of difference between us you are a latin and greek scholar and can talk french while i am at the bottom of the ladder i have no time to lose you have begun to mount the ladder harry dont be discouraged you can climb up but i must work for it i havent got high enough up to stop and rest but there is one question i want to ask you before you go what is it what french book would you recommend after i have finished this reader i am nearly through now telemaque will be a good book to take next it is easy and interesting have you got a french dictionary no but i can buy one you can use mine while i am gone you may as well have it as not i have no copy of telemaque but i will send you one from boston agreed provided you will let me pay you for it so i would if i had to buy one but i have got an old copy not very ornamental but complete i will send it through the mail thank you oscar how kind you are dont flatter me harry the favors you refer to are but trifles i will ask a favor of you in return i wish you would then help me pack my trunk theres nothing i detest so much generally i tumble things in helterskelter and get a good scolding from mother for doing it when she inspects my trunk ill save you the trouble then bring what you want to carry home and pile it on the floor and ill do the packing a thousand thanks as the french say it takes a load off my mind by the way heres a lot of my photographs would you like one to remember your professor by very much oscar then take your choice they dont do justice to my beauty which is of a stunning description as you are aware nor do they convey an idea of the lofty intellect which sits enthroned behind my classic brow but such as they are you are welcome to one any one would think to hear you that you had no end of selfconceit oscar said harry laughing how do you know that i havent most people think they are beautiful a photographer told my sister that he was once visited by a frightfully homely man from the the country who wanted his picter took when the result was placed before him he seemed dissatisfied dont you think it like said the artist well yees he answered slowly but it hasnt got my sweet expression about the mouth very good said harry laughing thats whats the matter with your picture precisely i am glad your artistic eye detects what is wanting but hold theres a knock its fitz ill bet a hat come in he cried and fletcher walked in goodevening fletcher said oscar you see im packing or rather walton is packing hes a capital packer indeed sneered fletcher i was not aware that mr walton was in that line of business what are his terms i refer you to him what do you charge for packing trunks mr walton i think fifty cents would be about right answered harry with perfect gravity can you give me a job mr fletcher i might if i had known it in time though i am particular who handles my things walton is careful and i can vouch for his honesty said oscar carrying out the joke his wages in the printing office are not large and he would be glad to make a little extra money it must be very inconvenient to be poor said fletcher with a supercilious glance at our hero who was kneeling before oscars trunk it is answered harry quietly but as long as work is to be had i shall not complain to be sure said fletcher my father is wealthy and i shall not have to work suppose he should fail suggested oscar that is a very improbable supposition said fletcher loftily but not impossible nothing is impossible of course i say fitz if such a thing should happen youve got something to fall back upon to what do you refer mr bickford could give you an interest in the tin business goodevening said fletcher not relishing the allusion goodevening of course i shall see you in the city i suppose i ought not to tease fitz said oscar after his visitor had departed but i enjoy seeing how disgusted he looks in due time the trunk was packed and harry not without regret took leave of his friend for the summer chapter xiv harry becomes an author the closing of the academy made quite a difference in the life of centreville the number of boarding scholars was about thirty and these though few in number were often seen in the street and at the postoffice and their withdrawal left a vacancy harry walton felt quite lonely at first but there is no cure for loneliness like occupation and he had plenty of that the greater part of the day was spent in the printing office while his evenings and early mornings were occupied in study and reading he had become very much interested in french in which he found himself advancing rapidly occasionally he took tea at mr fergusons and this he always enjoyed for as i have already said he and ferguson held very similar views on many important subjects one evening at the house of the latter he saw a file of weekly papers which proved on examination to be back numbers of the weekly standard a literary paper issued in boston i take the paper for my family said ferguson it contains quite a variety of reading matter stories sketches and essays it seems quite interesting said harry yes it is i will lend you some of the back numbers if you like i would like it my father never took a literary paper his means were so limited that he could not afford it i think it is a good investment there are few papers from which you cannot obtain in a year more than the worth of the subscription besides if you are going to be an editor it will be useful for you to become familiar with the manner in which such papers are conducted when harry went home he took a dozen copies of the paper and sat up late reading them while thus engaged an idea struck him it was this could not he write something which would be accepted for publication in the standard it was his great ambition to learn to write for the press and he felt that he was old enough to commence if i dont succeed the first time i can try again he reflected the more he thought of it the more he liked the plan it is very possible that he was influenced by the example of franklin who while yet a boy in his teens contributed articles to his brothers paper though at the time the authorship was not suspected finally he decided to commence writing as soon as he could think of a suitable subject this he found was not easy he could think of plenty of subjects of which he was not qualified to write or in which he felt little interest but he rightly decided that he could succeed better with something that had a bearing upon his own experience or hopes for the future finally he decided to write on ambition i do not propose to introduce harrys essay in these pages but will give a general idea of it as tending to show his views of life he began by defining ambition as a desire for superiority by which most men were more or less affected though it manifested itself in very different ways according to the character of him with whom it was found here i will quote a passage as a specimen of harrys style and mode of expression there are some who denounce ambition as wholly bad and to be avoided by all but i think we ought to make a distinction between true and false ambition the desire of superiority is an honorable motive if it leads to honorable exertion i will mention napoleon as an illustration of false ambition which is selfish in itself and has brought misery and ruin to prosperous nations again there are some who are ambitious to dress better than their neighbors and their principal thoughts are centred upon the tie of their cravat or the cut of their coat if young men or upon the richness and style of their dresses if they belong to the other sex beau brummel is a noted instance of this kind of ambition it is said that fully half of his time was devoted to his toilet and the other half to displaying it in the streets or in society now this is a very low form of ambition and it is wrong to indulge it because it is a waste of time which could be much better employed harry now proceeded to describe what he regarded as a true and praiseworthy ambition he defined it as a desire to excel in what would be of service to the human race and he instanced his old franklin who induced by an honorable ambition worked his way up to a high civil station as well as a commanding position in the scientific world he mentioned columbus as ambitious to extend the limits of geographical knowledge and made a brief reference to the difficulties and discouragements over which he triumphed on the way to success he closed by an appeal to boys and young men to direct their ambition into worthy channels so that even if they could not leave behind a great name they might at least lead useful lives and in dying have the satisfaction of thinking that they done some service to the race this will give a very fair idea of harrys essay there was nothing remarkable about it and no striking originality in the ideas but it was very creditably expressed for a boy of his years and did even more credit to his good judgment since it was an unfolding of the principles by which he meant to guide his own life it must not be supposed that our hero was a genius and that he wrote his essay without difficulty it occupied him two evenings to write it and he employed the third in revising and copying it it covered about five pages of manuscript and according to his estimate would fill about twothirds of a long column in the standard after preparing it the next thing was to find a nom de plume for he shrank from signing his own name after long consideration he at last decided upon franklin and this was the name he signed to his maiden contribution to the press he carried it to the postoffice one afternoon after his work in the printing office was over and dropped it unobserved into the letterbox he did not want the postmaster to learn his secret as he would have done had he received it directly from him and noted the address on the envelope for the rest of the week harry went about his work weighed down with his important secret a secret which he had not even shared with ferguson if the essay was declined as he thought it might very possibly be he did not want any one to know it if it were accepted and printed it would be time enough then to make it known but there were few minutes in which his mind was not on his literary venture his preoccupation was observed by his fellowworkmen in the office and he was rallied upon it goodnaturedly by ferguson but in a different spirit by clapp it seems to me you are unusually silent harry said ferguson youre not in love are you not that i know of said harry smiling its rather too early yet ive known boys of your age to fancy themselves in love he is is more likely thinking up some great discovery said clapp sneering you know hes a second franklin thank you for the compliment said our hero goodhumoredly but i dont deserve it i dont expect to make any great discovery at present i suppose you expect to set the river on fire some day said clapp sarcastically i am afraid it wouldnt do much good to try said harry who was too sensible to take offence it isnt so easily done i suppose some day we shall be proud of having been in the same office with so great a man pursued clapp really clapp youre rather hard on our young friend said ferguson he doesnt put on any airs of superiority or pretend to anything uncommon hes very kind such an intellect as hes got too said clapp im glad you found it out said harry i havent a very high idea of my intellect yet i wish i had more reason to do so finding that he had failed in his attempt to provoke harry by his ridicule clapp desisted but he disliked him none the less the fact was that clapp was getting into a bad way he had no high aim in life and cared chiefly for the pleasure of the present moment he had found luke harrison a congenial companion and they had been associated in more than one excess the morning previous clapp had entered the printing office so evidently under the influence of liquor that he had been sharply reprimanded by mr anderson i dont choose to interfere with your mode of life unwise and ruinous as i may consider it he said as long as it does not interfere with your discharge of duty but today you are clearly incapacitated for labor and i have a right to complain if it happens again i shall be obliged to look for another journeyman clapp did not care to leave his place just at present for he had no money saved up and was even somewhat in debt and it might be some time before he got another place so he rather sullenly agreed to be more careful in future and did not go to work till the afternoon but though circumstances compelled him to submit it put him in bad humor and made him more disposed to sneer than ever he had an unreasoning prejudice against harry which was stimulated by luke harrison who had this very sufficient reason for hating our hero that he had succeeded in injuring him as an old proverb has it we are slow to forgive those whom we have injured chapter xv a literary debut harry waited eagerly for the next issue of the weekly standard it was received by mr anderson in exchange for the centreville gazette and usually came to hand on saturday morning harry was likely to obtain the first chance of examining the paper as he was ordinarily sent to the postoffice on the arrival of the morning mail his hands trembled as he unfolded the paper and hurriedly scanned the contents but he looked in vain for his essay on ambition there was not even a reference to it he was disappointed but he soon became hopeful again i couldnt expect it to appear so soon he reflected these city weeklies have to be printed some days in advance it may appear yet so he was left in suspense another week hopeful and doubtful by turns of the success of his first offering for the press he was rallied from time to time on his silence in the office but he continued to keep his secret if his contribution was slighted no one should know it but himself at last another saturday morning came around and again he set out for the postoffice again he opened the paper with trembling fingers and eagerly scanned the wellfilled columns this time his search was rewarded there on the first column of the last page in all the glory of print was his treasured essay a flash of pleasure tinged his cheek and his heart beat rapidly as he read his first printed production it is a great event in the life of a literary novice when he first sees himself even byron says tis pleasant sure to see ones self in print to our young hero the essay read remarkably well better than he had expected but then very likely he was prejudiced in its favor he read it through three times on his way back to the printing office and each time felt better satisfied i wonder if any of the readers will think it was written by a boy thought harry probably many did so suspect for as i have said though the thoughts were good and sensible the article was only moderately well expressed a practised critic would readily have detected marks of immaturity although it was a very creditable production for a boy of sixteen shall i tell ferguson thought harry on the whole he concluded to remain silent just at present he knew ferguson took the paper and waited to see if he would make any remark about it i should like to hear him speak of it without knowing that i was the writer thought our hero just before he reached the office he discovered with satisfaction the following editorial reference to his article we print in another column an essay on ambition by a new contributor it contains some good ideas and we especially commend it to the perusal of our young readers we hope to hear from franklin again thats good thought harry i am glad the editor likes it i shall write again as soon as possible what makes you look so bright harry asked ferguson as he reentered the office has any one left you a fortune not that i know of said harry do i look happier than usual so it seems to me harry was spared answering this question for clapp struck in grumbling as usual i wish somebodyd leave me a fortune you wouldnt see me here long what would you do asked his fellowworkman cut work to begin with id go to europe and have a jolly time you can do that without a fortune i should like to know how be economical and you can save enough in three years to pay for a short trip bayard taylor was gone two years and only spent five hundred dollars oh hang economy drawled clapp it dont suit me i should like to know how a fellers going to economize on fifteen dollars a week i could oh no doubt sneered clapp but a man cant starve come round and take supper with me some night said ferguson goodhumoredly and you can judge for yourself whether i believe in starving clapp didnt reply to this invitation he would not have enjoyed a quiet evening with his fellowworkman an evening at billiards or cards accompanied by bets on the games would have been much more to his mind who is bayard taylor that made such a cheap tour in europe asked harry soon afterward a young journalist who had a great desire to travel he has lately published an account of his tour i dont buy many books but i bought that would you like to read it very much you can have it any time thank you on monday a very agreeable surprise awaited harry i am out of copy he said going up to mr andersons table heres a selection for the first page said mr anderson cut it in two and give part of it to clapp could harry believe his eyes it was his own article on ambition and it was to be reproduced in the gazette next to the delight of seeing ones self in print for the first time is the delight of seeing that first article copied it is a mark of appreciation which cannot be mistaken still harry said nothing but with a manner as unconcerned as possible handed the lower half of the essay to clapp to set up the signature franklin had been cut off and the name of the paper from which the essay had been cut was substituted wouldnt clapp feel disgusted thought harry if he knew that he was setting up an article of mine i believe he would have a fit he was too considerate to expose his fellowworkman to such a contingency and went about his work in silence that evening he wrote to the publisher of the standard inclosing the price of two copies of the last number which he desired should be sent to him by mail he wished to keep one himself and the other he intended to forward to his father who he knew would sympathize with him in his success as well as his aspirations he accompanied the paper by a letter in which he said i want to improve in writing as much as i can i want to be something more than a printer sometime i shall try to qualify myself for an editor for an editor can exert a good deal of influence in the community i hope you will approve my plans in due time harry received the following reply my dear son i am indeed pleased and proud to hear of your success not that it is a great matter in itself but because i think it shows that you are in earnest in your determination to win an honorable position by honorable labor i am sorry that my narrow means have not permitted me to give you those advantages which wealthy fathers can bestow upon their sons i should like to have sent you to college and given you an opportunity afterward of studying for a profession i think your natural abilities would have justified such an outlay but alas poverty has always held me back it shuts out you as it has shut out me from the chance of culture your college my boy must be the printing office if you make the best of that you will find that it is no mean instructor not franklin alone but many of our most eminent and influential men have graduated from it you will be glad to hear that we are all well i have sold the cow which i bought of squire green and got another in her place that proves to be much better we all send much love and your mother wishes me to say that she misses you very much as indeed we all do but we know that you are better off in centreville than you would be at home and that helps to make us contented dont forget to write every week your affectionate father hiram walton p s if you print any more articles we shall be interested to read them harry read this letter with eager interest he felt glad that his father was pleased with him and it stimulated him to increased exertions poor father he said to himself he has led a hard life cultivating that rocky little farm it has been hard work and poor pay with him i hope there is something better in store for him if i ever get rich or even well off i will take care that he has an easier time after the next issue of the gazette had appeared harry informed ferguson in confidence that he was the author of the article on ambition i congratulate you harry said his friend it is an excellent essay well thought out and well expressed i dont wonder now you tell me of it it sounds like you without knowing the authorship i asked clapp his opinion of it what did he say are you sure it wont hurt your feelings it may but i shall get over it go ahead he said it was rubbish harry laughed he would be confirmed in his decision if he knew that i wrote it he said no doubt but dont let that discourage you keep on writing by all means and youll become an editor in time chapter xvi ferdinand b kensington it has already been mentioned that john clapp and luke harrison were intimate though their occupations differed one being a printer and the other a shoemaker they had similar tastes and took similar views of life both were discontented with the lot which fortune had assigned them to work at the case or the shoebench seemed equally irksome and they often lamented to each other the hard necessity which compelled them to it suppose we listen to their conversation as they walked up the village street one evening about this time smoking cigars i say luke said john clapp ive got tired of this kind of life here ive been in the office a year and im not a cent richer than when i entered it besides working like a dog all the while just my case said luke ive been shoemakin ever since i was fourteen and ill be blest if i can show five dollars to save my life whats worse said clapp there isnt any prospect of anything better in my case whats a feller to do on fifteen dollars a week wont old anderson raise your wages not he he thinks i ought to get rich on what he pays me now and clapp laughed scornfully if i were like ferguson i might he never spends a cent without taking twentyfour hours to think it over beforehand my readers who are familiar with mr fergusons views and ways of life will at once see that this was unjust but justice cannot be expected from an angry and discontented man just so said luke if a feller was to live on bread and water and get along with one suit of clothes a year he might save something but that aint my style nor mine its strange how lucky some men are said luke they get rich without tryin i never was lucky i bought a ticket in a lottery once but of course i didnt draw anything just my luck so did i said clapp but i fared no better it seemed as if fortune had a spite against me here i am twentyfive years old and all im worth is two dollars and a half and i owe more than that to the tailor youre as rich as i am said luke i only get fourteen dollars a week thats less than you do a dollar more or less dont amount to much said clapp ill tell you what it is luke he resumed after a pause im getting sick of centreville so am i said luke but it dont make much difference if i had fifty dollars id go off and try my luck somewhere else but ill have to wait till im grayheaded before i get as much as that cant you borrow it whod lend it to me i dont know if i did id go in for borrowing myself i wish there was some way of my getting to california california repeated luke with interest what would you do there id go to the mines do you think theres money to be made there i know there is said clapp emphatically how do you know it theres an old schoolmate of mine ralph smith went out there two years ago last week he returned home i heard it in a letter and how much do you think he brought with him how much eight thousand dollars eight thousand dollars he didnt make it all at the mines did he yes he did when he went out there he had just money enough to pay his passage now after only two years he can lay off and live like a gentleman hes been lucky and no mistake you bet he has but we might be as lucky if we were only out there ay theres the rub a fellow cant travel for nothing at this point in their conversation a welldressed young man evidently a stranger in the village met them and stopping asked politely for a light this clapp afforded him you are a stranger in the village he said with some curiosity yes i was never here before i come from new york indeed if i lived in new york id stay there and not come to such a beastly place as centreville do you live here asked the stranger yes i wonder you live in such a beastly place he said with a smile you wouldnt if you knew the reason what is the reason i cant get away the stranger laughed cruel parents he asked not much said clapp the plain reason is that i havent got money enough to get me out of town its the same with me said luke harrison gentlemen we are well met said the stranger im hard up myself you dont look like it said luke glancing at his rather flashy attire these clothes are not paid for said the stranger laughing and whats more i dont think they are likely to be but i take it you gentlemen are better off than i in one respect youve got situations something to do yes but on starvation pay said clapp im in the office of the centreville gazette and im in a shoemakers shop its a beastly business for a young man of spirit said luke well im a gentleman at large living on my wits and pretty poor living it is sometimes said the stranger as i think well agree together pretty well im glad ive met you we ought to know each other better theres my card he drew from his pocket a highly glazed piece of pasteboard bearing the name frederick b kensington i havent any cards with me said clapp but my name is john clapp and mine is luke harrison said the bearer of that appellation im proud to know you gentlemen if you have no objection well walk on together to this clapp and luke acceded readily indeed they were rather proud of being seen in company with a young man so dashing in manner and fashionably dressed though in a pecuniary way their new acquaintance by his own confession was scarcely as well off as themselves where are you staying mr kensington said clapp at the hotel its a poor place no style of course not i cant help wondering mr kensington what can bring you to such a onehorse place as this i dont mind telling you then the fact is ive got an old aunt living about two miles from here shes alone in the world got neither chick nor child and is worth at least ten thousand dollars do you see i think i do said clapp you want to come in for a share of the stamps yes i want to see if i cant get something out of the old girl said kensington carelessly do you think the chance is good i dont know i hear shes pretty tightfisted but ive run on here on the chance of doing something if she will only make me her heir and give me five hundred dollars in hand ill go to california and see whatll turn up california repeated john clapp and luke in unison yes were you ever there no but we were talking of going there just as you came up said john an old schoolmate of mine has just returned from there with eight thousand dollars in gold lucky fellow thats the kind of haul id like to make do you know how much it costs to go out there the prices are down just at present you can go for a hundred dollars second cabin it might as well be a thousand said luke clapp and i cant raise a hundred dollars apiece to save our lives ill tell you what said kensington you two fellows are just the company id like if i can raise five hundred dollars out of the old girl ill take you along with me and you can pay me after you get out there john clapp and luke harrison were astounded at this liberal offer from a perfect stranger but they had no motives of delicacy about accepting it they grasped the hand of their new friend and assured him that nothing would suit them so well all right said kensington then its agreed now boys suppose we go round to the tavern and ratify our compact by a drink i say amen to that answered clapp but i insist on standing treat just as you say said kensington come along it was late when the three parted company luke and john clapp were delighted with their new friend and as they staggered home with uncertain steps they indulged in bright visions of future prosperity chapter xvii aunt deborah miss deborah kensington sat in an oldfashioned rockingchair covered with a cheap print industriously engaged in footing a stocking she was a maiden lady of about sixty with a thin face thick seamed with wrinkles a prominent nose bridged by spectacles sharp gray eyes and thin lips she was a shrewd new england woman who knew very well how to take care of and increase the property which she had inherited her nephew had been correctly informed as to her being closefisted all her establishment was carried on with due regard to economy and though her income in the eyes of a city man would be counted small she saved half of it every year thus increasing her accumulations as she sat placidly knitting an interruption came in the shape of a knock at the front door ill go myself she said rising and laying down the stocking hannahs out in the back room and wont hear i hope it aint mrs smith come to borrow some butter she aint returned that last halfpound she borrowed she seems to think her neighbors have got to support her these thoughts were in her mind as she opened the door but no mrs smith presented her figure to the old ladys gaze she saw instead with considerable surprise a stylish young man with a book under his arm she jumped to the conclusion that he was a bookpedler having been annoyed by several persistent specimens of that class of travelling merchants if youve got books to sell she said opening the attack you may as well go away i aint got no money to throw away mr ferdinand b kensington for he was the young man in question laughed heartily while the old lady stared at him half amazed half angry i dont see what there is to laugh at said she offended i was laughing at the idea of my being taken for a bookpedler well aint you one she retorted if you aint what be you aunt deborah dont you know me asked the young man familiarly who are you that calls me aunt demanded the old lady puzzled im your brother henrys son my name is ferdinand you dont say so ejaculated the old lady why id never ave thought it i aint seen you since you was a little boy this dont look as if i was a little boy aunt said the young man touching his luxuriant whiskers how time passes i do declare said deborah well come in and well talk over old times where did you come from from the city of new york thats where ive been living for some time you dont say well what brings you this way to see you aunt deborah its so long since ive seen you that i thought id like to come im glad to see you ferdinand said the old lady flattered by such a degree of dutiful attention from a finelooking young man so your poor fathers dead yes aunt hes been dead three years i suppose he didnt leave much he wasnt very forehanded no aunt he left next to nothing well it didnt matter much seein as you was the only child and big enough to take care of yourself still aunt it would have been comfortable if he had left me a few thousand dollars aint you doin well you look as if you was said deborah surveying critically her nephews good clothes well ive been earning a fair salary but its very expensive living in a great city like new york humph thats accordin as you manage if you live snug you can get along there cheap as well as anywhere i reckon what was you doin i was a salesman for a t stewart our leading drygoods merchant what pay did you get a thousand dollars a year why thats a fine salary youd ought to save up a good deal you dont realize how much it costs to live in new york aunt of course if i lived here i could live on half the sum but i have to pay high prices for everything in new york you dont need to spend such a sight on dress said deborah disapprovingly i beg your pardon aunt deborah thats where you are mistaken the storekeepers in new york expect you to dress tiptop and look genteel so as to do credit to them if it hadnt been for that i shouldnt have spent half so much for dress then boards very expensive you can get boarded here for two dollars and a half a week said aunt deborah two dollars and a half why i never paid less than eight dollars a week in the city and you can only get poor board for that the boardinghouses must make a great deal of money said deborah if i was younger id maybe go to new york and keep one myself youre rich aunt you dont need to do that who told you i was rich said the old lady quickly why youve only got yourself to take care of and you own this farm dont you yes but farmin dont pay much i always heard you were pretty comfortable so i am said the old lady and maybe i save something but my income aint as great as yours you have only yourself to look after and it is cheap living in centreville i dont fling money away i dont spend quarter as much as you on dress looking at the old ladya faded bombazine dress ferdinand was very ready to believe this you dont have to dress here i suppose he answered but aunt we wont talk about money matters just yet it was funny you took me for a bookpedler it was that book you had that made me think so its a book i brought as a present to you aunt deborah you dont say said the old lady gratified what is it let me look at it its a copy of pilgrims progress illustrated i knew you wouldnt like the trashy books they write nowadays so i brought you this really ferdinand youre very considerate said aunt deborah turning over the leaves with manifest pleasure its a good book and i shall be glad to have it where are you stoppin at the hotel in the village you must come and stay here you can get em to send round your things any time thank you aunt i shall be delighted to do so it seems so pleasant to see you again after so many years you dont look any older than when i saw you last miss deborah knew very well that she did look older but still she was pleased by the compliment is there any one who does not like to receive the same assurance im afraid your eyes aint very sharp ferdinand she said i feel im gettin old why im sixtyone come october are you i shouldnt call you over fifty from your looks aunt really i shouldnt im afraid you tell fibs sometimes said aunt deborah but she said it very graciously and surveyed her nephew very kindly heigh ho its a good while since your poor father and i were children together and went to the schoolhouse on the hill now hes gone and im left alone not alone aunt if he is dead you have got a nephew well ferdinand im glad to see you and i shall be glad to have you pay me a good long visit but how can you be away from your place so long did mr stewart give you a vacation no aunt i left him for good yes left a place where you was gettin a thousand dollars a year said the old lady in accents of strong disapproval yes aunt then i think you was very foolish said deborah with emphasis perhaps you wont when you know why i left it why did you because i could do better better than a thousand dollars a year said deborah with surprise yes i am offered two thousand dollars in san francisco you dont say ejaculated deborah letting her stocking drop in sheer amazement yes i do its a positive fact you must be a smart clerk well it isnt for me to say said ferdinand laughing when be you goin out in a week but i thought i must come and bid you goodby first im real glad to see you ferdinand said aunt deborah the more warmly because she considered him so prosperous that she would have no call to help him but here she was destined to find herself mistaken chapter xviii aunt and nephew i dont think i can come here till tomorrow aunt deborah said ferdinand a little later ill stay at the hotel tonight and come round with my baggage in the morning very well nephew but now youre here you must stay to tea thank you aunt i will i little thought this mornin i should have henrys son to tea said aunt deborah half to herself you dont look any like him ferdinand no i dont think i do its curis too for you was his very picter when you was a boy ive changed a good deal since then aunt deborah said her nephew a little uneasily so you have to be sure now theres your hair used to be almost black now its brown really i cant account for it and aunt deborah surveyed the young man over her spectacles youve got a good memory aunt said ferdinand with a forced laugh now ef your hair had grown darker i shouldnt have wondered pursued aunt deborah but it aint often black turns to brown thats so aunt but i can explain it said ferdinand after a slight pause how was it you know the french barbers can change your hair to any shade you want can they yes to be sure now dont laugh at me aunt a young lady i used to like didnt fancy dark hair so i went to a french barber and he changed the color for me in three months you dont say fact aunt but he made me pay him well too how much did you give him fifty dollars aunt thats what i call wasteful said aunt deborah disapprovingly couldnt you be satisfied with the natral color of your hair to my mind blacks handsomer than brown youre right aunt i wouldnt have done it if it hadnt been for miss percival are you engaged to her no aunt deborah the fact was i found she wasnt domestic and didnt know anything about keeping house but only cared for dress so i drew off and shes married to somebody else now im glad to hear it said deborah emphatically the jade she wouldnt have been a proper wife for you you want some good girl thats willin to go into the kitchen and look after things and not carry all shes worth on her back i agree with you aunt said ferdinand who thought it politic in view of the request he meant to make by and by to agree with hie aunt in her views of what a wife should be aunt deborah began to regard her nephew as quite a sensible young man and to look upon him with complacency i wish ferdinand she said you liked farmin why aunt you could stay here and manage my farm for me heaven forbid thought the young man with a shudder i should be bored to death does the old lady think i would put on a frock and overalls and go out and plough or hoe potatoes its a good healthy business pursued aunt deborah unconscious of the thoughts which were passing through her nephews mind and you wouldnt have to spend much for dress then im gittin old and though i dont want to make no promises id very likely will it to you ef i was satisfied with the way you managed youre very kind aunt said ferdinand but im afraid i wasnt cut out for farming you know i never lived in the country why yes you did said the old lady you was born in the country and lived there till you was ten years old to be sure said ferdinand hastily but i was too young then to take notice of farming what does a boy of ten know of such things to be sure youre right there the fact is aunt deborah some men are born to be farmers and some are born to be traders now ive got a talent for trading thats the reason ive got such a good offer from san francisco how did you get it did you know the man he used to be in business in new york he was the first man i worked for and he knew what i was san francisco is full of money and traders make more than they do here thats the reason he can afford to offer me so large a salary when did he send for you i got the letter last week have you got it with you no aunt i may have it at the hotel said the young man hesitating but i am not certain well its a good offer there isnt nobody in centreville gets so large a salary no i suppose not they dont need it as it is cheap living here i hope when you get out there ferdinand youll save up money youd ought to save twothirds of your pay i will try to aunt youll be wantin to get married bimeby and then itll be convenient to have some money to begin with to be sure aunt i see you know how to manage i was always considered a good manager said deborah complacently ef your poor father had had my faculty he wouldnt have died as poor as he did i can tell you what a conceited old woman she is with her faculty thought ferdinand but what he said was quite different i wish he had had aunt it would have been better for me well you ought to get along with your prospects little the old woman knows what my real prospects are thought the young man of course i ought he said excuse me a few minutes nephew said aunt deborah gathering up her knitting and rising from her chair i must go out and see about tea maybe youd like to read that nice book you brought no i thank you aunt i think ill take a little walk round your place if youll allow me sartin ferdinand only come back in half an hour teall be ready then yea aunt ill remember so while deborah was in the kitchen ferdinand took a walk in the fields laughing to himself from time to time as if something amused him he returned in due time and sat down to supper aunt deborah had provided her best and though the dishes were plain they were quite palatable when supper was over the young man said now aunt i think i will be getting back to the hotel youll come over in the morning ferdinand and fetch your trunk yes aunt goodnight goodnight well thought the young man as he tramped back to the hotel ive opened the campaign and made i believe a favorable impression but what a pack of lies i have had to tell to be sure the old lady came near catching me once or twice particularly about the color of my hair it was a lucky thought that about the french barber it deceived the poor old soul i dont think she could ever have been very handsome if she was she must have changed fearfully in the evening john clapp and luke harrison came round to the hotel to see him have you been to see your aunt asked clapp yes i took tea there have a good time oh i played the dutiful nephew to perfection the old lady thinks a sight of me how did you do it i agreed with all she said told her how young she looked and humbugged her generally clapp laughed the best part of the joke is will you promise to keep dark of course dont breathe it to a living soul you two fellows she isnt my aunt of all isnt your aunt no her true nephew is in new york i know him but i know enough of family matters to gull the old lady and i hope raise a few hundred dollars out of her this was a joke which luke and clapp could appreciate and they laughed heartily at the deception which was being practised on simple aunt deborah particularly when ferdinand explained how he got over the difficulty of having different colored hair from the real owner of the name he assumed we must have a drink on that said luke walk up gentlemen im agreeable said ferdinand and i said clapp never refuse a good offer say i poor aunt deborah she little dreamed that she was the dupe of a designing adventurer who bore no relationship to her chapter xix the romance of a ring ferdinand b kensington as he called himself removed the next morning to the house of aunt deborah the latter received him very cordially partly because it was a pleasant relief to her solitude to have a lively and active young man in the house partly because she was not forced to look upon him as a poor relation in need of pecuniary assistance she even felt considerable respect for the prospective recipient of an income of two thousand dollars which in her eyes was a magnificent salary ferdinand on his part spared no pains to make himself agreeable to the old lady whom he had a mercenary object in pleasing finding that she was curious to hear about the great city which to her was as unknown as london or paris be gratified her by long accounts chiefly of as imaginative character to which she listened greedily these included some personal adventures in all of which he figured very creditably here is a specimen by the way aunt deborah he said casually have you noticed this ring on my middle finger no i didnt notice it before ferdinand its very handsome i should think it ought to be aunt deborah said the young man why it cost enough to be handsome how much did it cost asked the old lady not without curiosity guess i aint no judge of such things ive only got this plain gold ring yours has got some sort of a stone in it that stone is a diamond aunt deborah you dont say so let me look at it it aint got no color looks like glass its very expensive though how much do you think it cost well maybe five dollars five dollars ejaculated the young man why what can you be thinking of aunt deborah i shouldnt have guessed so much said the old lady misunderstanding him only you said it was expensive so it is five dollars would be nothing at all you dont say it cost more a great deal more did it cost ten dollars more fifteen i see aunt you have no idea of the cost of diamond rings you may believe me or not but that ring cost six hundred and fifty dollars what almost screamed aunt deborah letting fall her knitting in her surprise its true six hundred and fifty dollars for a little piece of gold and glass ejaculated the old lady diamond aunt not glass well it dont look a bit bettern glass and i do say proceeded deborah with energy that its a sin and a shame to pay so much money for a ring why it was more than half your years salary ferdinand i agree with you aunt it would have been very foolish and wrong for a young man on a small salary like mine to buy so expensive a ring as this i hope aunt deborah i have inherited too much of your good sense to do that then where did you get it asked the old lady moderating her tone it was given to me given to you who would give you such a costly present a rich man whose life i once saved aunt deborah you dont say so ferdinand said aunt deborah interested tell me all about it so i will aunt though i dont often speak of it said ferdinand modestly it seems like boasting you know and i never like to do that but this is the way it happened now for a good tough lie said ferdinand to himself as the old lady suspended her work and bent forward with eager attention you know of course that new york and brooklyn are on opposite sides of the river and that people have to go across in ferryboats yes ive heard that ferdinand im glad of that because now youll know that my story is correct well one summer i boarded over in brooklyn on the heights and used to cross the ferry morning and night it was the wall street ferry and a great many bankers and rich merchants used to cross daily also one of these was a mr clayton a wholesale drygoods merchant immensely rich whom i knew by sight though i had never spoken to him it was one thursday morning i remember even the day of the week when the boat was unusually full mr clayton was leaning against the siderailing talking to a friend when all at once the railing gave way and he fell backward into the water which immediately swallowed him up merciful man ejaculated aunt deborah intensely interested go on ferdinand of course there was a scene of confusion and excitement continued ferdinand dramatically man overboard who will save him said more than one i will i exclaimed and in an instant i had sprang over the railing into the boiling current werent you frightened to death asked the old lady could you swim of course i could more than once i have swum all the way from new york to brooklyn i caught mr clayton by the collar as he was sinking for the third time and shouted to a boatman near by to come to my help well there isnt much more to tell we were taken on board the boat and rowed to shore mr clayton recovered his senses so far as to realize that i had saved his life what is your name young man he asked grasping my hand ferdinand b kensington i answered modestly you have saved my life he said warmly i am very glad of it said i you have shown wonderful bravery oh no i answered i know how to swim and i wasnt going to see you drown before my eyes i shall never cease to be grateful to you oh dont think of it said i but i must think of it he answered but for you i should now be a senseless corpse lying in the bottom of the river and he shuddered mr clayton said i let me advise you to get home as soon as possible or you will catch your death of cold so will you he said you must come with me he insisted so i went and was handsomely treated you may depend mr clayton gave me a new suit of clothes and the next morning he took me to tiffanys thats the best jeweller in new york and bought me this diamond ring he first offered me money but i felt delicate about taking money for such a service and told him so so he bought me this ring well i declare ejaculated aunt deborah that was an adventure but it seems to me ferdinand i would have taken the money as to that aunt i can sell this ring if ever i get hard up but i hope i shant be obliged to you certainly behaved very well ferdinand do you ever see mr clayton now sometimes but i dont seek his society for fear he would think i wanted to get something more out of him how much money do you think hed have given you asked aunt deborah who was of a practical nature a thousand dollars perhaps more seems to me i would have taken it if i had people would have said thats why i jumped into the water whereas i wasnt thinking anything about getting a reward so now aunt you wont think it very strange that i wear such an expensive ring of course it makes a difference as you didnt buy it yourself i dont see how folks can be such fools as to throw away hundreds of dollars for such a trifle well aunt everybody isnt as sensible and practical as you now i agree with you i think its very foolish still im glad ive got the ring because i can turn it into money when i need to only you see i dont like to part with a gift although i dont think mr clayton would blame me of course he wouldnt ferdinand but i dont see why you should need money when youre goin to get such a handsome salary in san francisco to be sure aunt but theres something else however i wont speak of it today tomorrow i may want to ask your advice on a matter of business ill advise you the best i can ferdinand said the flattered spinster you see aunt youre so clearheaded i shall place great dependence on your advice but i think ill take a little walk now just to stretch my limbs ive made good progress said the young man to himself as he lounged over the farm the old lady swallows it all tomorrow must come my grand stroke i thought i wouldnt propose it today for fear shed suspect the ring story chapter xx a business transaction ferdinand found life at the farmhouse rather slow nor did he particularly enjoy the society of the spinster whom he called aunt but he was playing for a valuable stake and meant to play out his game strike while the iron is hot said he to himself thats a good rule but how shall i know when it is hot however i must risk something and take my chances with the old lady aunt deborah herself hastened his action her curiosity had been aroused by ferdinands intimation that he wished her advice on a matter of business and the next morning after breakfast she said ferdinand what was that you wanted to consult me about you may as well tell me now as any time here goes then thought the young man ill tell you aunt you know i am offered a large salary in san francisco yes you told me so and as you said the other day i can lay up half my salary and in time become a rich man to be sure you can but there is one difficulty in the way what is that i must go out there of course you must said the old lady who did not yet see the point and unfortunately it costs considerable money havent you got enough money to pay your fare out there no aunt it is very expensive living in new york and i was unable to save anything from my salary how much does it cost to go out there about two hundred and fifty dollars thats a good deal of money so it is but it will be a great deal better to pay it than to lose so good a place i hope said the old lady sharply you dont expect me to pay your expenses out there my dear aunt said ferdinand hastily how can you suspect such a thing then what do you propose to do asked the spinster somewhat relieved i wanted to ask your advice sell your ring its worth over six hundred dollars very true but i should hardly like to part with it ill tell you what i have thought of it cost six hundred and fifty dollars i will give it as security to any one who will lend me five hundred dollars with permission to sell it if i fail to pay up the note in six months by the way aunt why cant you accommodate me in this matter you will lose nothing and i will pay handsome interest how do you know i have the money i dont know but i think you must have but although i am your nephew i wouldnt think of asking you to lend me money without security business is business so i say very true ferdinand i ask nothing on the score of relationship but i will make a business proposal i dont believe the ring would fetch over six hundred dollars it would bring just about that the other fifty dollars represent the profit now aunt ill make you a regular business proposal if youll lend me five hundred dollars ill give you my note for five hundred and fifty bearing interest at six per cent payable in six months or to make all sure say in a year i place the ring in your hands with leave to sell it at the end of that time if i fail to carry out my agreement but i shant if i keep my health the old lady was attracted by the idea of making a bonus of fifty dollars but she was cautious and averse to parting with her money i dont know what to say ferdinand she replied five hundred dollars is a good deal of money so it is aunt well i dont know but i can offer you a little better terms give me four hundred and seventyfive and ill give you a note for five hundred and fifty you cant make as much interest anywhere else id like to accommodate you said the old lady hesitating for like most avaricious persons she was captivated by the prospect of making extralegal interest i know you would aunt deborah but i dont want to ask the money as a favor it is a strictly business transaction i am afraid i couldnt spare more than four hundred and fifty very well i wont dispute about the extra twentyfive dollars considering how much income im going to get it isnt of any great importance and youll give me a note for five hundred and fifty yes certainly i dont know as i ought to take so much interest its worth that to me for though of course i could raise it by selling the ring i dont like to do that well i dont know but ill do it ill get some ink and you can write me the due bill why aunt deborah you havent got the money here have you yes ive got it in the house a man paid up a mortgage last week and i havent yet invested the money i meant to put it in the savings bank you wouldnt get but six per cent there now the bonus i offer you will be equal to about twenty per cent and you really feel able to pay so much yes aunt as i told you it will be worth more than that to me well ferdinand well settle the matter now ill go and get the money and you shall give me the note and the ring triumph said the young man to himself when the old lady had left the room youre badly sold aunt deborah but its a good job for me i didnt think i would have so little trouble within fifteen minutes the money was handed over and aunt deborah took charge of the note and the valuable diamond ring be careful of the ring aunt deborah said ferdinand remember i expect to redeem it again ill take good care of it nephew never fear if it were a little smaller you could wear it yourself how would deborah kensington look with a diamond ring the neighbors would think i was crazy no ill keep it in a safe place but i wont wear it now aunt deborah i must speak about other arrangements dont you think it would be well to start for san francisco as soon as possible you know i enter upon my duties as soon as i get there yes ferdinand i think you ought to i wish i could spare the time to spend a week with you aunt but business is business and my motto is business before pleasure and very proper too ferdinand said the old lady approvingly so i think i had better leave centreville tomorrow may be you had you must write and let me know when you get there and how you like your place so i will and i shall be glad to know that you take an interest in me now aunt as i have some errands to do i will walk to the village and come back about the middle of the afternoon wont you be back to dinner no i think not aunt very well ferdinand come as soon as you can half an hour later ferdinand entered the office of the centreville gazette how do you do mr kensington said clapp eagerly anything new i should like to speak with you a moment in private mr clapp all right clapp put on his coat and went outside shutting the door behind him well said ferdinand ive succeeded have you got the money yes but not quite as much as i anticipated cant you carry out your plan asked clapp soberly fearing he was to be left out in the cold ive formed a new one instead of going to california which is very expensive well go out west say to st louis and try our fortune there what do you say im agreed can luke go too yes ill take you both out there and lend you fifty dollars each besides and you shall pay me back as soon as you are able will you let your friend know yes ill undertake that but when do you propose to start tomorrow morning whew thats short notice i want to get away as soon as possible for fear the old lady should change her mind and want her money back thats where youre right of course you must give up your situation at once as there is short time to get ready no trouble about that said clapp ive hated the business for a long time and shall be only too glad to leave its the same with luke he wont shed many tears at leaving centreville well well all meet this evening at the hotel i depend upon your both being ready to start in the morning all right ill let luke know it may be thought singular that ferdinand should have made so liberal an offer to two comparative strangers but to do the young man justice though he had plenty of faults he was disposed to be generous when he had money though he was not particular how he obtained it clapp and luke harrison he recognized as congenial spirits and he was willing to sacrifice something to obtain their companionship how long his fancy was likely to last was perhaps doubtful but for the present he was eager to associate them with his own plans chapter xxi harry is promoted clapp reentered the printing office highly elated mr anderson said he to the editor i am going to leave you ferguson and harry walton looked up in surprise and mr anderson asked have you got another place no i am going west indeed how long have you had that in view not long i am going with mr kensington the one who just called on you yes how soon do you want to leave now that is rather short notice i know it but i leave town tomorrow morning well i wish you success here is the money i owe you shant we see you again clapp asked ferguson yes ill just look in and say goodby now i must go home and get ready well ferguson said mr andersen after clapps departure that is rather sudden so i think how can we get along with only two hands very well sir im willing to work a little longer and harry here is a pretty quick compositor now the fact is there isnt enough work for three then you think i neednt hire another journeyman no if you both work harder i must increase your wages and then i shall save money i shant object to that said ferguson smiling nor i said harry i was intending at any rate to raise harrys wages as i find he does nearly as much as a journeyman hereafter i will give you five dollars a week besides your board oh thank you sir said harry overjoyed at his good fortune as for you ferguson if you will give me an hour more daily i will add three dollars a week to your pay thank you sir i think i can afford now to give mrs ferguson the new bonnet she was asking for this morning i dont want to overwork you two but if that arrangement proves satisfactory we will continue it i suppose you will be buying your wife a new bonnet too eh harry said ferguson i may buy myself a new hat luke harrison turned up his nose at my old one the other day what will luke do without clapp they were always together perhaps he is going too i dont know where he will raise the money nor clapp either for that matter perhaps their new friend furnishes the money if he does he is indeed a friend well it has turned out to our advantage at any rate harry suppose you celebrate it by coming round and taking supper with me with the greatest pleasure harry was indeed made happy by his promotion having been employed for some months on boardwages he had been compelled to trench upon the small stock of money which he had saved up when in the employ of prof henderson and he had been unable to send any money to his father whose circumstances were straitened and who found it very hard to make both ends meet that evening he wrote a letter to his father in which he inclosed ten dollars remaining to him from his fund of savings at the same time informing him of his promotion a few days later he received the following reply my dear son your letter has given me great satisfaction for i conclude from your promotion that you have done your duty faithfully and won the approbation of your employer the wages you now earn will amply pay your expenses while you may reasonably hope that they will be still further increased as you become more skilful and experienced i am glad to hear that you are using your leisure hours to such good purpose and are trying daily to improve your education in this way you may hope in time to qualify yourself for the position of an editor which is an honorable and influential profession to which i should be proud to have you belong the money which you so considerately inclose comes at the right time your brother needs some new clothes and this will enable me to provide them we all send love and hope to hear from you often your affectionate father hiram walton harrys promotion took place just before the beginning of september during the next week the fall term of the prescott academy commenced and the village streets again became lively with returning students harry was busy at the case when oscar vincent entered the printing office and greeted him warmly how are you oscar said harry his face lighting up with pleasure i am glad to see you back i would shake hands but i am afraid you wouldnt like it and harry displayed his hands soiled with printers ink well well shake hands in spirit then harry how have you passed the time i have been very busy oscar and i have been very lazy i have scarcely opened a book that is a studybook during the vacation how much have you done in french i have nearly finished telemachus you have then you have done splendidly by the way harry i received the paper you sent containing your essay it does you credit my boy mr anderson who was sitting at his desk caught the last words what is that harry he asked have you been writing for the papers harry blushed yes sir he replied i have written two or three articles for the boston weekly standard indeed i should like to see them you republished one of them in the gazette mr anderson said ferguson what do you refer to dont you remember an article on ambition which you inserted some weeks ago yes it was a good article did you write it walton yes air why didnt you tell me of it he was too bashful said ferguson i am glad to know that you can write said the editor i shall call upon you for assistance in getting up paragraphs occasionally i shall be very glad to do what i can said harry gratified harry is learning to be an editor said ferguson i will give him a chance for practice then and mr anderson returned to his exchanges by the way oscar said harry i am not a printers devil any longer i am promoted to be a journeyman i congratulate you harry but what will fitz do now he used to take so much pleasure in speaking of you as a printers devil i am sorry to deprive him of that pleasure did you see much of him in vacation oscar i used to meet him almost every day walking down washington street swinging a light cane and wearing a stunning necktie as usual is he coming back this term yes he came on the same train with me hasnt he called to pay his respects to you no answered harry with a smile he hasnt done me that honor he probably expects me to make the first call well harry i suppose you will be on hand next week when the clionian holds its first meeting yes i will be there and dont forget to call at my room before that time i want to examine you in french and see how much progress you have made thank you oscar now i must be going i have got a tough greek lesson to prepare for tomorrow i suppose it will take me twice as long as usual it is always hard to get to work again after a long vacation so goodmorning and dont forget to call at my room soon say tomorrow evening i will come what a gentlemanly fellow your friend is said ferguson what is his name harry asked mr anderson oscar vincent his father is an editor in boston what the son of john vincent said mr anderson surprised yes sir do you know his father only by reputation he is a man of great ability oscar is a smart fellow too but not a hard student i shall be glad to have you bring him round to the house some evening harry i shall be glad to become better acquainted with him thank you sir i will give him the invitation it is very possible that harry rose in the estimation of his employer from his intimacy with the son of a man who stood so high in his own profession at all events harry found himself from this time treated with greater respect and consideration than before and mr anderson often called upon him to write paragraphs upon local matters so that his position might be regarded except as to pay as that of an assistant editor chapter xxii miss deborahs eyes are opened aunt deborah felt that she had done a good stroke of business she had lent ferdinand four hundred and fifty dollars and received in return a note for five hundred and fifty secured by a diamond ring worth even more she plumed herself on her shrewdness though at times she felt a little twinge at the idea of the exorbitant interest which she had exacted from so near a relative but he said the money was worth that to him she said to herself in extenuation and hes goin to get two thousand dollars a year i didnt want to lend the money id rather have had it in the savings bank but i did it to obleege him by such casuistry aunt deborah quieted her conscience and carefully put the ring away among her bonds and mortgages whod think a little ring like that should be worth so much she said to herself its clear waste of money but then ferdinand didnt buy it it was give to him and a very foolish gift it was too railly it makes me nervous to have it to take care of its so little it might get lost easy aunt deborah plumed herself upon her shrewdness it was not easy to get the advantage of her in a bargain and yet she had accepted the ring as security for a considerable loan without once questioning its genuineness she relied implicitly upon her nephews assurance of its genuineness just as she had relied upon his assertion of relationship but the time was soon coming when she was to be undeceived one day a neighbor stopped his horse in front of her house and jumping out of his wagon walked up to the door and knocked goodmorning mr simpson said the old lady answering the knock herself wont you come in thank you miss deborah i cant stop this morning i was at the postoffice just now when i saw there was a letter for you and thought id bring it along a letter for me said aunt deborah in some surprise for her correspondence was very limited whos it from it is postmarked new york said mr simpson i dont know no one in new york said the old lady fumbling in her pockets for her spectacles maybe its one of your old beaux said mr simpson humorously a joke which brought a grim smile to the face of the old spinster but i must be goin if its an offer of marriage dont forget to invite me to the wedding aunt deborah went into the house and seating herself in her accustomed place carefully opened the letter she turned over the page and glanced at the signature to her astonishment it was signed your affectionate nephew ferdinand b kensington ferdinand she exclaimed in surprise why i thought he was in californy by this time how could he write from new york i spose hell explain i hope he didnt lose the money i lent him the first sentence in the letter was destined to surprise miss deborah yet more dear aunt it commenced it is so many years since we have met that i am afraid you have forgotten me so many years repeated miss deborah in bewilderment what on earth can ferdinand mean why its only five weeks yesterday since he was here he must be crazy she resumed reading i have often had it in mind to make you a little visit but i have been so engrossed by business that i have been unable to get away i am a salesman for a t stewart whom you must have heard of as he is the largest retail dealer in the city i have been three years in his employ and have been promoted by degrees till i now receive quite a good salary until and that is the news i have to write you i have felt justifed in getting married my wedding is fixed for next week thursday i should be very glad if you could attend though i suppose you would consider it a long journey but at any rate i can assure you that i should be delighted to see you present on the occasion and so would maria if you cant come write to me at any rate in memory of old times it is just possible that during our bridal tour we are to go to the white mountains for a week we shall call on you let me know if it will be convenient for you to receive us for a day your affectionate nephew ferdinand b kensington miss deborah read this letter like one dazed she had to read it a second time before she could comprehend its purport ferdinand going to be married he never said a word about it when he was here and he dont say a word about californy then again he says he hasnt seen me for years merciful man i see it now the other fellow was an impostor exclaimed miss deborah jumping to her feet in excitement what did he want to deceive an old woman for it flashed upon her at once he came after money and he had succeeded only too well he had carried away four hundred and fifty dollars with him true he had left a note and security but another terrible suspicion had entered the old ladys mind the ring might not be genuine i must know at once exclaimed the disturbed spinster ill go over to brandon to the jewellers and inquire if its paste then deborah kensington youre the biggest fool in centreville miss deborah summoned abner her farm servant from the field and ordered him instantly to harness the horse as she wanted to go to brandon do you want me to go with you asked abner to be sure i cant drive so fur and take care of the horse itll interrupt the work objected abner never mind about the work said deborah impatiently i must go right off its on very important business wouldnt it be best to go after dinner no well get some dinner over there at the tavern whats got into the old woman thought abner it isnt like her to spend money at a tavern for dinner when she might as well dine at home interruptin the work too however its her business deborah was ready and waiting when the horse drove up the door she got in and they set out abner tried to open a conversation but he found miss deborah strangely unsocial she appeared to take no interest in the details of farm work of which he spoke somethings on her mind i guess thought abner and as we know he was right in her hand deborah clutched the ring of whose genuineness she had come to entertain such painful doubts it might be genuine she tried to hope even if it came from an impostor but her hope was small she felt a presentiment that it would prove as false as the man from whom she received it as for the story of the manner in which he became possessed of it doubtless that was as false as the rest how blind i was groaned deborah in secret i saw he didnt look like the family what a goose i was to believe that story about his changin the color of his hair i was an old fool and thats all about it drive to the jewellers said miss deborah when they reached brandon in some surprise abner complied deborah got out of the wagon hastily and entered the store what can i do for you miss kensington asked the jeweller who recognized the old lady i want to show you a ring said aunt deborah abruptly tell me what its worth she produced the ring which the false ferdinand had intrusted to her the jeweller scanned it closely its a good imitation of a diamond ring he said imitation gasped deborah yes you didnt think it was genuine whats it worth the value of the gold that appears to be genuine it may be worth three dollars three dollars ejaculated deborah he told me it cost six hundred and fifty whoever told you that was trying to deceive you youre sure about its being imitation are you there can be no doubt about it thats what i thought muttered the old lady her face pale and rigid is there anything to pay oh no i am glad to be of service to you goodafternoon then said deborah abruptly and she left the store drive home abner as quick as you can she said i havent had any dinner abner remarked you said youd get some at the tavern did i well drive over there im not hungry myself but ill pay for some dinner for you poor aunt deborah it was not the loss alone that troubled her though she was fond of money but it was humiliating to think that she had fallen such an easy prey to a designing adventurer in her present bitter mood she would gladly have ridden fifty miles to see the false ferdinand hanged chapter xxiii the plot against fletcher the intimacy between harry and oscar vincent continued and as during the former term the latter volunteered to continue giving french lessons to our hero these were now partly of a conversational character and as harry was thoroughly in earnest it was not long before he was able to speak quite creditably about the first of november fitzgerald fletcher left the prescott academy and returned to his home in boston it was not because he had finished his education but because he felt that he was not appreciated by his fellowstudents he had been ambitious to be elected to an official position in the clionian society but his aspirations were not gratified he might have accepted this disappointment and borne it as well as he could had it not been aggravated by the elevation of harry walton to the presidency to be only a common member while a boy so far his social inferior was president was more than fitzgerald could stand he was so incensed that upon the announcement of the vote he immediately rose to a point of order mr president he said warmly i must protest against this election walton is not a member of the prescott academy and it is unconstitutional to elect him president will the gentleman point out the constitutional clause which has been violated by waltons election said oscar vincent mr president said fletcher this society was founded by students of the prescott academy and the offices should be confined to the members of the school harry walton rose and said mr president my election has been a great surprise to myself i had no idea that any one had thought of me for the position i feel highly complimented by your kindness and deeply grateful for it but there is something in what mr fletcher says you have kindly allowed me to share in the benefits of the society and that satisfies me i think it will be well for you to make another choice as president i will put it to vote said the presiding officer those who are ready to accept mr waltons resignation will signify it in the usual way fletcher raised his hand but he was alone those who are opposed said the president every other hand except harrys was now raised mr walton your resignation is not accepted said the presiding officer i call upon you to assume the duties of your new position harry rose and modestly advanced to the chair i have already thanked you gentlemen he said for the honor you have conferred upon me in selecting me as your presiding officer i have only to add that i will discharge its duties to the best of my ability all applauded except fletcher he sat with an unpleasant scowl upon his face and waited for the result of the balloting for vicepresident and secretary had he been elected to either position the clionian would probably have retained his illustrious name upon its roll but as these honors were conferred upon other members he formed the heroic resolution no longer to remain a member mr president he said when the last vote was announced i desire to terminate my connection with this society i hope mr fletcher will reconsider his determination said harry from the chair i would like to inquire the gentlemans reasons said tom carver i dont like the way in which the society is managed said fletcher i predict that it will soon disband i dont see any signs of it said oscar if the gentleman is really sincere he should not desert the clionian in the hour of danger i insist upon my resignation said fletcher i move that it be accepted said tom carver second the motion said the boy who sat next him the resignation was unanimously accepted fletcher ought to have felt gratified at the prompt granting of his request but he was not he had intended to strike dismay into the society by his proposal to withdraw but there was no consternation visible apparently they were willing to let him go he rose from his seat mortified and wrathful gentlemen he said you have complied with my request and i am deeply grateful i no longer consider it an honor to belong to the clionian i trust your new president may succeed as well in his new office as he has in the capacity of a printers devil fletcher was unable to proceed being interrupted by a storm of hisses in the midst of which he hurriedly made his exit he wanted to be president himself thats whats the matter said tom carver in a whisper to his neighbor but he couldnt blame us for not wanting to have him other members of the society came to the same conclusion and it was generally said that fletcher had done himself no good by his undignified resentment his parting taunt levelled at harry was regarded as mean and ungenerous and only strengthened the sentiment in favor of our hero who bore his honors modestly in fact tom carver who was fond of fun conceived a project for mortifying fletcher and readily obtained the cooperation of his classmates it must be premised that fitz was vain of his reading and declamation he had a secret suspicion that if he should choose to devote his talents to the stage he would make a second booth this selfconceit of his made it the more easy to play off the following joke upon him a fortnight later the young ladies of the village proposed to hold a fair to raise funds for some public object at the head of the committee of arrangements was a sister of the doctors wife named pauline clinton this will explain the following letter which fletcher received the succeeding day fitzgerald fletcher esq dear sir understanding that you are a superior reader we should be glad of your assistance in lending eclat to the fair which we propose to hold on the evening of the th will you be kind enough to occupy twenty minutes by reading such selections as in your opinion will be of popular interest it is desirable that you should let me know as soon as possible what pieces you have selected that they may be printed on the programme yours respectfully pauline clinton for the committee this note reached fletcher at a time when he was still smarting from his disappointment in obtaining promotion from the clionian society he read it with a flushed and triumphant face he never thought of questioning its genuineness was it not true that he was a superior reader what more natural than that he should be invited to give eclat to the fair by the exercise of his talents he felt it to be a deserved compliment it was a greater honor to be solicited to give a public reading than to be elected president of the clionian society they wont laugh at me now thought fletcher he immediately started for oscars room to make known his new honors how are you fitz said oscar who was in the secret and guessed the errand on which he came very well thank you oscar answered fletcher in a stately manner anything new with you asked oscar carelessly not much said fletcher theres a note i just received whew exclaimed oscar in affected astonishment are you going to accept i suppose i ought to oblige them said fletcher it wont be much trouble to me you know to be sure its in a good cause but how did they hear of your reading oh there are no secrets in a small village like this said fletcher its certainly a great compliment has anybody else been invited to read i think not said fletcher proudly they rely upon me couldnt you get a chance for me it would be quite an honor and i should like it for the sake of the family i shouldnt feel at liberty to interfere with their arrangements said fletcher who didnt wish to share the glory with any one besides you dont read well enough well i suppose i must give it up said oscar in a tone of resignation by the way what have you decided to read i havent quite made up my mind said fletcher in a tone of importance i have only just received the invitation you know havent you answered it yet no but i shall as soon as i go home goodnight oscar goodnight fitz how mad fitz will be when he finds he has been sold said oscar to himself but he deserves it for treating harry so meanly chapter xxiv reading under difficulties on reaching home fletcher looked over his speaker and selected three poems which he thought he could read with best effect the selection made he sat down to his desk and wrote a reply to the invitation as follows miss pauline clinton i hasten to acknowledge your polite invitation to occupy twenty minutes in reading choice selections at your approaching fair i have paid much attention to reading and hope to be able to give pleasure to the large numbers who will doubtless honor the occasion with their presence i have selected three poems poes raven the battle of ivry by macaulay and marco bozarris by halleck i shall be much pleased if my humble efforts add eclat to the occasion yours very respectfully fitzgerald fletcher there said fletcher reading his letter through with satisfaction i think that will do it is hightoned and dignified and shows that i am highly cultured and refined i will copy it off and mail it fletcher saw his letter deposited in the postoffice and returned to his room i ought to practise reading these poems so as to do it up handsomely he said i suppose i shall get a good notice in the gazette if i do i will buy a dozen papers and send to my friends they will see that i am a person of consequence in centreville even if i didnt get elected to any office in the high and mighty clionian society i am sorry that i cannot reproduce the withering sarcasm which fletcher put into his tone in the last sentence when demosthenes was practising oratory he sought the seashore but fitzgerald repaired instead to a piece of woods about half a mile distant it was rather an unfortunate selection as will appear it so happened that tom carver and hiram huntley were strolling about the woods when they espied fletcher approaching with an open book in his hand hiram said tom theres fun coming theres fitz fletcher with his speaker in his hand hes going to practise reading in the woods let us hide and hear the fun im in for it said hiram but where will be the best place to hide here in this hollow tree hell be very apt to halt here all right go ahead ill follow they quickly concealed themselves in the tree unobserved by fletcher whose eyes were on his book about ten feet from the tree he paused i guess thisll be a good place he said aloud theres no one to disturb me here now which shall i begin with i think ill try the raven but first it may be well to practise an appropriate little speech something like this fletcher made a low bow to the assembled trees cleared his throat and commenced ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to appear before you this evening in compliance with the request of the committee who have thought that my humble efforts would give eclat to the fair i am not a professional reader but i have ever found pleasure in reciting the noble productions of our best authors and i hope to give you pleasure thatll do i think said fletcher complacently now ill try the raven in a deep sepulchral tone fletcher read the first verse which is quoted below once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing more was it fancy or did fletcher really hear a slow measured tapping near him upon one of the trees as it seemed he started and looked nervously but the noise stopped and he decided that he had been deceived since no one was visible the boys within the tree made no other demonstration till fletcher had read the following verse back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore tis the wind and nothing more here an indescribable unearthly noise was heard from the interior of the tree like the wailing of some discontented ghost good heavens whats that ejaculated fletcher turning pale and looking nervously around him it was growing late and the branches above him partially stripped of their leaves rustled in the wind fletcher was somewhat nervous and the weird character of the poem probably increased this feeling and made him very uncomfortable he summoned up courage enough however to go on though his voice shook a little he was permitted to go on without interruption to the end those who are familiar with the poem know that it becomes more and more wild and weird as it draws to the conclusion this with his gloomy surroundings had its effect upon the mind of fletcher scarcely had he uttered the last words when a burst of wild and sepulchral laughter was heard within a few feet of him a cry of fear proceeded from fletcher and clutching his book he ran at wild speed from the enchanted spot not daring to look behind him indeed he never stopped running till he passed out of the shadow of the woods and was well on his way homeward tom carver and hiram crept out from their place of concealment they threw themselves on the ground and roared with laughter i never had such fun in my life said tom nor i i wonder what fitz thought that the wood was enchanted probably he left in a hurry yes he stood not on the order of his going but went at once i wish i could have seen him we must have made a fearful noise i was almost frightened myself he must be almost home by this time when do you think hell find out about the trick about the invitation not till he gets a letter from miss clinton telling him it is all a mistake he will be terribly mortified meanwhile fletcher reached home tired and out of breath his temporary fear was over but he was quite at sea as to the cause of the noises he had heard he could not suspect any of his schoolfellows for no one was visible nor had he any idea that any were in the wood at the time i wonder if it was an animal he reflected it was a fearful noise i must find some other place to practise reading in i wouldnt go to that wood again for fifty dollars but fletchers readings were not destined to be long continued when he got home from school the next day he found the following note which had been left for him during the forenoon mr fitzgerald fletcher dear sir i beg to thank you for your kind proposal to read at our fair but i think there must be some mistake in the matter as we have never contemplated having any readings nor have i written to you on the subject as you intimate i fear that we shall not have time to spare for such a feature though under other circumstances it might be attractive in behalf of the committee i beg to tender thanks for your kind proposal yours respectfully pauline clinton fletcher read this letter with feelings which can better be imagined than described he had already written home in the most boastful manner about the invitation he had received and he knew that before he could contradict it it would have been generally reported by his gratified parents to his city friends and now he would be compelled to explain that he had been duped besides enduring the jeers of those who had planned the trick this was more than he could endure he formed a sudden resolution he would feign illness and go home the next day he could let it be inferred that it was sickness alone which had compelled him to give up the idea of appearing as a public reader fitz immediately acted upon his decision and the next day found him on the way to boston he never returned to the prescott academy as a student chapter xxv an invitation to boston harry was doubly glad that he was now in receipt of a moderate salary he welcomed it as an evidence that he was rising in the estimation of his employer which was of itself satisfactory and also because in his circumstances the money was likely to be useful five dollars a week said harry to himself half of that ought to be enough to pay for my clothes and miscellaneous expenses and the rest i will give to father it will help him take care of the rest of the family our hero at once made this proposal by letter this is a paragraph from his fathers letter in reply i am glad my dear son to find you so considerate and dutiful as your offer indicates i have indeed had a hard time in supporting my family and have not always been able to give them the comforts i desired perhaps it is my own fault in part i am afraid i have not the faculty of getting along and making money that many others have but i have had an unexpected stroke of good fortune last evening a letter reached your mother stating that her cousin nancy had recently died at st albans vermont and that in accordance with her will your mother is to receive a legacy of four thousand dollars with your mothers consent onefourth of this is to be devoted to the purchase of the ten acres adjoining my little farm and the balance will be so invested as to yield us an annual income of one hundred and eighty dollars many would think this a small addition to an income but it will enable us to live much more comfortably you remember the tenacre lot to the east of us belonging to the heirs of reuben todd it is excellent land well adapted for cultivation and will fully double the value of my farm you see therefore my dear son that a new era of prosperity has opened for us i am now relieved from the care and anxiety which for years have oppressed me and feel sure of a comfortable support instead of accepting the half of your salary i desire you if possible to save it depositing in some reliable savings institution if you do this every year till you are twentyone you will have a little capital to start you in business and will be able to lead a more prosperous career than your father knowing you as well as i do i do not feel it necessary to caution you against unnecessary expenditures i will only remind you that extravagance is comparative and that what would be only reasonable expenditure for one richer than yourself would be imprudent in you harry read this letter with great joy he was warmly attached to the little home circle and the thought that they were comparatively provided for gave him fresh courage he decided to adopt his fathers suggestion and the very next week deposited three dollars in the savings bank that is to begin an account he thought if i can only keep that up i shall feel quite rich at the end of a year several weeks rolled by and thanksgiving approached harry was toiling at his case one day when oscar vincent entered the office hard at work i see harry he said yes said harry i cant afford to be idle i want you to be idle for three days said oscar harry looked up in surprise how is that he asked you know we have a vacation from wednesday to monday at the academy over thanksgiving yes well i am going home to spend that time and i want you to go with me what to boston asked harry startled for to him inexperienced as he was that seemed a very long journey yes father and mother gave me permission to invite you shall i show you the letter ill take it for granted oscar but i am afraid i cant go nonsense whats to prevent in the first place mr anderson cant spare me ask him whats that asked the editor hearing his name mentioned i have invited harry to spend the thanksgiving vacation with me in boston and he is afraid you cant spare him does your father sanction your invitation yes he wrote me this morning that is i got the letter this morning telling me to ask harry to come now the country editor had a great respect for the city editor who was indeed known by reputation throughout new england as a man of influence and ability and he felt disposed to accede to any request of his so he said pleasantly of course harry we shall miss you but if mr ferguson is disposed to do a little additional work we will get along till monday what do you say mr ferguson i shall be very glad to oblige harry said the older workman and i hope he will have a good time that settles the question harry said oscar joyfully so all youve got to do is to pack up and be ready to start tomorrow morning its tuesday you know already harry hesitated and oscar observed it well whats the matter now he said out with it ill tell you oscar said harry coloring a little your father is a rich man and lives handsomely i havent any clothes good enough to wear on a visit to your house oh hang your clothes said oscar impetuously it isnt your clothes we invite its yourself still oscar come i see you think i am like fitz fletcher after all say you think me a snob and done with it but i dont said harry smiling then dont make any more ridiculous objections dont you think they are ridiculous mr ferguson they wouldnt be in some places said ferguson but here i think they are out of place i feel sure you are right and that you value harry more than the clothes he wears well harry do you surrender at discretion said oscar you see ferguson is on my side i suppose i shall have to said harry as long as you are not ashamed of me none of that harry ill go the first sensible words youve spoken this morning i want to tell you how much i appreciate your kindness oscar said harry earnestly why shouldnt i be kind to my friend even if he was once a printers devil very true it is a great objection but still i will overlook it by the way there is one inducement i didnt mention what is that we may very likely see fitz in the city he is studying at home now i hear who knows but he may get up a great party in your honor do you think it likely asked harry smiling it might not happen to occur to him i admit still if we made him a ceremonious call i am afraid he might send word that he was not at home that would be a loss to him no doubt however we will leave time to settle that question be sure to be on hand in time for the morning train all right oscar harry had all the love of new scenes natural to a boy of sixteen he had heard so much of boston that he felt a strong curiosity to see it besides was not that the city where the weekly standard was printed the paper in which he had already appeared as an author in connection with this i must here divulge a secret of harrys he was ambitious not only to contribute to the literary papers but to be paid for his contributions he judged that essays were not very marketable and he had therefore in his leisure moments written a humorous sketch entitled the tin pedlers daughter i shall not give any idea of the plot here i will only say that it was really humorous and did not betray as much of the novice as might have been expected harry had copied it out in his best hand and resolved to carry it to boston and offer it in person to the editor of the standard with an effort if accepted to obtain compensation for it chapter xxvi the vincents at home when harry rather bashfully imparted to oscar his plans respecting the manuscript the latter entered enthusiastically into them and at once requested the privilege of reading the story harry awaited his judgment with some anxiety why harry this is capital said oscar looking up from the perusal do you really think so oscar if i didnt think so i wouldnt say so i thought you might say so out of friendship i dont say it is the best i ever read mind you but i have read a good many that are worse i think you managed the denouement youre a french scholar so ill venture on the word admirably i only hope the editor of the standard will think so if he doesnt there are other papers in boston the argus for instance ill try the standard first because i have already written for it all right dont you want me to go to the office with you i wish you would i shall be bashful i am not troubled that way besides my fathers name is well known and ill take care to mention it sometimes influence goes farther than merit you know i should like to increase my income by writing for the city papers even if i only made fifty dollars a year it would all be clear gain harrys desire was natural he had no idea how many shared it every editor of a successful weekly could give information on this subject certainly there is no dearth of aspiring young writers scotts and shakspeares in embryo in our country and if all that were written for publication succeeded in getting into print the world would scarcely contain the books and papers which would pour in uncounted thousands from the groaning press when the two boys arrived in boston they took a carriage to oscars house it was situated on beacon street not far from the common a handsome brick house with a swell front such as they used to build in boston no one of the family was in and oscar and harry went up at once to the room of the former which they were to share together it was luxuriously furnished so harry thought but then our hero had been always accustomed to the plainness of a country home now old fellow make yourself at home said oscar you can get yourself up for dinner theres water and towels and a brush i dont expect to look very magnificent said harry you must tell your mother i am from the country i would make you an offer if i dared said oscar i am always open to a good offer its this im one size larger than you and my last years suits are in that wardrobe if any will fit you they are yours thank you oscar said harry ill accept your offer tomorrow why not today you may not understand me but when i first appear before your family i dont want to wear false colors i understand said oscar with instinctive delicacy an hour later the bell rang for dinner harry went down and was introduced to his friends mother and sister the former was a true lady refined and kindly and her smile made our hero feel quite at home i am glad to meet you mr walton she said oscar has spoken of you frequently with oscars sister maud a beautiful girl two years younger than himself harry felt a little more bashful but the young lady soon entered into an animated conversation with him do you often come to boston mr walton she asked this is my first visit said harry then i dare say oscar will play all sorts of tricks upon you we had a cousin visit us from the country and the poor fellow had a hard time yes said oscar laughing i used to leave him at a street corner and dodge into a doorway it was amusing to see his perplexity when he looked about and couldnt find me shall you try that on me asked harry very likely then ill be prepared you might tie him with a rope mr walton said maud and keep firm hold i will if oscar consents i will see about it but here is my father father this is my friend harry walton i am glad to see you mr walton said mr vincent then you belong to my profession i hope to some time sir but i am only a printer as yet you are yet to rise from the ranks i know all about that i was once a compositor harry looked at the editor with great respect he was stout squarely built with a massive head and a thoughtful expression his appearance was up to harrys anticipations he felt that he would be prouder to be mr vincent than any man in boston he could hardly believe that this man who controlled so influential an organ and was so honored in the community was once a printer boy like himself what paper are you connected with asked mr vincent the centreville gazette i have seen it it is quite a respectable paper but how different thought harry from a great city daily let us go out to dinner said mr vincent consulting his watch i have an engagement immediately afterward at table harry sat between maud and oscar if at first he felt a little bashful the feeling soon wore away the dinner hour passed very pleasantly mr vincent chatted very agreeably about men and things there is no one better qualified to shine in this kind of conversation than the editor of a city daily who is compelled to be exceptionally well informed harry listened with such interest that he almost forgot to eat till oscar charged him with want of appetite i must leave in haste said mr vincent when dinner was over oscar i take it for granted that you will take care of your friend certainly father i shall look upon myself as his guardian adviser and friend you are not very well fitted to be a mentor oscar said maud why not young lady you need a guardian yourself you are young and frivolous and you i suppose are old and judicious thank you i will own to the last and the first will come in time isnt it singular harry that my sister should have so much conceit whereas i am remarkably modest i never discovered it oscar said harry smiling that is right mr walton said maud i see you are on my side look after my brother mr walton he needs an experienced friend i am afraid i dont answer the description miss maud i dont doubt you will prove competent i wish you a pleasant walk my sisters a jolly girl dont you think so asked oscar as maud left the room that isnt exactly what i should say of her but i can describe her as even more attractive than her brother you couldnt pay her a higher compliment but come well take a walk on the common they were soon on the common dear to every bostonian and sauntered along the walks under the pleasant shade of the stately elms look there said oscar suddenly isnt that fitz fletcher yes said harry but he doesnt see us well join him how are you fitz glad to see you oscar said fletcher extending a gloved band while in the other he tossed a light cane when did you arrive only this morning but you dont see harry walton fletcher arched his brows in surprise and said coldly indeed i was not aware mr walton was in the city he is visiting me said oscar fletcher looked surprised he knew the vincents stood high socially and it seemed extraordinary that they should receive a printers devil as a guest have you given up the printing business he asked superciliously no i only have a little vacation from it ah indeed its a very dirty business i would as soon be a chimneysweep each to his taste fitz said oscar if you have a taste for chimneys i hope your father wont interfere i havent a taste for such a low business said fletcher haughtily i should like it as well as being a printers devil though would you at any rate if you take it up youll be sure to be well sooted fletcher did not laugh at the joke he never could see any wit in jokes directed at himself how long are you going to stay at that beastly school he asked i am not staying at any beastly school i mean the academy till i am ready for college where are you studying i recite to a private tutor well we shall meet at harvard if we are lucky enough to get in fletcher rather hoped oscar would invite him to call at his house for he liked to visit a family of high social position but he waited in vain what a fool oscar makes of himself about that country clodhopper thought the stylish young man as he walked away the idea of associating with a printers devil i hope i know what is due to myself better chapter xxvii the office of the standard on the day after thanksgiving harry brought out from his carpetbag his manuscript story and started with oscar for the office of the weekly standard he bought the last copy of the paper and thus ascertained the location of the office oscar turned the last page and ran through a sketch of about the same length as harrys yours is fully as good as this harry he said the editor may not think so then he ought to this story is by one of his regular contributors kenella kent youll have to take a name yourself a nom de plume i mean i have written so far over the name of franklin that will do very well for essays but is not appropriate for stories suppose you suggest a name oscar how will fitz fletcher do mr fletcher would not permit me to take such a liberty and you wouldnt want to take it not much let me see i suppose i must task my invention then how will old nick do people would think you wrote the story a fair hit hold on ive got just the name frank lynn i thought you objected to that name you dont understand me i mean two names not one frank lynn dont you see yes its a good plan ill adopt it who knows but you may make the name illustrious harry if i do ill dedicate my first boot to oscar vincent shake hands on that i accept the dedication with mingled feelings of gratitude and pleasure better wait till you get it said harry laughing dont count your chickens before theyre hatched the first egg is laid and thats something but here we are at the office it was a building containing a large number of offices the names of the respective occupants were printed on slips of black tin at the entrance from this harry found that the office of the weekly standard was located at no my heart begins to beat oscar said harry naturally excited in anticipation of an interview with one who could open the gates of authorship to him does it asked oscar mine has been beating for a number of years you are too matteroffact for me oscar if it was your own story you might feel differently shall i pass it off as my own and make the negotiation harry was half tempted to say yes but it occurred to him that this might prove an embarrassment in the future and he declined the proposal they climbed rather a dark and not very elegant staircase and found themselves before no harry knocked or was about to do so when a young lady with long ringlets and a roll of manuscript in her hand who had followed them upstairs advanced confidently and opening the door went in the two boys followed thinking the ceremony of knocking needless they found themselves in a large room one corner of which was partitioned off for the editors sanctum a middleaged man was directing papers in the larger room while piles of papers were ranged on shelves at the sides of the apartment the two boys hesitated to advance but the young lady in ringlets went on and entered the office through the open door well wait till she is through said harry it was easy to hear the conversation that passed between the young lady and the editor whom they could not see goodmorning mr houghton she said goodmorning take a seat please said the editor pleasantly are you one of our contributors no sir not yet answered the young lady but i would become so we are not engaging any new contributors at present but still if you have brought anything for examination you may leave it i am not wholly unknown to fame said the young lady with an air of consequence you have probably heard of prunella prune possibly but i dont at present recall it we editors meet with so many names you know what is the character of your articles i am a poetess sir and i also write stories poetry is a drug in the market we have twice as much offered us as we can accept still we are always glad to welcome really meritorious poems i trust my humble efforts will please you said prunella i have here some lines to a nightingale which have been very much praised in our village shall i read them if you wish said the editor by no means cheerfully miss prune raised her voice and commenced o stareyed nightingale how nobly thou dost sail through the air no other bird can compare with the tuneful song which to thee doth belong i sit and hear thee sing while with tireless wing thou dost fly and it makes me feel so sad it makes me feel so bad i know not why and i heave so many sighs o warbler of the skies is there much more asked the editor that is the first verse there are fifteen more said prunella then i think i shall not have time at present to hear you read it all you may leave it and i will look it over at my leisure if it suits you said prunella how much will it be worth i dont understand how much would you be willing to pay for it oh we never pay for poems said mr houghton why not asked miss prune evidently disappointed our contributors are kind enough to send them gratuitously is that fostering american talent demanded prunella indignantly american poetical talent doesnt require fostering judging from the loads of poems which are sent in to us you pay for stories i presume yes we pay for good popular stories i have one here said prunella untying her manuscript which i should like to read to you you may read the first paragraph if you please i havent time to hear more what is the title the bandits bride this is the way it opens the night was tempestuous lightnings flashed in the cerulean sky and the deepvoiced thunder rolled from one end of the firmament to the other it was a landscape in spain from a rocky defile gayly pranced forth a masked cavalier roderigo di lima a famous bandit chief ha ha he laughed in demoniac glee the night is well fitted to my purpose ere it passes isabella gomez shall be mine i think that will do said mr houghton hastily i am afraid that style wont suit our readers why not demanded prunella sharply i can assure you sir that it has been praised by excellent judges in our village it is too exciting for our readers you had better carry it to the weekly corsair do they pay well for contributions i really cant say how much do you expect this story will make about five columns i think twentyfive dollars will be about right i am afraid you will be disappointed we cant afford to pay such prices and the corsair has a smaller circulation than our paper how much do you pay two dollars a column i expected more said prunella but i will write for you at that price send us something suited to our paper and we will pay for it at that price i will write you a story tomorrow goodmorning sir goodmorning miss prune the young lady with ringlets sailed out of the editors room and oscar nudging harry said now it is our turn come along follow me and dont be frightened chapter xxviii accepted the editor of the standard looked with some surprise at the two boys as editor he was not accustomed to receive such young visitors he was courteous however and said pleasantly what can i do for you young gentlemen are you the editor of the standard asked harry diffidently i am do you wish to subscribe i have already written something for your paper harry continued indeed said the editor was it poetry or prose harry felt flattered by the question to be mistaken for a poet he felt to be very complimentary if he had known how much trash weekly found its way to the standard office under the guise of poetry he would have felt less flattered i have written some essays over the name of franklin he hastened to say ah yes i remember and very sensible essays too you are young to write yes sir i hope to improve as i grow older by this time oscar felt impelled to speak for his friend it seemed to him that harry was too modest my friend is assistant editor of a new hampshire paper the centreville gazette he announced indeed said the editor looking surprised he is certainly young for an editor my friend is not quite right said harry hastily i am one of the compositors on that paper but you write editorial paragraphs said oscar yes unimportant ones and are you too an editor asked the editor of the standard addressing oscar with a smile not exactly said oscar but i am an editors son perhaps you are acquainted with my father john vincent of this city are you his son said the editor respectfully i know your father slightly he is one of our ablest journalists thank you sir i am very glad to receive a visit from you and should be glad to print anything from your pen i am not sure about that said oscar smiling if i have a talent for writing it hasnt developed itself yet but my friend here takes to it as naturally as a duck takes to water have you brought me another essay mr franklin asked the editor turning to harry i address you by your nom de plume not knowing your real name permit me to introduce my friend harry walton said oscar harry where is your story i have brought you in a story said harry blushing it is my first attempt and may not suit you but i shall be glad if you will take the trouble to examine it with pleasure said the editor is it long about two columns it is of a humorous character the editor reached out his hand and taking the manuscript unrolled it he read the first few lines and they seemed to strike his attention if you will amuse yourselves for a few minutes i will read it at once he said i dont often do it but i will break over my custom this time thank you sir said harry there are some of my exchanges said the editor pointing to a pile on the floor you may find something to interest you in some of them they picked up some papers and began to read but harry could not help thinking of the verdict that was to be pronounced on his manuscript upon that a great deal hinged if he could feel that he was able to produce anything that would command compensation however small it would make him proud and happy he tried as he gazed furtively over his paper at the editors face to anticipate his decision but the latter was too much accustomed to reading manuscript to show the impression made upon him fifteen minutes passed and he looked up well mr walton he said your first attempt is a success harrys face brightened may i ask if the plot is original it is so far as i know sir i dont think i ever read anything like it of course there are some faults in the construction and the dialogue might be amended here and there but it is very creditable and i will use it in the standard if you desire it i do sir and how much are you willing to pay for it oscar struck in the editor hesitated it is not our custom to pay novices just at first he said if mr walton keeps on writing he would soon command compensation harry would not have dared to press the matter but oscar was not so diffident indeed it is easier to be bold in a friends cause than ones own dont you think it is worth being paid for if it is worth printing he persisted upon that principle we should feel obliged to pay for poetry said the editor oh said oscar poets dont need money they live on flowers and dewdrops the editor smiled you think prosewriters require something more substantial yes sir i will tell you how the matter stands said the editor mr walton is a beginner he has his reputation to make when it is made he will be worth a fair price to me or any of my brother editors i see said oscar but his story must be worth something it will fill up two columns if you didnt print it you would have to pay somebody for writing these two columns you have some reason in what you say still our ordinary rule is based on justice a distinction should be made between new contributors and old favorites yes sir pay the first smaller sums if the speaker had not been john vincents son it would have been doubtful if his reasoning would have prevailed as it was the editor yielded i may break over my rule in the case of your friend said the editor but he must be satisfied with a very small sum for the present anything will satisfy me sir said harry eagerly your story will fill two columns i commonly pay two dollars a column for such articles if by practised writers i will give you half that thank you sir i accept it said harry promptly in a year or so i may see my way clear to paying you more mr walton but you must consider that i give you the opportunity of winning popularity and regard this as part of your compensation at present i am quite satisfied sir said harry his heart fluttering with joy and triumph may i write you some more sketches i shall be happy to receive and examine them but you must not be disappointed if from time to time i reject your manuscripts no sir i will take it as a hint that they need improving i will revise my friends stories sir said oscar humorously and give him such hints as my knowledge of the world may suggest no doubt such suggestions from so mature a friend will materially benefit them said the editor smiling he opened his pocketbook and drawing out a twodollar bill handed it to harry i shall hope to pay you often he said for similar contributions thank you sir said harry feeling that their business was at an end the boys withdrew as they reached the foot of the stairs oscar took off his cap and bowed low mr lynn i congratulate you he said i cant tell you how glad i feel oscar said harry his face radiant let me suggest that you owe me a commission for impressing upon the editor the propriety of paying you how much do you ask an icecream will be satisfactory all right come round to copelands then well celebrate your success in a becoming manner chapter xxix mrs clintons party when oscar and harry reached home they were met by maud who flourished in her hand what appeared to be a note what is it maud asked oscar a loveletter for me dont flatter yourself oscar no girl would be so foolish as to write you a loveletter it is an invitation to a party on saturday evening where at mrs clintons i think i will decline said oscar i wouldnt like to leave harry alone oh he is included too mrs clinton heard of his being here and expressly included him in the invitation that alters the case youll go harry wont you i am afraid i shouldnt know how to behave at a fashionable party said harry oh youve only got to make me your model said oscar and youll be all right did you ever see such conceit mr walton said maud it reminds me of fletcher said harry fitz fletcher by the way he will probably be there his family are acquainted with the clintons yes he is invited said maud good then theres promise of fun said oscar youll see fitz with his best company manners on i am afraid he wont enjoy meeting me there said harry probably not i dont see why said maud shall i tell harry certainly to begin with fletcher regards himself as infinitely superior to walton here because his father is rich and waltons poor again harry is a printer and works for a living which fitz considers degrading besides all this harry was elected president of our debating society an office which fitz wanted i hope said maud that mr fletchers dislike does not affect your peace of mind mr walton not materially said harry laughing by the way maud said oscar did i ever tell you how fletchers pride was mortified at school by our discovering his relationship to a tinpedler no tell me about it the story already familiar to the reader was graphically told by oscar and served to amuse his sister he deserved the mortification she said i shall remember it if he shows any of his arrogance at the party fletcher rather admires maud said oscar after his sister had gone out of the room but the favor isnt reciprocated if he undertakes to say anything to her against you she will take him down depend upon it saturday evening came and harry with oscar and his sister started for the party our hero having confessed his inability to dance had been diligently instructed in the lancers by oscar so that he felt some confidence in being able to get through without any serious blunder of course you must dance harry he said you dont want to be a wallflower i may have to be said harry i shall know none of the young ladies except your sister maud will dance the first lancers with you and i will get you a partner for the second you may dispose of me as you like oscar wisely said dont forget that i am your mentor when they entered the brilliantly lighted parlors they were already half full oscar introduced his friend to mrs clinton i am glad to see you here mr walton said the hostess graciously oscar i depend upon you to introduce your friend to some of the young ladies you forget my diffidence mrs clinton i didnt know you were troubled in that way see how i am misjudged i am painfully bashful you hide it well said the hostess with a smile escort my sister to a seat harry said oscar by the way you two will dance in the first lancers if miss maud will accept so awkward a partner said harry oh yes mr walton ill give you a hint if you are going wrong five minutes later fletcher touched oscar on the shoulder oscar where is your sister he asked there said oscar pointing her out fletcher who was rather nearsighted did not at first notice that harry walton was sitting beside the young lady he advanced and made a magnificent bow on which he rather prided himself goodevening miss vincent he said goodevening mr fletcher i am very glad you have favored the party with your presence thank you mr fletcher dont turn my head with your compliments may i hope you will favor me with your hand in the first lancers i am sorry mr fletcher but i am engaged to mr walton i believe you are acquainted with him fletcher for the first time observed our hero and his face wore a look of mingled annoyance and scorn i have met the gentleman he said haughtily mr fletcher and i have met frequently said harry pleasantly i didnt expect to meet you here said fletcher with marked emphasis probably not said harry my invitation is due to my being a friend of oscars i was not aware that you danced said fletcher who was rather curious on the subject i dont much where did you learn in the printing office no in the city ah indeed fletcher thought he had wasted time enough on our hero and turned again to maud may i have the pleasure of your hand in the second dance he asked i will put you down for that if you desire it thank you it so happened that when harry and maud took the floor they found fletcher their visavis perhaps it was this that made harry more emulous to get through without making any blunders at any rate he succeeded and no one in the set suspected that it was his first appearance in public as a dancer fletcher was puzzled he had hoped that harry would make himself ridiculous and throw the set into confusion but the dance passed off smoothly and in due time fletcher led out maud if he had known his own interest he would have kept silent about harry but he had little discretion i was rather surprised to see walton here he began didnt you know he was in the city yes i met him with oscar then why were you surprised because his social position does not entitle him to appear in such a company when i first knew him he was only a printers apprentice fletcher wanted to say printers devil but did not venture to do so in presence of a young lady he will rise higher than that i dare say said fletcher with a sneer he will rise in time to be a journeyman with a salary of fifteen dollars a week if i am not mistaken in mr walton he will rise much higher than that many of our prominent men have sprung from beginnings like his it must be rather a trial to him to come here his father is a daylaborer i believe and of course he has never been accustomed to any refinement or polish i dont detect the absence of either said maud quietly do you believe in throwing down all social distinctions and meeting the sons of laborers on equal terms as to that said maud meeting her partners glance i am rather democratic i could even meet the son of a tinpedler on equal terms provided he were a gentleman the blood rushed to fletchers cheeks a tinpedler he ejaculated yes suppose you were the son or relation of a tinpedler why should i consider that it would make you neither better nor worse i have no connection with tinpedlers said fletcher hastily who told you i had i only made a supposition mr fletcher but fletcher thought otherwise he was sure that maud had heard of his mortification at school and it disturbed him not a little for in spite of her assurance he felt that she believed the story and it annoyed him so much that he did not venture to make any other reference to harry poor fitz said oscar when on their way home maud gave an account of their conversation i am afraid he will murder the tinpedler some time to get rid of such an odious relationship chapter xxx two letters from the west the vacation was over all too soon yet brief as it was harry looked back upon it with great satisfaction he had been kindly received in the family of a man who stood high in the profession which he was ambitious to enter he had gratified his curiosity to see the chief city of new england and by no means least he had secured a position as paid contributor for the standard i suppose you will be writing another story soon said oscar yes said harry i have got the plan of one already if you should write more than you can get into the standard you had better send something to the weekly argus i will but i will wait till the standard prints my first sketch so that i can refer to that in writing to the argus perhaps you are right theres one advantage to not presenting yourself they wont know youre only a boy unless they judge so from my style i dont think they would infer it from that by the way harry suppose my father could find an opening for you as a reporter on his paper would you be willing to accept it i am not sure whether it would be best for me said harry slowly even if i were qualified there is more chance to rise on a city paper i dont know if i stay here i may before many years control a paper of my own then if i want to go into politics there would be more chance in the country than in the city would you like to go into politics i am rather too young to decide about that but if i could be of service in that way i dont see why i should not desire it well harry i think you are going the right way to work i hope so i dont want to be promoted till i am fit for it i am going to work hard for the next two or three years i wish i were as industrious as you are harry and i wish i knew as much as you do oscar say no more or we shall be forming a mutual admiration society said oscar laughing harry received a cordial welcome back to the printing office mr anderson asked him many questions about mr vincent and our hero felt that his employer regarded him with increased consideration on account of his acquaintance with the great city editor this consideration was still farther increased when mr anderson learned our heros engagement by the weekly standard three weeks later the standard published harrys sketch and accepted another at the same price before this latter was printed harry wrote a third sketch which he called phineas popkins engagement this he inclosed to the weekly argus with a letter in which he referred to his engagement by the standard in reply he received the following letter boston jan mr frank lynn dear sir we enclose three dollars for your sketch phineas popkins engagement we shall be glad to receive other sketches of similar character and length and if accepted we will pay the same price therefor i b fitch co this was highly satisfactory to harry he was now an accepted contributor to two weekly papers and the addition to his income would be likely to reach a hundred dollars a year all this he would be able to lay up and as much or more from his salary on the gazette he felt on the high road to success seeing that his young compositor was meeting with success and appreciation abroad mr anderson called upon him more frequently to write paragraphs for the gazette though this work was gratuitous harry willingly undertook it he felt that in this way he was preparing himself for the career to which he steadily looked forward present compensation he justly reasoned was of small importance compared with the chance of improvement in this view ferguson who proved to be a very judicious friend fully concurred indeed harry and he became more intimate than before if that were possible and they felt that clapps departure was by no means to be regretted they were remarking this one day when mr anderson who had been examining his mail looked up suddenly and said what do you think mr ferguson ive got a letter from clapp a letter from clapp where is he inquired ferguson with interest this letter is dated at st louis he doesnt appear to be doing very well i thought he was going to california so he represented but here is the letter ferguson took it and after reading handed it to harry it ran thus st louis april jotham anderson esq dear sir perhaps you will be surprised to hear from me but i feel as if i would like to hear from centreville where i worked so long the man that induced me and harrison to come out here left us in the lurch three days after we reached st louis he said he was going on to san francisco and he had only money enough to pay his own expenses as luke and i were not provided with money we had a pretty hard time at first and had to pawn some of our clothes or we should have starved finally i got a job in the democrat office and a week after luke got something to do though it didnt pay very well so we scratched along as well as we could part of the time since we have been out of work and we havent found coming west all that it was cracked up to be are ferguson and harry walton still working for you i should like to come back to the gazette office and take my old place but i havent got five dollars ahead to pay my travelling expenses if you will send me out thirty dollars i will come right on and work it out after i come back hoping for an early reply i am yours respectfully henry clapp are you going to send out the money mr anderson asked ferguson not i now that walton has got well learnt i dont need another workman i shall respectfully decline his offer both harry and ferguson were glad to hear this for they felt that clapps presence would be far from making the office more agreeable heres a letter for you walton also postmarked st louis said mr anderson just afterward harry took it with surprise and opened it at once its from luke harrison he said looking at the signature does he want you to send him thirty dollars asked ferguson listen and i will read the letter dear harry it commenced you will perhaps think it strange that i have written to you but we used to be good friends i write to tell you that i dont like this place i havent got along well and i want to get back now i am going to ask of you a favor will you lend me thirty or forty dollars to pay my fare home i will pay you back in a month or two months sure after i get to work i will also pay you the few dollars which i borrowed some time ago i ought to have done it before but i was thoughtless and i kept putting it off now harry i know you have the money and you can lend it to me just as well as not and ill be sure to pay it back before you need it just get a postoffice order and send it to luke harrison r street st louis and ill be sure to get it give my respects to mr anderson and also to mr ferguson your friend luke harrison there is a chance for a firstclass investment harry said ferguson do you want to join me in it no i would rather pay the money to have your friend keep away i dont want to be unkind or disobliging said harry but i dont feel like giving luke this money i know he would never pay me back say no then i will luke will be mad but i cant help it so both mr anderson and harry wrote declining to lend the latter in return received a letter from luke denouncing him as a mean miserly hunks but even this did not cause him to regret his decision chapter xxxi one step upward in real life the incidents that call for notice do not occur daily months and years pass sometimes where the course of life is quiet and uneventful so it was with harry walton he went to his daily work with unfailing regularity devoted a large part of his leisure to reading and study or writing sketches for the boston papers and found himself growing steadily wiser and better informed his account in the savingsbank grew slowly but steadily and on his nineteenth birthday when we propose to look in upon him again he was worth five hundred dollars some of my readers who are favored by fortune may regard this as a small sum it is small in itself but it was not small for a youth in harrys position to have saved from his small earnings but of greater value than the sum itself was the habit of selfdenial and saving which our hero had formed he had started in the right way and made a beginning which was likely to lead to prosperity in the end it had not been altogether easy to save this sum harrys income had always been small and he might without incurring the charge of excessive extravagance have spent the whole he had denied himself on many occasions where most boys of his age would have yielded to the temptation of spending money for pleasure or personal gratification but he had been rewarded by the thought that he was getting on in the world this is my birthday mr ferguson he said as he entered the printingoffice on that particular morning is it asked ferguson looking up from his case with interest how venerable are you may i ask i dont feel very venerable as yet said harry with a smile i am nineteen you were sixteen when you entered the office as printers devil yes you have learned the business pretty thoroughly you are as good a workman as i now though i am fifteen years older you are too modest mr ferguson no it is quite true you are as rapid and accurate as i am and you ought to receive as high pay that will come in time you know i make something by writing for the papers thats extra work how much did you make in that way last year i can tell you because i figured it up last night it was one hundred and twentyfive dollars and i put every cent into the savingsbank that is quite an addition to your income i shall make more this year i am to receive two dollars a column hereafter for my sketches i congratulate you harry the more heartily because i think you deserve it your recent sketches show quite an improvement over those you wrote a year ago do you really think so said harry with evident pleasure i have no hesitation in saying so you write with greater ease than formerly and your style is less that of a novice so i have hoped and thought but of course i was prejudiced in my own favor you may rely upon it indeed your increased pay is proof of it did you ask it the increase no the editor of the standard wrote me voluntarily that he considered my contributions worth the additional amount that must be very pleasant i tell you what harry ive a great mind to set up opposition to you in the story line do so said harry smiling i would if i had the slightest particle of imagination but the fact is im too practical and matteroffact besides i never had any talent for writing of any kind some time i may become publisher of a village paper like this but farther than that i dont aspire we are to be partners in that you know ferguson that may be for a time but you will rise higher than that harry i am afraid you overrate me no i have observed you closely in the time we have been together and i have long felt that you are destined to rise from the ranks in which i am content to remain havent you ever felt so yourself harry harrys cheek flushed and his eye lighted up i wont deny that i have such thoughts sometimes he said but it may end in that it often does end in that but it is only where ambition is not accompanied by faithful work now you are always at work you are doing what you can to help fortune and the end will be that fortune will help you i hope so at any rate said harry thoughtfully i should like to fill an honorable position and do some work by which i might be known in after years why not the boys and young men of today are hereafter to fill the highest positions in the community and state why may not the lot fall to you i will try at any rate to qualify myself then if responsibilities come i will try to discharge them the conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of mr anderson the editor of the gazette he was not as well or strong as when we first made his acquaintance then he seemed robust enough but now he was thinner and moved with slower gait it was not easy to say what had undermined his strength for he had had no severe fit of sickness but certainly he was in appearance several years older than when harry entered the office how do you feel this morning mr anderson asked ferguson i feel weak and languid and indisposed to exertion of any kind you need some change that is precisely what i have thought myself the doctor advises change of scene and this very morning i had a letter from a brother in wisconsin asking me to come out and visit him i have no doubt it would do you good so it would but how can i go i cant take the paper with me said mr andersen rather despondently no but you can leave harry to edit it in your absence mr ferguson exclaimed harry startled by the proposition harry as editor repeated mr anderson yes why not he is a practised writer for more than two years he has written for two boston papers but he is so young how old are you harry asked the editor nineteen today sir nineteen thats very young for an editor very true but after all it isnt so much the age as the qualifications is it mr anderson true said the editor meditatively harry do you think you could edit the paper for two or three months i think i could said harry with modest confidence his heart beat high at the thought of the important position which was likely to be opened to him and plans of what he would do to make the paper interesting already began to be formed in his mind it never occurred to me before but i really think you could said the editor and that would remove every obstacle to my going by the way harry you would have to find a new boardingplace for mrs anderson would accompany me and we should shut up the house perhaps ferguson would take me in said harry i should be glad to do so but i dont know that my humble fare would be good enough for an editor harry smiled i wont put on airs he said till my commission is made out i am afraid that i cant offer high pay for your services in that capacity said mr anderson i shall charge nothing sir said harry but thank you for the opportunity of entering if only for a short time a profession to which it is my ambition to belong after a brief consultation with his wife mr anderson appointed harry editor pro tem and began to make arrangements for his journey harrys weekly wages were raised to fifteen dollars out of which he waa to pay ferguson four dollars a week for board so our hero found himself at nineteen the editor of an old established paper which though published in a country village was not without its share of influence in the county and state chapter xxxii the young editor the next number of the centreville gazette contained the following notice from the pen of mr anderson for the first time since our connection with the gazette we purpose taking a brief respite from our duties the state of our health renders a vacation desirable and an opportune invitation from a brother at the west has been accepted our absence may extend to two or three months in the interim we have committed the editorial management to mr harry walton who has been connected with the paper in a different capacity for nearly three years though mr walton is a very young man he has already acquired a reputation as contributor to papers of high standing in boston and we feel assured that our subscribers will have no reason to complain of the temporary change in the editorship the old man has given you quite a handsome notice harry said ferguson i hope i shall deserve it said harry but i begin now to realize that i am young to assume such responsible duties it would have seemed more appropriate for you to undertake them i cant write well enough harry i like to read but i cant produce in regard to the business management i feel competent to advise i shall certainly be guided by your advice ferguson as it may interest the reader we will raise the curtain and show our young hero in the capacity of editor the time is ten days after mr andersons absence harry was accustomed to do his work as compositor in the forenoon and the early part of the afternoon from three to five he occupied the editorial chair read letters wrote paragraphs and saw visitors he had just seated himself when a man entered the office and looked about him inquisitively i would like to see the editor he said i am the editor said harry with dignity the visitor looked surprised you are the youngestlooking editor i have met he said have you filled the office long not long said harry can i do anything for you yes sir you can first let me introduce myself i am dr theophilus peabody will you be seated dr peabody you have probably heard of me before said the visitor i cant say that i have i am surprised at that said the doctor rather disgusted to find himself unknown you must have heard of peabodys unfailing panacea i am afraid i have not you are young said dr peabody compassionately that accounts for it peabodys panacea let me tell you sir is the great remedy of the age it has effected more cures relieved more pain soothed more aching bosoms and done more good than any other medicine in existence it must be a satisfaction to you to have conferred such a blessing on mankind said harry inclined to laugh at the doctors magniloquent style it is i consider myself one of the benefactors of mankind but sir the medicine has not yet been fully introduced there are thousands who groan on beds of pain who are ignorant that for the small sum of fifty cents they could be restored to health and activity thats a pity it is a pity mr walton mr walton i have called sir to ask you to cooperate with me in making it known to the world so far as your influence extends is your medicine a liquid no sir it is in the form of pills twentyfour in a box let me show you the doctor opened a wooden box and displayed a collection of very unwholesomelooking brown pills try one sir it wont do you any harm thank you i would rather not i dont like pills what will they cure what wont they cure ive got a list of fiftynine diseases in my circular all of which are relieved by peabodys panacea they may cure more in fact ive been told of a consumptive patient who was considerably relieved by a single box you wont try one i would rather not well here is my circular containing accounts of remarkable cures performed permit me to present you a box thank you said harry dubiously youll probably be sick before long said the doctor cheerfully and then the pills will come handy doctor said ferguson gravely i find my hair getting thin on top of the head do you think the panacea would restore it yes said the doctor unexpectedly i had a case in portsmouth of a gentleman whose head was as smooth as a billiardball he took the pills for another complaint and was surprised in the course of three weeks to find young hair sprouting all over the bald spot cant i sell you halfadozen boxes you may have half a dozen for two dollars and a half ferguson who of course had been in jest found it hard to forbear laughing especially when harry joined the doctor in urging him to purchase not today he answered i can try mr waltons box and if it helps me i can order some more you may not be able to get it then said the doctor persuasively i may not be in centreville if the panacea is well known i can surely get it without difficulty not so cheap as i will sell it i wont take any today said ferguson decisively you havent told me what i can do for you said harry who found the doctors call rather long i would like you to insert my circular to your paper it wont take more than two columns we shall be happy to insert it at regular advertising rates i thought said dr peabody disappointed that you might do it gratuitously as i had given you a box we dont do business on such terms said harry i think i had better return the box no keep it said the doctor you will be willing to notice it doubtless harry rapidly penned this paragraph and read it aloud dr theophilus peabody has left with us a box of his unfailing panacea which he claims will cure a large variety of diseases couldnt you give a list of the diseases insinuated the doctor there are fiftynine you said yes sir then i am afraid we must decline harry resumed his writing and the doctor took his leave looking far from satisfied here ferguson said harry after the visitor had retired take the pills and much good may they do you better take one now for the growth of your hair it was fortunate that dr peabody did not hear the merriment that followed or he would have given up the editorial staff of the centreville gazette as maliciously disposed to underrate his favorite medicine who wouldnt be an editor said harry i notice said ferguson that pilltenders and blacking manufacturers are most liberal to the editorial profession i only wish jewellers and piano manufacturers were as free with their manufactures i would like a good gold watch and i shall soon want a piano for my daughter you may depend upon it ferguson when such gifts come in that i shall claim them as editorial perquisites we wont quarrel about them till they come harry our hero here opened a bulky communication what is that asked ferguson an essay on the immortality of the soul covers fifteen pages foolscap what shall i do with it publish it in a supplement with dr peabodys circular i am not sure but the circular would be more interesting reading from whom does the essay come it is signed l s then it is by lemuel snodgrass a retired schoolteacher who fancies himself a great writer hell be offended if i dont print it wont he ill tell you how to get over that say in an editorial paragraph we have received a thoughtful essay from l s on the immortality of the soul we regret that its length precludes our publishing it in the gazette we would suggest to the author to print it in a pamphlet that suggestion will be regarded as complimentary and we may get the job of printing it i see you are shrewd ferguson i will follow your advice chapter xxxiii an unexpected proposal during his temporary editorship harry did not feel at liberty to make any decided changes in the character or arrangement of the paper but he was ambitious to improve it as far as he was able in its different departments mr anderson had become rather indolent in the collection of local news merely publishing such items as were voluntarily contributed harry after his days work was over made a little tour of the village gathering any news that he thought would be of interest to the public moreover he made arrangements to obtain news of a similar nature from neighboring villages and the result was that in the course of a month he made the gazette much more readable really the gazette gives a good deal more news than it used to was a common remark it was probably in consequence of this improvement that new subscriptions began to come in not from centreville alone but from towns in the neighborhood this gratified and encouraged harry who now felt that he was on the right tack there was another department to which he devoted considerable attention this was a condensed summary of news from all parts of the world giving the preference and the largest space of course to american news he aimed to supply those who did not take a daily paper with a brief record of events such as they would not be likely otherwise to hear of of course all this work added to his labors as compositor and his occasional sketches for boston papers absorbed a large share of his time indeed he had very little left at his disposal for rest and recreation i am afraid you are working too hard harry said ferguson you are doing mr andersons work better than he ever did it and your own too i enjoy it said harry i work hard i know but i feel paid by the satisfaction of finding that my labors are appreciated when mr anderson gets back he will find it necessary to employ you as assistant editor for it wont do to let the paper get back to its former dulness i will accept said harry if he makes the offer i feel more and more that i must be an editor you are certainly showing yourself competent for the position i have only made a beginning said our hero modestly in time i think i could make a satisfactory paper one day about two months after mr andersons departure ferguson and harry were surprised and not altogether agreeably by the entrance of john clapp and luke harrison they looked far from prosperous in fact both of them were decidedly seedy going west had not effected an improvement in their fortunes is that you clapp asked ferguson where did you come from from st louis then you didnt feel inclined to stay there not i its a beastly place i came near starving clapp would have found any place beastly where a fair days work was required for fair wages and my young readers in st louis therefore need not heed his disparaging remarks how was it with you luke asked harry do you like the west no better than clapp you dont catch me out there again said luke it isnt what its cracked up to be we had the hardest work in getting money enough to get us back as luke did not mention the kind of hard work by which the money was obtained i may state here that an evenings luck at the faro table had supplied them with money enough to pay the fare to boston by railway otherwise another year might have found them still in st louis hard work doesnt suit your constitution does it said ferguson slyly i can work as well as anybody said luke but i havent had the luck of some people you were lucky enough to have your fare paid to the west for you yes and when we got there the rascal left us to shift for ourselves that aint much luck ive always had to shift for myself and always expect to was the reply oh youre a model sneered clapp you always were as sober and steady as a deacon i wonder they didnt make you one and walton there is one of the same sort said luke i say harry it was real mean in you not to send me the money i wrote for you hadnt it had you yes said harry firmly but i worked hard for it and i didnt feel like giving it away who asked you to give it away i only wanted to borrow it thats the same thing with you you were not likely to repay it again do you mean to insult me blustered luke no i never insult anybody i only tell the truth you know luke harrison whether i have reason for what i say i wouldnt leave a friend to suffer when i had plenty of money in my pocket said luke with an injured air if you had been a different sort of fellow i would have asked you for five dollars to keep me along till i can get work ive come back with empty pockets ill lend you five dollars if you need it said harry who judged from lukes appearance that he told the truth will you said luke brightening up thats a good fellow ill pay you just as soon as i can harry did not place much reliance on this assurance but he felt that he could afford the loss of five dollars if loss it should prove and it might prevent lukes obtaining the money in a more questionable way wheres mr anderson asked clapp looking round the office hes been in michigan for a couple of months you dont say so why who runs the paper ferguson and i said harry i mean who edits it harry does that said his fellowworkman whew ejaculated clapp in surprise why but two years ago you was only a printers devil hes risen from the ranks said ferguson and i can say with truth that the gazette has never been better than since it has been under his charge how much does old anderson pay you for taking his place asked luke who was quite as much surprised as clapp i dont ask anything extra he pays me fifteen dollars a week as compositor youre doing well said luke enviously got a big pile of money laid up havent you i have something in the bank harry writes stories for the boston papers also said ferguson he makes a hundred or two that way some folks are born to luck said clapp discontentedly here am i six or eight years older out of a place and without a cent to fall back upon i wish i was one of your lucky ones you might have had a few hundred dollars at any rate said ferguson if you hadnt chosen to spend all your money when you were earning good wages a man must have a little enjoyment we cant drudge all the time its better to do that than to be where you are now but clapp was not to be convinced that he was himself to blame for his present disagreeable position he laid the blame on fortune like thousands of others he could not see that harrys good luck was the legitimate consequence of industry and frugality after a while the two left the office they decided to seek their old boardinghouse and remain there for a week waiting for something to turn up the next day harry received the following letter from mr anderson dear walton my brother urges me to settle permanently at the west i am offered a partnership in a paper in this vicinity and my health has much improved here the west seems the place for me my only embarrassment is the paper if i could dispose of the gazette for two thousand dollars cash i could see my way clear to remove why cant you and ferguson buy it the numbers which you have sent me show that you are quite capable of filling the post of editor and you and ferguson can do the mechanical part i think it will be a good chance for you write me at once whether there us any likelihood of your purchasing your friend jotham anderson harrys face flushed eagerly as he read this letter nothing would suit him better than to make this arrangement if only he could provide the purchase money but this was likely to present a difficulty chapter xxxiv a friend in need harry at once showed ferguson the letter he had received what are you going to do about it asked his friend i should like to buy the paper but i dont see how i can mr anderson wants two thousand dollars cash how much have you got only five hundred i have seven hundred and fifty said ferguson thoughtfully harrys face brightened why cant we go into partnership he asked that is what we spoke of once said ferguson and it would suit me perfectly but there is a difficulty your money and mine added together will not be enough perhaps mr anderson would take a mortgage on the establishment for the balance i dont think so he says expressly that he wants cash harry looked disturbed do you think any one would lend us the money on the same terms he asked after a while squire trevor is the only man in the village likely to have money to lend there he is in the street now run down harry and ask him to step in a minute our hero seized his hat and did as requested he returned immediately followed by squire trevor a stout puffy little man reputed shrewd and a capitalist excuse our calling you in squire trevor said ferguson but we want to consult you on a matter of business harry just show the squire mr andersons letter the squire read it deliberately do you want my advice he said looking up from the perusal buy the paper it is worth what anderson asks for it so i think but there is a difficulty harry and i can only raise twelve hundred dollars or so between us give a note for the balance youll be able to pay it off in two years if you prosper i am afraid that wont do mr anderson wants cash cant you lend us the money squire trevor continued ferguson bluntly the village capitalist shook his head if you had asked me last week i could have obliged you he said but i was in boston day before yesterday and bought some railway stock which is likely to enhance in value that leaves me short then you couldnt manage it said ferguson soberly not at present said the squire decidedly then we must write to mr anderson offering what we have and a mortgage to secure the rest that will be your best course he may agree to our terms said harry hopefully after their visitor had left the office we will hope so at all events a letter was at once despatched and in a week the answer was received i am sorry mr anderson wrote to decline your proposals but i have immediate need of the whole sum which i ask for the paper if i cannot obtain it i shall come back to centreville though i would prefer to remain here upon the receipt of this letter ferguson gave up his work for the forenoon and made a tour of the village calling upon all who he thought were likely to have money to lend he had small expectation of success but felt that he ought to try everywhere before giving up so good a chance while he was absent harry had a welcome visitor it was no other than professor henderson the magician in whose employ he had spent three months some years before as related in bound to rise take a seat professor said harry cordially i am delighted to see you how you have grown harry said the professor why i should hardly have known you we havent met since i left you to enter this office no it is nearly three years how do you like the business very much indeed are you doing well i receive fifteen dollars a week that is good what are your prospects for the future they would be excellent if i had a little more capital i dont see how you need capital as a journeyman printer i have a chance to buy out the paper but who would edit it i would you said the magician rather incredulously i have been the editor for the last two months you a boy i am nineteen professor i shouldnt have dreamed of editing a paper at nineteen or indeed as old as i am now harry laughed you are too modest professor let me show you our last two issues the professor took out his glasses and sat down not without considerable curiosity to read a paper edited by one who only three years before had been his assistant did you write this article he asked after a pause pointing to the leader in the last issue of the gazette yes sir then by jove you can write why its worthy of a man of twice your age thank you professor said harry gratified where did you learn to write harry gave his old employer some account of his literary experiences mentioning his connection with the two boston weekly papers you ought to be an editor said the professor if you can do as much at nineteen you have a bright future before you that depends a little on circumstances if i only could buy this paper i would try to win reputation as well as money what is your difficulty the want of money how much do you need eight hundred dollars is that all the price such a paper commands no the price is two thousand dollars but ferguson and i can raise twelve hundred between us do you consider it good property mr anderson made a comfortable living out of it besides paying for office work we should have this advantage that we should be our own compositors that would give you considerable to do if you were editor also i shouldnt mind said harry if i only had a paper of my own i think i should be willing to work night and day what are your chances of raising the sum you need very small ferguson has gone out at this moment to see if he can find any one willing to lend but we dont expect success why dont you apply to me asked the professor i didnt know if you had the money to spare i might conjure up some presto change you know we professors of magic can find money anywhere but you need some to work with i have been behind the scenes said harry smiling but you dont know all my secrets for all that in sober earnest i havent been practising magic these twentyfive years for nothing i can lend you the money you want and i will harry seized his hand and shook it with delight how can i express my gratitude he said by sending me your paper gratis and paying me seven per cent interest on my money agreed anything more yes i am to give an exhibition in the village tomorrow night you must give me a good puff with the greatest pleasure ill write it now before it takes place i see you are following the example of some of the city dailies and ill print you some handbills for nothing good when do you want the money will next week do yes mr anderson wont expect the money before here ferguson entered the efface harry made a signal of silence to the professor whom he introduced then he said well ferguson what luck none at all answered his fellowcompositor evidently dispirited nobody seems to have any money we shall have to give up our plan i dont mean to give it up then perhaps youll tell me where to find the money i will you dont mean to say began ferguson eagerly yes i do i mean to say that the money is found where prof henderson has agreed to let us have it is that true said ferguson bewildered i believe so said the professor smiling harry has juggled the money out of me you know he used to be in the business and you can make your bargain as soon as you like it is hardly necessary to say that prof henderson got an excellent notice in the next number of the centreville gazette and it is my opinion that he deserved it chapter xxxv fletchers opinion of harry walton in two weeks all the business arrangements were completed and ferguson and harry became joint proprietors of the centreville gazette the latter being sole editor the change was received with favor in the village as harry had as editor pro tem for two months shown his competence for the position it gave him prominence also in town and though only nineteen he already was classed with the minister the doctor and the lawyer it helped him also with the weekly papers to which he contributed in boston and his pay was once more raised while his sketches were more frequently printed now this was all very pleasant but it was not long before our hero found himself overburdened with work what is the matter harry you look pale said ferguson one morning i have a bad headache and am feeling out of sorts i dont wonder at it you are working too hard i dont know about that i do you do nearly as much as i as a compositor then you do all the editorial work besides writing sketches for the boston papers how can i get along with less the paper must be edited and i shouldnt like giving up writing for the boston papers ill tell you what to do take a boy and train him up as a printer after a while he will relieve you almost wholly while by the time he commands good wages we shall be able to pay them it is a good idea ferguson do you know of any boy that wants to learn printing havent you got a younger brother the very thing said harry briskly father wrote to me last week that he should like to get something for better write and offer him a place in the office i will the letter was written at once an immediate answer was received of a favorable nature the boy was glad to leave home and the father was pleased to have him under the charge of his older brother after he had become editor and part proprietor of the gazette harry wrote to oscar vincent to announce his promotion though oscar had been in college now nearly two years and they seldom met the two were as warm friends as ever and from time to time exchanged letters this was oscars reply harvard college june dear mr editor i suppose thats the proper way to address you now i congratulate you with all my heart on your brilliant success and rapid advancement here you are at nineteen while i am only a rattlebrained sophomore i dont mind being called that by the way for at least it credits me with the possession of brains not that i am doing so very badly i am probably in the first third of the class and that implies respectable scholarship here but you i can hardly realize that you whom i knew only two or three years since as a printers apprentice i wont use fletchers word have lifted yourself to the responsible position of sole editor truly you have risen from the ranks speaking of fletcher by the way you know he is my classmate he occupies an honorable position somewhere near the foot of the class where he is likely to stay unless he receives from the faculty leave of absence for an unlimited period i met him yesterday swinging his little cane and looking as dandified as he used to hallo fletcher said i ive just got a letter from a friend of yours who is it he asked harry walton he never was a friend of mine said fitz turning up his delicately chiselled nose the beggarly printers devil i hope you wont feel sensitive about the manner in which fitz spoke of you youve made two mistakes said i hes neither a beggar nor a printers devil he used to be retorted fitz the last not the first youll be glad to hear that hes getting on well has he had his wages raised twentyfive cents a week sneered fitz he has lost his place said i fletcher actually looked happy but i dashed his happiness by adding but hes got a better one whats that he snarled he has bought out the paper of mr anderson and is now sole editor and part proprietor a boy like him buy a paper without a cent of money and no education you are mistaken he had several hundred dollars and as a writer he is considerably ahead of either of us hell run the paper into the ground said fitz prophetically if he does itll only be to give it firmer root you are crazy about that country lout said fitz it isnt much to edit a little village paper like that after all so you see what your friend fitz thinks about it as you may be in danger of having your vanity fed by compliments from other sources i thought i would offset them by the candid opinion of a disinterested and impartial scholar like fitz i told my father of the step you have taken oscar said he that boy is going to succeed he shows the right spirit i would have given him a place on my paper but very likely he does better to stay where he is perhaps you noticed the handsome notice he gave you in his paper yesterday i really think he has a higher opinion of your talents than of mine which of course shows singular lack of discrimination however youre my friend and i wont make a fuss about it i am cramming for the summer examinations and hot work i find it i can tell you this summer i am going to niagara and shall return by way of the st lawrence and montreal seeing the thousand islands the rapids and so on i may send you a letter or two for the gazette if you will give me a puff in your editorial columns these letters were actually written and being very lively and readable harry felt quite justified in referring to them in a complimentary way fletchers depreciation of him troubled him very little it will make me neither worse nor better he reflected the time will come i hope when i shall have risen high enough to be wholly indifferent to such illnatured sneers his brother arrived in due time and was set to work as harry himself had been three years before he was not as smart as harry nor was he ever likely to rise as high but he worked satisfactorily and made good progress so that in six months he was able to relieve harry of half his labors as compositor this enabled him to give more time to his editorial duties both boarded at fergusons where they had a comfortable home and good plain fare meanwhile harry was acknowledged by all to have improved the paper and the most satisfactory evidence of the popular approval of his efforts came in an increased subscription list and this of course made the paper more profitable at the end of twelve months the two partners had paid off the money borrowed from professor henderson and owned the paper without incumbrance a pretty good years work harry said ferguson cheerfully yes said harry but well do still better next year chapter xxxvi conclusion i have thus traced in detail the steps by which harry walton ascended from the condition of a poor farmers son to the influential position of editor of a weekly newspaper i call to mind now however that he is no longer a boy and his future career will be of less interest to my young readers yet i hope they may be interested to hear though not in detail by what successive steps he rose still higher in position and influence harry was approaching his twentyfirst birthday when he was waited upon by a deputation of citizens from a neighboring town inviting him to deliver a fourth of july oration he was at first disposed out of modesty to decline but on consultation with ferguson decided to accept and do his best he was ambitious to produce a good impression and his experience in the debating society gave him a moderate degree of confidence and selfreliance when the time came he fully satisfied public expectation i do not say that his oration was a model of eloquence for that could not have been expected of one whose advantages had been limited and one for whom i have never claimed extraordinary genius but it certainly was well written and well delivered and very creditable to the young orator the favor with which it was received may have had something to do in influencing the people of centreville to nominate and elect him to the new hampshire legislature a few months later he entered that body the youngest member in it but his long connection with a debating society and the experience he had gained in parliamentary proceedings enabled him at once to become a useful working member he was successively reelected for several years during which he showed such practical ability that he obtained a state reputation at twentyeight he received a nomination for congress and was elected by a close vote during all this time he remained in charge of the centreville gazette but of course had long relinquished the task of a compositor into his brothers hands he had no foolish ideas about this work being beneath him but he felt that he could employ his time more profitably in other ways under his judicious management the gazette attained a circulation and influence that it had never before reached the income derived from it was double that which it yielded in the days of his predecessor and both he and ferguson were enabled to lay by a few hundred dollars every year but harry had never sought wealth he was content with a comfortable support and a competence he liked influence and the popular respect and he was gratified by the important trusts which he received he was ambitious but it was a creditable and honorable ambition he sought to promote the public welfare and advance the public interests both as a speaker and as a writer and though sometimes misrepresented the people on the whole did him justice a few weeks after he had taken his seat in congress a young man was ushered into his private room looking up he saw a man of about his own age dressed with some attempt at style but on the whole wearing a look of faded gentility mr walton said the visitor with some hesitation that is my name wont you take a seat the visitor sat down but appeared ill at ease he nervously fumbled at his hat and did not speak can i do anything for you asked harry at length i see you dont know me said the stranger i cant say i recall your features but then i see a great many persons i went to school at the prescott academy when you were in the office of the centreville gazette harry looked more closely and exclaimed in astonished recognition fitzgerald fletcher yes said the other flushing with mortification i am fitzgerald fletcher i am glad to see you said harry cordially forgetting the old antagonism that had existed between them he rose and offered his hand which fletcher took with an air of relief for he had felt uncertain of his reception you have prospered wonderfully said fletcher with a shade of envy yes said harry smiling i was a printers devil when you knew me but i never meant to stay in that position i have risen from the ranks i havent said fletcher bitterly have you been unfortunate tell me about it if you dont mind said harry sympathetically my father failed three years ago said fletcher and i found myself adrift with nothing to do and no money to fall back upon i have drifted about since then but now i am out of employment i came to you today to see if you will exert your influence to get me a government clerkship even of the lowest class you may rest assured mr walton that i need it was this the proud fitzgerald fletcher suing for the means of supporting himself to one whom as a boy he had despised and looked down upon surely the world is full of strange changes and mutations of fortune here was a chance for harry to triumph over his old enemy but he never thought of doing it instead he was filled with sympathy for one who unlike himself had gone down in the social scale and he cordially promised to see what he could do for fletcher and that without delay on inquiry he found that fletcher was qualified to discharge the duties of a clerk and secured his appointment to a clerkship in the treasury department on a salary of twelve hundred dollars a year it was an income which fletcher would once have regarded as wholly insufficient for his needs but adversity had made him humble and he thankfully accepted it he holds the position still discharging the duties satisfactorily he is glad to claim the hon harry walton among his acquaintances and never sneers at him now as a printers devil oscar vincent spent several years abroad after graduation acting as foreign correspondent of his fathers paper he is now his fathers junior partner and is not only respected for his ability but a general favorite in society on account of his sunny disposition and cordial good nature he keeps up his intimacy with harry walton indeed there is good reason for this since harry four years since married his sister maud and the two friends are brothersinlaw harrys parents are still living no longer weighed down by poverty as when we first made their acquaintance the legacy which came so opportunely improved their condition and provided them with comforts to which they had long been strangers but their chief satisfaction comes from harrys unlookedfor success in life their past life of poverty and privation is all forgotten in their gratitude for this great happiness the next and concluding volume of this series will be herbert carters legacy
