i not twenty minutes has passed since you left me here in the cafe since i said no to your request that i would never write out for you the story of my mortal life how i became a vampire how i came upon marius only years after he had lost his human life now here i am with your notebook open using one of the sharp pointed eternal ink pens you left me delighted at the sensuous press of the black ink into the expensive and flawless white paper naturally david you would leave me something elegant an inviting page this notebook bound in dark varnished leather is it not tooled with a design of rich roses thornless yet leafy a design that means only design in the final analysis but bespeaks an authority what is written beneath this heavy and handsome book cover will count sayeth this cover the thick pages are ruled in light blue you are practical so thoughtful and you probably know i almost never put pen to paper to write anything at all even the sound of the pen has its allure the sharp scratch rather like the finest quills in ancient rome when i would put them to parchment to write my letters to my father when i would write in a diary my own laments ah that sound the only thing missing here is the smell of ink but we have the fine plastic pen which will not run out for volumes making as fine and deep a black mark as i choose to make i am thinking about your request in writing you see you will get something from me i find myself yielding to it almost as one of our human victims yields to us discovering perhaps as the rain continues to fall outside as the cafe continues with its noisy chatter to think that this might not be the agony i presumed reaching back over the two thousand years but almost a pleasure like the act of drinking blood itself i reach now for a victim who is not easy for me to overcome my own past perhaps this victim will flee from me with a speed that equals my own whatever i seek now a victim that i have never faced and there is the thrill of the hunt in it what the modern world calls investigation why else would i see those times so vividly now you had no magic potion to give me to loosen my thoughts there is but one potion for us and it is blood you said at one point as we walked towards the cafe you will remember everything you who are so young amongst us yet were so old as a mortal and such a scholar as a mortal perhaps it is natural that you so boldly attempt to collect our stories but why seek to explain here such curiosity as yours such bravery in face of blooddrenched truth how could you have kindled in me this longing to go back two thousand years almost exactly to tell of my mortal days on earth in rome and how i joined marius and what little chance he had against fate how could origins so deeply buried and so long denied suddenly beckon to me a door snaps open a light shines come in i sit back now in the cafe i write but i pause and look around me at the people of this paris cafe i see the drab unisex fabrics of this age the fresh american girl in her olive green military clothes all of her possessions slung over her shoulder in a backpack i see the old frenchman who has come here for decades merely to look at the bare legs and arms of the young to feed on the gestures as if he were a vampire to wait for some exotic jewel of a moment when a woman sits back laughing cigarette in hand and the doth of her synthetic blouse becomes tight over her breasts and there the nipples are visible ah old man he is grayhaired and wears an expensive coat he is no menace to anyone he lives entirely in vision tonight he will go back to a modest but elegant apartment which he has maintained since the last great world war and he will watch films of the young beauty brigitte bardot he lives in his eyes he has not touched a woman in ten years i dont drift david i drop anchor here for i will not have my story pour forth as from a drunken oracle i see these mortals in a more attentive light they are so fresh so exotic and yet so luscious to me these mortals they look like tropical birds must have looked when i was a child so full of fluttering rebellious life i wanted to clutch them to have it to make their wings flap in my hands to capture flight and own it and partake of it ah that terrible moment in childhood when one accidentally crushes the life from a brightred bird yet they are sinister in their darker vestments some of these mortals the inevitable cocaine dealer and they are everywhere our finest prey who waits for his contact in the far corner his long leather coat styled by a noted italian designer his hair shaved dose on the side and left bushy on the top to make him look distinctive which it does though there is no need when one considers his huge black eyes and the hardness of what nature intended to be a generous mouth he makes those quick impatient gestures with his cigarette lighter on the small marble table the mark of the addicted he twists he turns he cannot be comfortable he doesnt know that he will never be comfortable in life again he wants to leave to snort the cocaine for which he burns and yet he must wait for the contact his shoes are too shiny and his long thin hands will never grow old i think he will die tonight this man i feel a slow gathering desire to kill him myself he has fed so much poison to so many tracking him wrapping him in my arms i would not even have to wreathe him with visions i would let him know that death has come in the form of a woman too white to be human too smoothed by the centuries to be anything but a statue come to life but those for whom he waits plot to kill him and why should i intervene what do i look like to these people a woman with long wavy dean brown hair that covers me much like a nuns mantle a face so white it appears cosmetically created and eyes abnormally brilliant even from behind golden glasses ah we have a lot to be grateful for in the many styles of eyeglasses in this age for if i were to take these off i should have to keep my head bowed not to startle people with the mere play of yellow and brown and gold in my eyes that have grown ever more jewellike over the centuries so that i seem a blind woman set with topaz for her pupils or rather carefully formed orbs of topaz sapphire even aquamarine look i have filled so many pages and all i am saying is yes i will tell you how it began for me yes i will tell you the story of my mortal life in ancient rome how i came to love marius and how we came to be together and then to part what a transformation in me this resolution how powerful i feel as i hold this pen and how eager to put us in sharp and dear perspective before i begin fulfilling your request this is paris in a time of peace there is rain high regal gray buildings with their double windows and iron balconies line this boulevard loud tiny dangerous automobiles race in the streets cafes such as this are overflowing with international tourists ancient churches are crowded here by tenements palaces turned to museums in whose rooms i linger for hours gazing at objects from egypt or sumer which are even older than me roman architecture is everywhere absolute replicas of temples of my time now serve as banks the words of my native latin suffuse the english language ovid my beloved ovid the poet who predicted his poetry would outlast the roman empire has been proved true walk into any bookstore and you find him in neat small paperbacks designed to appeal to students roman influence seeds itself sprouting mighty oaks right through the modern forest of computers digital disks microviruses and space satellites it is easy here as always to find an embraceable evil a despair worth tender fulfillment and with me there must always be some love of the victim some mercy some selfdelusion that the death i bring does not mar the great shroud of inevitability woven of trees and earth and stars and human events which hovers forever around us ready to close on all that is created all that we know last night when you found me how did it seem to you i was alone on the bridge over the seine walking in the last dangerous darkness before dawn you saw me before i knew you were there my hood was down and i let my eyes in the dim light of the bridge have their little moment of glory my victim stood at the railing no more than a child but bruised and robbed by a hundred men she wanted to die in the water i dont know if the seine is deep enough for one to drown there so near the ile stlouis so near notre dame perhaps it is if one can resist a last struggle for life but i felt this victims soul like ashes as though her spirit had been cremated and only the body remained a worn diseaseridden shell i put my arm around her and when i saw the fear in her small black eyes when i saw the question coming i wreathed her with images the soot that covered my skin was not enough to keep me from looking like the virgin mary and she sank into hymns and devotion she even saw my veils in the colors she had known in churches of childhood as she yielded to me and i knowing that i neednt drink but thirsting for her thirsting for the anguish she could give forth in her final moment thirsting for the tasty red blood that would fill my mouth and make me feel human for one instant in my very monstrosity i gave in to her visions bent her neck ran my fingers over her sore tender skin and then it was when i sank my teeth into her when i drank from her it was then that i knew you were there you watched i knew it and i felt it and i saw the image of us in your eye distractingly as the pleasure nevertheless flushed through me making me believe i was alive somehow connected to fields of clover or trees with roots deeper in the earth than the branches they raise to the welkin above at first i hated you you saw me as i feasted you saw me as i gave in you knew nothing of my months of starvation restraint wandering you saw only the sudden release of my unclean desire to suck her very soul from her to make her heart rise in the flesh inside her to drag from her veins every precious particle of her that still wanted to survive and she did want to survive wrapped in saints and dreaming suddenly of the breasts that nursed her her young body fought pumping and pumping against me she so soft and my own form hard as a statue my milkless nipples enshrined in marble no comfort let her see her mother dead gone and now waiting let me glimpse through her dying eyes the light through which she sped towards this certain salvation then i forgot about you i would not be robbed i slowed the drinking i let her sigh i let her lungs fill with the cold river air her mother drawing closer and closer so that death now was as safe for her as the womb i took every drop from her that she could give she hung dead against me as one id rescued one i would help from the bridge some weakened sickened drunken girl i slid my hand into her body breaking the flesh so easily even with these delicate fingers and i dosed my fingers around her heart and brought it to my lips and sucked it my head tucked down by her face sucked the heart like fruit until no blood was left in any fiber or chamber and then slowly perhaps for your benefit i lifted her and let her fall down into the water she had so desired now there would be no struggle as her lungs filled with the river now there would be no last desperate thrashing i fed from the heart one last time to take even the color of blood out of it and then sent it after her crushed grapes poor child child of a hundred men then i faced you let you know that i knew you watched from the quay i think i tried to frighten you in rage i let you know how weak you were that all the blood given to you by lestat would make you no match should i choose to dismember you pitch a fatal heat into you and immolate you or only punish you with penetrating scar simply for having spied upon me actually i have never done such a thing to a younger one i feel sorry for them when they see us the ancient ones and quake in terror but i should by all the knowledge of myself i possess have retreated so quickly that you could riot follow me in the night something in your demeanor charmed me the manner in which you approached me on the bridge your young angloindian brownskinned body gifted by your true mortal age with such seductive grace your very posture seemed to ask of me without humiliation pandora may we speak my mind wandered perhaps you knew it i dont remember whether i shut you out of my thoughts and i know that your telepathic abilities are not really very strong my mind wandered suddenly perhaps of itself perhaps at your prodding i thought of all the things i could tell you which were so different from the tales of lestat and those of marius through lestat and i wanted to warn you warn you of the ancient vampires of the far east who would kill you if you went into their territory simply because you were there i wanted to make certain you understood what we all had to accept the fount of our immortal vampiric hunger did reside in two beings mekare and maharet so ancient they are now both horrible to look upon more than beautiful and if they destroy themselves we will all die with them i wanted to tell you of others who have never known us as a tribe or known our history who survived the terrible fire brought down on her children by our mother akasha i wanted to tell you that there were things walking the earth that look like us but are not of our breed any more than they are human and i wanted suddenly to take you under my wing it must have been your prodding you stood there the english gentleman wearing your decorum more lightly and naturally than any man id ever seen i marveled at your fine clothes that youd indulged yourself in a light black cloak of worsted wool that you had even given yourself the luxury of a gleaming red silk scarf so unlike you when you were newly made understand i was not aware the night that lestat transformed you into a vampire i didnt feel that moment all the preternatural world shimmered weeks earlier however with the knowledge that a mortal had jumped into the body of another mortal we know these things as if the stars tell us one preter natural mind picks up the ripples of this sharp cut in the fabric of the ordinary then another mind re ceives the image and on and on it goes david talbot the name we all knew from the venerable order of psychic detectives the talamasca had managed to move his entire soul and etheric body into that of another man that body itself was in the possession of a body thief whom you forced from it and once anchored in the young body you with all your scruples and values all your knowledge of seventyfour years remained an chored in the young cells and so it was david the reborn david with the highgloss india beauty and raw wellnourished strength of british lineage that lestat had made into a vampire bringing over both body and soul compounding miracle with the dark trick achieving once more a sin that should stun his contemporaries and his elders and this this was done to you by your best friend welcome to the darkness david welcome to the domain of shakespeares inconstant moon bravely you came up the bridge towards me forgive me pandora you said so quietly flawless british upperclass accent and the usual beguiling british rhythm that is so seductive it seems to say that we will all save the world you kept a polite distance between us as if i were a virgin girl of the last century and you didnt want to alarm me and my tender sensibilities i smiled i indulged myself then i took your full measure this fledgling that lestat against mariuss injunction had dared to make i saw the components of you as a man an immense human soul fearless yet half in love with despair and a body which lestat had almost injured himself to render powerful he had given you more blood than he could easily give in your transformation he had tried to give you his courage his cleverness his cunning he had tried to transport an armory for you through the blood he had done well your strength was complex and obvious our queen mother akashas blood was mixed with that of lestat marius my ancient lover had given him blood as well lestat ah now what do they say they say that he may even have drunk the blood of the christ it was this first issue i took up with you my curiosity overwhelming me for to scan the world for knowledge is often to rake in such tragedy that i abhor it tell me the truth of it i said this story memnoch the devil lestat claimed he went to heaven and to hell he brought back a veil from st veronica the face of christ was on it it converted thousands to christianity it cured alienation and succored bitterness it drove other children of darkness to throw up their arms to the deadly morning light as if the sun were in fact the fire of god yes its all happened as i described it you said lowering your head with a polite but unexaggerated modesty and you know a few of us perished in this fervor whilst newspapers and scientists collected our ashes for examination i marveled at your calm attitude a twentiethcentury sensibility a mind dominated by an incalculable wealth of information and quick of tongue with an intellect devoted to swiftness synthesis probabilities and all this against the backdrop of horrid experiences wars massacres the worst perhaps the world has ever seen it all happened you said and i did meet with mekare and maharet the ancient ones and you neednt fear for me that i dont know how fragile is the root it was kind of you to think so protectively of me i was quietly charmed what did you think of this holy veil yourself i asked our lady of fatima you said softly the shroud of turin a cripple rising from the miraculous waters of lourdes what a consolation it must be to accept such a thing so easily and you did not you shook your head and neither did lestat really it was the mortal girl dora snatching the veil from him who took it out into the world but it was a most singular and meticulously made thing ill tell you that more worthy of the word relic perhaps than any other ive ever seen you sounded dejected suddenly some immense intent went into its making you said and the vampire armand the delicate boylike armand he believed it i asked armand looked at it and saw the face of christ i said seeking your confirmation enough to die for it you said solemnly enough to open his arms to the morning sun you looked away and you closed your eyes this was a simple unadorned plea to me not to make you speak of armand and how he had gone into the morning fire i gave a sigh surprised and gently fascinated to find you so articulate skeptical yet so sharply and frankly connected to the others you said in a shaken voice armand and still looking away from me what a requiem and does he know now if memnoch was real if god incarnate who tempted lestat was in fact the son of the god almighty does anyone i was taken with your earnestness your passion you were not jaded or cynical there was an immediacy to your feelings for these happenings these creatures these questions you posed they locked up the veil you know you said its in the vatican there were two weeks of frenzy on fifth avenue in st patricks cathedral in which people came to look into the eyes of the lord and then they had it gone taken to their vaults i doubt there is a nation on the earth with the power to gain even a glimpse of it now and lestat i said where is he now paralyzed silent you said lestat lies on the floor of a chapel in new orleans he doesnt move he says nothing his mother has come to him you knew her gabrielle he made a vampire of her yes i remember her even she draws no response from him whatever he saw in his journey to heaven and hell he doesnt know the truth of it one way or the other he tried to tell this to dora and eventually after id written down the whole story for him he passed within a few nights into this state his eyes are fixed and his body pliant they made a curious pietб he and gabrielle in this abandoned convent and its chapel his mind is dosed or worse its empty i found i liked very much your manner of speaking in fact i was taken off guard i left lestat because he was beyond my help and my reach you said and i must know if there are old ones who want to put an end to me i must make my pilgrimages and my progresses to know the dangers of this world to which ive been admitted youre so forthright you have no cunning on the contrary i conceal my keenest assets from you you gave me a slow polite smile your beauty rather confuses me are you used to this quite i said and weary of it come beyond it let me just warn there are old ones ones no one knows or can explain its rumored youve been with maharet and mekare who are now the edest and the fount from which we all spring obviously theyve drawn back from us from all the world into some secret place and have no taste for authority youre so very correct you said and my audience with them was beautiful but brief they dont want to rule over anyone nor will maharet as long as the history of the world and her own physical descendants are in it her own thousands of human descendants from a time so ancient there is no date for it maharet will never destroy herself and her sister thereby destroying all of us yes i said in that she believes the great family the generations she has traced for thousands of years i saw her when we all gathered she doesnt see us as evil you or me or lestat she thinks that were natural rather like volcanoes or fires that rage through forests or bolts of lightning that strike a man dead precisely you said there is no queen of the damned now i fear only one other immortal and thats your lover marius because it was marius who laid down the strict rule before he left the others that no more blood drinkers could be made im baseborn in the mind of marius that is were he an englishman those would be his words i shook my head i cant believe he would harm you hasnt he come to lestat did he not come to see the veil with his own eyes you said no to both questions heed this advice whenever you sense his presence talk to him talk to him as you have to me begin a conversation which he wont have the confidence to bring to a dose you smiled again thats such a clever way of putting it you said but i dont think you have to fear him if he wanted you gone off the earth youd be gone what we have to fear is the same things humans fear that there are others of our same species of varying power and belief and we are never entirely sure where they are or what they do thats my advice to you you are so kind to take your time with me you said i could have wept on the contrary you dont know the silence and solitude in which i wander and pray you never know it and here youve given me heat without death youve given me nourishment without blood im glad youve come i saw you look up at the sky the habit of the young ones i know we have to part now you turned to me suddenly meet me tomorrow night you said imploringly let this exchange continue ill come to you in the cafe where you sit every night musing ill find you let us talk to each other so youve seen me there oh often you said yes you looked away again i saw it was to conceal feeling then your dark eyes turned back to me pandora we have the world dont we you whispered i dont know david but ill meet you tomorrow night why havent you come to me there where it was warm and lighted it seemed a far more outrageous intrusion to move in on you in the sanctified privacy of a crowded cafe people go to such places to be alone dont they this seemed somehow more proper and i did not mean to be the voyeur like many fledglings i have to feed every night it was an accident that we saw each other at that moment that is charming david i said it is a long time since anyone has charmed me ill meet you there tomorrow night and then a wickedness possessed me i came towards you and embraced you knowing that the hardness and coldness of my ancient body would strike the deepest chord of terror in you newborn as you were passing so easily for mortal but you didnt draw back and when i kissed your cheek you kissed mine i wonder now as i sit here in the cafe writing trying to give you more with these words perhaps than you ask for what i would have done had you not kissed me had you shrunk back with the fear that is so common in the young david you are indeed a puzzle you see that i have begun to chronicle not my life here but what has passed these two nights between you and me allow this david allow that i speak of you and me and then perhaps i can retrieve my lost life when you came into the cafe tonight i thought nothing much about the notebooks you had two they were thick the leather of the notebooks smelled good and old and when you set them down on the table only then did i detect a glimmer from your disciplined and restrained mind that they had to do with me i had chosen this table in the crowded center of the room as though i wanted to be in the middle of the whirlpool of mortal scent and activity you seemed pleased unafraid utterly at home you wore another stunning suit of modern cut with a full cape of worsted wool very tasteful yet old world and with your golden skin and radiant eyes you turned the head of every woman in the place and you turned the heads of some of the men you smiled i must have seemed a snail to you beneath my cloak and hood gold glasses covering well over half my face and a trace of commercial lipstick on my lips a soft purple pink that had made me think of bruises it had seemed very enticing in the mirror at the store and i liked that my mouth was something i didnt have to hide my lips are now almost colorless with this lipstick i could smile i wore these gloves of mine black lace with their shearedoff tips so that my fingers can feel and i had sooted my nails so they would not sparkle like crystal in the cafe and i reached out my hand to you and you kissed it there was your same boldness and decorum and then the warmest smile from you a smile in which l think your former physiology must have dominated because you looked far too wise for one so young and strong of build i marveled at the perfect picture you had made of yourself you dont know what a joy it is to me you said that youve come that youve let me join you here at this table you have made me want this i said raising my hands and seeing that your eyes were dazzled by my crystalline fingernails in spite of the soot i reached towards you expecting you to pull back but you entrusted to my cold white fingers your warm dark hand you find in me a living being i asked you oh yes most definitely most radiantly and perfectly a living being we ordered our coffee as mortals expect us to do deriving more pleasure from the heat and aroma than they could ever imagine even stirring our little cups with our spoons i had before me a red dessert the dessert is still here of course i ordered it simply because it was red strawberries covered in syrup with a strong sweet smell that bees would like i smiled at your blandishments i liked them playfully i mocked them i let my hood slip down and i shook out my hair so that its fullness and dark brown color could shimmer in the light of course its no signal to mortals as is mariuss blond hair or that of lestat but i love my own hair i love the veil of it when it is down over my shoulders and i loved what i saw in your eyes somewhere deep inside me there is a woman i said to write it now in this notebook as i sit here alone it gives architecture to a trivial moment and seems so dire a confession david the more i write the more the concept of narrative excites me the more i believe in the weight of a coherence which is possible on the page though not in life but again i didnt know i meant to pick up this pen of yours at all we were talking pandora if anyone does not know youre a woman then he is a fool you said how angry marius would be with me for being pleased by that i said oh no rather he would seize it as a strong point in favor of his position i left him left him without a word the last time we were together that was before lestat went on his little escapade of running around in a human body and long before he encountered memnoch the devil i left marius and suddenly i wish i could reach him i wish i could talk with him as you and i are talking now you looked so troubled for me and with reason on some level you must have known that i had not evinced this much enthusiasm over anything in many a dreary year would you write your story for me pandora you asked suddenly i was totally surprised write it in these notebooks you pressed write about the time when you were alive the time when you and marius came together write what you will of marius but its your story that i most want i was stunned why in the world would you want this of me you didnt answer david surely youve not returned to that order of human beings the talamasca they know too much you put up your hand no and i will never and if there was ever any doubt of it i learnt it once and for all in the archives kept by maharet she allowed you to see her archives the books shes saved over the course of time yes it was remarkable you know a storehouse of tablets scrolls parchments books and poems from cultures of which the world knows nothing i think books lost from time of course she forbade me to reveal anything i found or speak in detail of our meeting she said it was too rash tampering with things and she confirmed your fear that i might go to the talamasca my old mortal psychic friends i have not i will not but it is a very easy vow to keep why so pandora when i saw all those old writings i knew i was no longer human i knew that the history lying there to be collected was no longer mine i am not one of these your eyes swept the room of course you must have heard this a thousand times from fledgling vampires but you see i had a fervent faith that philosophy and reason would make a bridge for me by which i could go and come in both worlds well there is no bridge its gone your sadness shimmered about you flashing in your young eyes and in the softness of your new flesh so you know that i said i didnt plan the words but out they came you know i gave a soft bitter laugh indeed i do i knew when i held documents from your time so many from your time imperial rome and other crumbling bits of inscribed rock i couldnt even hope to place i knew i didnt care about them pandora i care about what we are what we are now how remarkable i said you dont know how much i admire you or how attractive is your disposition to me i am happy to hear this you said then you leaned forward towards me i dont say we do not carry our human souls with us our history of course we do i remember once a long time ago armand told me that he asked lestat how will i ever understand the human race lestat said read or see all the plays of shakespeare and you will know all you ever need to know about the human race armand did it he devoured the poems he sat through the plays he watched the brilliant new films with laurence fishburne and kenneth branagh and leonardo dicaprio and when armand and i last spoke together this is what he said of his education lestat was right he gave me not books but a passage into understanding this man shakespeare writes and i quote both armand and shakespeare now as armand spoke it as i will to you as if it came from my heart tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing this man writes this said armand to me and we all know that it is absolutely the truth and every revelation has sooner or later fallen before it and yet we want to love the way he has said it we want to hear it again we want to remember it we want to never forget a single word we were both silent for a moment you looked down you rested your chin on your knuckles i knew the whole weight of armands going into the sun was on you and i had so loved your recitation of the words and the words themselves finally i said and this gives me pleasure think of it pleasure that you recite these words to me now you smiled i want to know now what we can learn you said i want to know what we can see so i come to you a child of the millennia a vampire who drank from the queen akasha herself one who has survived two thousand years and i ask you pandora please will you write for me write your story write what you will for a long moment i gave you no answer then i said sharply that i could not but something had stirred in me i saw and heard arguments and tirades of centuries ago i saw the poets lifted light shine on eras i had known intimately out of love other eras i had never known wandering ignorant a wraith yes there was a tale to be written there was but at the moment i could not admit it you were in misery having thought of armand having remembered his walking into the morning sun you mourned for armand was there any bond between you you asked forgive me my boldness but i mean was there any bond between you and armand when you met because marius had given you both the dark gift i know no jealousy exists that i can feel i wouldnt bring up the very name armand if i detected a hurt in you but all else is an absence a silence was there no bond the bond is only grief he went into the sun and grief is absolutely the easiest and safest of bonds you laughed under your breath what can i do to make you consider my request have pity on me gracious lady entrust to me your song i smiled indulgently but it was impossible i thought its far too dissonant my dear i said its far too i shut my eyes i had wanted to say that my song was far too painful to sing suddenly your eyes moved upwards your expression changed it was almost as if you were deliberately trying to appear to enter a trance slowly you turned your head you pointed with your hand close to the table then let your hand go lax what is it david i said what are you seeing spirits pandora ghosts you shuddered as if to dear your head but thats unheard of i said yet i knew that he was telling the truth the dark gift takes away that power even the ancient witches maharet and mekare told us this that once akashas blood entered them and they became vampires they never heard or saw the spirits again youve recently been with them did you tell them of this power he nodded obviously some loyalty bound him not to say that they did not have it but i knew they did not i saw it in his mind and i had known it myself when i had encountered the ancient twins the twins who had struck down the queen of the damned i can see spirits pandora you said with the most troubled expression i can see them anywhere if i try and in some very specific places when they choose lestat saw the ghost of roger his victim in memnoch the devil but that was an exception a surge of love in the mans soul that somehow defied death or delayed the souls termination something we cant understand i see spirits but i havent come to burden you with this or frighten you you must tell me more about this i said what did you see right now a weak spirit it couldnt harm anyone its one of those sad humans who does not know hes dead they are an atmosphere around the planet the earthbound is the name for them but pandora i have more than that in myself to explore you continued apparently each century yields a new kind of vampire or let us say that our course of growth was not set in the beginning any more than the course of human beings some night perhaps i will tell you everything i see these spirits who were never clear to me when i was mortal ill tell you about something armand confided to me about the colors he saw when he took life how the soul left body in waves of radiating color ive never heard of such a thing i too see this you said i could see it hurt you almost too much to speak of armand but whatever possessed armand to believe in the veil i asked suddenly amazed at my own passion why did he go into the sun how could such a thing kill lestats reason and will veronica did they know the very name means vera ikon that there was never any such person that she could not be found by one drawn back to ancient jerusalem on the day christ carried his cross she was a concoction of priests didnt they know i think i had taken the two notebooks in hand for i looked down and i saw that i did indeed hold them in fact i clutched both of them to my breast and examined one of the pens reason i whispered oh precious reason and consciousness within a void i shook my head smiling kindly at you and vampires who speak now with spirits humans who can travel from body to body i went on with a wholly unfamiliar energy a lively fashionable modern cult of angels devotion thriving everywhere and people rising from operating tables to speak of life after death a tunnel an embracing love oh you have been created perhaps in an auspicious time i dont know what to make of it you were obviously quite impressed by these words or rather the way that my perspective had been drawn from me so was i ive only started you said and will keep company alike with brilliant children of the millennia and streetcorner fortune tellers who deal out the cards of the tarot im eager to gaze into crystal balls and darkened mirrors ill search now among those whom others dismiss as mad or among us among those like you who have looked on something that they do not believe they should share thats it isnt it but i ask you to share it im finished with the ordinary human soul i am finished with science and psychology with microscopes and perhaps even with the telescopes aimed at the stars i was quite enthralled how strongly you meant it i could feel my face so warm with feeling for you as i looked at you i think my mouth was slack with wonder i am a miracle unto myself you said i am immortal and i want to learn about us you have a tale to tell you are ancient and deeply broken i feel love for you and cherish that it is what it is and nothing more what a strange thing to say love you shrugged your shoulders you looked up and then back at me for emphasis and it rained and it rained for millions of years and the volcanoes boiled and the oceans cooled and then there was love you shrugged to make a mock of the absurdity i couldnt help but laugh at your little gest too perfect i thought but i was suddenly so torn this is very unexpected i said because if i do have a story a very small story yes well my story if i have one is very much to the point its linked to the very points youve made suddenly something came over me i laughed again softly i understand you i said oh not that you can see spirits for that is a great subject unto itself but i see now the source of your strength you have lived an entire human life unlike marius unlike me you werent taken in your prime you were taken near the moment of your natural death and you will not settle for the adventures and faults of the earthbound you are determined to forge ahead with the courage of one who has died of old age and then finds himself risen from the grave youve kicked aside the funeral wreaths you are ready for mount olympus arent you or for osiris in the depths of the darkness you said or for the shades in hades certainly i am ready for the spirits for the vampires for those who see the future and claim to know past lives for you who have a stunning intellect encased beautifully to endure for so many years an intellect which has perhaps all but destroyed your heart i gasped forgive me that was not proper of me you said no explain your meaning you always take the hearts from the victims isnt it so you want the heart perhaps dont expect wisdom from me as it might come from marius or the ancient twins you draw me to you you said why because you do have a story inside you it lies articulate and waiting to be written behind your silence and your suffering you are too romantic friend i said you waited patiently i think you could feel the tumult in me the shivering of my soul in the face of so much new emotion its such a small story i said i saw images memories moments the stuff that can incite souls to action and creation i saw the very faintest possibility of faith i think you already knew the answer you knew what i would do when i did not you smiled discreetly but you were eager and waiting i looked at you and thought of trying to write it write it all out you want me to leave now dont you you said you rose collected your rainspattered coat and bent over gracefully to kiss my hand my hands were clutching the notebooks no i said i cant do it you made no immediate judgment come back in two nights i said i promise you will have your two notebooks for you even if they are completely empty or only contain a better explanation of why i cant retrieve my lost life i wont disappoint you but expect nothing except that i will come and i will put these books in your hands two nights you said and we meet here again in silence i watched you leave the cafe and now you see it has begun david and now you see david l have made our meeting the introduction to the story you asked me to tell pandoras story i was born in rome during the reign of augustus caesar in the year that you now reckon to have been bc or fifteen years before christ all the roman history and roman names i give here are accurate i have not falsified them or made up stories or created false political events everything bears upon my ultimate fate and the fate of marius nothing is included for love of the past i have omitted my family name i did this because my family has a history and i cannot bring myself to connect their ancient reputations deeds epitaphs to this tale also marius when he confided in lestat did not give the full name of his roman family and i respect this and that also is not revealed augustus had been emperor for over ten years and it was a marvelous time to be an educated woman in rome women had immense freedom and i had a rich senator for a father five prosperous brothers and grew up motherless but cherished by teams of greek tutors and nurses who gave me everything i wanted now if i really wanted to make this difficult for you david id write it in classical latin but i wont and i must tell you that unlike you i came by my education in english haphazardly and certainly i never learnt it from shakespeares plays indeed i have passed through many stages of the english language in my wanderings and in my reading but the great majority of my true acquaintance with it has been in this century and i am writing for you in colloquial english theres another reason for this which im sure youll understand if youve read the modern translation of petroniuss satyricon or juvenals satires very modern english is a really true equivalent to the latin of my time the formal letters of imperial rome wont tell you this but the graffiti scratched on the walls of pompeii will make it obvious we had a sophisticated tongue countless clever verbal shortcuts and common expressions im going to write therefore in the english which feels equivalent and natural to me let me say here quickly while the action is at a halt that i was never as marius said a greek courtesan i was living with such a pretense when marius gave me the dark gift and perhaps out of consideration for old mortal secrets he so described me or maybe it was contemptuous of him to style me this way i dont know but marius knew all about my roman family that it was a senatorial family as purely aristocratic and privileged as his own mortal family and that my people dated back to the time of romulus and remus the same as mariuss mortal line marius did not succumb to me because i had beautiful arms as he indicated to lestat this trivialization was perhaps provocative i dont hold anything against either of them marius or lestat i dont know who got what wrong my feeling for my father is so great to this very night as i sit in the cafe writing for you david that i am astonished at the power of writing of putting words to paper and bringing back so vividly to myself my fathers loving face my father was to meet a terrible end he did not deserve what happened to him but some of our kinsmen survived and reestablished our family in later times my father was rich one of the true millionaires of that age and his capital was invested widely he was a soldier more often than required of him a senator a thoughtful and quiet man by disposition and after the terrors of the civil war he was a great supporter of caesar augustus and very much in the emperors good graces of course he dreamed that the roman republic would come back we all did but augustus had brought unity and peace to the empire i met augustus many times in my youth and it was always at some crowded social function and of no consequence he looked like his portraits a lean man with a long thin nose short hair average face he was rather rational and pragmatic by nature and not invested with any abnormal cruelty he had no personal vanity the poor man was really blessed that he couldnt see into the future that he had no inkling of all the horrors and madness that would begin with tiberius his successor and go on for so long under other members of his family only in later times did i understand the full singularity and accomplishment of augustuss long reign was it fortyfour years of peace throughout the cities of the empire alas to be born during this time was to be born during a time of creativity and prosperity when rome was caput mundi or capital of the world and when i look back on it i realize what a powerful combination it was to have both tradition and vast sums of money to have old values and new power our family life was conservative strict even a little dusty and yet we had every luxury my father grew more quiet and conservative over the years he enjoyed his grandchildren who were born while he was still vigorous and active though he had fought principally in the northern campaigns along the rhine he had been stationed in syria for a while he had studied in athens he had served so much and so well that he was being allowed an early retirement in the years during which i grew up an early withdrawal from the social life that whirled around the imperial palace though i did not realize this at the time my five brothers came before me so there was no ritual roman mourning when i was born as you hear tell of in roman families when a girl comes into the world far from it five times my father had stood in the atrium the main enclosed courtyard or peristyle of our house with its pillars and stairs and grand marblework five times he had stood there before the assembled family and held in his hands a newborn son inspected it and then pronounced it perfect and fit to be reared as his own as was his prerogative now you know he had the power of life and death over his sons from that moment on if my father hadnt wanted these boys for any reason he would have exposed them to die of starvation it was against the law to steal such a child and make it a slave having five boys already my father was expected by some to get rid of me immediately who needs a girl but my father never exposed or rejected any of my mothers children and by the time i arrived im told he cried for joy thank the gods a little darling i heard the story ad nauseam from my brothers who every time i acted up did something unseemly frisky and wild said sneeringly thank the gods a little darling it became a charming goad my mother died when i was two and all i recall of her are gentleness and sweetness shed lost as many children as she had birthed and early death was typical enough her epitaph was beautifully written by my father and her memory honored throughout my life my father never took another woman into the house he slept with a few of the female slaves but this was nothing unusual my brothers did the same thing this was common in a roman household my father brought no new woman from another family to rule over me there is no grief in me for my mother because i was simply too young for it and if i cried when my mother did not come back i dont remember it what i remember is having the run of a big old rectangular palatial roman house with many rectangular rooms built onto the main rectangle one off another the whole nestled in a huge garden high on the palatine hill it was a house of marble floors and richly painted walls the garden meandering and surrounding every room of it i was the true jewel of my fathers eye and i remember having a marvelous time watching my brothers practice outside with their short broadswords or listening as their tutors instructed them and then having fine teachers of my own who taught me how to read the entire aeneid of virgil before i was five years old i loved words i love to sing them and speak them and even now i must admit i have fallen into the joy of writing them i couldnt have told you that nights ago david youve brought back something to me and i must make the admission and i must not write too fast in this mortal cafe lest human beings notice ah so we continue my father thought it was hysterical that i could recite verses from virgil at so young an age and he liked nothing better than to show me off at banquets at which he entertained his conservative and somewhat oldfashioned senatorial friends and sometimes caesar augustus himself caesar augustus was an agreeable man i dont think my father ever really wanted him at our house however but now and then i suppose the emperor had to be wined and dined id rush in with my nurse give a rousing recital and then be whisked away to where i could not see the proud senators of rome glutting themselves on peacock brains and garum surely you know what garum is its the horrible sauce the romans put on everything rather like todays ketchup definitely it defeated the purpose of having eels and squids on your plate or ostrich brains or unborn lamb or whatever other absurd delicacies were being brought by the platterful the point is as you know the romans seemed to have a special place in their hearts for genuine gluttony and the banquets inevitably became a disgrace the guests would go off to the vomitorium of the house to heave up the first five courses of the meal so that they could then swallow the others and i would lie upstairs giggling in my bed listening to all this laughter and vomiting then the rape of the entire catering staff of slaves would follow whether they were boys or girls or a mixture of both family meals were an entirely different affair then we were old romans everyone sat at the table my father was undisputed master of his house and would tolerate no criticism of caesar augustus who as you know was julius caesars nephew and did not really rule as emperor by law when the time is right he will step down said my father he knows he cant do it now he is more weary and wise than ever he was ambitious who wants another civil war the times were actually too prosperous for men of stature to make a revolt augustus kept the peace he had profound respect for the roman senate he rebuilt old temples because he thought people needed the piety they had known under the republic he gave free corn from egypt to the poor nobody starved in rome he maintained a dizzying amount of old festivals games and spectacles enough to sicken one actually but often as patriotic romans we had to be there of course there was great cruelty in the arena there were cruel executions there was the ever present cruelty of slavery but what is not understood by those today is that there coexisted with all this a sense of individual freedom on the part of even the poorest man the courts took time over their decisions they consulted the past laws they followed logic and code people could speak their minds fairly openly i note this because it is key to this story that marius and i both were born in a time when roman law was as marius would say based on reason as opposed to divine revelation we are totally unlike those blood drinkers brought to darkness in lands of magic and mystery not only did we trust augustus when we were alive we also believed in the tangible power of the roman senate we believed in public virtue and character we held to a way of life which did not involve rituals prayers magic except superficially virtue was embedded in character that was the inheritance of the roman republic which marius and i shared of course our house was overcrowded with slaves there were brilliant greeks and grunting laborers and a fleet of women to rush about polishing busts and vases and the city itself was choked with manumitted slaves freedmen some of whom were very rich they were all our people our slaves my father and i sat up all night when my old greek teacher was dying we held his hands until the body was cold nobody was flogged on our estate in rome unless my father himself gave the order our country slaves loafed under the fruit trees our stewards were rich and showed off their wealth in their clothes i remember a time when there were so many old greek slaves in the garden that i could sit day after day and listen to them argue they had nothing else to do i learned much from this i grew up more than happy if you think i exaggerate the extent of my education consult the letters of pliny or other actual memoirs and correspondence of the times highborn young girls were well educated modern roman women went about unhampered for the most part by male interference we partook of life as did men for example i was scarcely eight years old when i was first taken to the arena with several of my brothers wives to have the dubious pleasure of seeing exotic creatures such as giraffes tear madly around before being shot to death with arrows this display then followed by a small group of gladiators who would hack other gladiators to death and then after that came the flock of criminals to be fed to the hungry lions david i can hear the sound of those lions as if it were now theres nothing between me and the moment that i sat in the wooden benches perhaps two rows up the premium seats and i watched these beasts devour living beings as i was supposed to do with a pleasure meant to demonstrate a strength of heart a fearlessness in the face of death rather than simple and utter monstrousness the audience screamed and laughed as men and women ran from the beasts some victims would give the crowd no such satisfaction they merely stood there as the hungry lion attacked those who were being devoured alive almost invariably lay in a stupor as though their souls had already taken flight though the lion had not reached the throat i remember the smell of it but more than anything i remember the noise of the crowd i passed the test of character i could look at all of it i could watch the champion gladiator finally meet his end lying there bloody in the sand as the sword went through his chest but i can certainly remember my father declaring under his breath that the whole affair was disgusting in fact everybody i knew thought it was all disgusting my father believed as did others that the common man needed all this blood we the highborn had to preside over it for the common man it had a religious quality to it all this spectacular viciousness the making of these appalling spectacles was considered something of a social responsibility also roman life was a life of being outdoors involved in things attending ceremonies and spectacles being seen taking an interest coming together with others you came together with all the other highborn and lowborn of the city and you joined in one mass to witness a triumphant procession a great offering at the altar of augustus an ancient ceremony a game a chariot race now in the twentieth century when i watch the endless intrigue and slaughter in motion pictures and on television throughout our western world i wonder if people do not need it do not need to see murder slaughter death in all forms television at times seems an unbroken series of gladiatorial fights or massacres and look at the traffic now in video recordings of actual war records of war have become art and entertainment the narrator speaks softly as the camera passes over the heap of bodies or the skeletal children sobbing with their starving mothers but it is gripping one can wallow shaking ones head in all this death nights of television are devoted to old footage of men dying with guns in their hands i think we look because we are afraid but in rome you had to look so that you would be hard and that applied to women as well as men but the overall point is i was not closeted away as a greek woman might have been in some old hellenistic household i did not suer under the earlier customs of the roman republic i vividly remember the absolute beauty of that time and my fathers heartfelt avowal that augustus was a god and that rome had never been more pleasing to her deities now i want to give you one very important recollection let me set the scene first lets take up the question of virgil and the poem he wrote the aeneid greatly amplifying and glorifying the adventures of the hero aeneas a trojan fleeing the horrors of defeat by the greeks who came out of the famous trojan horse to massacre helens city of troy its a charming story i always loved it aeneas leaves dying troy valiantly journeys all the way to beautiful italy and there founds our nation but the point is that augustus loved and supported virgil all of virgils life and virgil was a respected poet a poet fine and decent to quote an approved and patriotic poet it was perfectly fine to like virgil virgil died before i was born but by ten id read everything hed written and had read horace as well and lucretius much of cicero and all the greek manuscripts we possessed and there were plenty my father didnt erect his library for show it was a place where members of the family spent hours it was also where he sat to write his letters which he seemed endlessly to be doing letters on behalf of the senate the emperor the courts his friends etc back to virgil i had also read another roman poet who was alive still and deeply and dangerously out of favor with augustus the god this was the poet ovid the author of the metamorphoses and dozens of other earthy hilarious and bawdy works now when i was too young to remember augustus turned on ovid whom augustus had also loved and augustus banished ovid to some horrible place on the black sea maybe it wasnt so horrible but it was the sort of place cultured city romans expect to be horrible very far away from the capital and full of barbarians ovid lived there a long time and his books were banned all over rome you couldnt find them in the bookshops or the public libraries or at the book stands all over the marketplace you know this was a hot time for popular reading books were everywhere both in scroll form and in codex that is with bound pages and many booksellers had teams of greek slaves spending all day copying books for public consumption to continue ovid had fallen out of favor with augustus and he had been banned but men like my father were not about to burn their copies of the metamorphoses or any other of ovids work and the only reason they didnt plead for ovids pardon was fear the whole scandal had something to do with augustuss daughter julia who was a notorious slut by anyones standards how ovid became involved in julias love affairs i dont know perhaps his sensuous early poetry the amores was considered to be a bad influence there was also a lot of reform in the air during the reign of augustus a lot of talk of old values i dont think anyone knows what really happened between caesar augustus and ovid but ovid was banished for the rest of his life from imperial rome but i had read the amores and the metamorphoses in wellworn copies by the time of this incident which i want to recount and many of my fathers friends were always worried about ovid now to the specific recollection i was ten years old i came in from playing covered with dust from head to foot my hair loose my dress torn and breezed into my fathers large receiving room and i plopped down at the foot of his couch to listen to what was being said as he lounged there with all appropriate roman dignity chatting with several other lounging men who had come to visit i knew all of the men but one and this one was fairhaired and blueeyed and very tall and he turned during the conversation which was all whispers and nods and winked at me this was marius with skin slightly tanned from his travels and a flashing beauty in his eyes he had three names like everyone else but again i will not disclose the name of his family but i knew it i knew he was sort of the bad boy in an intellectual way the poet and the loafer what nobody had told me was that he was beautiful now on this day this was marius when he was alive about fifteen years before he was to be made a vampire i can calculate that he was only twentyfive but im not certain to continue the men paid no attention to me and it became plain to my ever curious little mind that they were giving my father news of ovid that the tall blond one with the remarkable blue eyes the one called marius had just returned from the baltic coast and he had given my father several presents which were in fact good copies of ovids work both past and current the men assured my father that it was still far too dangerous to go crying to caesar augustus over ovid and my father accepted this but if im not mistaken he entrusted some money for ovid to marius the blond one when the gentlemen were all leaving i saw marius in the atrium got a measure of his full height which was quite unusual for a roman and let out a girlish gasp and then a streak of laughter he winked at me again marius had his hair short then dipped militaryromanstyle with a few modest curls on his forehead his hair was long when he was later made a vampire and he wears it long now but then it was the typical boring roman military cut but it was blond and full of sunlight in the atrium and he seemed the brightest and most impressive man id ever laid eyes upon he was full of kindness when he looked at me why are you so tall i asked him my father thought this was amusing of course and he did not care what anyone else thought of his dusty little daughter hanging onto his arms and speaking to his honored company my precious one marius said im tall because im a barbarian he laughed and was flirtatious when he laughed with a deference to me as a little lady which was rather rare suddenly he made his hands into claws and ran at me like a bear i loved him instantly no truly i said you cant be a barbarian i know your father and all your sisters they live just down the hill the family is always talking about you at the table saying only nice things of course of that im sure he said breaking into laughter i knew my father was getting anxious what i didnt know was that a tenyearold girl could be betrothed marius drew himself up and said in his gentle very fine voice trained for public rhetoric as well as words of love i am descended through my mother from the keltoi little beauty little muse i come from the tall blond people of the north the people of gaul my mother was a princess there or so i am told do you know who they are i said of course i knew and began to recite verbatim from julius caesars account of conquering gaul or the land of the keltoi all gaul is made up of three parts marius was quite genuinely impressed so was everybody so i went on and on the keltoi are separated from the aquitani by the river garonne and the tribe of the belgae by the rivers marne and seine my father being slightly embarrassed by this time with his daughter glorying in attention spoke up to gently assure everyone that i was his precious joy and i was let to run wild and please make nothing of it and i said being bold and a born troublemaker give my love to the great ovid because i too wish he would come home to rome i then rattled off several steamy lines of the amores she laughed and gave her best whole hearted kisses theyd shake the three pronged bolt from joves hand torture to think that fellow got such good ones i wish they hadnt been of the same brand all laughed except my father and marius went wild with delight clapping his hands that was all the encouragement i needed to rush at him now like a bear as he had rushed at me and to continue singing out ovids hot words whats more these kisses were better than id taught her she seemed possessed of knowledge that was new they pleased too well bad sign her tongue was in them and my tongue was kissing too my father grabbed me by the small of my upper arm and said thats it lydia wrap it up and the men laughed all the harder commiserating with him and embracing him and then laughing again but i had to have one final victory over this team of adults pray father i said let me finish with some wise and patriotic words which ovid said i congratulate myself on not having arrived into the world until the present time this age suits my taste this seemed to astonish marius more than to amuse him but my father gathered me close and said very dearly lydia ovid wouldnt say that now and now you for being such a a scholar and philosopher in one should assure your fathers dearest friends that you know full well ovid was banished from rome by augustus for good reason and that he can never return home in other words he was saying shut up about ovid but marius undeterred dropped on his knees before me lean and handsome with mesmeric blue eyes and he took my hand and kissed it and said i will give ovid your love little lydia but your father is right we must all agree with the emperors censure after all we are romans he then did the very strange thing of speaking to me purely as if i were an adult augustus caesar has given far more to rome i think than anyone ever hoped and he too is a poet he wrote a poem called ajax and burnt it up himself because he said it wasnt good i was having the time of my life i would have run off with marius then and there but all i could do was dance around him as he went out of the vestibule and out the gate i waved to him he lingered goodbye little lydia he said he then spoke under his breath to my father and i heard my father say you are out of your mind my father turned his back on marius who gave me a sad smile and disappeared what did he mean what happened i asked my father whats the matter listen lydia said my father have you in all your readings come across the word betrothed yes father of course well that sort of wanderer and dreamer likes nothing better than to betroth himself to a young girl of ten because it means she is not old enough to marry and he has years of freedom without the censure of the emperor they do it all the time no no father i said i shall never forget him i think i forgot him the next day i didnt see marius again for five years i remember because i was fifteen and should have been married and didnt want to be married at all i had wriggled out of it year after year feigning illness madness total uncontrollable fits but time was running out on me in fact id been eligible for marriage since i was twelve at this time we were all standing together at the foot of the palatine hill watching a most sacrosanct ceremony the lupercalia just one of so many festivals that were integral in roman life now the lupercalia was very important to us though theres no way to relate its significance to a christians concept of religion it was pious to enjoy such a festival to participate as a citizen and as a virtuous roman and besides it was a great pleasure so i was there not so far from the cave of the lupercal watching with other young women as the two chosen men of that year were smeared with blood from a sacrifice of goats and then draped in the bleeding skins of the sacrificed animals i couldnt see all of this very well but i had seen it many times and when years before two of my brothers had run in this festival i had pushed to the front to get a good look at it on this occasion i did have a fairly good view when each of the two young men took his own company and began his run around the base of the palatine hill i moved forward because i was supposed to do it the young men were hitting lightly on the arm of every young woman with a strip of goatskin which was supposed to purify us render us fertile i stepped forward and received the ceremonial blow and then stepped back again wishing i was a man and could run around the hill with the other men not an unusual thought for me at any time in my mortal life i had some sarcastic inner thoughts about being purified but by this age i behaved in public and would not on any account have humiliated my father or my brothers these strips of goatskin as you know david are called februa and february comes from that word so much for language and all the magic it unwittingly carries with it surely the lupercalia had something to do with romulus and remus perhaps it even echoed some ancient human sacrifice after all the young mens heads were smeared with goat blood it gives me shivers because in etruscan times long before i was born this might have been a far more cruel ceremony perhaps this was the occasion that marius saw my arms because i was exposing them to this ceremonial lash and was already as you can see much of a showoff in general laughing with the others as the company of men continued their run in the crowd i saw marius he looked at me then back to his book so strange i saw him standing against a tree trunk and writing no one did this stand against a tree hold a book in one hand and write with the other the slave stood beside him with a bottle of ink mariuss hair was long and most beautiful quite wild i said to my father look theres our barbarian friend marius the tall one and hes writing my father smiled and said marius is always writing marius is good for writing if for nothing else turn around lydia be still but he looked at me father i want to talk to him you will not lydia you will not grace him with one small smile on the way home i asked my father if youre going to marry me to someone if theres no way short of suicide that i can avoid this disgusting development why dont you marry me to marius i dont understand it im rich hes rich i know his mother was a wild keltoi princess but his father has adopted him my father said witheringly where have you learned all this he stopped in his tracks always an ominous sign the crowd broke and streamed around i dont know its common knowledge i turned there was marius hovering about glancing at me father i said please let me speak to him my father knelt down most of the crowd had gone on lydia i know this is dreadful for you i have caved to every objection you have raised to your suitors but believe you me the emperor himself would not approve of you marrying such a mad wandering historian as marius he has never served in the military he cannot enter the senate it is quite impossible when you marry you will marry well as we walked away i turned again thinking only to pick marius out from the others but to my surprise he was stark still looking at me with his flowing hair he much resembled the vampire lestat he is taller than lestat but he has the same lithe build the same very blue eyes and a muscular strength to him and a squareness of face which is almost pretty i pulled away from my father and ran up to him well i wanted to marry you i said but my father has said no ill never forget the expression on his face but before he could speak my father had gathered me up and gone into obliterating respectable conversation how now marius how goes it with your brother in the army and how is it with your history i hear you have written thirteen volumes my father backed up virtually carrying me away marius did not move or answer soon we were with others hurrying up the hill all the course of our lives was changed at that moment but there was no conceivable way marius or i could have known it twenty years would pass before we would meet again i was thirtyfive then i can say that we met in a realm of darkness in more respects than one for now let me fill up the gap i was married twice due to pressure from the imperial house augustus wanted us all to have children i had none my husbands seeded plenty however with slave girls so i was legally divorced and freed twice over and determined then to retire from social life just so the emperor tiberius who had come to the imperial throne at the age of fifty would not meddle with me for he was more a public puritan and domestic dictator than augustus if i kept to the house if i didnt go abroad to banquets and parties and hang around with the empress livia augustuss wife and mother of tiberius perhaps i wouldnt be pushed into becoming a stepmother id stay home i had to care for my father he deserved it even though he was perfectly healthy he was still old with all due respect for the husbands i have mentioned whose names are more than footnotes in common roman histories i was a wretched wife i had plenty of my own money from my father i listened to nothing and yielded to the act of love only on my own terms which i always obtained being gifted with enough beauty to make men really suffer i became a member of the cult of isis just to spite these husbands and get away from them so that i could hang around at the temple of isis where i spent an enormous amount of time with other interesting women some far more adventurous and unconventional than i dared to be i was attracted to whores i saw the brilliant loose women as having conquered a barrier which i the loving daughter of my father would never conquer i became a regular at the temple i was initiated at last in a secret ceremony and i walked in every procession of isis in rome my husbands loathed this maybe thats why after i came home to my father i gave up the worship whatever it was a good thing perhaps that i had but fortune could not be so easily shaped by any decision of mine now isis was an imported goddess from egypt of course and the old romans were as suspicious of her as they were of the terrible cybele the great other from the far east who led her male devotees to castrate themselves the whole city was filled with these eastern cults and the conservative population thought them dreadful these cults werent rational they were ecstatic or euphoric they offered a complete rebirth through understanding the typical conservative roman was far too practical for that if you didnt know by age five that the gods were madeup creatures and the myths invented stories then you were a fool but isis had a curious distinction something that set her far apart from the cruel cybele isis was a loving mother and goddess isis forgave her worshipers anything isis had come before all creation isis was patient and wise thats why the most degraded woman could pray at the temple thats why none were ever turned away like the blessed virgin mary who is so well known today throughout the east and west the queen isis had conceived her divine child by divine means from the dead and castrated osiris she had drawn the living seed by her own power and many a time she was pictured or sculpted holding her divine son horus on her knee her breast was bare in all innocence to feed the young god and osiris ruled in the land of the dead his phallus lost forever in the waters of the nile where an endless semen flowed from it fertilizing the remarkable fields of egypt every year when the river overflowed its banks the music of our temple was divine we used the sistrum a small rigid metal lyre of sorts and flutes and timbrels we danced and we sang together the poetry of isiss litanies was fine and rapturous isis was the queen of navigation much like the blessed virgin mary would be called later our lady star of the sea when her statue was carried to the shore each year the procession was so splendid that all rome turned out to see the egyptian gods with their animal heads the huge abundance of flowers and the statue of the queen mother herself the air rang with hymns her priests and priestesses walked in white linen robes she herself made of marble and carried high holding her sacred sistrum dressed regally in a grecian gown with grecian hair that was my isis i fell away from her after my last divorce my father didnt like the worship and i myself had enjoyed it long enough as a free woman i wasnt infatuated with prostitutes i had it infinitely better i kept my fathers house and he was just old enough in spite of his black hair and his remarkably sharp vision that the emperor left me alone i cant say i remembered or thought of marius no one had mentioned marius for years he had disappeared out of my mind after the lupercalia there was no force on earth that could come between me and my father my brothers all had good luck they married well had children and came home from the hard wars in which they fought keeping the boundaries of the empire my youngest brother lucius i did not like much but he was always a little anxious and given to drinking and apparently also to gambling which very much annoyed his wife she i loved as i did all my sistersinlaw and my nieces and nephews i loved it when they descended upon the house these flocks of children squealing and running rampant with aunt lydias blessing as they were never allowed to do at home the eldest of my brothers antony was in potential a great man fate robbed him of greatness but he had been most ready for it well schooled trained and most wise the only foolish thing i ever knew antony to do was say to me very distinctly once that livia augustuss wife had poisoned him so that her son tiberius would rise my father the only other occupant of the room told him sternly antony never speak of that again not here not anywhere my father stood up and without planning it put in perspective the style of life which he and i lived stay away from the imperial palace stay away from the imperial families be in the front ranks of the games and always in the senate but dont get into their quarrels and their intrigues antony was very angry but the anger had nothing to do with my father i said it only to those two to whom i can say it you and lydia i detest eating dinner with a woman who poisoned her husband augustus should have reestablished the republic he knew when death was coming yes and he knew that he could not restore the republic it was simply impossible the empire had grown to britannia in the north beyond parthia in the east it covers northern africa if you want to be a good roman antony then stand up and speak your conscience in the senate tiberius invites this oh father you are much deceived said antony my father put an end to this argument but he and i did live exactly the life he had described tiberius was immediately unpopular with the noisy roman crowds he was too old too dry too humorless too puritanical and tyrannical at the same time but he had one saving grace other than his extensive love and knowledge of philosophy he had been a very good soldier and that was the most important characteristic the emperor had to possess the troops honored him he strengthened the praetorian guard around the palace hired a man named sejanus to run things for him but he didnt bring legions into rome and he spoke a damned good line about personal rights and freedom that is if you could stay awake to listen i thought him a brooder the senate went mad with impatience when he refused to make decisions they didnt want to make the decisions but all this seemed relatively safe then a horrible incident occurred which made me positively detest the emperor wholeheartedly and lose all my faith in the man and his ability to govern this incident involved the temple of isis some clever evil man claiming to be the egyptian god anubis had enticed a highborn devotee of isis to the temple and gone to bed with her fooling her completely though how on earth he did it i cant imagine i remember her to this day as the stupidest woman in rome but theres probably more to it anyway it had all happened at the temple and then this man this fake anubis went before the highborn virtuous woman and told her in the plainest terms that he had had her she went screaming to her husband it was a scandal of extraordinary flair it had been years since i had been at the temple and i was glad of it but what followed from the emperor was more dreadful than i ever dreamed the entire temple was razed to the very ground all the worshipers were banished from rome and some of them executed and our priests and priestesses were crucified their bodies hung on the tree as the old roman expression goes to die slowly and to rot for all to see my father came into my bedroom he went to the small shrine of isis he took the statue and smashed it on the marble floor then he picked up the larger pieces and smashed each of them he made dust of her i nodded i expected him to condemn me for my old habits i was overcome with sadness and shock at what had happened other eastern cults were being persecuted the emperor was moving to take away the right of sanctuary from various temples throughout the empire the man doesnt want to be emperor of rome said my father hes been bent by cruelty and losses hes stiff boring and completely in terror for his life a man who would not be emperor cannot be emperor not now maybe hell step down i said sadly he has adopted the young general germanicus julius caesar this means germanicus is to be his heir does it not what good did it do to the earlier heirs of augustus when they were adopted my father asked what do you mean i asked use your head said my father we cannot continue pretending we are a republic we must define the office of this emperor and the limits of his power we must outline a form of succession other than murder i tried to calm him father lets leave rome lets go to our house in tuscany its always beautiful there father thats just it we cant lydia he said i have to remain here i have to be loyal to my emperor i must do so for all my family i must stand in the senate within months tiberius sent off his young and handsome nephew germanicus julius caesar to the east just to get him away from the adulation of the roman public as i said people spoke their minds germanicus was supposed to be tiberiuss heir but tiberius was too jealous to listen to the crowds screaming praise of germanicus for his victories in battle he wanted the man far from rome and so this rather charming and seductive young general went to the east to syria he vanished from the loving eyes of the roman people from the core of the empire where a city crowd could determine the fate of the world sooner or later there would be another campaign in the north we all figured germanicus had hit hard at the german tribes in his last campaign my brothers vividly described it to me over the dinner table they told how they had gone back to avenge the hideous massacre of general varus and his troops in the teutoburg forest they could finish the job if called up again and my brothers would go they were exactly the kind of oldfashioned patricians who would go meantime there were rumors that the delatores the notorious spies of the praetorian guard pocketed onethird of the estate of those against whom they informed i found it horrible my father shook his head and said that started under augustus yes father i said but then treason was considered a matter of what one did not what one said which is all the more reason to say nothing he sat back wearily lydia sing to me get your lyre make up one of your comic epics its been a long time im too old for that i said thinking of the silly bawdy satires on homer which i used to make up so quickly and freely that everyone marveled but i jumped at that idea i remember that night so palpably that i cannot tear myself loose now from the writing of this story even though i know what pain i must confess and explore what does it mean to write david youll see this question repeated because with each page i understand more and more i see the patterns that have before eluded me and driven me to dream rather than live that night i did make a very funny epic my father laughed he fell asleep on his couch and then as if from a trance state he spoke lydia dont live out your life alone on account of me marry for love you must not give up by the time i turned around he was breathing deeply again two weeks later or maybe it was a month our life came abruptly to an end i came home one day found the house completely empty except for two terrified old slave men men who actually belonged to the household of my brother antony who let me in and bolted the door ferociously i walked through the huge vestibule and then into the peristyle and into the dining room i beheld an amazing sight my father was in full battle dress armed with sword and dagger lacking only his shield he even wore his red cloak his breastplate was polished and gleaming he stared at the floor and with reason it had been dug up the old hearth from generations ago had been dug up this had been the first room of this house in the very ancient days of rome and it was around this hearth that the family gathered worshiped dined i had never even seen it we had our household shrines but this this giant circle of burnt stones there were actually ashes there uncovered how ominous and sacred it appeared what in the name of the gods is going on i asked where is everybody they are gone he said i have freed the slaves sent them packing ive been waiting for you you have to leave here now not without you you will not disobey me lydia i had never seen such an imploring yet dignified expression in his face theres a wagon out back ready to take you to the coast and a jewish merchant who is my most trusted friend who will take you by ship out of italy i want you to go your moneys been loaded on board the ship your clothing everything these are men i trust nevertheless take this dagger he picked up a dagger from the nearby table and gave it to me youve watched your brothers enough to know how to use it he said and this he reached for a sack this is gold the currency that all the world accepts take it and go i always carried a dagger and it was in the sling on my forearm but i could not shock him with this just now so i put the dagger in my girdle and took the purse father im not afraid to stand by you whos turned on us father you are senator of rome accused of any crime you are entitled to a trial before the senate oh my precious quickwitted daughter you think that evil sejanus and his delatores bring charges out in the open his speculatores have already surprised your brothers and their wives and children these are antonys slaves he sent them to warn me as he fought as he died he saw his son dashed against the wall lydia go of course i knew this was a roman custom to murder the entire family to wipe out the spouse and offspring of the condemned it was even the law and in matters such as this when word got out that the emperor had turned his back on a man any of his enemies could precede the assassins you come with me i said why do you stay here i will die a roman in my house he said now go if you love me my poet my singer my thinker my lydia go i will not be disobeyed i have spent the last hour of my life arranging for your salvation kiss me and obey me i ran to him kissed him on the lips and at once the slaves led me through the garden i knew my father i could not revolt against him in this final wish i knew that in oldfashioned roman style he would probably take his life before the speculatores broke down the front door when i reached the gate when i saw the hebrew merchants and their wagon i couldnt go this is what i saw my father had cut both his wrists and was walking around the household hearth in a circle letting the blood flow right down onto the floor he had really given his wrists the slash he was turning white as he walked in his eyes there was an expression i would only come to understand later there came a loud crash the front door was being bashed in my father stopped quite still and two of the praetorian guard came at him one making sneering remarks why dont you finish yourself off maximus and save us the trouble go on are you proud of yourselves my father said cowards you like killing whole families how much money do you get did you ever fight in a true battle come on die with me turning his back on them he whipped around with sword and dagger and brought down both of them as they came at him with unanticipated thrusts he stabbed them repeatedly my father wobbled as if he would faint he was white the blood flowed and flowed from his wrists his eyes rolled up into his head mad schemes came to me we must get him into the wagon but a roman like my father would never have cooperated suddenly the hebrews one young and one elderly had me by the arms and were carrying me out of the house i vowed i would save you said the old man and you will not make a liar of me to my old friend let go of me i whispered i will see him through it throwing them off in their polite timidity i turned and saw from a great distance my fathers body by the hearth he had finished himself with his own dagger i was thrown into the wagon my eyes dosed my hands over my mouth i fell among soft pillows bolts of fabric tumbling as the wagon began to roll very slowly down the winding road of the palatine hill soldiers shouted at us to get the hell out of the way the elderly hebrew said i am nearly deaf sir what did you say it worked perfectly they rode past us the hebrew knew exactly what he was doing as crowds rushed past us he kept to his slow pace the one young one came into the back of the wagon my name is jacob he said here put on all these white mantles you look now like an eastern woman if questioned at the gate hold up your veil and pretend you do not understand we went through the gates of rome with amazing ease it was hail david and jacob has it been a good trip i was helped aboard a large merchant vessel with galley slaves and sails nothing unusual at all and then into a small barren wooden room this is all we have for you said jacob but we are sailing now he had long wavy brown hair and a beard he wore striped robes to the ground in the dark i asked sailing in the dark this was not usual but as we moved out as the oars began to dip and the ship found its proper distance and began to move south i saw what we were doing all the beautiful southwestern coast of italy was well lighted by her hundreds and hundreds of palatial villas lighthouses stood on the rocks we will never see the republic again said jacob wearily as though he were a roman citizen which i think in fact he was but your fathers last wish is fulfilled we are safe now the old man stepped up to me he told me that his name was david the old man apologized profusely that there were no female attendants for me i was the only woman on board oh please banish any such thoughts from your mind why have you taken these risks for years we have done business with your father said david years ago when pirates sank our ships your father carried the debt he trusted us again and we repaid him fivefold he has laid up riches for you they are all stowed among cargo we carried as if they were nothing i went into the cabin and collapsed on the small bed the old man averting his eyes brought a cover for me slowly i realized something i had fully expected them to betray me i had no words i had no gestures or sentiments inside me i turned my head to the wall sleep lady he said a nightmare came to me a dream such as i have never had in my life i was near a river i wanted to drink blood i waited in high grass to catch one of the villagers and when i had this poor man i took him by his shoulders and i sank two fang teeth into his neck my mouth filled with delicious blood it was too sweet and too potent to be described and even in the dream i knew it but i had to move on the man was nearly dead i let him fall others who were more dangerous were after me and there was another terrible threat to my life i came to the ruins of a temple far from the marsh here it was desert just with the snap of the fingers from wetland to sand i was afraid morning was coming i had to hide besides i was also being hunted i digested this delicious blood and i entered the temple no place to hide i lay my whole body on the cold walls they were graven with pictures but there was no small room no hiding place for me i had to make it to the hills before sunrise but that wasnt possible i was moving right towards the sun suddenly there came above the hills a great fatal light my eyes hurt unbearably they were on fire my eyes i cried and reached to cover them fire covered me i screamed amon ra i curse you i cried another name i knew it meant isis but it was not that name it was another title for her that flew from my lips i woke up i sat bolt upright shivering the dream had been as sharply defined as a vision it had a deep resonance in me of memory had i lived before i went out on the deck of the ship all was well enough we could see the coastline dearly still and the lighthouses and the ship moved on i stared at the sea and i wanted blood this is not possible this is some evil omen some twisted grief i said i felt the fire i could not shut out the taste of the blood how natural it had seemed how good how perfect for my thirst i saw the twisted body of the villager again in the marshes this was a horror it was no escape from what i had just witnessed i was incensed and feverish jacob the tall young one came to me he had with him a young roman the young man had shaved his first beard but otherwise he seemed a flushed and glistening child i wondered wearily if i were so old at thirtyfive that everyone young looked beautiful to me he cried my family too has been betrayed my mother made me leave to whom do we owe this shared catastrophe i asked i put my hands on his wet cheeks he had a babys mouth but the shaven beard was rough he had broad strong shoulders and wore only a light simple tunic why wasnt he cold out here on the water perhaps he was he shook his head he was pretty still and would be handsome later he had a nice curl to his dark hair he didnt fear his tears or apologize for them my mother stayed alive to tell me she lay gasping until i came when the delatores had told my father that he plotted against the emperor my father had laughed he had actually laughed they had accused him of plotting with germanicus my mother wouldnt die until shed told me she said that all my father was accused of doing was talking with other men about how he would serve under germanicus again if they were sent north i nodded wearily i see my brothers probably said the same thing and germanicus is the emperors heir and imperium maius of the east yet this is treason to speak of serving rome under a pretty general i turned to go to understand gave no consolation we are taking you to different cities said jacob to different friends better that we not say dont leave me said the boy not tonight all right i said i took him into the cabin and closed the door with a polite nod to jacob who was watching all with a guardians conscience what do you want i asked the boy stared at me he shook his head he flung his hands out he turned and drew dose to me and kissed me we went into a rampage of kisses i took off my shift and sank into the bed with him he was a man all right tender face or no and when i came to the moment of ecstasy which was quite easy given his phenomenal stamina i tasted blood i was the blood drinker in the dream i went limp but it didnt matter he had all he needed to finish the rites to his satisfaction he rose up youre a goddess he said no i whispered the dream was rising i heard the wind on the sand i smelled the river i am a god a god who drinks blood we did the rites of love until we could do them no more be circumspect and very proper with our hebrew hosts i said they will never understand this sort of thing he nodded i adore you not necessary what is your name marcellus fine marcellus go to sleep marcellus and i made a night of every night after that until we finally saw the famous lighthouse of pharos and knew we had come to egypt it was perfectly obvious that marcellus was being left in alexandria he explained to me that his maternal grandmother was still alive a greek and indeed her whole dan dont tell me so much just go i said and be wise and safe he begged me to come with him he said he had fallen in love with me he would marry me he didnt care if i bore no children he didnt care that i was thirtyfive i laughed softly mercifully jacob noted all this with lowered eyes and david looked away quite a few trunks followed marcellus into alexandria now i said to jacob will you tell me where im being taken i might have some thoughts on the matter though i doubt i could improve on my fathers plan i still wondered would they deal honestly with me what about now that they had seen me play the whore with the boy they were such religious men youre headed to a great city jacob said it couldnt be a better place your father has greek friends there how could it be better than alexandria i said oh it is far and away better jacob said let me talk to my father before i talk to you further we had put out to sea the land was going away egypt it was growing dark dont be afraid jacob said you look as though you are terrified im not afraid i said its only that i have to lie in my bed and think and remember and dream i looked at him as he shyly looked away i held the boy like a mother against me night after night this was about the biggest lie ive told in my life he was a child in my arms some child and now i fear nightmares you must tell me what is our destination what is our fate antioch said jacob antioch on the orontes greek friends of your father await you and they are friends with germanicus perhaps in time but they will be loyal to you you are to be married to a greek of breeding and means married to a greek a provincial greek a greek in asia i stifled my laughter and my tears that was not going to happen to me poor man if he really was a provincial greek he was going to have to experience the conquest of rome all over again we sailed on from port to port i mulled all this over it was nauseating trivia like this which of course protected me from my full and inevitable grief and shock over what happened worry about whether your dress is properly girdled dont see your father lying dead with his own dagger in his chest as for antioch i had been far too embroiled in the life of rome to know or hear much about this city if tiberius had stationed his heir germanicus there to get him away from roman popularity then i thought antioch must be the end of the civilized world why in the name of the gods had i not run away in alexandria i thought alexandria was the greatest city in the empire next to rome it was a young city built by alexander for whom it was named but it was a marvelous port no one would ever dare raze the temple of isis in alexandria isis was an egyptian goddess wife of the powerful osiris but what had that to do with things i must have been plotting in the back of my mind already but i didnt allow any conscious plot to surface and blemish my highborn roman moral character i quietly thanked my hebrew guardians for this intelligence for keeping it even from the young roman marcellus the other man they had rescued from the emperors assassins and i asked for frank answers to my questions regarding my brothers all taken by surprise said jacob the delatores those spies of the praetorian guard are so swift and your father had so many sons it was your eldest brothers slaves who jumped the wall at their masters command and ran to warn your father antony i hope you shed their blood i know you fought with your last breath and my niece my little niece flora had she run screaming from them or did they do it with mercy the praetorian guard doing anything with mercy stupid to even think so i didnt say anything aloud just sighed after all when they looked at me these two jewish merchants beheld the body and face of a woman naturally my protectors should think a woman was inside of me the disparity between outward appearances and inner disposition had disturbed me all my life why disturb jacob and david on to antioch but i had no intention of living in any oldfashioned greek family if such still existed in the greek city of antioch a family in which women lived apart from the men and wove wool all day never going out having no part in the life of the world whatsoever id been taught all the virtuous female arts by my nurses and i could indeed do anything with yarn or thread or loom that any other woman could do but i knew well what the old greek ways had been and i remembered vaguely my fathers mother who had died when i was very young a virtuous roman matron who was always making wool so they had said of her in her epitaph and in fact they had said in my mothers epitaph she kept the house she made wool and so they had said of my mother the very same tiresome words well no one was going to say that on mine what i failed to realize in my overall dejection was that the roman world was enormous and the eastern portion of it differed dramatically from the northern barbarian lands where my brothers had fought the entire of asia minor towards which we sailed had been conquered by alexander of macedon hundreds of years before as you know alexander had been the pupil of aristotle alexander had wanted to spread greek culture everywhere and in asia minor greek ideas and styles found not mere country towns or farmers but ancient cultures like the empire of syria willing to receive the new ideas the grace and beauty of the greek enlightenment and willing to bring in tune with it their own centuriesold literature religion styles of life and dress antioch had been built by a general of alexander the great who sought to rival the beauty of other hellenistic cities with splendid temples administrative buildings and libraries of books in the greek language its schools where greek philosophy was taught a hellenistic government was established quite enlightened compared to ancient eastern despotism and yet there lay beneath all this the knowledge and customs and possibly the wisdom of the mysterious east the romans had conquered antioch early on because it was a huge trade center it was unique in this way as jacob showed to me drawing a crude map with his wet finger on the wooden table antioch was a port of the great mediterranean because she was only twenty miles up the orontes river yet on the eastern side she was open to the desert all the old caravan routes came to antioch the camel merchants who brought fantastic wares from fabled lands lands we know now to have been india and china silk carpet and jewels which never reached the markets of rome countless other traders came and went to antioch fine roads connected it in the east with the euphrates river and the parthian empire beyond and to the south you could go to damascus and judea and to the north of course lay all the cities made by alexander which had flowered under roman rule roman soldiers loved it there it was an easy and interesting life and antioch loved the romans because the romans protected the trade routes and the caravans and kept peace in the port you will find open places arcades temples all that you seek and such markets you would not believe there are romans everywhere i hope to one most high that you are not recognized by someone from your own background that is one danger of which your father had no time to plan i waved it away does it have teachers now and markets of books from everywhere you will find books which no one can read and greek is spoken by everyone you have to go out in the country to find some poor farmer who does not understand greek latin has now become common the philosophers never stop they speak of plato and pythagoras names that dont mean much to me they talk about chaldean magic from babylon of course there are temples to every imaginable god he went on reflecting as he spoke the hebrews i think personally they are too worldly they want to hang around in short tunics with the greeks and go to the public baths they are too interested in the greek philosophy it invades everything all this thinking that greeks did not good but a greek city is an inviting world he glanced up his father was watching over us and we were too dose together at this table on the deck he hastily filled me in on other facts germanicus julius caesar heir to the imperial throne the official adopted son of tiberius had been granted the imperium maius in antioch that is he controlled all of this territory and gnaeus calpurnius piso was the governor of syria i assured him that they would know nothing of me or my oldfashioned family or our quiet old house on the palatine hill squeezed between so many other extravagant new mansions its all romanstyle jacob protested youll see and you come with money and forgive me but you are still beautiful at your age you have fresh skin and you move your limbs like a girl i sighed and gave jacob thanks time for him to break away unless we wanted his father coming down upon us i watched the ever rolling blue waves i was thankful in secret that our family had withdrawn from the parties and banquets at the imperial palace but then i blamed myself for such thankfulness knowing that our reclusiveness must have paved the way for our downfall id seen germanicus on his triumphal procession through rome a gorgeous young man much as alexander had been and i knew from my father and my brothers that tiberius fearing the popularity of his appointed heir had sent him off to the east to get him away from the roman crowds the governor piso i had never laid eyes on him the gossip was that he was sent east to devil germanicus oh such a waste of talent and thought jacob returned to me well you go nameless and unknown into this vast city said jacob and you have protectors of high character who are beloved of germanicus hes young and sets a tone of vitality and gaiety in the city and piso i asked everyone hates him especially the soldiers and you know what that means in a roman province you can look at the crashing undulating sea from the railing of a deck forever or just for so long that night i had my second blood dream it was keenly similar to the first i was thirsty for blood and enemies were after me enemies that knew i was a demon and must be destroyed i was running my own kind had forsaken me thrust me out unprotected to the superstitions of the people then i saw the desert and knew i would die i awoke sitting up and crying out but covering my mouth quickly so no one heard it what disturbed me so terribly was the thirst for blood i could not imagine such a thing when i was awake but in these dreams i was the monster that romans called the lamia or so it seemed blood was sweet blood was all was the old greek pythagoras right souls do migrate from body to body but my soul in this past life had been that of a monster during the day i dosed my eyes now and then and found myself dangerously on the edge of the dream as if it were a trap in my mind waiting to engulf my consciousness but at night that is when they came most strongly you have served me before what could this mean come to me blood thirst i closed my eyes curled up in bed and prayed mother isis cleanse my mind of this blood madness then i resorted to plain old ordinary eroticism get jacob into bed no such luck little did i know that hebrews had been and would be forever the most difficult of men to seduce it was all made dear with great grace and tact i considered all the slaves out of the question first off were the galley slaves among whom no great ben hur was chained waiting for me to rescue him they were just the dregs of the criminal poor fastened romanstyle so they would drown if the ship went down and they were dying as all galley slaves do from the monotony and the whip it wasnt a pleasant sight to go down into the hold of a galley ship and see those men bending their backs but my eyes were as cold as those of an american watching color television pictures of the starving babies of africa little black skeletons with big heads screaming for water news break commercial break sound bite cnn now switches to palestine rock throwing rubber bullets television blood the rest on board were boring sailors and two old pious merchant hebrews who stared at me as if i were a whore or worse and turned their heads whenever i came out on deck in my long tunic with my long hair swinging free such a disgrace i must have seemed but what a fool i was then really living in numbness and how pleasant that voyage all because true grief and rage had not yet taken hold of me things had happened too fast i gloated over my last glimpse of my father dispatching those soldiers of tiberius those cheap assassins sent by a cowardly indecisive emperor and the rest i banished it from my mind affecting the attitude of the hardened roman man or woman a modern irish poet yeats best characterizes the official roman attitude towards failure and tragedy cast a cold eye on life on death horseman pass by there was never a roman born who would not have agreed with that that was my stance sole survivor of a great house commanded by her father to live i didnt dare to dwell on the fate of my brothers their lovely wives their little children i couldnt envision the slaughter of the children little boys being run through by broadswords or babies bashed against the wall oh rome you and your bloody old wisdom be sure to kill the offspring kill the whole family lying alone at night i found myself amid more horrid blood dreams they seemed fragments of a lost life a lost land deep echoing vibrant tones of music dominated the dreams as though someone were striking a gong and others beside him beat solemnly on deep drums with soft coverings i saw in a haze a world of stiff and flat alien paintings on the walls painted eyes around me i drank blood i drank it from a small shuddering human being who knelt before me as if i were mother isis i woke to take the big jug of water by my bed and drink all of it down i drank water to defy and satisfy this dream thirst i was almost sick from drinking water i racked my mind had i ever had such dreams as a child no and now these dreams had the heat of recollection of initiation into the doomed temple of isis when it had been still the fashion i had been intoxicated and drenched in the blood of a bull and dancing wildly in circles my head was filled with the litanies of isis we were promised rebirth never tell never tell never tell how could an initiate tell anything of the rites when you were so drunk you could hardly remember them isis brought me memories now of lovely music of lyres flutes timbrels of the high magical sound of the metal strings of the sistrum which the mother herself held in her hand there were only fleeting recollections of that naked blood dance that night of rising into the stars of seeing the scope of life in its cycles of accepting perfectly just for a little while that the moon would always be changing and the sun would set as it always rose embraces of other women soft cheeks and kissing and bodies rocking in unison life death rebirth its no series of miracles said the priestess to understand it and accept it that is the miracle make the miracle within your own breast surely we had not drunk blood and the bull it was a sacrifice only for the initiation we did not bring helpless animals to her flowerladen altars no our blessed mother did not ask that of us now at sea alone i lay awake to avoid these blood dreams when exhaustion won out a dream came with sleep as if it had been waiting for my eyes to close i lay in a gold chamber i was drinking blood blood from the throat of a god or so it seemed and choruses were singing or chanting it was a dull repetitive sound not quite worthy of being called music and when i had had my fill of blood this god or whoever this was this silkenskinned proud thing lifted me and placed me on an altar vividly i could feel the cold marble beneath me i realized i wore no clothes i felt no modesty somewhere far off echoing through these great halls came the weeping of a woman i was full of blood those who chanted approached with little clay oil lamps faces around me were dark dark enough to be from far faraway ethiopia or india or egypt look painted eyes i looked at my hands and arms they were dark but i was this person who lay on the altar and i say person now because it had come clear to me with no disturbance during the dream itself that i was a man lying there pain tore at me the god said this is merely the passage you will now drink from each of us only a little blood only when i woke did the brief transition in the masculine gender leave me as puzzled as everything else i was drenched with a sense of egyptian art egyptian mystery as id seen it in golden statues for sale in the marketplace or when the egyptian dancers performed at a banquet like walking sculptures with their blacklined eyes and black plaited wigs whispering in that mysterious tongue what had they thought of our isis in roman dress a mystery taunted me something attacked my reason the very thing the roman emperors had so feared in egyptian cults and oriental cults swept over me mystery and emotion which claim a superiority to reason and law my isis had been a roman goddess really a universal goddess the mother of us all her worship spreading out in a greek and roman world long before it had come into rome itself our priests were greeks and roman poor men we the congregation were all greeks and romans something scratched at the back of my mind it said remember it was a tiny desperate voice within my own brain that urged me to remember for my own sake but remembering only led to confused and jumbled thoughts suddenly a veil would fall between the reality of my cabin on the ship and the tumbling of the sea between that and some dim and frightening world of temples covered in words that made magic long narrow beautifully bronzed faces a voice whispered beware the priests of ra they lie i shivered i closed my eyes the queen mother was bound and chained to her throne she wept it had been her crying unspeakable but you see she has forgotten how to rule do as we say i shook myself awake i wanted to know and i did not want to know the queen wept beneath her monstrous fetters i couldnt see her clearly it was all in progress it was busy the king is with osiris you see you see how he stares each one whose blood you drink you give to osiris each one becomes osiris but why did the queen scream no this was madness i couldnt let this confusion overcome me i couldnt deliberately slip from reason into these fantasies or recollections supposing they had a true root they had to be nonsense twisted images of grief and guilt guilt that i had not rushed to the hearth and driven the dagger into my breast i tried to remember the calming voice of my father explaining once how the blood of the gladiators satisfied the thirst of the dead the manes now some say that the dead drink blood spoke my father from some long ago dinner talk thats why we are so fearful on all these unlucky days when the dead are supposed to be able to walk the earth i personally think this is nonsense we should revere our ancestors where are the dead father my brother lucius asked who had piped up from the other side of the table to quote lucretius in a sad little female voice that nevertheless commanded silence of all these men lydia of earth return to earth but any part sent down from heaven must ascend again recalled to the high temples of the sky and death does not destroy the elements of matter only breaks the combinations no my father had replied to me quite gently rather quote ovid the ghosts ask for but little they value piety more than a costly gift he drank his wine the ghosts are in the underworld where they cant harm us my eldest brother antony had said the dead are nowhere and are nothing my father had raised his cup to rome he said and it was he this time who had quoted lucretius too many times religion mothers crimes and wickedness shrugs and sighs all around the roman attitude even the priests and priestesses of isis would have joined lucretius when he wrote our terrors and our darknesses of mind mast be dispelled then not by sunshines rays not by those shining arrows of light but by insight into nature and a scheme of systematic contemplation drunk drugged bulls blood systematic well it all came down to the same thing know twist the poetry as you will and the phallus of osiris lives forever in the nile and the water of the nile inseminates the mother egypt eternally death giving birth to life with the blessing of mother isis merely a particular scheme and a sort of systematic form of contemplation the ship sailed on i languished some eight more days in this torment often lying awake in the dark and sleeping only in the day to avoid the dreams suddenly in the early morning jacob pounded my door we were midway up the orontes to the city twenty miles now from antioch i did up my hair as best i could into a chignon on the back of my head then covered my roman gowns with a great black cloak and prepared to disembark an eastern woman her face draped protected by hebrews when the city came into view when the immense harbor greeted us and then embraced us with all its masts and racket and odors and cries i ran to the deck of the ship and looked out at this city it was splendid you see jacob said taken from the ship by litter i found myself carried rapidly through vast waterfront markets and then into a great open square crowded with people i saw everywhere the temples porticoes booksellers even the high walls of an amphitheater all that i could have expected in rome no this was no town the young men were crowded about the barbershops ready to have their obligatory shave and the inevitable fancy curls on their foreheads which tiberius with his own hairstyle had made fashionable there were wine shops all over the slave markets were jammed i glimpsed the entrances to the streets devoted to crafts the street of the tentmakers the street of the silversmiths and there in all its glory in the very center of antioch stood the temple of isis my goddess isis with her worshipers coming and going undisturbed and in huge numbers a few very properlooking linenclad priests stood at the doors the temple was aswarm i thought i can run away from any husband in this place gradually i realized a great commotion had come upon the forum the center of the city i heard jacob ordering the men to hurry out of the broad market street and into the back streets my bearers were running the curtains were brought shut by jacobs hand so i couldnt see out news was being shouted out in latin in greek in chaldean murder murder poison treachery i peeped out of the curtain people were weeping and cursing the roman gnaeus calpurnius piso cursing him and his wife placina why i didnt much like either one of them but what was all this jacob shouted again at my bearer to hurry we were rushed through the gates and into the vestibule of a sizable house no different in design or color than my own in rome only much smaller i could see the same refinements the distant peristyle clusters of weeping slaves the litter was promptly set down and i stepped out deeply concerned that they had not stopped me at the doors to wash my feet as was proper and my hair it had all fallen down in waves but no one noticed me i turned round and round amazed at the oriental curtains and tassels that hung over the doorways the caged birds everywhere singing in their little prisons the woven carpets lying all over the floor one heaped upon another two obvious ladies of the house came towards me whats the matter i asked they were as fashionable as any rich woman in rome drenched in bracelets and wearing goldtrimmed gowns i implore you said one of the women for your own sake go get back into the litter they tried to push me inside the curtained cell of the litter i wouldnt go i became furious i dont know where i am i said and i dont know who you are now stop pushing me the master of the house or someone who certainly appeared to be such came dashing towards me with tears streaming down his cheeks and his short tousled gray hair a mess torn as if in mourning hed ripped his long tunic hed smeared dirt on his face he was old with a bent back and a massive head loaded with skin and wrinkles your father was my young colleague he said to me in latin he grabbed me by the arms i dined in your house when you were a baby i saw you when you crawled on all fours tender i said quickly your father and i studied in athens slept under the same roof the women stood panicstricken with their hands over their mouths your father and i fought with tiberius on his first campaign we fought those lurid barbarians very brave i said my black outer cloak fell down revealing my unkempt wild long hair and plain dress nobody cared germanicus dined in this house because your father spoke of me oh dear i see i said one of the women motioned for me to get in the litter where was jacob the old man wouldnt let me go i stood with your father and with augustus when news came to us of the massacre of our troops in the teutoburg forest that general varus and all his men were slain my sons fought with your brothers in the legions of germanicus when he punished those northern tribes oh god yes very marvelous indeed i said gravely get back in the litter and get out said one of the women the old man clutched me we fought the madman king arminius said the old man we could have won your brother antony wasnt for giving up and coming back was he i no get her out of here screamed a young patrician man who had also been weeping he came forward and shoved me towards the litter stand back you imbecile i said to him i slapped his face all this while jacob had been talking to the slaves getting the scoop jacob appeared beside me as the grayhaired greek sobbed and kissed my cheeks jacob took over guiding me into the litter germanicus has just been murdered jacob said in my ear everybody loyal to him is convinced that the emperor tiberius put the roman governor piso up to the murder it was done with poison word is spreading through the city like fire tiberius you idiot i whispered rolling my eyes one cowardly step after another i sank back into the darkness the litter was being lifted jacob went right on gnaeus calpurnius piso has allies here naturally everybodys fighting everybody else settling scores mayhem this greek family traveled with germanicus to egypt there are riots already we go farewell friend i cried to the old greek as i was carried from the house but i dont think he heard me he had gone down on his knees he cursed tiberius he screamed of suicide and begged for the dagger we were outside once more hurrying through the street i lay askew in the litter thinking dully in the darkness germanicus dead poisoned by tiberius i knew that this recent trip of germanicus to egypt had made tiberius very angry egypt was like no other roman province rome was so dependent upon it for grain that senators could not go there but germanicus had gone just to see the ancient relics his friends had said in the streets of rome a mere excuse i thought in desperation where was the trial the sentence poison my bearers were running people were screaming and sobbing around us germanicus germanicus give us back our beautiful germanicus antioch had gone mad at last we were obviously in a small narrow street that was little more than an alleyway you know the kind for a grid of them was uncovered in the ruins of pompeii in italy you could smell the male urine collected in the jugs on the corner you could smell food cooking from high chimneys my bearers were running and stumbling over rough cobblestones once we were all thrown to the side as a chariot came crashing through the narrow place its wheels no doubt finding the ruts in the stone intended for it my head had hit the wall i was furious and frightened but jacob said lydia we are with you i covered up all over with the cloak so that only one eye allowed me to see the seams of light between the curtains on either side of me i had my hand on my dagger the litter was set down it was a cool indoor place i heard jacobs father david arguing i knew no hebrew and i wasnt even sure that he was speaking in hebrew finally jacob took over in greek and i realized that they were purchasing outright a proper house for me which came with all fine appointments including much fine furniture left recently by a rich widow who had lived there alone but alas the slaves had been sold off no slaves this was a quick cash deal finally i heard jacob say in greek you damn well better be telling me the truth as the litter was lifted i beckoned to him i owe you my life twice over now that greek family who was to shelter me they are truly in danger of course he said when a riot starts who cares they went with germanicus to egypt pisos men know that anybody with the slightest excuse will attack murder and plunder someone else look fire he told the men to hurry all right i said never say my real name again from now on say this name my name is pandora i am a greek from rome i paid you to bring me here you have it my dear pandora he replied you are some strong woman the deed to your new house is made up in a fake name with less charm but the deed verifies you are widowed emancipated and a roman citizen well get the deed when we pay up the gold which we wont do until we are in the house and if the man does not give me that deed with everything written out in full to protect you ill strangle him youre very clever jacob i said wearily on and on went this dark bouncing journey in the litter until at last it came to a halt i could hear the metal key turning in the lock of the gate and then we were brought into the large vestibule of the house itself i should have waited out of consideration for my guardians but frantically i limbed out of this miserable little black veiled prison throwing off the cloak and taking a deep breath we were in the broad vestibule of a fine house with great charm to it and much ingenuity in its decoration even now my thoughts scattered i saw the lionhead fountain right near the gate through which wed just come and i washed my feet in the cool of the water the receiving room or atrium was huge and beyond it i saw the rich couches of the dining room on the far side of a rather large enclosed garden the peristyle it was not my massive ancient opulent old home on the palatine hill which had grown new corridors and rooms over many generations penetrating its broad gardens it was a bit too glossy but it was grand all the walls were freshly painted with a more oriental bent i think more swirls and serpentine lines how could i judge i could have fainted from relief would people really leave me alone here there sat the desk in the atrium and near it books along the porticoes flanking the garden i saw the many doors i looked up and saw the secondstory windows dosed on the porches splendor safety the mosaic floors were old i knew the style the festive figures of the saturnalia on parade they had to have been brought here from italy little real marble plastered columns but so many wellexecuted murals full of the requisite happy nymphs i went out into the soft wet grass of the peristyle and looked up at the blue sky i wanted only to breathe but now came the moment of truth regarding my belongings i was too dazed to ask about what was mine and as it turned out no such thing was necessary jacob and david first did an entire inventory of the household furnishings they were purchasing for me as i stood there staring at them in near disbelief at their patience with detail and when theyd found every room quite fine and a bedchamber down the hall to the right and a small open garden somewhere to the left beyond the kitchen they went upstairs found things proper and then unloaded my possessions trunk followed trunk then to my utter shock jacobs father david drew out a scroll and actually started taking a full inventory of everything that belonged to me from hairpins to ink and gold jacob was meantime sent on an errand i could see the hasty writing of my father on this inventory that david read under his breath personal toilet articles david said in final summation of one portion of this examination clothes one two three trunks to the largest bedroom go household plate to the kitchen books here yes please i was too shocked at his honesty and meticulousness to speak ah so many books fine dont count them i said i cannot you see these fragile yes i know carry on you want your ivory and ebony shelves assembled here in the front room magnificent i slumped down on the floor only to be lifted at once by two helpful asian slaves and settled in an amazingly soft crosslegged roman chair i was given a cup of fresh deansmelling water i drank it down thought of blood closed my eyes ink writing materials on the desk asked the old man if you will i sighed now everybody out said the old man dispensing coins quickly and generously to these asian slaves who bowed from the waist and backed out of the room nearly stumbling over each other i was about to try to form some sensible words of gratitude when a fresh brace of slaves rushed in nearly colliding with the departing crew carrying baskets of everything edible that a marketplace could yield including at least nine kinds of bread jugs of oil melons green vegetables and much smoked food that would last for days fish beef and exotic sea creatures dried out to look like parchment at once to the kitchen save for a plate of olives and cheese and bread at once for the lady on that table to her left fetch the ladys wine which her father has sent oh how incredible my fathers wine then everyone was ordered out again with lots of coins freely given and the old man at once returned to his inventory jacob come here count for me this gold as i read off the list to you plate coin more coin jewels of exceptional value coin bars of gold yes on and on they went rushing at it where had my father hidden all this gold i couldnt imagine it what was i going to do with it were they really going to let me keep this they were honest men but this was such a fortune you must wait until everyone is gone said david and then hide this gold yourself in various places about the house you will find such places we cannot do that for you for then we would know where it was your jewels some i leave here to be hidden for they are much too valuable to be flashed abroad among the populace in your first days he opened a casket of gems see this ruby it is superb look at the size of it this can feed you for the rest of your life if sold to an honest man for half of its worth every jewel in this box is exceptional i know jewels these are handpicked from the finest see these pearls perfection he returned the ruby and the pearls to the casket and shut the lid yes i said weakly pearls more gold silver plate he muttered its all here we should take more care but oh no you have done wonders i declared i stared at the bread and the wine in the cup my fathers wine bottle my fathers amphorae around the room pandora said jacob addressing me most seriously here in my hand is the deed to this house and another paper which describes your official entry into the port under your new madeup name julia la la la and so forth pandora we have to leave you the old man shook his head and bit his lip we have to sail for ephesus child he said i am ashamed that i must leave you but the harbor will soon be blocked there are ships on fire already in the harbor said jacob under his breath theyve pulled down the statue of tiberius in the forum the transaction is closed said the old man to me the man who sold the house has never laid eyes on you and does not know your real name and there is no evidence of it remaining here those were not his slaves who brought you here youve done miracles for me i said you are on your own my beautiful roman princess jacob said it hurts my soul to leave you like this we must said the old man dont go out for three days said jacob coming near to me about as near as he could as if he even meant to break all the rules and kiss my cheek there are enough legions here to quell this riot but they will let it burn itself out rather than slaughter roman citizens and forget those greek friends their house is already an inferno they turned to leave were you well paid for all this i asked if not take from my gold now freely i insist dont even think of such things said the old man but for your peace of mind know this your father staked me twice after my ships were captured by pirates in the adriatic your father put his money in with mine and i made profits for both of us the greek owed your father money worry about those matters no more but we must go god be with you pandora said jacob jewels where were the jewels i leapt up and opened the casket there were hundreds of them flawless dazzlingly clear and exquisitely polished i saw their value their clarity and the care of the polishing i took the big eggshaped ruby david had shown to me and then another just like it and thrust them at the two men they put up their hands to say no oh but you must i said give me this respect confirm for me that i am a free roman woman and that i shall live as my father told me to do it will give me courage take this from me david shook his head sternly but jacob took the ruby pandora here the keys follow us and lock the gate at the street and then the doors to the vestibule dont fear there are lamps everywhere plenty of oil go i said as they passed over the threshold i locked the gate and held to the bars staring at them if you cant get out if you need me come back here i said we have our own people here jacob said soothingly thank you from my heart for the beautiful ruby pandora you will survive go back in bolt the doors i made it to the chair but i did not sit in it rather i collapsed and prayed lares familiares spirits of the house i should find your altar welcome me please i bring no ill will to anyone i will heap your altar with flowers and light your fire give me patience let me rest yet i did nothing but sit in shock on the floor my hands limp for hours as the daylight waned as the strange little house grew dark a blood dream began but i wouldnt have it not that alien temple not the altar no not the blood i banished it and imagined i was home i was a little girl dream of that i told myself of listening to my eldest brother antony talk of war in the north driving the mad germans back to the sea he had so loved germanicus so had my other brothers lucius the young one he was so weak by nature it broke my heart to think of him crying out for mercy as soldiers cut him down the empire was the world all that lay beyond was chaos and misery and struggle and strife i was a soldier i could fight i dreamt i was putting on my armor my brother said i am so relieved to discover you are a man i always thought so i didnt waken till the following morning and then it was that grief and pain made themselves known to me as never before note this because i knew the full absurdity of fate and fortune and nature more truly than a human can bear to know it and perhaps the description of this brief as it is may give consolation to another the worst takes its time to come and then to pass the truth is you cannot prepare anyone for this nor convey an understanding of it through language it must be known and this i would wish on no one in the world i was alone i went from room to room of this small house banging upon the walls with my fists and crying with my teeth clenched and whirling there was no mother isis there were no gods philosophers were fools poets sang lies i sobbed and tore at my hair i tore at my dress as naturally as if it had been a newborn custom i knocked over chairs and tables at times i felt a huge exhilaration a freedom from all falsehoods and conventions all means by which a soul or body can be held hostage and then the awesome nature of this freedom spread itself out around me as if the house did not exist as if the darkness knew no walls three nights and days i spent in this agony i forgot to eat food i forgot to drink water i never lighted a lamp the moon nearing her fullness gave enough light to this meaningless labyrinth of little painted chambers sleep was gone from me forever my heart beat fast my limbs clenched then slackened only to clench again at times i lay on the moist good earth of the courtyard for my father because no one had laid his body on the moist good earth as it should have been done right after his death and before any funeral i knew suddenly why this disgrace was so important his body rent with wounds and not placed on the earth i knew the gravity of this omission as few have ever known the meaning of anything it was of the utmost importance because it did not matter at all live lydia i looked at the small leafy trees of the garden i felt a strange gratitude that i had opened human eyes in this darkness on earth long enough to see such things i quoted lucretius that which comes from heaven ascends to heaven madness alas as i said i wandered crawled wept and cried for three nights and days finally one morning when the sun came spilling down through the open roof i looked at the objects in the room and i realized i didnt know what they were or what theyd been made for i didnt know their common names i was removed from their definitions i didnt even know this place i sat up and realized i was looking at the lararium the shrine of the household gods this was the dining room of course and those were the couches and there the glorious conjugal bed the lararium was a high threesided shrine a little temple with three pediments and inside stood figures of old household gods no one in this profane city had even taken them away with the dead woman the flowers were dead the fire had simply gone out no one had quenched it with wine as should have been done on hands and knees i crawled in my torn dress around the garden of the peristyle gathering flowers for these gods i found the wood and made their sacred fire i stared at them i stared for hours it seemed i would never move again night fell dont sleep i whispered keep watch with the night they wait for you by dark those egyptians the moon look its almost full only a night or so from being full but the worst of my agony had passed and i was exhausted and sleep rose to embrace me sleep rose as if to say care no more the dream came i saw men in gilded robes you will be taken now in the sanctum but whats there i didnt want to see our mother our beloved mother of sorrows said the priest the paintings on the walls were rows upon rows of egyptians in profile and words made of pictures myrrh burned in this place come said those who held me all the impurities have gone from you now and you will partake of the sacred fount i could hear a woman crying and moaning i peeped into the great room before i entered it there they were the king and the queen on their thrones the king still and staring as in the last dream and the queen struggling against her golden fetters she wore the crown of upper and lower egypt and pleated linen her hair was not a wig but real plaits she cried and her white cheeks were stained in red red stained her necklace and her breasts she looked soiled and ignominious my mother my goddess i said but this is an abomination i forced myself to wake i sat up and i laid my hand on the lararium and looked at the spiderwebs in the trees of the garden made visible by the climbing sun i thought i heard people whispering in the ancient egyptian tongue i was not going to allow this i would not go mad enough the only man i had ever loved my father said live it was time for action to get up and get going i was suddenly all strength and purpose my long nights of mourning and weeping had been equivalent to the initiation in the temple death had been the intoxicant comprehension had been the transformation it was over now and the meaningless world was tolerable and need not be explained and never would it be and how foolish i had ever been to think so the facts of my predicament warranted action i poured out a cup of wine and took it with me to the front gate the city seemed quiet people weed to and fro casting their eyes away from a halfdressed ragged woman in her vestibule at last a workman trudging under his burden of bricks i thrust forth the wine i have been ill for three days i said what of the death of germanicus how goes it in the city the man was so grateful for the wine labor had made him old his arms were thin his hands shook madam thank you he said he drained the cup as if he could not stop himself our germanicus was laid out in the public square for all to see how beautiful he was some compared him to the great alexander people could not determine had he been poisoned or not some said yes some said no his soldiers loved him governor piso thank the gods is not here and dares not come back germanicuss wife the gracious agrippina has the ashes of germanicus in an urn she carries next to her breast she sails for rome seeking justice for tiberius he handed me the cup i humbly thank you the city is as usual again oh yes what could stop this glorified marketplace he declared business goes on as always the loyal soldiers of germanicus keep the peace waiting for justice they will not let the murderous piso return and sentius gathers to himself here all who served under germanicus the city is happy the flame burns for germanicus if there is war it wont be here dont worry thank you you have helped me marvelously much i took the cup locked the gate shut the door and went into action nibbling on enough bread to give me strength and murmuring aloud the common sense of luretius i surveyed the house it had a large luxurious bath on the right side of the courtyard full of light water flowed steadily from the seashells of the nymphs into the plastered basin and the water was fine there was no need to light a fire for it in the bedchamber were my clothes roman dresses were simple as you know just long shifts or tunics and we wore two or three of them plus an outdoor coverup tunic the stola and finally the palla or mantle which hung to the ankles and belted below the breasts i chose the finest tunics composing three layers of gossamer silk and then a brilliant red palla that covered me from head to toe in all my life i had never had to put on my own sandals this was hysterically funny and annoying all my toilet articles had been laid out on tables which held burnished mirrors what a mess i sat down in one of the many gilded chairs pushed the burnished metal mirror dose and tried to work with the paints as my slaves had always done i managed to darken my eyebrows but my horror of the painted egyptian eyes stopped me i rouged my lips put some white powder on my face but that was it i couldnt attempt powdering my arms as would have been done for me in rome i dont know what i looked like now i had to braid this damned hair and i managed it and fixed the braids in a big coil on the back of my head i used enough pins for twenty women dragging down the loose curls around my face on my forehead and cheeks i saw in the mirror a roman woman modest and acceptable i thought her brown hair parted in the middle her eyebrows black and her lips rosy red gathering up all this drapery was the biggest nuisance i attempted to match length with length i tried to get the silk stola straight and then belt it tightly beneath my breasts i mean all this folding all this drapery and fastening id always had slave girls around me finally with two undertunics and a long fine red stola i snatched up a silk palla a very large one fringed and decorated all over with gold i put on rings bracelets but i intended to hide under this mantle as much as possible i could remember my father cursing every day of his life that he had to wear the toga the official outer garment of the highborn roman male well only prostitutes wore togas at least i didnt have to cope with that i headed straight for the slave markets jacob was right about the population here the city was filled with men and women of all nations many women walked in pairs arm in arm loose greek cloaks were entirely acceptable here and so were long exotic phoenician or babylonian gowns both for men and women long hair among the men was common as were heavy beards some women went about in tunics no longer than a mans others were completely veiled revealing only the eyes as they walked accompanied by guards and servants the streets were cleaner than they might have been in rome the sewage flowing to wider gutters in the center and more swiftly to its destination long before i reached the forum or the central plaza i had passed three different doors in which rich courtesans stood arguing sarcastically over price with wealthy young greeks and romans one said as i passed to a handsome young man you want me in bed youre dreaming any of the girls you can have as i told you if you want me go home and sell everything you own rich romans in their full togas stood at the corner wine shops and respected my quick glance away with a simple nod as i passed pray none of them would recognize me it was not a likely thing by any means and we were so far from rome and i had lived so long in my fathers house happily reprieved by him from banquets and suppers and even ceremonial gatherings the forum was far larger than i had remembered from my brief glimpse when i came to the edge of it and beheld the huge square flooded with sun flanked on all sides with porticoes or temples or imperial buildings i was amazed in the canopied markets everything was for sale silversmiths grouped together the weavers in their own place the silk merchants in a row and i could see down the side street that came in to my right that it was dedicated to the sale of slaves the better slaves who might never have to go to an auction block far away i saw the high masts of the ships i could smell the river there stood the temple of augustus its fires burning its uniformed legionnaires in lazy readiness i was hot and anxious because my mantle kept slipping in fact all this silk seemed to slip and to slide and there were many open wine gardens where women gathered in groups chatting i could have found a place near enough to someone to have a drink but i had to have a household i had to have loyal slaves now in rome of course i had never gone to a slave market i would never have had to do such a thing besides we had so many families of slaves on our land in tuscany and in rome that we seldom if ever bought a new slave on the contrary my father had a habit of inheriting the decrepit and wise from his friends and we had often teased my father about the academy which did nothing in the slaves garden but argue about history but now i had to act the shrewd woman of the world i inspected every quality household slave on display quickly settled upon a pair of sisters very young and very frightened that they were going to be auctioned at noon and go to a brothel i sent for stools and we sat together we talked they came from a small fine family household in tyre theyd been born slaves they knew greek and latin well they spoke aramaic they were angelic in their sweetness they had immaculate hands they demonstrated every skill i required they knew how to dress hair paint a face cook food they rattled off recipes for eastern dishes of which id never heard they named different pomades rouges one of them flushed with fear and then said madam i can paint your face for you and very quickly and perfectly i knew this meant i had made a mess of the job i also knew that coming from a small household they were far more versatile than our slaves at home i bought them both the answer to their prayers i demanded clean tunics of modest length for both of them got the tunics made of blue linen though they werent very fine then found a roaming merchant with an armful of pallae i brought each sister a blue mantle they were in such happiness they were reticent and wanted their heads covered i had no doubt of them they would have died for me it didnt occur to me that they were starving until while searching for other slaves i heard a nasty slave dealer remind an impudent educated greek that he would get no food until he was sold horrors i said you girls youre probably hungry go to the cookshop in the forum look down the street see there the scattering of benches and tables mone they said in dismay listen girls i have no time to feed you like birds from my hand dont look any man in the eye eat and drink what you want i gave them a seemingly shocking amount of money and dont leave the cookshop till i come for you if a man comes to you pretend to be in terror bow your heads and protest as best you can that you dont speak his language if worst comes to worst go to the temple of isis they ran together down the narrow street towards the distant banquet their mantles such a beautiful blue as they ballooned in the breeze that i can see it even now the color of the sky streaking through the tight sweaty crowds beneath the jumble of canopies mia and lia not hard to remember but i could not tell them apart a low derisive laughter surprised me it was the greek slave who had just been threatened with starvation by his master he said to his master m right starve me and then what will you have to sell a sickened and dying man instead of an unusual and great scholar unusual and great scholar i turned and looked at the man he sat on a stool and did not rise for me he wore nothing but a filthy loincloth which was plain stupidity on the part of the merchant but this neglect certainly revealed that this slave was one very handsome man beautiful in face with soft brown hair and long almondshaped green eyes and a sarcastic expression to his pretty mouth he was maybe thirty years old perhaps a little younger he was fit for his age as greeks like to be having a sound musculature his brown hair was filthy had been hacked off and around his neck by a rope was the most wretched small board i ever beheld crowded with tiny cramped letters in latin pulling up the mantle again i stepped up very close to his gorgeous naked chest a little amused by his audacious stare and tried to read all this it seemed he could have taught all philosophy all languages all mathematics could sing everything knew every poet could prepare whole banquets was patient with children had known military service with his roman master in the balkans could perform as an armed guard was obedient and virtuous and had lived all his life in athens in one house i read this a bit scornfully he glared at me impertinently when he saw this scorn impudently he folded his arms just below this little plaque he leaned back against the wall suddenly i saw why the merchant hovering near had not made the greek rise the greek had only one good leg the left leg below the knee was made of wellcarved ivory complete with carefully engraved foot and sandal perfect toes of course it had been pieced together this fine ivory leg and foot but in three proportionate sections each girded with decorative work and separate parts for the feet nails defined and sandal straps exquisitely carved i had never seen such a false limb such a surrender to artifice rather than a meager attempt to imitate nature how did you lose your leg i asked him in greek no answer i pointed to the leg no answer i asked again in latin still no answer the slave trader was rising on his toes in his anxiety and wringing his hands mistress he can keep records run any business he writes in perfect hand keeps honest numbers hmmm so no mention of tutoring children i did not look like a wife and mother not good the greek sneered and looked away he said softly under his breath in piercing latin that if i did spend money for him i was spending it for a dead man his voice was soft and beautiful though weary and full of contempt his enunciation unaffected and refined i threw off all patience i spoke quickly in greek learn from me you arrogant athenian idiot i said red in the face and furious to be so misjudged both by a slave and a slave dealer if you can write greek and latin at all if you have in fact studied aristotle and euclid whose name you misspelled by the way if you have been schooled in athens and have seen battle in the balkans if even half of this great epic is true why wouldnt you want to belong to one of the most keenly intelligent women youll ever meet wholl treat you with dignity and respect in exchange for your loyalty what do you know of aristotle and plato that i dont ive never struck a slave in my life you pass up the one mistress to whom your loyalty might earn you any reward of which you could dream that tablet is a pack of lies isnt it the slave was stunned but not angered he sat forward trying to appraise me further without being obvious the merchant gestured furiously for the slave to rise to his feet which the slave did giving him an admirable height over me his legs were sound and strong up to the ivory limb what about telling me the real truth as to what you can do i said switching to latin i turned to the slave dealer get me a pen to correct this the spelling of these names if this man has any chance of becoming a teacher these misspellings destroy it he looks like a fool for writing such i didnt have space enough to write declared the slave suddenly whispering in perfect latin fury he bent towards me as if i should understand look at this little tablet if youre so keenly intelligent do you realize the ignorance of this dealer here he has not sense enough to know he has an emerald and thinks it a piece of green glass this is wretched i crammed here what generalities i could i laughed i was seduced and thrilled i couldnt stop laughing this was too funny the slave merchant was confused chastise the slave and lower his value or let the two of us work this out what was i to do he demanded in the same confidential whisper only this time in greek shout to every man passing here sits a great teacher here sits a philosopher he grew a little calm having thus released this rage the names of my grandfathers are carved on the acropolis at athens he said the merchant was mystified but i was so obviously delighted and interested my mantle slipped again and i gave it a hard jerk these clothes had no one ever told me silk slides on silk and what about ovid i said taking a deep breath i almost laughed myself into tears you wrote ovids name here ovid is ovid popular here nobody would dare write that on your card in rome i can tell you you know i dont even know if ovid is still alive and its a shame ovid taught me to kiss when i was ten years old when i read the amores you ever read the amores his entire demeanor altered he softened and l could see he was just on the verge of hope hope that i might be a good mistress for him but he couldnt let himself believe it the merchant was waiting for the slightest signal as to what he might do clearly he could follow our exchanges look you insolent onelegged slave i said if i thought you could even read ovid to me in the evenings id buy you in a moment but this tablet here makes you a glorified socrates and alexander the great smashed in one in what war in the balkans did you carry arms why are you dumped in the hands of this lowly merchant rather than taken at once to some fine house how could anyone believe all this if blind homer had sung such a preposterous tale people would have gotten up and left the tavern he grew angry frustrated the merchant put out his hand in warning as if to control the man what the hell happened to your leg i asked how did you lose it who made you this glorious replacement lowering his voice to an angry yet eloquent whisper the slave declared slowly and patiently i lost it in a boar hunt with my roman master he saved my life we hunted often it was on pentelikon the mountain i know where pentelikon is thank you i said his facial expressions were elegant he was utterly confused he licked his parched lips and said just make this merchant fetch the parchment and the ink he spoke his latin with such beauty the beauty of an actor or rhetorician yet with no effort ill write the amores of ovid from memory for you he said gently pleading through clenched teeth which is no mean feat and then ill copy out all of xenophons history of the persians for you if you have the time in greek of course my master treated me like a son i fought with him studied with him learned with him i wrote his letters for him his education i made my education because he wanted it so ah i said in proud relief he looked the full gentleman now angered caught in impossible circumstance yet dignified and reasoning with just enough spirit to strengthen his own soul and in bed can you do it in bed i asked i cant say what rage or desperation prompted this question he was genuinely shocked good sign his eyes really widened he furrowed his brow meantime the slave trader emerged with the table stool parchment ink and set it all down on the hot cobblestones here write he said to the slave make letters for this woman add sums or ill kill you and sell your leg i broke again into helpless laughing i looked at the slave who still stood dazed he broke away from my gaze to cast a disdainful look on the merchant are you safe around the slave girls i said patronizingly are you a lover of boys i am completely trustworthy the slave said i am not capable of crimes for any master and what if i desire you in my bed im the mistress of the house twice widowed and on my own and i am roman his face darkened i couldnt name the emotions that seemed to pass over his expression the sadness indecision confusion and ultimate perplexity that transformed him well i asked lets put it this way madam you would be much more pleased with my recitation of ovid than with any attempted enactment of his verses by me you like boys i said with a nod i was a born a slave madam i made do with boys i know nothing else and i need neither his face was crimson now and he had lowered his eyes lovely athenian modesty i gestured for him to sit down this he did with amazing simplicity and grace considering the circumstances the heat the dirt crowds the fragile stool and the wobbling table he picked up the pen and quickly wrote in flawless greek have i foolishly offended this great lady of learning and exceptional patience have i brought about through rashness my own doom he wrote on in latin does lucretius tell us the truth when he says that death is nothing to fear he thought for a moment and then he wrote in greek again are virgil and horace really equal to our great poets do the romans truly believe this or only hope it is true knowing their achievements shine in other arts i read this all very thoughtfully smiling most agreeably i had fallen in love with him i looked at his thin nose his cleft chin and i looked into the green eyes that looked up at me how did you come to this i asked a slave shop in antioch youre athenianbred just as you say he tried to stand to answer i pushed him to sit down i can tell you nothing of that he said only that i was much beloved by my master that my master died in his bed with his family around him and that here i am why didnt he set you free in his will he did madam and with means what happened i can tell you no more why not who sold you why madam he said please place a value upon my loyalty to a house in which i served all my life i cannot speak more if i become your servant you will have the same loyalty from me your house will become my house and sacred to me what happens within your walls will remain within your walls i speak of virtue and kindness in my master because this is proper to say let me say no more sublime oldgreek morality write more hurry said the slave merchant be quiet i told him hes written quite enough the handsome brownhaired slave this enticingly beautiful onelegged man had fallen into some deep pit of woe and looked towards the distant forum flash of figures back and forth over the mouth of the street what would i do as a free man he said to me looking up at me from a position of utter careless loneliness copy all day for a pittance at the booksellers write letters for coins my master risked his own life to save me from that boar in battle i served under tiberius in illyricum where with some fifteen legions he put down all revolts i chopped the head off a man to save my master what am i now i was filled with pain what am i now he repeated the question if i were free i would live hand to mouth and when i slept in some filthy tenement my ivory leg would be severed and stolen i gasped and put my hand to my lips his eyes filled with tears as he looked at me and his voice became all the more softer yet sharply articulate oh i could teach philosophy beneath the arches out there you know prattle on about diogenes and pretend that i liked wearing rags as do his followers these days what a circus out there have you seen it i have never seen so many philosophers in my life as in this city take a look when you go back you know what it takes to teach philosophy here you have to lie you have to fling meaningless words as fast as you can at young people and brood when you cant answer and make up nonsense and ascribe it to the old stoics he broke off and tried to gain command of himself i was almost in tears as i looked down at him but you see i have no skill at lying he said that has been my undoing with you great lady i was shattered inside my wounds silently opened the nerve which had carried me out of confinement was ebbing away but surely he saw my tears he looked towards the forum again i dream of an honorable master or mistress a house with honor can a slave through the contemplation of honor thereby have honor the law says not so any slave called to testify in a court trial must be tortured for he has no honor but reason says otherwise i have learned and i can teach both bravery and honor and yes all of this tablet is true i didnt have time or opportunity to temper its boastful style he bowed his head and looked again towards the forum as though towards the lost world he drew himself up in the chair for braverys sake again he tried to stand no sit i said madam he said if you seek my services for a house of ill repute let me tell you now if it is to torture and force young girls such as those you just purchased if you order me to advertise their charms abroad i wont do it it is as dishonorable to me as to steal or to lie why do you want me the tears were halted merely resting between him and his vision of the world around him his face was serene do i look as if i am a whore i asked him with shock yea gods i wore all my best clothes im doing my best to look revoltingly respectable in all these fancy silks do you see cruelty in my eyes cant you believe that it is perhaps the tempered soul that survives grief one need not fight on a battlefield to have courage no madam no he said he was so very sorry then why fling these insults at me now i said full of hurt and no i agree with you what youve written there our roman poets are not the equals of the greeks i dont know our destiny as an empire and this weighs as heavily on me as it ever did on my father and his father why i dont know i turned as if to go but i had really no intention of going his insults had simply gone too far he bent towards me over the writing table madam he said whispering even lower and with greater solicitude forgive me my rash words you are absolutely a paradox your face is eccentrically painted and i think the lip rouge is not properly set you have rouge on your teeth you have no powder on your arms you wear three dresses of silk and i can see through all of them your hair is in two barbarianstyle braids lying on your shoulders and you are raining little silver and gold pins galore look at these little pins falling madam you will be hurt by these pins your mantle more appropriate for evening has fallen on the ground your hems drag in the dirt not missing a beat of his speech he reached down deftly and picked up the palla standing at once to offer it to me coming round the table with a heavy shift of his leg to lay the palla on my shoulders you speak with miraculous speed and stunning gibes he went on yet you carry a huge dagger in your girdle it should be hidden on your forearm under your mantle and your purse you take gold out of it to pay the girls its huge carelessly visible and your hands your hands are beautiful fine as your latin and your greek but they are deeply creased with dirt as though you have been digging in the earth itself i smiled i had stopped my tears you are very observant i said cheerfully i was charmed why did i have to cut you so deeply to find your soul why cant we simply reveal ourselves to one another i need a strong steward a guardian who can bear arms run my house and protect it because i am alone can you really see through all this silk he nodded well now that the mantle is over your shoulders and hiding the the dagger and the girdle he blushed then as i smiled at him trying to regain my calm trying to fight back the engulfing darkness that would take away all confidence from me all faith in any task he spoke on madam we learn to hide our souls because we are betrayed by others but i would entrust to you my soul i know it if you would reconsider your judgment i can protect you i can run your house i will not molest your little girls but mark for all my time fighting in illyricum i have one leg i came home from three years of bloody constant battle to lose it to a boar because a spear poorly tempered and made broke as i thrust it into the boar whats your name i asked flavius he answered this was a roman name flavius i said madam the palla is slipping again from your head and these little pins they are sharp they are everywhere theyll hurt you never mind that i said though i let him drape me again properly as if he were pygmalion and i his galatea he used the tips of his fingers but the mantle was already soiled those girls i said whom you glimpsed they are my household as of the past halfhour you have to be their loving master but if you lie in any womans bed under my roof the bed had better be mine i am flesh and blood he nodded at a total loss for words i pulled open my purse and took out what i thought to pay a reasonable price in rome i thought where slaves were always bragging about how much they had cost i laid down the gold oblivious to the imprint of the coin only gauging the value the slave stared at me with ever increasing fascination then his eyes whipped the merchant the slimy merciless weasling slave trader puffed up like a toad and told me this priceless greek scholar was to be auctioned for a high price several rich men had expressed interest an entire school class was to question him within the hour roman officers had sent their stewards to inspect him i have no more stamina for it i said and reached in my purse again at once my new slave flavius put his hand out gents to prevent me he glared at the merchant with great authority and fearless contempt for a man with one leg said flavius between his teeth you thief you charge my mistress that here in antioch where slaves are so plentiful the ships take them on to rome for its the only way to cut their losses i was quite impressed all had gone so well the darkness flowed back away from me and there seemed for the moment a divine meaning in the warmth of the sun you cheat my mistress and you know it youre the scum of the earth he went on madam do we ever purchase from this scoundrel again i advise never the slave trader broke into an inane smile a hideous grimace of cowardice and stupidity bowed and gave me back a third of what id given him i could hardly keep from another burst of laughing i had to fetch the mantle from the ground again flavius did it this time i knotted it properly in front i looked at the gold which had been returned scooped it up entrusted it to flavius and off we went when we had plunged into the thick crowd in the center of the forum i did laugh and laugh at the whole affair well flavius youre protecting me already saving me money giving me excellent advice if there were more men like you in rome the world might be better for it he was choked up he couldnt talk it was an effort to whisper lady you have on trust my body and soul forever i went up on tiptoe and kissed his cheek i realized that his nakedness the filth of the loincloth all this was a disgrace he bore without a sign of protest here i said giving him some money take the girls home put them to work then you go to the baths get clean get roman clean have a boy if you want have two then buy fine clothes for yourself not slave clothes mind you but clothes that you would buy for a rich young roman master madam please hide that purse he said as he took the coins and what is my mistresss name to whom shall i say i belong if asked to pandora of athens i said though you shall have to fill me in on the current state of my birthplace because i have never actually been there but a greek name serves me well now go see the girls watch lots of people were watching oh this red silk and flavius was such a splendid figure of a male i kissed him again and whispered in his ear calculatingly devil that i am i need you flavius he looked down at me awestruck i am yours forever madam he whispered are you sure you cant do with me in bed oh believe me i have tried he confessed flushing again i made my hand into a fist and punched his muscular arm very well i said the damsels had already risen at my gesture they knew i sent him to them i gave him my key the directions to my house described the particularities of its gate and the old bronze lion fountain right inside the gate and you madam he asked youre going in the crowd unaccompanied madam the purse is huge its full of gold wait till you see the gold in the house i said appoint yourself the only one who can open chests and then hide them in obvious places replace all the furniture ive smashed in my my solitude there are many pieces stored in rooms above gold in the house he was alarmed chests of gold now dont worry about me i said i know where to seek help now and if you betray me if you steal my legacy and i find my house ruined when i return i suppose i shall have deserved it cover up the chests of gold with carpets the place has heaps of little persian carpets look upstairs and tend to the shrine i shall do everything you ask and more so i thought a man who cannot lie cannot steal now the sun is intolerable here go to the girls they wait i turned he caught me by coming round in front of me madam there is something i must tell you what i said with an ominous face not that youre a eunuch i said eunuchs dont grow muscles in their arms and legs like that no he said then he took on a sudden gravity ovid you spoke of ovid ovid is dead ovid died two years ago in the wretched town of tomis on the upper rim of the black sea it was a miserable choice of exile a barbarian outpost no one told me this what a revolting silence i threw up my hands over my face the mantle fell he retrieved it i scarce noticed i had so prayed that tiberius would let ovid come back to rome i told myself i had no time to stop for this ovid no time to weep for him now his books are no doubt plentiful here flavius said they are very easily found in athens good perhaps you will have time to find some for me now im off pins or tumbled braids or sliding mantle i do not care and dont look so worried when you leave the house just lock up the girls and the gold when i finally turned around he was making his way rather gracefully towards the girls the sun rippled prettily on his wellmuscled back his hair was curly and brown rather like my own he stopped for one moment when a vendor attacked him with an armful of cheaply made tunics cloaks and whatnot more than likely stolen goods full of dye that would run in the first rain but who knows he bought a tunic hastily and slipped it over his head and purchasing a red sash tied it around his waist such a transformation the tunic went halfway to his knees that must have been a great relief to him to have on something clean i should have thought of this before i left him stupid i admired him naked or clothed you cant carry such beauty and dignity unless you have been cherished he wore the raiment of the affection bestowed on him and inscribed in the art of his ivory leg in our brief encounter a bond had been forged forever he greeted the girls with his arms around them he guided them out of the crowd i went straight to the temple of isis and thereby unwittingly took the first firm step towards a larcenous immortality an inglorious and unearned supernature a never ending and utterly useless doom as soon as i entered the temple compound i was received by several rich roman women who welcomed me generously they were all properly painted with white on their arms and their faces welldrawn eyebrows lip color all the details of which id made a hash that morning i explained that though i had means i was on my own they were for helping me in every way when they heard i had been actually initiated in rome they were in awe thank mother isis they didnt discover you and execute you said one of the roman women go in and see the priestess they said many of them had not yet undergone the secret ceremonies and were waiting to be called by the goddess for this momentous event there were many other women here some egyptian some babylonian perhaps i could only guess jewels and silks were the order of the day fancy painted gold borders lined their mantles some wore simple dresses but it seemed to me that all of them spoke greek i couldnt bring myself to enter the temple i looked up and saw in my mind our crucified priests in rome thank god you were not identified said one quite a few people fled to alexandria said another i raised no protest i said dismally there came a chorus of sympathy how could you under tiberius believe me every one who could escaped dont be laden with misery said a young blueeyed greek woman very properly dressed id fallen away from the worship i said again came a comforting round of soft voices go in now said one woman and ask to pray in the very sanctuary of our mother you are an initiate most of us here are not i nodded i went up the steps of the temple and entered inside it i paused to shake from my mantle the mundane that is all the trivia i had discussed my mind was focused upon the goddess and desperate to believe in her i loathed my hypocrisy that i used this temple and this worship but then it didnt seem significant my despair of the three nights had penetrated too deep what a shock awaited me as i found myself inside the temple was far more ancient than our temple in rome and egyptian paintings covered its walls a shiver at once went through me the columns were in the egyptian style not fluted but smoothly round and brightly painted in orange and rising to giant lotus leaves at the capitals the smell of the incense was overpowering and i could hear music emanating from the sanctuary i could hear the thin notes of the lyre and of the wires of the sistrum being plucked and i could hear a litany being chanted but this was a thoroughly egyptian place which enveloped me as firmly as my blood dreams i almost fainted the dreams came back the deep paralytic sense of being in some secret sanctuary in egypt my soul swallowed within another body the priestess came to me this too was a shock in rome her dress would have been purely roman and she might have worn a small exotic headdress a little cap to her shoulders perhaps but this woman wore egyptian clothes of pleated linen in the old style and she wore a magnificent egyptian headdress and wig the broad mass of long black braids falling down stiffly over her shoulders she looked as extravagant perhaps as cleopatra had ever looked for all i knew i had only heard stories of julius caesars love of cleopatra then her affair with mark antony and cleopatras death all that was before my birth but i knew that cleopatras fabulous entrance into rome had much affrighted the old roman sense of morality i had always known the old roman families feared egyptian magic in the recent punitive roman massacre which ive described there was a lot of shouting about license and lust but beneath it there had been an unspoken fear of the mystery and the power hidden behind the temple doors and now as i gazed at this priestess at her painted eyes i felt in my soul this fear i knew it of course this woman seemed to have stepped from the dreams but it was not that which struck me so much for after all what are dreams this was an egyptian woman wholly alien and inscrutable to me my isis had been grecoroman even her statue in the roman sanctuary had been clothed in a gorgeously draped greek dress and her hair had been done softy in the old greek style with waves around her face she had held her sistrum and an urn she had been a romanized goddess perhaps the same had happened with the goddess cybele in rome rome swallowed things and made them roman in a very few centuries though i had no thought of it then how could i rome would swallow and shape the followers of jesus of nazareth and make of his christians the roman catholic church i suppose you are familiar with the modern expression when in rome do as the romans do but here in this reddish gloom among flickering lights and a deeper muskier incense than i had ever smelled i resented my timidity in silence then the dreams did descend like so many veils lowered one by one to enclose me in a flash i saw the beautiful queen weeping no she screamed cried for help get away from me i whispered to the air around me fly from me all things that are impure and evil get away from me as i enter the house of my blessed mother the priestess took me in hand i heard voices from my dream in violent argument i strained to dear my vision to see the worshipers coming and going towards the sanctuary to meditate or to make sacrifice to ask for some favor i tried to realize it was a big busy crowd very little different from rome but the touch of the priestess enfeebled me her painted eyes struck terror her broad necklace caused me to blink my eyes row upon row of flat stones i was taken into a private apartment of the temple by her offered a sumptuous couch i lay back exhausted fly from me all things evil i whispered including dreams the priestess sat beside me and enfolded me in her silken arms i looked up into a mask talk to me suffering one she said in latin with a thick accent speak all that must come forth suddenly uncontrollably i poured out my whole family story the annihilation of my family my guilt my travails what if i was the cause of my familys downfall my worship at the temple of isis what if tiberius had remembered it what have i done the priests were crucified and i did nothing what does mother isis want of me i want to die that she does not want of you said the priestess staring at me her eyes were huge or was it the paint no i could see the whites of her eyes so glistening and pure her painted mouth let loose words like a tiny breeze in a monotone i was fast becoming delirious and totally unreasonable i murmured what i could about my initiation what details i could tell a priestess for all these things were highly secret you know but i confirmed for her that i had been reborn in the rites all the storedup weakness in me was cut loose in a flood then i lay down my guilt i confessed that i had early on left the cult of isis that in recent years i had walked only in the public processions to the sea when the goddess was carried to the shore to bless the ships isis the goddess of navigation i had not lived a life of devotion i had done nothing when the priests of isis were crucified except speak out with many others behind the emperors back there had been a solidarity between me and those romans who thought tiberius was a monster but we had not raised our voices in defense of isis my father had told me to remain silent so i had this was the same father who had told me to live i turned over and slipped down off this couch and i lay on the tiled floor i dont know why i pressed my cheek to the cold tile i liked the coldness against my face i was in a state of madness but not an uncontrollable state i lay staring i knew one thing i wanted to get out of this temple i didnt like it no this had been a very bad idea i hated myself suddenly for having become so vulnerable to this woman whatever sort she was and the atmosphere of the blood dreams beckoned to me i opened my eyes the priestess bent over me i saw the weeping queen of my nightmares i turned away and shut my eyes be at peace she said in her calculated and perfected voice you did nothing wrong said the priestess it seemed preposterous that such a voice should issue from such a painted face and form but the voice was definite first the priestess said you must understand that mother isis forgives anything she is the mother of mercy then she said you have been more fully initiated by your description than most here or anywhere you made a long fast you bathed in the sacred blood of the bull you must have drunk the potion you dreamed and saw yourself reborn yes i said trying to revive the old ecstasy the priceless gift of belief in something yes i saw the stars and great fields of flowers such fields it was no good i was scared of this woman and i wanted to get out of there id go home and confess all this to flavius and make him let me weep on his shoulder i am not pious by nature i confessed i was young i loved the free women who went there the women who slept with whom they chose the whores of rome the keepers of the houses of pleasure i liked women who thought for themselves and followed the goingson of the empire you can enjoy such company here as well said the priestess without batting an eye and dont fear that your old ties to the temple caused your downfall in rome we have plenty of news to confirm that the highborn were not persecuted by tiberius when he destroyed the temple it is always the poor who suffer the street whore and the simple weaver the hairdresser the bricklayer no noble family was persecuted in the name of isis you know that some women fled to alexandria because they would not give up the worship but they were never in danger the dreams approached oh mother of god i whispered the priestess went on talking you like mother isis have been the victim of tragedy and you like mother isis must take strength and walk alone as isis did when her husband osiris was slain who helped her when she searched all over egypt for the body of her murdered husband osiris she walked alone she is the greatest of the goddesses when she recovered the body of her husband osiris and could find no organ of generation for him with which she might be impregnated she drew the semen right from his spirit thus the god horus was born of a woman and a god it was the power of isis who drew the spirit from the dead man it is isis who tricked the god ra into revealing his name that was the old tale all right i looked away from the priestess i was unable to look at her decorated face surely she felt my revulsion i must not hurt her she meant well it wasnt her fault that she looked to me like a monster why in hell had i come here i lay dazed the room had a soft golden light coming mainly through its three doors and they were cut egyptianstyle these doors wider at the base than at the top and i let this light make a blur of my vision i asked the light to do this i felt the priestesss hand such silken warmth so lovely her touch her sweetness do you believe all of it i suddenly whispered she completely ignored this question her painted mask gave forth the creed you must be like mother isis depend on no one you dont have the burden of recovering a lost husband or father you are free receive into your house men with love as you choose you belong to no one but mother isis remember isis is the goddess who loves the goddess who forgives the goddess of infinite understanding because she herself has suffered suffered i gasped i moaned a very uncommon sound for me most of my life but i saw the weeping queen of my nightmares bound to her throne listen to this i said the dreams i will now recount and then tell me why it is happening i knew my voice sounded angry i was sorry for it these dreams dont come from wine or potions or after long periods of wakefulness that twist the mind then i launched into another totally unplanned confession i told this woman of the blood dreams the dreams of ancient egypt in which i had drunk blood the altar the temple the desert the sun rising amon ra i said this was the egyptian name for the sun god but i had never spoken it to my knowledge i said it now yes isis tricked him into revealing his name but he killed me and i was her blood drinker do you hear me a thirsty god no said the priestess she sat motionless she thought for a long while i had scared her and now this scared me all the more can you read the ancient picture writing of egypt she asked no i said then she said in a more relaxed and vulnerable tone you speak of very old legends legends buried in the history of our worship of isis and osiris that they once did indeed take the blood of their victims as sacrifice there are scrolls here that tell of this but nobody can really decipher them except for one her voice trailed off who is the one i asked i sat up on my elbows i realized the plaits of my hair had come undone good it felt good because it was free now and clean i raked my hair with both hands what did it feel like to be entombed in paint and wig like this priestess tell me i said who is the one who can read these legends tell me these are evil tales she said that isis herself and osiris live on somewhere in material form taking blood even now she made an expression of denial and disgust but this is not our worship we sacrifice no humans here egypt was old and wise before rome was born who was she trying to convince md ive never had such dreams in a string like this with the same theme she became very worked up with her declarations our mother isis has no taste for blood she has conquered death and set her husband osiris as king of the dead but for us she is life itself she didnt send you these dreams probably not i agree with you but then who did where do they come from why did they pursue me at sea who is this one who can read the old writing she was shaken she had let go of me and she stared off her eyes taking on a deceptive ferocity due to the black lining perhaps somewhere in childhood you heard an old tale maybe an old egyptian priest told it to you you forgot it and now it flames in your tortured mind it feeds on fires to which it has no right your fathers death yes well i certainly hope so but ive never known an old egyptian at the temple the priests were roman besides if we take the dreams and lay them out what is the pattern there why is the queen weeping why does the sun kill me the queen is in fetters the queen is a prisoner the queen is in agony stop the priestess shuddered then she put her arms around me as if it was she who needed me i felt her stiff linen and the thick hair of her wig and beneath it the hurried pounding of her heart no she said youre possessed of a demon and we can drive this demon out of you maybe the way was opened for this wretched demon when your father was attacked at his own hearth you really believe its possible i asked listen she said as casually now as one of the women outside i want you to be bathed to have fresh garments this money what portion can you give me if none we will provide all for you we are rich here heres plenty i dont care i pulled the purse loose from my girdle i will have everything done for you fresh clothes this silk is too fragile you are telling me i said this mantle is torn your hair is uncombed i spilled out a dozen or so gold coins more than i had paid for flavius it shocked her but she covered up the shock very quickly suddenly she stared at me and her painted mask managed to make a flexible expression a frown i thought it might crack i thought she might weep i was becoming a regular expert in making people weep mia and lia had wept flavius had wept now she was going to cry the queen in the dream was crying i laughed in madness throwing back my head but then i saw the queen i saw her in distant wavery recollection and i felt such sorrow that i too could have cried my mockery was blasphemy it was a lie unto myself take the gold for the temple i said take it for new clothes for all i need but my offering to the goddess i want it to be flowers and bread warm from the oven a small loaf very good she said with an eager nod that is what isis wants she wants no blood no no blood she started to help me up i paused in the dream you understand that she weeps she is not happy with these blood drinkers she protests she objects she herself is not the one who drinks blood the priestess was confounded and then she nodded yes that is obvious is it not i too protest and suer i said yes come she said leading me through a thick tall door she left me in the hands of the temple slaves i was relieved i was weary i was taken into the ceremonial bath cleansed by temple maidens and redressed carefully by temple maidens what a pleasure to have it all done right for a little while i wondered helplessly if they would frame me in white pleats and black plaits but they used the roman style my hair was properly done by these girls in a correct circlet that would hold leaving a generous frame of ringlets around the face the clothes given me were new and made of fine linen flowers had been stitched along the borders this finery so precise so minute seemed more valuable than gold it certainly gave more joy to me than gold i felt so tired i was so grateful the girls then made up my face more artfully than i could have done it and more in the egyptian style and i flinched when i saw myself in the mirror flinched it wasnt the full paint of the priestess but my eyes were rimmed with black how dare i complain i whispered i put down the mirror one doesnt have to see oneself fortunately i emerged into the great hall of the temple a proper roman woman with the extravagant face paint of the east a common sight in antioch i found the priestess with two others as formally dressed as she and a priest who wore the same oldfashioned egyptian headdress only he wore no wig just a striped hood his tunic was short pleated he turned and glared at me as i came forward fear crushing fear flee this place forget about the offering or have them make it for you go home flavius is waiting get out i was struck dumb i let the priest draw me aside pay attention he said to me gently i will take you now into the holy place i will let you talk to the mother but when you come out you must come to me dont leave without coming to me you must promise me you will return each day and if you have more of these dreams you will lay them before us there is one to whom they should be told that is unless the goddess drives them from your mind of course i will tell anyone who can help i said i hate these dreams but why are you so anxious are you afraid of me he shook his head i dont fear you but there is something i must confide to you i must talk to you either today or tomorrow i must speak with you go now to the mother then come to me the others led me to the chamber of the sanctuary there were white linen curtains before the shrine i saw my sacrifice lying there a great garland of sweetsmelling white flowers and the warm loaf of bread i knelt the curtains were pulled back by unseen hands and i found myself alone in the chamber kneeling before the regina caeli the queen of heaven another shock this was an ancient egyptian statue of our isis carved from dark basalt her headdress was long narrow pushed behind her ears on her head she wore a great disk between horns her breasts were bare on her lap sat the adult pharaoh her son horus she held her left breast to offer him her milk i was struck with despair this image meant nothing to me i groped for the essence of isis in this image did you send me the dreams mother i whispered i laid out the flowers i broke the bread i heard nothing in the silence from the serene and ancient statue i prostrated myself on the floor stretching out my arms and from the depths of my soul i struggled to say i accept i believe i am yours i need you i need you but i wept all was lost to me not merely rome and my family but even my isis this goddess was the embodiment of the faith of another nation another people very slowly a calm settled over me is it so i thought the cult of my mother is in all places north and south and east and west it is the spirit of this cult which gives it power i need not literally kiss the feet of this effigy that is not the point i raised my head slowly then sat back on my heels a real revelation came upon me i cannot fully record it i knew it fully in an instant i knew that all things were symbols of other things i knew that all rituals were enactments of other happenings i knew that out of our practical human minds we devised these things with an immensity of soul that would not allow the world to be devoid of meaning and this statue represented love love above cruelty love above injustice love above loneliness and condemnation that was what mattered that single thing i stared up at the face of the goddess and i knew her i stared at the little pharaoh the proffered breast i am yours i said coldly her stark primitive egyptian features were no obstade to my heart i looked at the right hand which held her breast love this requires strength from us this requires endurance this requires an acceptance of all that is unknown take the dreams away from me heavenly mother i said or reveal their purpose and the path i must follow please then in latin i said an old litany you are she who has separated the heavens and the earth you are she who rises in the dog star you are she who makes strong the right you are she who makes the children to love their parents you are she who decreed mercy for all who ask for it i believed these words but in a wholly profane way i believed them because i saw her worship as having collected together from the minds of men and women the best ideas of which men and women were capable that was the function for which a goddess existed that was the spirit from which she drew her vitality the lost phallus of osiris exists in the nile and the nile inseminates the fields oh it was so lovely the trick was not to reject it as lucretius might have suggested but to realize what her image meant to extract from that image the best in my own soul and when i looked down at the beautiful white flowers i thought it is your wisdom mother that these bloom and i meant by that only that the world itself was filled with so much to be cherished preserved honored that pleasure itself was resplendent and she isis embodied these concepts that were too deep to be called ideas i loved her this expression of goodness which was isis the longer i looked at her stone face the more it seemed she saw me an old trick the more i knelt there the more it seemed she spoke to me i allowed this to happen fully aware that it meant nothing the dreams were remote they seemed a puzzle which would find its idiot resolution then with true fervor i crawled towards her and kissed her feet my worship was over i went out refreshed jubilant i wasnt going to have those dreams anymore there was still daylight i was happy i found many friends in the courtyard of the temple and sitting down with them under the olive trees i drew out of them all the information i needed for practical life how to get caterers hairdressers all that where to buy this thing and the other in other words i was armed by my rich friends with full equipment to run a fine house without actually cluttering it up with slaves i didnt want i could stick with flavius and the two girls excellent anything else could be hired or bought finally very tired with my head full of names to remember and directions to recall and very amused with the jokes and stories of these women delighted by their ease in speaking greek which i had always loved i sat back and thought i can go home now i can begin the temple was still very busy i looked at the doors where was the priest well i would come back tomorrow i didnt want to revive those dreams now that was certain many people were coming and going with flowers and bread and some with birds to be set free for the goddess birds that would take wing out of the high window of her sanctuary how warm it was here what a blaze of flowers covered the wall i had never thought there could be a place as beautiful as tuscany but maybe this place was beautiful too i went out of the courtyard before the steps and into the forum i approached a man under the arches who was teaching a group of young boys all of what diogenes has espoused that we give up the flesh and all its pleasures that we live pure lives in denial of the senses it was so much as flavius had described it but the man meant his words and was well versed he spoke of a liberating resignation he caught my fancy for this is what i thought had come to me in the temple a liberating resignation the boys who listened were too young to know this but i knew it i liked him he had gray hair and wore a simple long tunic he was not ostentatiously in rags i at once interrupted with a humble smile i offered the counsel of epicurus that the senses wouldnt have been given us were they not good wasnt this so must we deny ourselves look back at the courtyard of the temple of isis look at the flowers covering the top of the wall is this not something to savor look at the roaring red of those flowers those flowers are in themselves enough to lift a person out of sorrow we is to say that eyes are wiser than hands or lips the young men turned to me i fell into discussions with several of them how fresh and pretty they were there were longhaired men from babylon and even highborn hebrews here all with very hairy arms and chests and many colonial romans who were dazzled by the points i made that in the flesh and in the wine we find the truth of life the flowers the stars the wine the kisses of ones lover all is part of nature surely i said i was of course on fire having just come from the temple having just unburdened all fears and having resolved all doubts i was for the moment invincible the world was new the teacher whose name was marcellus came from under the arch to greet me ah gracious lady you amaze me he said but from whom did you really learn what you believe was it from lucretius or was it from experience you realize that we must not ever encourage people to abandon themselves to the senses have i said anything about abandon i asked to yield is not to abandon it is to honor i speak of a prudent life i speak of listening to the wisdom of our bodies i speak of the ultimate intelligence of kindness and enjoyment and if you will know lucretius didnt teach me as much as one might think he was always too dry for me you know i learned to embrace the glory of life from poets like ovid the crowd of boys cheered i learnt from ovid came shout after shout well thats fine but remember your manners as well as your lessons i said firmly more cheering then the young men began tossing out verses from ovids metamorphoses thats splendid i declared how many here fifteen why dont you come to my house for a supper y i asked five nights from now all of you i need the time to prepare i have many books i want to show you i promise you i will show you what a delicious feast can do for the soul my invitation was accepted with amusement and laughter i disclosed the location of my house i am a widow my name is pandora i invite you with all propriety and the feast awaits you dont expect dancing boys and girls for you will not find them under my roof expect delicious food expect poetry which of you can sing the verses of homer truly sing them which of you sings them now from memory for pleasure laughter conviviality victory it seemed everybody could do this and welcomed the opportunity someone made a soft mention of another roman woman who would be most jealous when she discovered she had competition in antioch nonsense said another her table is overcrowded lady may i kiss your hand you must tell me who she is i said ill welcome her i want to know her and what i can learn from her the teacher was smiling i slipped him some money it was getting dusk i sighed look the rising stars of the tinted evening that precedes blackness i received the boys chaste kisses and confirmed our feast but something had changed it was as quick as the opening of ones eyes ah painted eyes no perhaps it was only the awful pall of twilight i felt a shudder it is i who summoned you who spoke those words beware for you would be stolen from me now and i will not have it i was dumbstruck i held the teachers hand warmly he talked about moderation in living look at my plain tunic he said these boys have so much money they can destroy themselves the boys protested but this was dim to me i tried to listen my eyes roved whence came that voice who spoke those words who summoned me and who would attempt the theft then to my silent astonishment i saw a man his head covered by his toga watching me i knew him immediately by his forehead and his eyes i recognized his walk now as he moved steadily away this was my brother the youngest lucius the one i despised it had to be him and behold the sly manner in which he fled from notice into the shadows i knew the whole person lucius he waited at the end of the long portico i couldnt move and it was getting dark all the merchants who are open only in the day were gone the taverns were putting out their lanterns or torches one bookseller remained open with great displays of books under the lamps above lucius my much detested youngest brother not coming to welcome me with tears but gliding in the shadows of the portico why i feared i knew meantime the boys were begging me to go to the nearby wine garden with them a lovely place they were fighting over who would pay for my supper there think pandora this sweet little invitation is some keen test of the degree of my daring and freedom and i should not go to a common tavern with the boys but within moments i would be alone the forum grew quiet the fires blazed before the temples but there were great spaces of darkness the man in the toga waited no i must be off now i said desperately i thought what i shall i do for a torchbearer dare i ask these youths to see me home i could see their slaves waiting about some already lighting their torches or lanterns singing came from the temple of isis it was i who summoned you beware for me and my purpose this is madness i muttered waving goodnight to those who left in pairs or trios i forced smiles and kind words i glared at the distant figure of lucius who now slouched at the end of the portico in front of doors closed for the night his very posture was furtive and cowardly quite suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder i brushed it off immediately wishing to lay down limits to such familiarity and then i realized a man was whispering in my ear the priest at the temple begs for you to come back madam he needs to talk with you he did not mean for you to leave without talking i turned to see a priest there beside me in full egyptian headdress and impeccable white linen and wearing a medallion of the goddess around his neck oh thank heaven but before i could recover myself or answer another man had stepped up boldly heaving forward his ivory leg and foot two torchbearers accompanied him we were embraced by a warm light does my mistress wish to talk to this priest he asked it was flavius he had followed my commands he was wonderfully dressed as a roman gentleman in the long tunic and a loose cloak as a slave he couldnt wear a toga his hair was neat and trimmed and looked as impressive as any free mans he was shining dean and appeared completely confident marcellus the philosopherteacher lingered lady pandora you are most gracious and let me assure you that the tavern these boys frequent may give rise to another aristotle or plato but it is not a fit place for you i know that i said dont worry the teacher looked warily at the priest and at the handsome flavius i slipped my arm about flaviuss waist this is my steward who will welcome you the night you come to me thank you for letting me disrupt your teaching youre a kind man the teachers face stiffened then he leaned doser theres a man under the portico dont look at him now but you need more slaves to protect you this city is divided dangerous yes so you see him too i said and his glorious toga the mark of his genteel birth its getting dark flavius said ill hire more torchbearers now and a litter right over there he thanked the teacher who reluctantly slipped away the priest he was still waiting flavius gestured for two more torchbearers and they came trotting to join us we now had a plenitude of light i turned to the priest i will come to the temple directly but i must first talk with that man over there the man in the shadows i pointed quite visibly i stood in a flood of light i might as well have been on a stage i saw the distant figure cringe and try to fade into the wall why flavius asked with about as much humility as a roman senator something is very wrong about that man hes hovering the teacher was right i know i answered i heard the dim echoing laughter of a woman yea gods i had to stay sane long enough to get home i looked at flavius he had not heard the laughter there was one sure way to do this you torchbearers all of you come with me i said to the four of them flavius you stand here with the priest and watch as i greet this man i know him come only if i call oh i dont like it said flavius neither do i said the priest they want you in the temple madam and we have many guards to escort you home i wont disappoint you i said but i walked straight towards the togaclad figure crossing yard after yard of paved squares the torches flaring around me the togaclad man gave a violent start with his whole body and then he took a few steps away from the wall i stopped still out in the square he had to come closer i wasnt going to move the four torches gasped and blew in the breeze anybody anywhere near could see us we were the brightest thing in the forum the man approached he walked slow then fast the light struck his face he was consumed with rage lucius i whispered i see you but i cant believe what i see nor can i he said what the hell are you doing here he said to me what i was too baffled to answer our family is in disgrace in rome and youre making a spectacle of yourself in the middle of antioch look at you painted and perfumed and your hair full of ointment you are a whore lucius i cried what in the name of the gods are you thinking our father is dead your own brothers may be dead how did you escape why arent you glad to see me why dont you take me to your house glad to see you he hissed we are in hiding here you bitch how many of you who what about antony what happened to flora he sneered with exasperation they are murdered lydia and if you do not get yourself to some safe corner where no roaming citizen of rome can find you you are dead too oh that you would turn up here spouting philosophy everybody in the taverns was talking about you and that slave with the leg made of ivory i saw you at noon you wretched and infernal nuisance damn you lydia this was pure unadulterated hate again came that distinct echoing laughter of course he did not hear it only i could hear it your wife where is she i want to see her you will take me in i will not lucius i am your sister i want to see your wife youre right ive been foolish i didnt think things through very well there are so many miles of sea between here and rome it never occurred to me thats just it lydia you never really think of anything sensible or practical you never did youre an uncompromising dreamer and stupid on top of it lucius what can i do he turned from right to left sizing up the torchbearers he narrowed his eyes i could feel his hatred oh father do not see this from heaven or the underworld my brother wants me dead yes i said four torchbearers and we are in the middle of the forum and dont forget about the man with the ivory leg over there and the priest i said softly and do regard the soldiers outside the emperors temple take note how goes it with your wife i must see her ill come in secret shell be happy that i am alive surely for i love her like a sister i will never connect myself with you in public ive made a grievous error oh knock it off he said sisters shes dead he looked from right to left again they were all massacred dont you understand get away from me he took a few steps back but i moved forward drawing the light around him again but who is with you then who escaped with you who else is alive priscilla he said and we were damned lucky to get away when we did what your mistress you came here with your mistress the children they are all dead yes of course they must be how could they have escaped look lydia i give you one night to get out of this city and away from me i am lodged here comfortably and will not tolerate you get out of antioch go by sea or land i dont care but go you left your wife and children to die and came here with priscilla how the hell did you get away you stinking bitch in heat answer me that of course you had no children the great famous barren womb of our family he looked at the torchbearers get away from here he shouted stay right where you are i put my hand on my dagger i moved the mantle so that he could see the flash of the metal he looked genuinely surprised and then gave a ghastly false smile oh revolting lydia i wouldnt hurt you for the world he said as if insulted i am only worried for us all word came from the house everyone had been killed what was i to do go back and die for nothing youre lying and dont you call me a bitch in heat again unless you want to become a gelding i know you lie somebody tipped you off and you got out or it was you who betrayed us all ah how sad for him that he was not more clever more quick he did not take umbrage at these loathsome charges as he should have he just tilted his head and said no thats not true look come with me now send these men away get rid of that slave and i will help you priscilla adores you shes a liar and slut and how calm you have become in the face of my suspicions nothing as steamed as when you saw me i just accused you of betraying our family to the delatores i accused you of abandoning your wife and children to the praetorian guard can you hear these words its utter stupidity i would never do such a thing you reek of guilt look at you i should kill you now he backed up get out of antioch he said i dont care how you judge me or what i had to do to save myself and priscilla get out of antioch there were no words for my judgment it was harsher than my soul could hold he backed away and then walked fast into the darkness disappearing before he reached the portico i listened to his steps as they echoed down the street dear heaven i whispered i was about to cry my hand was still on the dagger however i turned around the priest and flavius stood much closer than ordered i was frankly utterly baffled stopped i didnt know what to do come to the temple at once said the priest all right i said flavius you come with me stand watch with the four torchmen i want you right by the temple guards and keep an eye out for that man who is he madam flavius whispered as i strode towards the temple leading them both how regal he looked he had the presence of a free man and his tunic was beautiful thin wool striped in gold belted in gold well fitted across his chest even his ivory leg had been polished i was more than pleased but was he armed beneath his quiet demeanor he was deeply protective of me in my misery i couldnt form words to answer him several litters were now crisscrossing the square carried on the shoulders of hurrying slaves and other slaves carried the torches beside them a kind of soft glow rose from the commotion people were on their way to dinners or private ceremonies something was happening in the temple i turned to the priest you will guard my slave and my torchbearers yes madam he said it was full night the breeze was sweet a few lanterns had been lighted under the long porticoes we drew near to the braziers of the goddess now i must leave you i said you have my permission to protect my property as you so eloquently put it earlier unto death dont move from these doors i wont leave here without you i wont stay long i dont want to but have you a knife yes madam but its untried it was among your possessions and when you did not come home and it grew dark dont recount the history of the world i said you did the right thing you probably will always do the right thing i turned my back to the square and said let me see it ill know if its decorative or sharp when he drew it from the forearm sling i touched it with my finger and blood came from the cut i returned it this had belonged to my father so my father had filled my trunk with his weapons as well as his wealth so that i might live flavius and i exchanged one last slow glance the priest grew very anxious madam please come inside he said i found myself ushered right through the tall doors into the temple and with the priestesses and the priest of earlier that afternoon you want something of me i asked i was out of breath i was faint i have much on my mind things that must be done can this wait no lady it cannot said the priest i felt a shudder in my limbs as if i were being watched by someone the tall shadows of the temples were too concealing all right i said its about those awful dreams isnt it yes said the priest and more than that we were taken into another chamber and this one had only one dim light i couldnt see well in the flickering of the flame and i realized i could not make out the faces of the other priest and priestess an oriental screen a screen of worked ebony partitioned off the end of this room and i felt certain someone was behind it but i felt nothing but gentleness emanating from all of these gathered here i looked around i was so miserable over my brother and so impatient that i couldnt find polite words please you must forgive me i said a dire matter requires me to hurry i was becoming afraid for flaviuss safety do send guards to flank my slave outside now done lady said the priest the one i knew i beg you to stay and recount your story again who is there i pointed behind that screen why is this person concealed this was very rude and irreverent but i was in a full state of alarm that is one of our most devoted supporters said the priest who had escorted me to the shrine of isis earlier this one often comes by night to pray at the shrine and has given much money to the temple he only wants to hear what we have to say well im not so sure of that tell him to come out i said besides what is it were supposed to say i was infuriated suddenly that they might have betrayed my corifidences i hadnt told them my true roman name only of my tragedy but the temple was sacred they became all flustered in their gentleness the figure draped in the toga much taller than my brother in fact remarkably tall stepped out from behind the screen the toga was dark but nevertheless the classical garment his face was hidden by the toga i could only see his lips he whispered dont be afraid you told the priest and priestesses this afternoon of blood dreams this was in confidence i said indignantly i was completely suspicious for i had told a good deal more than blood dreams to these people i tried better to see the figure there was something distinctly familiar about the figure the voice even in a whisper something else lady pandora said the priestess who had so consoled me earlier you talked to me of an old legendary worship worship which we oppose and condemn a worship of our beloved mother which once involved human sacrifice i told you that we abhor such things and we do however said the priest there is someone afoot in the city of antioch who does drink blood from humans draining them until they are dead then he flings the bodies before dawn on our steps the very steps of our temple he sighed lady pandora i am entrusting you with a powerful confidence all thought of my evil brother left me the hound of the dreams bore down upon me with its evil breath i tried to gather my wits i thought again of the voice id heard in my head it is e who summoned you the feminine laughter no it was a womans laughter i murmured lady pandora you tell me there is someone afoot in antioch who drinks blood by night he cannot walk in the day said the priest i saw the dream the rising sun knowing i the blood drinker would die in the rays of the sun youre telling me that these blood drinkers i saw in my dream exist i asked that one of them is here someone wants us to believe this said the priest that the old legends have truth but we dont know who it is and we are leery of the roman authorities you know what happened in rome you came speaking of dreams in which the sun killed you in which you were a blood drinker lady im not betraying your confidences here this one he gestured to the tall man this is the one who reads the ancient writing hes read the legends your dreams echo the legends i am sick i said i need a chair i have enemies to worry about ill protect you from your enemies said the mysterious tall man in the toga how can you you dont even know who they are there came a silent voice from the tall man in the toga your brother lucius betrayed the entire family he did it out of jealousy of your brother antony he sold out everybody to the delatores for a guaranteed onethird of the familys wealth and left before the killing began he had the cooperation of sejanus of the praetorian guard he wants to kill you i was shocked but also not about to let this person overwhelm me you speak just like the woman i said silently you speak right to my thoughts you speak like the woman who said to me in my head it is i who summoned you i could feel his shock at this but i too slumped as if dealt a mortal blow so this creature knew all about my brothers and lucius had betrayed us and this creature knew what are you i fired off to the mind speaker the tall one are you a magicians no answer the priest and priestess unable to hear this silent exchange pursued their course this blood drinker lady pandora he leaves human victims on the steps of the temple before dawn he writes an old name in egyptian on his victims with their blood should the government discover this our temple might be held accountable this is not our worship will you recount again for us for our friend here your dreams we must protect the worship of isis we did not believe in these old legends until this creature appeared and began his killing then comes out of the sea a beautiful roman woman who speaks of similar beings who are in her dreams what name does he write on his victims i asked this blood drinker is it isis its meaningless its forbidden its old egyptian it is one of the names by which isis was once called but never by us what is it none of them including the silent one answered me in the silence i thought of lucius and i almost wept then hatred came over me deep hatred as it had in the forum when i spoke with him saw his cowardly rage betrayed the entire family to be weak is a dangerous thing antony and my father had been such strong men lady pandora said the priest tell us what you might know of this creature in antioch have you dreamed of him i thought of the dreams i tried to respond in depth to what these people in this temple were telling me the tall distant roman spoke lady pandora knows nothing about this blood drinker she is telling you the truth she knows only the dreams and there have been no names spoken in her dreams in her dreams she sees an earlier time of egypt well thank you gracious lord i said furiously and just how have you arrived at that conclusion by reading your thoughts the roman said quite unruffled the same as i have regarding those who would put you in danger here ill protect you from your brother indeed you had better leave that to me it is i who will settle that score with him now let us leave the question of my personal misfortune and you explain to me most clever one why i am having these dreams fork up some useful magic from your mind reading you know a man with your gifts should post yourself at the courthouse and determine cases for the judges if you can read minds why dont you go to rome and become the advisor to the emperor tiberius i could feel positively feel the little tumult in the heart of the distant concealed roman again there came that sense of something familiar about this creature of course i was no stranger to necromancers astrologists or oracles but this man had mentioned specific names antony lucius he was an astounder tell me oh mysterious one i said how dose do my dreams come to what youve read in the old writing and this blood drinker the one thats roaming antioch is he a mortal man silence i strained to see the roman more dearly but couldnt he had in fact receded somewhat into the darkness my nerves were on the breaking point i wanted to kill lucius in fact i had no choice the roman said softly she knows nothing of this blood drinker in antioch tell her what you know of him for it may be he this blood drinker who is sending her the dreams i was confused the womans voice had been so clear in my head earlier et is i who summoned you this was causing confusion in the roman i could feel it like a little turbulence in the air weve seen him said the priest indeed we watch in order to collect these poor drained corpses before anyone finds them and blames the deed on us he is burned burned all over his body blackened he cannot be a man he is an old god burnt black as if in an inferno amon ra i said but why didnt he die in the dreams i die oh it is a horror to behold said the priestess suddenly as if she could contain herself no longer this thing cannot be human its bones show through its blackened skin but it is weak and its victims are weak it barely staggers yet it can drain the blood from the poor maimed souls upon whom it feeds it crawls away in the morning as if it hasnt the strength to walk the priest seemed impatient but hes alive said the priest alive god or demon or man he lives and each time he drinks blood from one of these weaklings he grows a little stronger and he is straight from the old legends and you have dreamed of them he wears his hair long in the old egyptian style he is in agony from his burns he spits curses at the temple what kind of curses the priestess interjected at once he seems to think that queen isis has betrayed him he speaks in old egyptian we barely understand him our roman friend here our benefactor has translated the words for us stop i demanded my head is reeling dont say anymore the man over there has told the truth i know nothing of this bloody burnt creature i dont know why i have the dreams l think a woman is sending the dreams to me it may be the queen i described to you the queen on the throne in fetters who weeps i dont know why you have never seen this man asked the priest the roman answered for me shehas not oh your marvelous talents as spokesman again i said to the roman i am so delighted why are you hiding behind your toga why do you stand over there so far away that i cant see you have you seen this blood drinker be patient with me he said it was spoken with such charm that i couldnt bring myself to say more to him i turned on the priest and the priestess why dont you lie in wait for this black burnt thing i said this weakling i am hearing voices in my head but its the words of a woman that come to me warning me of danger its a woman laughing i want to leave now i want to go home i have something that must be done and must be done cleverly i need to go i will protect you from your enemy said the roman thats charming i answered if you can protect me if you know who my enemy is then why cant you lie in wait for this blood drinker catch him in a gladiators net sink five tridents into him five of you can hold him all you have to do is hold him till the sun rises the rays of amon ra will kill him it may take two days even three but theyll kill him hell burn like i did in the dream and you mind reader why dont you help i broke off shocked and disoriented why was i so certain of this why was i using the name amon ra so casually as if i believed in the god i scarcely knew his fables the creature knows when we are lying in wait said the priest and priestess he knows when the tall friend is here and does not come we are vigilant we are patient we think we will see no more of him and then he comes and now you have come with the dreams a vivid garish flash of the dream returned i was a man i argued and cursed i refused to do something which i had been ordered to do a woman was weeping i fought off those who tried to stop me but i had not foreseen that i would as i ran away come to a desert place where i could find no shelter if the others spoke i took no note of it i heard the woman of the dream crying the fettered queen and the woman was a blood drinker too you must drink from the fount said the man in my dream and he wasnt a man i wasnt a man we were gods we were blood drinkers thats why the sun destroyed me it was the force of a more powerful god layers upon layers of the dream lay below this polished bit of remembrance i came to my senses or back to an awareness of the others when someone placed a cup of wine in my hands i drank it it was excellent wine from italy and i felt refreshed though at once tired it would make the walk home much too tiring if i drank any more i needed my strength take this away i said i looked at the priestess in the dream i told you i was one of them they wanted me to drink from the queen they called her the fount they said she did not know how to rule i told you the priestess burst into tears and turned her back hunching up her narrow shoulders i was one of the blood drinkers i said i was thirsty for blood listen i am no lover of blood sacrifice what do you know here does queen isis exist somewhere within this temple bound in fetters no cried the priest the priestess turned around echoing the same horrified denial all right then but you said there were legends that she did exist somewhere in material form now what do you think is happening she has summoned me here to assist this one this burntup weakling why me how can i do it im a mortal woman remembering dreams of a past life does not enhance my power listen it was a womans voice i told you which spoke in my head to me not an hour ago out there in the forum and she said it is i who summoned you i heard this and she swore she would not have me stolen from her then up comes this mortal man whos more of a threat to me than anything in my head the voice in my head had warned me of him i dont want any of your mysterious egyptian religion i refuse to go mad it is you all of you especially the talented mind reader who must find this thing before he makes any more trouble allow me to go on i stood up and began to walk out of the chamber the roman spoke behind me most gently are you really going out into the night alone knowing full well what awaits you that you have an enemy who wants to kill you and that you have in your dreams knowledge that may draw this blood drinker to you this was such a change of pace for the lofty mind reader such a slip into semisarcastic vernacular that i almost laughed im going home now i said firmly they all pleaded in diferent modes and tones stay in the temple absolutely not i said if the dreams return ill write them down for you how can you be so foolish said the roman with genteel impatience you would have thought he was my brother that is an unforgivable impertinence i said are not magicians and mind readers bound by manners i looked to the priest and priestess who is this man i went out and they followed me i hurried to the door in the light i saw the priestesss face we know only that hes our friend please listen to his advice he has never done anything but good for the temple he comes to read the egyptian books we have here he buys them up from the shops as soon as the sea brings them to us he is wise he can read minds as you see you promised an escort of guards i said and i will be with you the voice came from the roman though i did not know where he was now at all he was not in the great hall come live within the temple of isis and nothing can harm you said the priest im not quite the woman for living in the temple compound i said trying to sound as humble and grateful as i could id drive you mad in a week please open the door i slipped out i felt i had escaped from a dark corridor of spiderwebs back into the roman night among roman columns and roman temples i discovered flavius pressed against the column beside me staring down into the stairs our four torchbearers were gathered next to us very much alarmed there were men who were obviously temple guards but they stood cleaving to the doors as did flavius madam go back in whispered flavius at the foot of the stairs stood a group of helmeted roman soldiers in full military dress with polished muscled breastplates and short red cloaks and tunics they carried their deadly swords as if they were in battle their bronze helmets shone in the light of the temple braziers battle dress within the city everything but shields and who was the leader lucius my brother stood beside the leader lucius wore his battle tunic of red but no breastplate or sword his toga was doubled and redoubled over his left arm he was clean with shining hair exuding money a jeweled dagger was on his forearm another dagger was in his belt trembling he pointed at me there she is said lucius of the entire family she escaped the order of sejanus it was a plot to kill tiberius and somehow she bribed her way out of rome i quickly sized up the soldiers there were two young asiatics but the others were old and roman six in number yea gods they must have thought i was circe go back in said my beloved and loyal flavius seek sanctuary be still i said theres always time for that the leader he was the key and i saw that he was an older man older than my brother antony yet not as old as my father he had thick gray eyebrows and was impeccably dean shaven he wore battle scars proudly one on his cheek another on his thigh he was exhausted his eyes were red and he shook his head as if to clear his vision this mans arms were very tanned yet he was well muscled this meant war lots and lots of war lucius declared the entire family stands condemned she should be executed on the spot i decided my strategy as if i were caesar himself i spoke up at once proceeding two steps down you are the legate are you not how tired you must be i took his hand in both of mine were you under the command of germanicus he nodded first blow struck my brothers fought with germanicus in the north i said and antony the eldest after the triumphal march in rome lived long enough to tell us of the bones found in the teutoburg forest ah madam to see that field of bones an entire army ambushed and the bodies left to rot two of my brothers died in the battle it was in a storm in the north sea madam you never saw such a disaster but do you think the barbarian god thor could frighten our germanicus never and you came here with the general went everywhere with him from the banks of the elbe in the north to the south end of the river nile how marvelous and you are so tired tribune look at you you need sleep where is the famous governor gnaeus calpurnius piso why did it take him so long to quiet the city because hes not here madam and he doesnt dare to come back some say he makes a mutiny in greece others that he flees for his life stop listening to her shouted lucius he was never much loved in rome either i said it was germanicus whom my brothers loved and my father praised indeed and if we had been given one more year one more year madam we could have extinguished the fire of that bloody upstart king arminius forever we didnt even need that long you spoke of the north sea we fought on all terrain oh yes in the thick of the forest and tell me this were you there sir when they found the lost standard of general varuss legions is the story true ah madam when that golden eagle was raised you never heard such cries as from the soldiers this woman is a liar and a traitor shouted lucius i turned on him dont push me too far youre past all patience now do you even know the numbers of the legions of general varus who were ambushed in the teutoburg forest i thought not they were the seventh the eighth and the ninth right correct said the legate and we could have wiped out those tribes completely the empire would reach to the elbe but for some reason and mine is not the place to question our emperor tiberius called us back hmmm and then condemns your beloved leader for going to egypt madam it was no trip to seize power germanicuss trip to egypt it was because of a famine yes and germanicus had been declared imperium maius of all the eastern provinces i said and there was so much trouble said the legate you can not imagine the morale the habits of the soldiers here but our general never slept he went directly when he heard of the famine and you with him all of us his cohorts in egypt he delighted in seeing the old monuments so did i ah how marvelous for him you must tell me about egypt you know that i as a senators daughter cannot go to egypt any more than can a senator i would so love why is that madam asked the legate shes lying to you roared lucius her whole family was murdered very simple reason tribune i said to the legate its no state secret rome is so dependent upon egypt for corn that the emperor wants to prevent the country from ever falling under the control of a powerful traitor surely you grew up as i did in dread of another civil war i put my faith in our generals said the legate you are right to do so and you saw nothing from germanicus but loyalty is that not so it is absolutely so ah egypt we saw such temples and statues the singing statues i asked did you see them the colossal man and woman who wail in the rising of the sun yes i heard it madam he said nodding furiously i heard the sound it is magical egypt is full of magic hmmm a tremor ran through me i banished it in a flash i saw two images mixed that of the tall roman in his toga and that of a burnt and cunning creature think straight pandora and in the temple of ramses the great said the legate one of the priests read the writing on the walls all about victory all about battle we laughed because nothing really changes madam and governor piso do you believe these rumors can we not speak safely of them of rumors as if rumors were not things everyone here despises him said the legate he was a bad soldier plain and simple and agrippina the elder germanicuss beloved wife is on her way to rome now with the generals ashes she will officially accuse the governor before the senate yes how courageous of her and that is how it should be done if families are judged without trial then we have fallen into tyranny havent we here our friendly lunatic dont you agree to that lucius was speechless he turned red and in the teutoburg forest i said tenderly that gloomy arena for our doom did you see all the bones of our lost legions scattered about buried them madam with these hands the legate held up his weathered callused palms for who could tell what bones were ours and what bones were theirs and madam the platform of that cowardly sneaking king was still standing from which the loathsome longhaired slob had ordered the sacrifice to his pagan gods of our men nods and noble mumbles came from the other soldiers i was but a small child i said when word came of the ambush of general varus but i remember our divine emperor augustus how he let his hair grow long in mourning and how he would pound his head on the walls crying varus bring me back my legions you actually saw him this way oh many a time and was present one night when he discussed his often mentioned thoughts that the empire must not try to push further rather it should police the states which it now contains then caesar augustus did say this said the legate in fascination he cared about you i said to the legate how many years have you been in the field do you have a wife oh how i long to go home said the legate and now that my general has fallen my wife is grayhaired as i am i see her when we go to rome for parades yes and compulsory service was only six years under the republic but now you must fight for what twelve twenty but who am i to criticize augustus whom i loved as i loved my father and all my dead brothers lucius could see what was happening he sputtered when he spoke tribune read my safe conduct read it the legate looked truly annoyed my brother marshaled what he could of his rhetoric which wasnt much she lies she is condemned her family is dead i was compelled to bear witness to sejanus because they sought to kill tiberius himself you turned on your own family asked the soldier oh dont wear yourself out with this i said the man has harried me all day he has discovered that i am a woman alone an heiress and thinks that this is some uncivilized outpost of the empire where he can bring a charge against a senators daughter with no proof dear lunatic do pay attention julius caesar gave antioch its municipal standing less than one hundred years ago there are legions stationed here are there not i looked at the legate the legate turned and glowered at my trembling brother what is this safe conduct i asked this bears the name tiberius the legate snatched it from lucius before lucius could respond and handed the scroll to me i had to take my hand off my dagger to unroll the paper ah sejanus of the praetorian guard i knew it and the emperor probably knows nothing of it tribune do you know those palace guards make one and one half times what a legionnaire makes and now they have these delatores given incentive to charge others with crimes for onethird of the condemned mans property the legate was now sizing up my brother and every flaw in lucius shone in the light his cowardly posture his trembling hands his shifty eyes his growing desperation in the pursing of his lips i turned to lucius do you realize you madman whoever you are what you are asking of this seasoned and wise roman officer what if he should believe your insane lies what will become of him when the letter arrives from rome inquiring into my whereabouts and the disposition of my fortune sir this woman is a traitor shouted lucius on my honor i swear what honor is that asked the soldier under his breath his eyes fixed on lucius if rome were such i said that families as old as mine could be so easily dispatched as this man asks you now to do with me then why would the widow of germanicus dare to go before the senate for a trial they are all executed said my brother who was at his worst and most solemn and seemed to have lost all touch with the effect of his words every one of them because they were in a plot to kill tiberius and i was given safe conduct and passage out for reporting them as was my duty to the delatores and to sejanus with whom i spoke myself the possibilities were making themselves known slowly to the legate sir i said to lucius have you anything else on your person that identifies you i dont need anything else said lucius your fate is death same as it was for your father asked the legate and your wife had you children throw her into prison tonight and write to rome declared lucius youll see that i speak the truth and where will you be whoever you are while i am in prison looting my house you slut shouted lucius dont you see this is all feminine wiles and lurid distraction there was shock among the soldiers revulsion in the face of the legate flavius moved next to me officer asked flavius with tempered dignity what am i allowed to do on behalf of my mistress against this madman you use such words again sir i said firmly to lucius and ill lose my patience the legate took luciuss arm luciuss right hand went to his dagger just who are you the legate demanded are you one of the delatores you tell me you turned on your whole family tribune i said laying the gentlest touch yet on his arm my fathers roots went back to the time of romulus and remus we know no origins other than those in rome it was the same with my mother who was herself the daughter of a senator this man is saying rather horrible things so it seems said the legate narrowing his gaze as he inspected lucius where are your friends here your companions where do you live you cant do anything to me said lucius the legate glared at luciuss hand on the dagger you prepare to draw that against me asked the legate lucius dearly was at a loss why did you come to antioch i demanded of lucius were you the bearer of the poison that killed germanicus arrest her shouted lucius no i dont believe my own accusation not even sejanus would put such treachery in the hands of a petty scoundrel like you come now what else do you have on your person to connect you with this family this safe conduct which you say came from the pen of sejanus lucius was utterly baffled i certainly have nothing belonging to me to connect me to your wild and bloody sagas and tales i said the legate interrupted me nothing to connect you to this name he took the safe conduct from my hand absolutely nothing i said nothing but this madman here who is spouting horrors and would lead the world to believe that our emperor has lost his wits only he connects me with his bloody plot without witness or verification and hurls insults at me the legate rolled up the safe conduct and your purpose here madam he asked in a whisper to live in peace and quiet i said softly to live in safety and under the true shelter of roman rule now i knew the battle had been won but something else was required to seal the victory i took another gamble slowly i reached for my dagger and slowly i brought it out of its sling lucius leapt back at once he drew his dagger and lunged at me he was immediately stabbed by the legate and at least two of the soldiers he hung there bleeding on their weapons staring from right to left and then he spoke but his mouth was too full of blood his eyes widened it seemed again he would speak then as the soldiers withdrew their daggers his body folded up on the cobblestones at the foot of the stairs my brother lucius was quite mercifully dead i looked at him and shook my head the legate looked at me this was a significant moment and i knew it what is it tribune i asked that separates us from the longhaired barbarians of the north is it not law written law traditional law is it not justice that men and women are called to account for what they do yes madam he said you know l went on in a reverent voice staring at this heap of blood and clothes and flesh that lay on the stones i saw our great emperor caesar augustus on the day of his death you saw him you did i nodded when they were certain he was to die we were rushed to him with a few other close friends it was his hope to put down rumors in the capital that might lead to unrest he had sent for a mirror and combed his hair he was primly propped up and he asked us as we entered the room didnt we think hed played his part well in the comedy of life i thought what courage and then he made some further joke the old theatrical line they say after plays if i have made you happy kindly let me know your appreciation with a warm goodbye i could tell you more but oh please do said the legate well why not i asked it was told to me that the emperor said of tiberius his chosen successor poor rome to be chewed slowly by those sluggish jaws the legate smiled but there wasnt anyone else he said under his breath thank you tribune for all your assistance would you allow me to take from my purse sufficient funds to treat you and your soldiers to a fine dinner no madam i wouldnt have it be said i or any man here was bribed now this dead man do you know anything more of him only this officer that his body probably belongs in the river the soldiers all laughed among themselves good night gracious lady said the soldier and off i went striding across the blackness of the forum with my beloved onelegged flavius at my side and the torchbearers round us only now did i shake all over only now did the sweat cover my whole body when we had plunged deeply into the unbroken darkness of a small alleyway i said flavius let these torchbearers go there is no reason for them to know where we are headed madam i dont have any lantern the nights full of stars and has a near full moon look besides there are others from the temple who are following us there are he asked he paid off the torchbearers and they ran back towards the mouth of the street yes there is one watching and besides we can see well enough by the lighted windows and heavens light dont you think i am tired so tired i walked on reminding myself again and again that flavius could not keep up i began to weep tell me something with your great philosophical knowledge i said as i walked on determined to make the tears stop tell me why evil people are so stupid why are so many of them just plain stupid madam i think there are quite a few evil people who are quite clever he said but never have i seen such skilled rhetoric on the part of anyone either bad or good as your talents revealed just now im delighted that you know that that is all it was i said rhetoric and to think he had the same teachers as i the same library the same father my voice broke he put his arm gingerly about my shoulder and this time i didnt tell him to move away i let him steady me we walked faster as a pair no i said flavius the majority of the evil are just plain dumb ive seen it all my life the true crafty evil person is rare its bumbling that causes most of the misery of the world utter stupid bumbling its underestimation of ones fellow man you watch what happens with tiberius tiberius caesar and the guard watch what happens to that damned sejanus you can sow the seeds of distrust everywhere and lose yourself in an overgrown field we are home madam he said oh thank god you know it i could never have told you this was the house within moments he stopped and turned the key in a lock the smell of urine was everywhere overpowering as it always was in the back streets of ancient cities a lantern threw a dim light on our wooden door the light danced in the jet of water which fell from the lions mouth in the fountain flavius gave a series of knocks it sounded to me as if the women answering the inner door were crying oh lord now what i said i am too sleepy whatever it is tend to it i went inside madam squealed one of the girls i couldnt remember her name i didnt let him in i swear i never unbolted the door i have no key to the gate we had this house all this ready for you she sobbed what on earth are you talking about i asked but i knew id seen in the corner of my eye i knew i turned and saw a very tall roman sitting in my newly refurbished living room he sat relaxed with ankle on knee in a gilded wooden chair its all right flavius i said i know him and i did because it was marius marius the tall keltoi marius who had charmed me in childhood marius whom i had almost identified in the shadows of the temple he rose at once he came towards me where i stood in the darkness on the edges of the atrium and he whispered my beautiful pandora he stopped just short of touching me oh do please i said i moved to kiss him but he moved away the room had scattered lamps he played the shadows marius of course marius and you look not one day older than when i saw you in my girlhood your face is radiant and your eyes how beautiful are your eyes i would sing these praises to the accompaniment of a lyre if i could flavius had slowly withdrawn taking the distressed girls with him he made not a sound pandora marius said i wish i could take you in my arms but there are reasons why i cannot and you mustnt touch me not because i want it so much but because im not what you think you dont see the evidence of youth in me it is something so far afield of the promises of youth that ive only just begun to understand its agonies suddenly he looked off he raised his hand for my silence and patience that thing is abroad i said the burnt blood drinker dont think on your dreams just now he said to me directly think on our youth i loved you when you were a girl of ten when you were fifteen i begged your father for your hand you did he never told me this he looked away again then he shook his head the burnt one i said i feared this he cursed himself he followed you from the temple oh marius you are a fool you have played into his hands but he is not as clever as he thinks marius was it you who sent me the dreams no never i would do anything in my power to protect you from myself and from the old legends dont be quick of wit pandora i know your immense cleverness served you well back there with your loathsome brother lucius and the gentleman legate but dont think too much about dreams dreams are nothing and dreams will pass then the dreams came from him this hideous burnt killer i cant figure it he said but dont think on the images dont feed him now with your mind he reads minds i said just as you do yes but you can cloak your thoughts its a mental trick you can learn it you can walk with your soul locked up in a little metal box in your head i realized he was in much pain an immense sadness came from him this cannot be allowed to happen he insisted what is that marius you speak about the womans voice you no be quiet i will not i will get to the bottom of this you must take my instructions he stepped forward and again he reached to touch me to take me by the arms as my father might have done but then he did not no it is you who must tell me everything i said i was amazed at the whiteness of his skin its utter blemishless perfection and once again the radiance of his eyes seemed almost impossible inhuman only now did i see the full glory of his long hair he did look like the keltoi who had been his ancestors his hair touched his shoulders it was a gleaming gold overly bright yellow as corn and full of soft curls look at you i whispered youre not alive no take your last look for you are leaving here what i said last look i repeated his words what are you talking about ive only arrived laid my plans rid myself of my brother i am not leaving here do you mean to say you are leaving me there was a terrible anguish in his face a courageous appeal that i had never seen in any man not even in my father who had worked swiftly in those last fatal moments at home as if he were merely intent on sending me on an important appointment mariuss eyes were filmed with blood he was crying and his eyes were sore with the tears no these were tears like the tears of the magnificent queen in the dream who bound to her throne wept and stained her cheeks and her throat and her linen he wanted to deny it he shook his head but he knew i was quite convinced pandora when i saw it was you he said when you came into the temple and i saw it was you who had had these blood dreams i was beside myself i must get you far from this far from all danger i separated myself from his spell from the aura of his beauty i beheld him with a cold eye and i listened as he went on noting all about him from the glitter of his eyes to the way that he gestured you have to leave antioch at once he said i will stay here the night with you then in the day you pick up your faithful flavius and your two girls they are honest and you take them with you you put miles between you and this place by day and this thing cant follow you dont tell me now where you mean to go you can discuss all this at the docks in the morning you have plenty of money you are the one who is dreaming now marius i am not going who is it precisely that you want me to flee the weeping queen on her throne or the prowling burnt one the former reaches me over miles and miles of sea with her summons she warns me against my evil brother the other i can easily dispatch i have no fear of him i know what he is from the dreams and i know how the sun has hurt him and i will myself pin him to the wall in the sun he was silent biting his lip i will do that for her for the queen in the dreams to avenge her pandora i am begging you in vain i said do you think i have come so far only to run again and the womans voice how do you know it was this queen of whom you dreamt there could be other blood drinkers in this city men women they all want the same thing and you fear them loathe them and i must keep clear of them not give them what they want never give them what they want ah i see it all i said you do not he said scowling down at me so fierce so perfect you are one of them marius you are whole you are unburnt they want your blood to heal themselves how could you think of such a thing in my dreams they called the queen the fount i flew at him and imprisoned him in my arms he was powerfully strong solid as a tree i never felt such hardness of muscle in a man i lay my head on his shoulder and his cheek against the top of my head was cold but he enfolded me gently with both arms stroking my hair pulling it down out of all the pins and letting it flow down my back i felt a rich tingling all over the surface of my skin hard so hard yet with no pulse of life no warmth of human blood in his gentle sweet gestures my darling he said i dont know the source of your dreams but i know this you will be protected from me and from them you will never become part of this old tale that goes on verse by verse no matter how the world changes i wont allow it explain these things to me i will not cooperate with you until you explain everything do you know the anguish of the queen of the dream her tears are like yours look blood you stain your tunic is she here this queen has she summoned me and what if she has and she wants to punish you for this former life you dreamt in which the evil gods kept her fettered what if that is so no i said that is not her intention besides i wouldnt do what the dark gods of the dream said i wouldnt drink from the fount i ran and thats why i died in the desert ah he threw up his hands and walked away he stared out into the dark peristyle only the stars lighted the trees there i saw a faint glow coming from the far dining room on the other side of the house i looked at him at his great height and the straightness of his back and the way his feet were so firmly fixed on the mosaic floor the lamps made his blond hair glorious i heard him though he whispered with his back to me how could this stupid thing have happened what stupid thing i demanded i came to his side you mean that i am here in antioch ill tell you how my father arranged my escape thats how no no i dont mean that i want you to be safe alive out of all danger protected so that you flower as you are meant to do your petals arent even bruised at the edges look at you and your boldness heats your beauty your brother had no chance against your learning or your rhetoric and yet you charmed the soldiers and made slaves of them with your superiority never once rousing their resentment you have years of life in you but i must think of some way to make you safe look this is the heart of it you have to leave antioch during the day friend of the temple thats what the priest and priestess called you they said you could read the old script they said you bought up all the egyptian books when they came into the port why if you seek her the queen then seek her through me because it is she who said that she had summoned me she didnt speak in the dreams you dont know who spoke the words what if the dreams do have their root in your migrant soul what if you have lived before and now you come to the temple and there is one of these loathed ancient gods on the prowl and you are in danger you must get away from here from me from this wounded hunter whom i will find youre not telling me all you know what happened to you marius what happened who did this to you this miracle of your radiance this is no cloak the light comes from within damn it pandora do you think i wanted my life foreshortened and my destiny extended forever he was suffering he looked at me unwilling to speak and i felt such pain coming from him such loneliness that for a moment it was unbearable i felt a wave of my own anguish of the long night before when the utter vacuity of all religions and creeds had struck me hard and the sheer effort of a good life seemed a fools trap and nothing more he suddenly dosed his arms around me surprising me holding me firmly and rubbing his cheek gently against my hair and kissing my head silken polished gentle beyond words pandora pandora pandora he said the beautiful little girl grown into the marvelous woman i held this hard effigy of the most spectacular and singular man i had ever known or seen i held it and this time heard the beating of his heart the distinct rhythm of it i laid my ear on his chest oh marius if only i could lay my head to rest next to yours if i could only yield to your protection but you are driving me away you dont promise guardianship you ordain flight for me wandering and more nightmares and mystery and despair no i cant i turned away from his caresses i could feel his kisses on my hair dont tell me that ill never see you again dont think i can bear that along with everything else thats happened i have no one here and then who comes but one who left such a stamp on my girlish heart that the details are as deep as the finest coin and you say you will never see me again that i must go i turned around it was lust shining in his eyes yet he checked it in a soft voice he confessed with a little smile oh how i admired your work with the legate i thought the two of you would plan out the whole conquest of the germanic tribes on your own he sighed you must find a good life a rich life a life where your soul and body are fed the color flared in his face he looked at me at my breasts at my hips and then at my face ashamed and trying to conceal it lust are you a man still i asked he didnt answer me but his expression grew chilly you will never know the full extent of what i am he said ah but not a man i said am i right not a man pandora you are deliberately taunting me why why do this this transformation this induction into the blood drinkers its added no inches to your height did it add any inches anywhere else please stop this he said want me marius say that you do i see it confirm it in words what does that cost you you are infuriating he said his face colored deeply with his rage and pressed his lips together so hard that they went white thank the gods that i dont want you not enough to betray love for brief and bloody ecstasy the temple people they dont really know what you are do they no he said and you will not lay open your heart to me never you will forget me and these dreams will fade i wager i can make them fade myself through prayer for you i will do it thats a pious tack i said what grants you such favor with the ancient isis who drank blood and was the fount dont say those words its all lies all of it you do not know that this queen you saw was isis what did you learn in these nightmares think you learned that this queen was the prisoner of those who drank blood and she condemned them they were evil think go back into the dream think you thought them evil evil then and you think them evil now in the temple you caught the scent of evil i know you did i watched you yes but youre not evil marius you cant convince me of this you have a body like marble youre a blood drinker but like a god but not evil he was about to protest when he stopped again he looked out of the corner of his eye and then slowly turned his head and let his gaze drift up through the roof of the peristyle is it the dawn coming i asked the rays of amon ra you are the most maddening human being ive ever known he said if i had married you you would have put me in an early grave i would have been spared all of this all of what he called out for flavius who had been dose all the while listening to everything flavius im leaving now he said i must but guard her when night falls ill be here again as quickly as i can should anything precede me any badly scarred and frightening assailant go for its head with your sword the head remember and of course your mistress here will no doubt be quite able to lend a hand in defending herself yes sir must we leave antioch watch your words my faithful greek i said i am mistress here we are not leaving antioch try to persuade her to prepare said marius he looked at me a long silence fell between us i knew he read my thoughts then a shudder of the blood dreams passed over me i saw his eyes brighten something quickened in his expression i shook off the dream filled with terror i am no hostess to terror its all interwound i murmured the dreams the temple you being there their calling on you for help what are you some white god put on earth to hunt the dark blood drinkers does the queen live oh i wish i were such a god he said i would be if i could be that no more blood drinkers will ever be made of that i am certain let them lay flowers on an altar before a statue of basalt i felt such love for him and rushed to him suddenly take me with you now wherever you are going i cant he said he blinked as though something hurt his eyes he couldnt fully lift his head its the coming light isnt it you are one of them pandora when i come to you be ready to leave this place he said and he vanished like that he vanished like that he was gone from my arms and from my living room and from my house i turned away and walked slowly about the shadowy living room i looked at the murals on the walls the happy dancing figures with their laurels and their crowns of leaves bacchus and his nymphs so modestly covered for such a riotous crew flavius spoke madam a sword which i found among your possessions may i have it in readiness yes and daggers galore and fire do not forget fire it will run from fire i sighed how did i know this i did so much for it but flavius i turned around it wont come until dark there is only a small margin of the night left we can both sleep as soon as we see the sky turn purple i lifted my hand to my forehead i am trying to remember what madam flavius said he looked no less splendid after the spectacle of marius simply a man of different proportion but equally fine and with warm human skin whether the dreams ever came by day was it always night oh i am sleepy and they summon me flavius put a light in my bath but im going to bed i am drowsy can you watch yes madam look the stars have all but faded what is it like to be one of them flavius to be admired only in the darkness when men and women live with candles and lamps to be known and described only in the heaviness of night when all the business of day has ended you are truly the most resourceful woman ive ever known he said how you brought justice to the man who accused you he took my arm and we moved towards the bedchamber where i had dressed that morning i loved him an entire lifetime of crises could not have made it stronger you will not sleep in the great bed of the house in the dining room no i said that is for the display of marriage and i will never know marriage again i want to bathe but im so sleepy i can wake the girls no to the bed you have a chamber proper yes he led the way it was still quite dark i thought i heard a rustling noise realized it was nothing and there lay the bed with its small lamp and on the bed so many pillows in the oriental style a soft soft nest into which i fell like a persian at once the dream we blood drinkers stood in a vast temple it was meant to be dark we could see this dark as certain animals must see in the dark we were all bronzeskinned or tanned or golden we were all men on the floor lay the queen screaming her skin was white pure white her long hair was black her crown bore the horns and the sun the crown of isis she was the goddess it took five blood drinkers on either side to hold her down she thrashed her head from side to side her eyes seeming to crackle with divine light i am your queen you cannot do this to me how purely white she was and her screams grew ever more desperate and imploring great osiris save me from this save me from these blasphemers save me from the profane the priest beside me sneered at her the king sat motionless on the throne but it was not to this king that she prayed she prayed to an osiris beyond hold her more tightly two more came to secure her ankles drink said the priest to me kneel down and drink from her blood her blood is more powerful than any blood that exists in the world drink she cried softly monsters demon children she sobbed i wont do it i said do it you must have her blood no not against her will not like this shes our mother isis she is our fount and our prisoner no i said the priest shoved me forward i knocked him down to the floor i looked at her she looked at me as indiscriminately as she looked at the others her face was delicate and exquisitely painted her rage did not distort her features her voice was low and full of hatred i will destroy you all she said some morning i will escape and walk into the suns light and all of you will burn all of you will burn as i burn because i am the fount and the evil in me will be burnt and extinguished in all of you forever come you miserable fledgling she said to me do as they say drink and wait my vengeance the god amon ra will rise in the east and i will walk towards him and his deadly rays will kill me i shall be a sacrifice of fire to destroy every one of you who has been born of me transformed by my blood you greedy wanton gods who would use the power we possess for gain then a hideous transformation befell the entire dream she rose to her feet she was pristine and freshly adorned torches burst into flame around her one and two and three and then many and more flaring as if theyd just been ignited till she was surrounded by flame the gods were gone she smiled and beckoned to me she lowered her head the white beneath her eyes shone as she looked up at me she smiled she was cunning i woke up screaming i was in my bed antioch the lamp burned flavius held me i saw the light shine on his ivory leg as it was stretched out i saw the light shine on the carved toes hold onto me hold me i said mother isis hold me how long have i been asleep only moments he said no the sun has just risen do you want to go out lie in the warm sun perhaps no i screamed he tightened his warm desperate comforting grip it was only a bad dream my beautiful lady he said close your eyes ill sleep by your side with my dagger here oh yes please please flavius dont let me go hold me i cried i lay down and he snuggled next to me his knees behind mine his arm over me my eyes opened i heard mariuss voice again thank the gods that i dont want you not enough to betray love for brief and bloody ecstasy oh flavius i said my skin is my skin burning i started to rise put out the light put out the sun no madam your skin is as beautiful as it always was lie down let me sing to you yes sing i said i followed his song it was homer it was achilles and hector and i loved the way he sang it the pauses he made i pictured those heroes and the high walls of doomed troy and my eyes grew heavy i drifted i rested he placed his hand over my head as if to keep the dreams out as if to be a human dream catcher and i sighed as he smoothed my hair i pictured marius the sheen of his skin it had been so like that of the queen and the dazzle of his eyes so truly like that of the queen and i heard him say damn it pandora do you think i wanted my life foreshortened and my destiny extended forever and there followed before unconsciousness the utter despair the sense of worthlessness of all striving better that we be no more than beasts like the lions in the arena i awoke i could hear the birds i wasnt sure i calculated that it was still morning midmorning i walked barefoot into the next room and through it into the peristyle i walked on the tiled edge of the earth and looked up at the blue sky the sun had not yet risen high enough to be seen directly above i unbolted the door and went barefoot to the gate to the first man i saw a man of the desert wearing a long head veil i said what rime is it noon oh no madam he said not by half have you overslept how lucky for you he nodded and went on a lamp burned in the living room i walked into the living room and saw that the lamp stood on the desk which my servants had prepared for me the ink was there and so were the pens and so were sheets of clean parchment i sat down and i wrote down everything that i could remember of the dreams my eyes straining to see by the miserable little lamp in the shadows too far from the light that filled the fresh green garden of the peristyle my arm hurt finally from the speed with which i scratched at the parchment in detail i described the last dream the torches the queens smile her beckoning to me it was done all the while i had set aside the pages to dry all about me on the floor there was no breeze or wind to threaten them i gathered them up i went to the edge of the garden deliberately to look at the blue sky this sheaf of papers dose to my breast blue and clear and you cover this world i said and you are changeless save for one light that rises and sets i said to the sky then comes the night with deceptive and seductive patterns madam it was flavius behind me and very sleepy youve scarcely slept at all you need rest go back to bed go get my sandals now hurry i said and as he disappeared so did i out the front gate of the house walking as fast as i could i was halfway to the temple of isis when i realized the discomfort of confronting this filthy street in bare feet i realized i wore the rumpled linen dresses in which id slept my hair streamed i didnt slow my pace i was elated i was not helpless as when i had fled my fathers house i was not edgy and in deep danger as when lucius had pointed me out to the roman soldiers last night i was not gripped in fear as i had been when the queen smiled to me in the dream nor shivering as i had been upon waking i walked on and on i was in the grip of an immense drama i would see it through to the last act people passed laborers of the morning an old man with a crooked stick i barely saw these people i took a cold small delight in the fact that they noticed my loose free hair and my wrinkled gowns i wondered what it must be like to separate oneself from all civilization and never worry again about the position of a fastening or a pin to sleep on grass to fear nothing fear nothing ah that was so beautiful to me i came to the forum the markets were busy the beggars were out in full force curtained litters were being carried every which way the philosophers were teaching under the porticoes i could hear those huge strange noises that always come from a harbor of the cargo being dropped perhaps i didnt know i smelled the orontes i hoped luciuss body was floating in it i went up the steps and right into the temple of isis the high priest and priestess i said i must see them i walked past a confused and distinctly virginallooking young woman and went into the side chamber where they had first spoken to me no table only the couch i went into another apartment of the temple a table scrolls i heard feet rushing the priestess came to me she was already painted for the day and her wig and ornaments were in place i felt no shock as i looked at her look i said i had another dream i pointed to the sheets which i had piled neatly on the table ive written down everything for you the priest arrived he approached the table and stared at the sheets read it all every word read it now bear witness lest something happens to me the priest and priestess stood on opposite sides of me the priest carefully lifting the pages to study each one while not actually turning over the stack i am a migrant soul i said she wants some reckoning or favor of me i dont know which but she lives she is no mere statue they stared at me well speak up everyone comes to you for guidance but madam said the priest we cant read any of this what its written in the most ancient and ornate form of the old picture writing what i stared down at the pages i saw only my own words as they had flowed in a cadence from my mind through my hand through my pen i couldnt make my eyes fix upon the form of the letters i lifted the last page and read aloud her smile was cunning it filled me with fear i held out the page they shook their heads in firm denial suddenly there was a little ruckus and flavius much out of breath and red in the face was admitted to the room he had my sandals he took one look at me and rested back against the wall in great and obvious relief come here i said he obeyed now look at these pages read them are they not in latin two slaves came timidly hastily washing my feet and fastening on my sandals above me flavius looked at the pages this is ancient egyptian writing flavius said the oldest form ive ever seen this would fetch a fortune in athens i just wrote it i said i looked at the priest then the priestess summon your tall blondhaired friend i said get him here the mind reader the one who can read the old script we cant madam the priest looked helplessly at the priestess why not where is he he only comes after dark doesnt he i asked they both nodded and when he shops for books all the books on egypt he does this by the light of lamps too i asked i already knew the answer they looked at one another helplessly where does he live madam we do not know please dont try to find him he will be here as soon as the light fades he cautioned us last night that you were most precious to him you dont know where he lives i stood up all right i said i picked up the sheaf of my pages my spectacular ancient writing your burnt one i said as i walked out of the room your murdering blood drinker did he come last night did he leave you an offering yes said the priest he looked humiliated lady pandora rest and take some food yes said my loyal flavius you must not a chance i said clutching the pages i walked across the great hall to the front doors they pleaded with me i ignored them i went out into the heat of the day flavius followed the priest and priestess pleaded with us to remain i scanned the enormous marketplace the good booksellers were all grouped at the far left end of the forum i walked across the square flavius struggled to keep up madam please what are you going to do youve lost your mind i have not and you know it i said you saw him last night madam wait for him at the temple as he asked flavius said why why should i do that i asked the bookshops were numerous containing manuscripts in all languages egypt egypt i cried out both in latin and greek there was lots of noise many buyers and sellers plato was everywhere and aristotle there was a whole stack of the book of his life by caesar augustus which he had completed in the years before his death egypt i cried out merchants pointed to old scrolls fragments the canopies flapped in the breeze i looked into one room after another at rows of slaves busily copying slaves dipping their pens who did not dare to look up from their work there were slaves outside in the shade writing letters dictated by humble men and women it was all very busy trunks were being brought into one shop the owner an elderly man came forward marius i said i come from marius the tall blond one who comes to your shop only by night the man said nothing i went into the next shop everything was egyptian not merely the scrolls rolled out for display but the fragments of painting on the walls the chunks of plaster holding still the profile of a king or queen rows of little jars figures from some longdefiled tomb how the egyptians loved to make those tiny wooden figures and there i beheld just the sort of man i sought the true antiquarian only reluctantly did he look up from his book a grayhaired man the book a codex in modern egyptian nothing that would interest marius i asked walking into the shop trunks and boxes blocked me at each turn you know the tall roman marius who studies the ancient manuscripts buys the most prized of them you know the man i mean very blue eyes blond hair he comes by night you stay open for him the man nodded he glanced at flavius and said with a lift of his eyebrows quite an ivory leg there cultured greek excellent grecian oriental and perfectly pale i come on mariuss behalf i said i save everything for him as he asks said the man with a little shrug i sell nothing that isnt offered first to marius im sure you do i come on his behalf i looked around may i sit down oh please do forgive me said the man he gestured to a sturdy trunk flavius stood perplexed the man sat back down at his cluttered table i wish i had a proper table where is my slave i know i have some wine around here i just i was reading in this text the most amazing story really i said well take a look at this i thrust the pages into his hand my god but this is beautiful copying he said and so fresh he whispered under his breath he could make out many of the words marius will be very interested in this this is about the legends of isis this is what marius studies i drew back the papers gently ive written this for him you wrote it yes but you see i want to surprise him with something a gift something newly arrived something he hasnt seen yet well theres quite a lot flavius money madam i dont have any thats not true flavius you wouldnt leave the house without the keys and some money hand it over oh ill take it on credit if its for marius said the old man hmmm you know several things came onto the market this very week its because of the famine in egypt people were forced to sell i suppose you never know where an egyptian manuscript comes from but here he reached up and took a fragile papyrus from its niche in the dusty crisscross of wooden shelves he laid it down reverently and most cautiously opened it the papyrus had been well preserved but it was flaking at the edges the thing would disintegrate if not handled with care i stood to look at it over his shoulder a dizziness overcame me i saw the desert and a town of huts with roofs of palm branches i strained to open my eyes this is said the old man positively the oldest manuscript in egyptian which i have ever seen here steady yourself my dear lean upon my shoulder let me give you my stool no not necessary i said gazing at the letters i read aloud to my lord narmer king of upper and lower egypt who are these enemies of me that say i do not walk in righteousness when has your majesty ever known me not to be righteous indeed i seek to do always more than what is asked of me or expected when have i not heard every word of the accused so that he may be judged in fairness as would your majesty i broke off my head swam some brief recollection i was a child and we were all going up into the mountains over the desert to ask the god osiris the blood god to look into the heart of the evildoer look said those around me the god was a man of perfection bronze of skin and under the moon he took the condemned and slowly drew out his blood beside me a woman whispered that the god had made his judgment and rendered punishment and the evil blood would go back now to be cleansed and reborn in another in which it would do no harm i tried to banish this vision this sense of enclosing remembrance flavius was greatly concerned and held me by the shoulders i stood suspended in two worlds i gazed out at the bright sun striking the stones of the forum and i lived somewhere else a young man running up a mountain declaring my innocence summon the old blood god he will look into my husbands heart and see that the man lies i never lay with another oh sweet darkness come i needed it to shroud the mountains because the blood god slept by day hidden lest ra the sun god find him and destroy him out of jealousy because she had conquered them all i whispered i meant queen isis flavius hold me i have you madam there said the old man who had risen and pushed me down on his stool the night over egypt filled with stars i saw it as distinctly as i saw this shop around me in antioch at midday i saw the stars and knew i had won the god would rule oh come forth please from this mountain our beloved osiris and look into my husbands heart and my heart and if you find me in the wrong then my blood is yours i pledge it he was coming there he was as i had seen him in childhood before the priests of ra had forbidden the old worship righteousness righteousness righteousness the crowd chanted the man who was my husband cowered as the god pointed his finger in judgment at him give me this evil blood and i shall devour it said the god then bring back my offerings do not be cowards in the face of a rich priesthood you stand before a god he pointed at each of the villagers and pronounced his or her name he knew trades he could read their minds he drew back his lips and showed his fangs the vision dissolved i stared at common objects as though they had life and venom oh yea gods i said in genuine distress i must reach marius i must reach him now when he heard these things marius would draw me into the truth with him he had to do it hire a litter for your mistress said the old bookseller to flavius she is overtired and its too long a walk up that hill hill i perked up this man knew where marius lived i quickly went faint again bowing my head and with a weary gesture said please old gentleman tell my steward precisely how to reach the house of course i know two short cuts one slightly more difficult than another we deliver books to marius all the time flavius was staring aghast i tried to suppress my smile this was going much better than i had ever hoped but i was torn and bruised from the visions of egypt i hated the look of the desert the mountains the thought of blood gods i rose to go its a pink villa on the very edge of the city said the old man its just within the walls overlooking the river the last house once it was a country house outside the walls it is on a mountain of stones but no one will answer mariuss gate by day all know how he wants to sleep all day and study all night as is his custom we leave our books with the boys hell welcome me i said if you wrote that most likely he will said the old man then we were off the sun had fully risen the square was filled with shoppers women carried baskets on their heads the temples were thriving it was a game darting through the crowd one way and then another come on flavius i said it was a torture keeping to flaviuss slow pace as we mounted the hill turn by turn drawing ever doser you know this is madness said flavius he cant be awake during the light of day youve proven this to me and to yourself i the incredulous athenian and you the cynical roman what are we doing up and up we climbed passing one sumptuous house after another locked gates the bark of guard dogs hurry up must i listen to this lecture forever ah there look my beloved flavius the pink house the last house marius lives in style look at the walls and the gates at last i had my hands on the iron bars flavius collapsed on the grass across the small road he was spent i pulled on the bell rope trees laid down heavy limbs over the top of the walls through the mesh of leaf i could make out a figure that came out on the high porch of the second floor no admittance he cried out i have to see marius i said hes expecting me i cupped my hands and shouted he wants me to come he told me to come flavius said a quick prayer under his breath oh mistress i hope you know this man better than you knew your own brother i laughed there is no comparison i said stop complaining the figure had disappeared i heard running feet finally two darkheaded young boys appeared before me little more than children beardless with long black curls and beautifully dressed in goldtrimmed tunics they looked chaldean open the gate hurry i said madam i cant admit you said the speaker of the two i cannot admit anyone to this house until marius himself comes those are his orders comes from where i asked madam he appears when he wishes then he receives who he will madam please tell me your name and i will tell him that you have called you either open the gate or i will climb over the wall i said the boys were horrified no madam you cant do that well arent you going to shout for help i asked the two slaves stared amazed they were so pretty one was slightly taller than the other both wore exquisite bracelets just as i thought i said theres no one else here but you i turned and tested the thick snaggle of vine that rose over the plastered brick i leapt up and planted my right foot as high as i could in the thick mesh and rose in one leap to throw my arms over the top of the wall flavius had risen from the grass and rushed to me madam i beg you not to do this said flavius madam this is bad bad bad you cant just limb this mans wall the servants within were chattering frantically with one another i think it was in chaldean madam i fear for you cried flavius how can i protect you from such a man as this marius madam the man will be angry with you i lay on the top of the wall on my stomach catching my breath the garden inside was vast and lovely ah what marble fountains the two slaves had backed up and were staring at me as if i were a powerful monster please please both boys pleaded with me at once hell exact a terrible vengeance you dont know him please madam wait hand me the sheets of paper flavius hurry i have no time for disobedience flavius complied oh this is wrong wrong wrong he said nothing can come of this but the most fearful misunderstandings then i slid down the inside of the wall tickled all over by the thick overlay of bristling and brilliant leaves and i lay my head in the matted tendrils and blossoms i didnt fear the bees i never have i rested i held tight to my written pages then moved to the gate so i could see flavius you let me handle marius i said now you didnt come out without your dagger no i did not he said lifting his cloak to reveal it and with your permission i would like to plunge it through my heart now so that i will be most assuredly stonecold dead before the master of this house arrives home to find you running rampant in his garden permission denied i said dont you dare havent you heard all that has been said you are on guard not against marius but against a shriveled limping demon of burnt flesh hell come at dark what if he reaches here before marius oh yea gods help me his hands flew to his face flavius straighten up you are a man do i have to remind you of this perpetually you are watching for this dreaded burnt bag of bones and he is weak remember what marius said go for his head stab him in the eyes just cut him and cut him and shout for me and i will come now go to sleep until dark he cant come till then if he even knows to come here besides i think marius will arrive first i turned and walked towards the open doors of the villa the beautiful longhaired boys were in tears for a moment the tranquillity and moist cool air of the garden lulled all fear in me and i seemed safe among patterns i understood far far from dark temples safe in tuscany in our own family gardens there which had been so rich like this let me beg you one last time to come back out of this mans garden flavius shouted i ignored him all the doors of this lovely plastered villa stood open to the porches above or the outdoors below listen to the trickling of the fountains there were lemon trees and many a marble statue of a lazy sensuous god or goddess round which flowers grew in rich purple or blue diana the huntress rose from a bed of orange blossoms the marble old and pitted and there a lazy ganymede halfcovered in green moss marked some path that had been overgrown far off i could see the naked bending venus at her bath on the edge of a pool water flowed into the pool i glimpsed fountains all around me the small common white lilies had gone wild and there stood old olive trees with marvelously twisted trunks so wondrous to climb in childhood a pastoral sweetness hung over all yet nature had been kept at bay the stucco of the walls was freshly painted and so were the wooden shutters opened wide the two boys were crying madam hell be so angry well not with you i said as i entered the house i had come across the grass and left scarcely any footprint on the marble floor boys do stop sobbing you dont even have to plead with him to believe you isnt that true hell read the truth in your thoughts this startled each in his own way they looked at me warily i stopped just past the threshold something emanated from the house not loud enough to be called a sound but very like the rhythmic precursor of a sound i had heard this very soundless rhythm before when was it in the temple when first i entered the room where marius had hidden behind the screen i walked on marble floors from room to room breezes everywhere played with the hanging lamps there were many lamps and the candles how many candles and lamps on stands why when this place was lighted up it must have been bright as day and gradually i realized the entire lower floor was a library except for the inevitable sumptuous roman bath and an enormous wardrobe of clothes every other room was filled with books nothing but books of course there were couches for lying and reading and desks for writing but every wall had its prodigious stack of scrolls or shelves of bound books also there were strange doors they appeared to open onto concealed stairwells but they had no locks and seemed to be made of polished granite i found at least two of these and one chamber of the first floor was totally enclosed in stone and locked in the same way by impenetrable doors as the slaves trembled and sobbed i went outside and up the stairs to the second floor empty every room simply empty except the room that obviously belonged to the boys there were their beds and their little persian altars and gods and rich rugs and tasseled pillows and the usual oriental swirl of design i came down the boys sat at the main door as if positioned like marble statues each with his knees up head down weeping softly perhaps getting a bit worn out where are the bedrooms of this house where mariuss bedroom where is the kitchen where is the household shrine one of them let out a soft choking cry there are no bedrooms of course not i said our food is brought to us wailed the other cooked and most delicious but i fear that unwittingly we have enjoyed our last meal oh do take it easy how can he blame you for what ive done youre merely children and hes a gentle being is he not here put these pages on his desk and weight them down so that they dont ay away yes he is most gentle said the boy but most set in his ways i dosed my eyes i sensed the sound again the emanating encroaching sound did it want to be heard i couldnt tell it seemed impersonal like the beat of a sleeping heart or the flow of the water in the fountains i walked over to a large beautiful couch draped in fine silk with persian designs it was very wide and seemed to bear despite much straightening the imprint of a mans form there was the pillow there all fluffed and fresh yet still i could see the indentation of the head where the man had lain does he lie here the boys leapt to their feet curls flying yes madam that is his couch said the speaker of the two please please dont touch it he lies there for hours and reads madam please he is most particular that we do not lie on it playfully in his absence though he gives us free rein in every other regard hell know if you even touch it said the other boy speaking up for the first time im going to sleep on it i said i lay down and dosed my eyes i rolled over and brought up my knees i am tired i want only sleep i feel safe for the first time in so long you do asked one of the boys oh come here and lie by me bring pillows for your heads so that he will see me before he sees you he knows me well the pages i have brought where are they yes on the desk well they will make it dear why i have come in its all changed now something is wanted from me i have no choice there is no road home marius will understand ive come as dose to him as possible for my protection i lay back right in the hollow of the pillow where he lay i took a long deep breath the breeze is like music here i whispered do you hear it i slept the deep exhausted sleep which i had held off now for so many hours of boch night and day hours must have passed i woke with a start the sky was purple the slaves were curled up next to the couch just beneath me like terrified little animals i heard the noise again the sound distinct a pulse i thought oddly of something i used to like to do as a child it was this i would put my ear to my fathers chest and when i heard his heart then i would kiss it it had always made him happy i rose realizing that i was not fully awake but certain this was no dream i was in the beautiful villa of marius in antioch the marble rooms opened one upon another i went to the last room the room enclosed in stone the doors were impossibly heavy but suddenly silently they opened as if pushed from within i entered a massive chamber another pair of doors ahead of me they too were made of stone they had to lead to a stairwell for the house ended just beyond these doors too suddenly opened as if released by a spring light from below a stairway went down from the threshold of the door it was white marble and newly made with no wear of feet on it so smooth each slab so clean a soft series of flames burned below sending their antic shadows up the stairwell the sound now seemed louder i closed my eyes oh that all the world were these polished chambers and all that exists could be explained within suddenly i heard a loud cry lady pandora i spun around pandora he is over the wall the boys came screaming through the house echoing flaviuss cry lady pandora a great darkness gathered itself right before my eyes and then descended on me throwing the helpless beseeching boys to the side i was almost pitched down the stairwell then i realized i was in the grasp of the burnt thing i looked down to see the black wrinkled arm like old leather that held me strong spices filled my nostrils fresh clothing covered the hideously thin leg i saw the driedup foot boys get the lamps set it on fire i shouted i fought desperately driving us both back from the stairwell but i couldnt get loose from the creature boys the lamps downstairs the boys dung to one another i have you this creature said tenderly in my ear no you dont i said and gave him one fine blow with my right elbow it drove him off balance he nearly toppled but he didnt let me go the whiteness of his tunic glowed in the shadows as he once more enclosed my arms and rendered me almost helpless boys downstairs lamps full of oil i said flavius the creature hugged me as if he were a giant snake i could scarce breathe we cant go downstairs one of the boys cried were not allowed said the other the creature laughed in my ear a rich deep laugh not everyone is so bound to rebellion as you are beautiful woman outwitting your brother at the foot of the temple steps it was shocking to hear this dear articulate voice coming from a body which seemed burnt beyond all hope of life i watched the blackened fingers moving over my own i felt the touch of something cold on my neck then i felt the punctures his fangs no i cried i thrashed back and forth in his grip then threw all of my weight against him so that he almost toppled again but didnt fall stop it bitch or ill kill you now why dont you i demanded i twisted to see his face it was like that of a longdead corpse dried in the desert burnt black with a spine of a nose and arched lips that seemed quite unable to dose over white teeth and the two fangs he bared now as he looked at me his eyes were full of blood as mariuss eyes had been his hair was a fine black mop very thick fresh and dean as though it had sprung from his body renewing itself like magic yes he said confidently that is just what happened and very soon i will have the blood i need to renew all of me i wont be this hideous monster you see ill be what i was before those egyptian fools put her in the sun hmmm so she kept her promise i said she walked into the rays of amon ra so you would all burn up what do you know of it she hasnt moved or spoken in a thousand years i was that old when they removed the stones that enclosed her she couldnt have walked into the sun she is a great sacred vial of blood an enthroned source of power thats all and i will have that blood which your marius has stolen out of egypt i pondered searching desperately for a means to free myself you came to me as a gift said the burnt one you were all i needed to take on marius he wears his affections and weakness for you like bright silk garments for me to see i see i said no you dont he said my head was pulled back by my hair i screamed in annoyance his sharp teeth went into my neck a series of heated wires threaded me through and through i swooned an ecstasy rendered me motionless i tried to resist but i saw visions i saw him in his glory a golden man of an eastern land in a temple of skulls he was dressed in bright green silk breeches with an ornamented band around his forehead face delicate of nose and mouth then i saw him without explanation burst into flames that sent his slaves screaming he twisted and turned in these flames not dying but suffering exquisitely my head was swimming and i was weakening my blood flowed from all parts of my body into his wretched form i thought of my father of my father saying live lydia i wrenched my neck away from him and turned poking him hard with my shoulder and then pushed him with two hands so that he slid backwards on the floor i brought my knee up against him nothing could get him off me i tried to reach for my dagger but i was too dizzy and besides i didnt have my dagger my only chance lay with the burning oil in the lamps at the foot of the stairs i turned reeling and the monster caught me again with both hands by my long hair he yanked me bad you demon i said his strength had worn me out he tightened his grip slowly i knew that soon my arms would break ah he said twisting free of me and holding tight as ever my purpose is served a brighter light suddenly filled up the stairway a torch was placed at the foot of the steps then marius stepped into view he appeared utterly calm and he appeared to be looking past me into the eyes of my captor and what will you do now akbar marius asked hurt her violate her but one more time and i shall kill you kill her and you will die in agony let her go and you can run he mounted the steps one by one you underestimate me said the burnt thing you arrogant roman bumbler you think i dont know you keep the queen and the king that you stole them out of egypt it is known the word is spread through the world through the northern woods through the wild lands through the lands of which you know nothing you killed the elder who guarded the king and the queen and stole them the king and queen have not moved or spoken in a thousand years you took our queen from egypt you think you are a roman emperor you think she is a queen you can take captive like cleopatra cleopatra was a greek whore this is our isis our akasha you blaspheming fool now let me into akashas presence stand against me and this woman the only mortal whom you truly love dies marius came up step by step towards us akbar did your informants tell you that it was the elder in egypt her long keeper himself who left the royal pair to stand in the sun asked marius he took another step upward did they tell you that it was the elder that caused the sun to strike them the fire which destroyed hundreds of us and spared the oldest only so they could live in agony as you do marius made a quick gesture i felt the fangs deep in my neck i couldnt get away again i saw this creature in his former splendor taunting me with his beauty his jeweled feet as he danced surrounded by painted women i heard marius right beside me but i couldnt make out the words the folly of it all went through my mind i had led this creature to marius but was that what the mother wanted akasha that was the ancient name written on the bodies dumped on the steps of the temple i knew her name i knew it in the dreams i was losing consciousness marius i called out with all my strength my head fell forward free of the fangs i fought this total captivating weakness i deliberately pictured the emperor augustus receiving us on his deathbed i shall not see the end of this comedy i whispered oh yes you shall it was mariuss calm voice right near us i opened my eyes akbar dont risk it again youve shown your determination dont reach for me again marius said the burnt creature my teeth caress her neck but one more drop and her heart is silent the rich dark of night brightened the torch below that was all i could see the torch akasha i whispered the burnt thing took a deep breath his chest heaving against me her blood is beautiful he said he kissed my cheek with the parched burnt lips i closed my eyes it was becoming harder and harder for me to breathe i couldnt open my eyes he went on talking you see i have no fear to take her into death with me marius for if i must die by your hand why not with her as my consort these words were distant echoing pick her up in your arms said marius he was very dose to us and carry her gently as if she were your only beloved child and come down with me into the shrine come and see the mother kneel before akasha and see what she will allow i swooned again but i heard the creature laugh he did lift me now under the knees and my head fell back we went down the steps marius i said hes weak you can kill him my face fell against the chest of the burnt one as we descended i could feel the bones of his chest really very weak i said scarcely able to remain conscious akasha yes her true name carefully my friend said marius she dies and i destroy you youve almost overplayed your hand she narrows your chances with every labored breath pandora be silent please akbar is a great blood drinker a great god i felt a cold firm hand clasp mine we had reached the lower floor i tried to lift my head i saw rows of lamps splendid wall paintings hammered with gold a ceiling veiled in gold two great stone doors were opened a chapel lay within a chapel full of dense fluttering devotional light and the overpowering scent of lilies the blood drinker who held me let out a cry mother isis he said piteously oh akasha he released me setting me down on my feet as marius at once took hold of me and the blistered and damaged one rushed towards the altar i stared amazed but i was dying i couldnt breathe i was falling to the floor i tried to swallow air but i could not i could not stand without marius but oh to leave the earth and all its miseries with such a vision there they sat the great goddess isis and the king osiris or so it seemed bronzed in skin not white like the poor captive queen in my dreams but perfectly arrayed in garments of spun gold pleated and sewn in the fixed egyptian style their black hair was long plaited real the paint on their faces was fresh the dark eyelining and mascara the reddened lips she wore no crown of the horns and sun disk her collar of gold and jewels was superb shimmering and alive in my eyes i must get the crown restore the crown i said aloud hearing this voice come from me as if it had been born elsewhere to instruct me my eyes dosed the black thing knelt before the queen i couldnt see dearly i felt mariuss arms and then a gush of hot blood come into my mouth no marius protect her i tried to speak my words were washed away in this infusion of blood protect the mother again it came filling my mouth so that i had to swallow immediately i felt the strength the power of this blood infinitely stronger than the pull of akbar the blood rushed like so many rivers to the sea through my body it would not be stopped another gush followed as if a giant storm had driven the river even faster into its delta its broken and random streams seeking every morsel of flesh a wide and wondrous world opened and would have welcomed me sunlight in the deep forest but i wouldnt see it i broke free the queen save her from him i whispered did the blood drip from my lips no it was gone inside me marius wouldnt listen to me again a bloody wound was pressed to my mouth and the blood was driven ever faster i felt the air fill my lungs i could feel the length of my own body sturdy standing on its own the blood brightened inside me like light as though it had enflamed my heart i opened my eyes i was a pillar i saw mariuss face his golden eyelashes his deep blue eyes his long hair parted in the middle fell to his shoulders he was ageless a god protect her i cried i turned and pointed a veil was lifted that had all my life hung between me and all things now in their true color and shape they gave forth their deliberate purpose the queen stared forward immobile as the king life could not have imitated such serenity such utter paralysis i heard water dropping from the flowers tiny drops striking the marble floor the fall of a single leaf i turned and saw it curled and rocking on the stones this tiny leaf i heard the breeze move under the golden canopied ceiling and the lamps had tongues of flame to sing the world was a woven song a tapestry of song the multicolored mosiacs gleamed then lost all form then even pattern the walls dissolved into clouds of colored mist which welcomed us through which we could roam forever and there she sat the queen of heaven reigning over all in supreme and unperturbed stillness all the yearning of my childish heart was fulfilled she lives she is real she reigns over earth and heaven the king and the queen they didnt stir their eyes beheld nothing they did not look at us they did not look at the burnt thing as he drew doser and doser to their throne the arms of the royal pair were covered in many inscribed and intricate bracelets their hands rested on their thighs it was the manner of many an egyptian statue but there never has been a statue to equal either of them the crown she would have her crown i said with astonishing vigor i walked forward towards her marius took my hand keenly he watched the progress of the burnt one she was before all such crowns marius said they do not mean anything to her the thought itself burst with the sweetness of a grape on my tongue of course she was there before in my dreams she had had no crown she was safe marius kept her safe my queen said marius from behind me you have a supplicant it is akbar from the east he would drink the royal blood what is your will mother his voice was so tranquil he had no fears mother isis let me drink cried this burnt creature he stood up threw up his arms and created another dancing vision of his former self he wore human skulls hanging from his belt he wore a necklace of blackened human fingers another of blackened human ears it was grisly and revolting yet he seemed to think it seductive and overpowering at once the image left him the god from the faraway land was on his knees i am your servant and always was i slew only the evildoer as you commanded i never abandoned your true worship how fragile and insignificant seemed this pleading one so revolting so easy to clear away now from her presence i looked at the king osiris as remote and indifferent as the queen marius i said the corn for osiris doesnt he want the corn hes the god of the corn i was filled with visions of our processions in rome of people singing and bearing the offerings no he doesnt want the corn said marius he laid his hand on my shoulder they are true they are real i cried out it is all real everything is changed everything is redeemed the burnt thing turned and glared at me but i was quite beyond all reason he turned back to the queen and reached out for her foot how her toenails flashed in the light with the golden flesh beneath them but she was stonestill as was the crownless king without seeming judgment or power the creature suddenly sprang up and tried to seize the queen by the neck i screamed shameless despicable swiftly the frozen right arm of the queen rose her hand surrounding the burnt things skull and crushing it the blood gushing down her as the monster gave his last fractured cry for mercy she caught his body as it dropped over her waist she hurled it in the air and all its limbs broke loose from it crashing to the floor like so much timber a gusting wind caught each remnant and gathered them all in one as a lamp fell from its threelegged stand to spill its burning oil on the remains the heart look i said i can see its heart the heartbeats but the fire quickly consumed the heart consumed the flexing fingers and the writhing toes there was a great stirring a dance in the fire of bones bones whirling in the flames and then the bones blackened thinned snapped to pieces became fragments all of this thing was reduced at last to smoking cinders crisping and skittering on the floor then came the breeze again full of the breath of the garden lifting these cinders and carrying them away like so many fragile tiny black insects into the shadows of the antechamber i was spellbound the queen was as before her hand in its old place she and the king stared at nothing as if nothing had taken place only the wretched stain on her gown bore witness their eyes took no heed of marius or of me then there was only quiet in the chapel only sweet perfumed quiet golden light i breathed deeply i could hear the oil in the lamps turned to flame the mosiacs were peopled with finely made worshipers i could see the slow minute beginnings of decay of the various flowers and it seemed but another strain of the same song that expressed their growth their browning edges but another color in no contradiction to their brilliant colors forgive me akasha marius said softly that i let him come so dose i was not wise i cried great gushing tears came from me you summoned me i said to the queen through my tears you called me here i will do all you want of me slowly her right arm rose it rose from her thigh and extended itself and her hand very gently curved in the beckoning gesture of the dream but there was no smile no change in her frozen face i felt something invisible and irresistible wrap itself around me it came from her outstretching welcoming arm it was sweet and soft and caressing it made a flush of pleasure through all my limbs and my face i moved forward wound up in its will i beg you akasha marius said softly i beg you under the name of inanna under the name of isis under the name of all goddesses dont hurt her marius simply didnt understand marius had never known her worship i knew i knew that her blood drinker children had meant to be judges of the evildoer and drink only from the condemned according to her laws i saw the god of the dark cave whom id seen in my vision i understood all i wanted to tell marius but i couldnt not now the world was reborn all systems built upon skepticism or selfishness were as fragile as spiderwebs and meant to be swept away my own moments of despair had been nothing more than detours into an unholy and selfcentered blackness the queen of heaven i whispered i knew i was speaking in the ancient tongue a prayer came to my lips and amon ra the sun god for all his power shall never conquer the king of the dead or his bride for she is the ruler of the starry heavens of the moon of those who would bring the sacrifice of the evildoer cursed be those who misuse this magic cursed be those who seek to steal it i felt myself a human held together by the intricate threads of blood which marius had given me i felt the design of its support it had no weight my body i was lifted towards her her arm came around me and pulled my hair back from my face i put out my arms to embrace her neck because i could do nothing else we were too dose for any other possible sign of love i felt the soft silk of her real plaited hair and the coldness and firmness of her shoulders her arm yet she did not look at me she was a petrified thing could she look at me did she choose to remain silent staring forward did some evil spell hold her helpless a spell from which a thousand hymns might waken her in my delirium i saw the words engraved in gold pieces among the jewels of her collar bring to me the evildoer and i shall drink his blood it seemed i was in the desert and the necklace was tumbling over and over in the sand in the wind rather like the body of the burnt one had tumbled fallen lost to be remade i felt my head drawn to her neck she had opened her fingers over my hair she directed it that my lips should feel this skin its what you want isnt it i asked but my words seemed remote from me a pathetic expression of the fullness of my soul that i am to be your daughter she tipped her head slightly away from me so that i saw her neck i saw the vein displayed the vein from which she wanted me to drink her finger rose gently through my hair never pulling it or hurting it merely embracing my head sending rampant ecstasy through me and urging my head gently down so that my lips could no longer avoid her shimmering skin oh my adored queen i whispered i had never known such certainty such ecstasy without limits or mundane cause i had never known such bursting triumphant faith as my faith in her i opened my mouth nothing human could bite through this hard flesh yet it gave as though it were thin and the blood pumped into me the fount i heard her heart driving it a deafening force that vibrated in the drums of my ears this was not blood this was nectar this was all that any created being could ever desire with the nectar flowing into me there came another realm her ringing laughter filled the corridor she ran ahead of me girlish feline unencumbered by grandeur she beckoned for me to follow out under the stars marius sat alone in his soft shapeless garden she pointed to him i saw marius rise and take me in his arms his long hair was such a fine adornment i saw what she wanted it was marius i kissed in this vision as i drank from her it was marius with whom i danced a shower of flower petals descended upon us as upon a bridal couple in rome and marius held my arm as though we had just been wed and all around us people sang there was a flawless happiness a happiness so keen that perhaps there are those born who never even have the capacity for it she stood atop a broad black altar of diorite it was night this was an enclosed place filled with people but it was dark and cool with the sandy wind off the valley floor and she looked down at the one they offered up to her he was a man his eyes closed his hands were bound he didnt struggle she showed her teeth a gasp rose from the worshipers who filled the place and then she took the man by the throat and drank his blood when she had finished she let him fall and she held up her arms all things are cleansed in me she cried out once again the petals fell petals of all colors and peacock feathers waved about us and branches of palm and there was singing in great lusty bursts and the sound of a riotous drum and she smiled looking down from where she stood her face remarkably flushed and mobile and human her blackpainted eyes sweeping over her worshipers all began to dance save she who watched and then her eyes rose slowly and she looked over their heads out the high rectangular windows of this place at the twinkling firmament pipes played the dance had become a frenzy a weary and secretive darkness crept into her face a distraction as though her soul had traveled out of doors towards heaven and then she looked sadly down she looked lost anger overcame her then she cried out in a deafening voice the rogue blood drinker the crowd fell silent bring him to me the crowd parted to let this struggling furious god be forced to her altar you dare judge me he cried he was babylonian with full long curly locks and beard and mustache it took ten mortals to hold him into the burning place in the mountains in the sun in the strongest fetters she cried he was dragged away once again she looked up the stars grew big and ageold patterns were dear we floated under the stars a boy in a delicate gilded chair argued with those around him the men were old halfinvisible in the darkness the lamp shone on the boys face we stood in the door the boy was ail his little limbs like sticks and you say said the incredulous boy that these blood drinkers are worshiped in the hills i knew he was the pharaoh by the sacred lock of hair that grew from his bald head by the manner in which the others waited upon him he looked up in horror as she approached his guardians fled yes she said and you will do nothing to stop it she lifted him this small fragile boy and tore at his throat as an animal might do it letting the blood flood from the fatal wound little king she said little kingdom the vision ended her cold white skin was dosed beneath my lips i kissed her now i no longer drank i felt my own form felt myself fall back over her arm felt myself slipping out of her embrace in the dim radiance her profile remained as it had before silent and without feeling stark a face without a blemish or a line i sank back into mariuss arms her arm and hand returned to their former rigid position everything was brilliantly clear the motionless king and queen the artful figures fixed in lapis lazuli in the gold mosaics i felt a sharp pain in me in the heart in the womb as if someone had stabbed me marius i cried out he picked me up and carried me from the chamber no i want to kneel at her feet i said the pain took the breath out of me i tried not to scream from this pain oh the world had just been reborn and now this agony he set me down on the high grass letting it be crushed under me a flood of sour human fluid came out of my womb even out of my mouth i saw flowers right near me i saw the friendly heavens vivid as in my vision the pain was unspeakable i knew now why he had removed me from the shrine i wiped at my cheek i couldnt bear this filth the pain devoured me i struggled to see again what she had revealed to me remember what she said but there was too much obstruction in this pain marius i cried he covered me and kissed my cheek drink from me he said drink until the pain goes away its only the body dying drink pandora you are immortal fill me take me i said i reached down between his legs it doesnt matter now but it was hard this organ i sought the organ forever lost to the god osiris i guided it hard and cold as it was into my body then i drank and drank and when i felt his teeth again on my neck when he began to draw from me the new mixture that filled my veins it was sweet suckling and i knew him and loved him and knew all his secrets in one flash which meant nothing he was right the lower organs meant nothing he fed on me i fed on him this was our marriage all around us the grass was waving softly in the breeze a majestic conjugal bed and the smell of the green flooded me the pain was gone i flung out my arm and felt the softness of flowers he tore off my fouled dress and lifted me he carried me into the pool where the marble venus stood forever with back bent and one foot raised above the cool water pandora he whispered the boys stood at his side offering him pitchers he dipped a pitcher and poured the water over me i felt beneath my feet the tile at the bottom of the pool as the water ran down my skin i had never known such sensation another pitcherful washed over me deliciously i feared for one instant the pain would return but no it was gone i love you with all my heart i said m my love belongs to them and to you marius marius i can see in the darkness i can see in the deep dark beneath the trees marius held me the boys slowly bathed us both dipping their pitchers and pouring the silvery water over us oh to have you with me marius said to have you here not to be alone but to be with you my beauty you of all souls you he stood back and i gloried in him drenched as i was reached to touch his long wild foreign hair he sparkled all over with droplets yes i said it was exactly what she wanted his face stiffened he scowled he stared at me something had changed altogether and for the worse i could feel it what he asked it is what she wanted she made it plain to me in the visions she wanted me to be with you so you wouldnt be alone he stood back was this anger marius what is the matter with you cant you see what shes done he stepped back again away from me you didnt realize thats what was happening i asked the boys thrust forth towels marius took one and wiped his face and his hair i did the same he was furious he shook with anger this was a moment of mingled and inexplicable beauty and horror his white body there the shimmering pool the lights falling gracefully from the open doors of the house and above the stars her stars and marius angry and bristling his eyes full of outrage i looked at him i am her priestess now i said im to restore her worship thats what she wants but she brought me also for you because you were alone i said marius i saw all this i saw our own wedding in rome as if it were the old days and our families were with us i saw her worshipers he was plainly horrified i didnt want to see this surely i was misunderstanding him i stepped up on the grass i let the boys dry my body i looked up at the stars the house with all its warm lamps seemed crude and fragile a bumbled attempt to make an order of things which could not compare to the making of one complete flower oh how spectacular is the simple night i said it seems an insult to the night to speak of purpose and intent when this common moment is so brimming full of blessed design and tranquillity all things follow their course i stood back and spun around letting the water fly from me i was so strong no dizziness overcame when i stopped i had a sense of infinite power one of the boys held out a tunic for me it was a mans but as ive said so often here roman clothes are very simple it was just a short tunic i put it on and let him tie the sash around my waist i smiled at him he trembled and stepped back from me dry my hair i told him ah such sensations slowly i looked up marius too was dried and dressed he was still looking at me with violent protest and downright indignation someone has to go in i said to change her golden gown that blasphemer he left her bloody i will do that marius said in plain anger oh so it comes to this i said i looked around me seduced by beauty to forget his altogether to come back to him at some later hour after i had roamed beneath the olive trees and consorted with the constellations but his anger hurt me the hurt was strange and deep without the various stages mortal flesh and mind command of pain oh isnt it splendid i said i learn that the goddess reigns that she is real that she has made all things that the world is not just a giant graveyard but i learn this as i find myself in an arranged marriage and behold the groom how he nurses his own temper he sighed and bowed his head was i to see him cry again this flawless familiar and beloved god among crushed flowers he looked up pandora he said shes not a goddess she didnt make the world how dare you say this i have to say it i would have died for the truth when i was alive and will die for it now but she will not let this happen she needs me and she needs you to make me happy so very well i threw my hands i am happy to do it and we will restore her worship we will not he said how can you even think of such a thing marius i want to sing it from the tops of mountains i want to tell the world that this miracle exists i want to run through the streets singing we are to restore her to her throne in a great temple in the very middle of antioch youre talking madness he shouted the boys had run away marius have you stopped up your ears to her commands we are to hunt down and kill her renegade gods and see that new gods are born from her gods who look into souls gods who seek justice not lies gods who are not fantastical lustful idiots or the drunken whimsical creatures of the northern sky who hurl thunderbolts her worship is founded in the good in the pure no no no he said he stepped back as if that would make it all the more emphatic youre talking rot he said stupidity rank superstition i dont believe you said those words i cried you are a monster i said she deserves her throne so does the king who sits beside her they deserve their worshipers bringing flowers to them did you think you had the power to read minds for no good reason i came forward do you remember when i first mocked you in the temple when i said you ought to station yourself at the courts and look into the minds of the accused i had hit the mark in my ridicule no he roared this is absolutely not true he said he turned his back on me rushing into the house i followed him he rushed down the stairway and into her sanctum stopping short before her she and her king sat as before not an eyelash moved only the flowers clung to life in the perfumed air i looked down at my hands so white could i die now would i live centuries like the burnt one i studied their seemingly divine faces they did not smile they did not dream they looked and nothing more i fell down on my knees akasha i whispered may i call you this name tell me what you want there was no change in her none whatsoever well speak mother declared marius his voice thick with sadness speak is it what youve always wanted suddenly he dashed forward mounted the two steps of her dais and pounded on her breasts with his fists i was horrified she didnt move she didnt blink his fist struck a hardness he could not budge only her hair struck by his arm gave a little sway i ran to him and tried to pull him away stop it marius shell destroy you i was amazed at my strength surely it equalled his but he allowed me to pull him back his face flooded with tears oh what have i done he said staring at her oh pandora pandora what have i done ive made another blood drinker when i swore that there would never never be another made not so long as i survived come upstairs i said calmly i glanced at the king and queen no sign of response or recognition it isnt proper marius that we argue here in the shrine come upstairs he nodded he let me lead him slowly out of the room his head was bowed your long barbarian hair is most becoming i said and i have eyes now to see you as never before our blood is intertwined as it might be in a child born to us he wiped at his nose and didnt look at me we walked into the large library marius is there nothing in me that fills your eye nothing you find beautiful oh yes my dear there is everything he said but for the love of heaven bring your wits with you into this dont you see your lifes been stolen not for a sacred truth but for a degraded mystery reading minds doesnt make me any wiser than the next man i kill to live as she once did thousands and thousands of years ago oh and she knew she had to do this she knew the time had come what time what did she know i stared at him i was gradually realizing that i could no longer read his thoughts and surely he couldnt read mine but the hovering boys they were just open books in their fear thinking themselves the servants of kindhearted but very loudvoiced demons marius sighed she did it because i had almost gained the courage to do what i had to do to place them both and myself in the sun and finish forever what the egyptian elder had sought to do rid the world of the king and queen and all the fanged men and women who glut themselves on death oh she is too clever you really planned to do that i asked to immolate them and yourself he made a small sarcastic sound yes of course i planned it next week next month next year next decade after another hundred years maybe in two hundred maybe after id read all the books in the world and seen all the places maybe in five hundred years maybe maybe soon in my loneliness i was at first too stunned to speak he smiled at me wisely and sadly oh but i cry like a child he said softly where comes the confidence i asked to put an end so swiftly to such bold and complex evidence of divine magic magic he cursed id rather if you did not do this i said i dont mean the crying i mean burning up the mother and father and im sure you would he answered and do you think i could bear to do it against your will subject you to the fire you innocent desperate idiot of a woman restore her altars oh restore her worship oh you are out of your mind idiot you dare sling your insults at me you think youve brought a slave into your household you havent even brought a wife yes our minds were locked now to each other and later i would find out that it was because of our heavy exchange of blood but all i knew then was that we had to content ourselves with words like mortal men and women i did not mean to use petty insults he said he was stung well then sharpen your great male reason and your lofty elegant patrician mode of expression i said we glowered at one another yes he said reason he said he held up his finger you are the most clever woman ive ever known and you listen to reason i will explain and you will see that is what must be done yes and you are hotheaded and sentimental and give way to tears again and again and you pound upon the queen herself like a child throwing a tantrum his face went red with immediate anger it sealed his lips against his words he turned and went away do you cast me out i said do you want me gone i shouted this is your house tell me now if you want me gone ill go now he stopped no he said he turned around and looked at me shaken and caught off guard in a raw voice he said dont go pandora he blinked as if to dear his vision dont go please dont and then he let fall a final whisper we have each other and where do you go now to get away from me only to change her dress he said with a sad bitter smile to clean and recostume such bold evidence of complex and divine magic he disappeared i turned to the violet outdoors to the clouds stirred in a cauldron by the moon to defy the darkness to the big old trees that said mount our limbs we will embrace you to the scattered flowers everywhere that said we are your bed lie down with us and so the twohundredyear brawl began and it never really ended with my eyes still closed i heard voices of the city voices from nearby houses i heard men talking as they passed on the road outside i heard music coming from somewhere and the laughter of women and children when i concentrated i could understand what they said i chose not to do this and their voices melded with the breeze suddenly the state seemed unbearable there seemed nothing to do but rush back to the chapel and kneel there and worship these senses i had been given seemed fit for nothing else if this was my destiny then what was to become of me through it all i heard a soul weeping in agony it was an echo of my own a soul broken from a course of great hope who could scarce believe that such fine beginnings should end in terror it was flavius i leapt into the old gnarled olive tree it was as simple as taking a step i stood among the branches and then leapt to the next and then to the top of the wall encrusted with vine i walked along the wall towards the gate there he stood his forehead pressed to the bars both hands clutching at the iron he bled from several slash marks on his cheek he gnashed his teeth flavius i said he looked up with a start lady pandora surely by the light of the moon he saw the miracle wrought in me whatever its cause for i saw the mortality in him the deep wrinkles of his skin the painful flutter of his gaze a thin layer of soil clinging to him all over in the natural moisture of his mortal skin you must go home i said climbing to sit on the wall with legs on the outside i bent down so he could hear me he didnt back away but his eyes were huge with fascination go see to the girls and sleep and get those marks attended to the demons dead you neednt worry anymore about him come back here tomorrow night at sundown he shook his head he tried to speak but he couldnt he tried to gesture but he couldnt his heart thundered in his chest he glanced back down the road to the small farflung lights of antioch he looked at me i heard his heart galloping i felt his shock and his fear and it was fear for me not him fear that some awful fate had befallen me he reached for the gate and clung to the bars right arm hooked around and left hand clasping it as if he wouldnt be moved i saw myself as he saw me in his mind in a boys sashed tunic my hair wildly free sitting atop the wall as if my body were young and pliant all lines of age had gone from me he saw a face on me no one could have ever painted but the point was this the man had reached his limit he could go no further and i knew most fully how i loved him all right i said i stood up and leaned over with both my hands come on ill lift you over the wall if i can he raised his arms doubtful eyes still drinking up every detail of my transformation he weighed nothing i lifted him up and deposited him on his feet within the gate i dropped down on the grass beside him and put my arm around him how hot was his alarm how strong his courage still your heart i said i led him towards the house as he looked down at me his chest heaving as though he were out of breath but it was mere shock ill take care of you i had the thing he said i had it by its arm how opaque his voice sounded how filled with living fluid and effort i sank my dagger into it over and over but it just slashed at my face and it was gone over the wall like a swarm of gnats just darkness immaterial darkness flavius its dead burnt to cinders had i not heard your voice oh i was going mad i heard the boys crying i couldnt climb the wall with this damned leg then i heard your voice and i knew knew you were alive he was filled with happiness you were with your marius the ease with which i could feel his love was sweet and awe inspiring a sudden sense of the shrine came back to me of the queens nectar and the shower of flower petals but i had to maintain my equilibrium in this new state flavius was also profoundly baffled i kissed him on the lips warm mortal lips and then quickly like an artful cat i licked all the blood from the slash marks on his cheeks feeling a shiver run through me i took him into the library which in this house was the main room the boys hovered somewhere about they had been lighting lamps everywhere and now they cowered i could smell their blood and their young human flesh youll stay with me flavius boys can you make a bedroom for my steward on this floor you have fruit and bread dont you i can smell it have you enough furniture to make him a comfortable place to the far right where he is out of the way they came rushing out of their respective hiding places and they too struck me as vividly human i was distracted the smallest natural things about them seemed precious their thick black eyebrows their round little mouths their smooth cheeks yes madam yes they said almost in one voice they hurried forward this is flavius my steward he will stay with us for now take him to the bath heat the water and attend to him get him some wine they took flavius in hand at once but he paused dont abandon me madam he said suddenly with the most serious and thoughtful expression i am loyal in all respects i know i said oh how clearly i understand you cannot imagine then it was off to the bath with the babylonian boys who seemed delighted to have something to do i found mariuss huge closets he had enough clothes for the kings of parthia armenia the emperors mother livia the dead cleopatra and an ostentatious patrician who paid no attention to tiberiuss stupid sumptuary laws i put on a much finer long tunic woven of silk and linen and i chose a gold girdle and with mariuss combs and brushes i made a clean free mantle of my hair free of all tangles rippled and soft as it had been when i was a girl he had many mirrors which as you know in those days were only polished metal and i was rendered somber and mystified by the single fact that i was young again my nipples were pink as i had said the lines of age no longer interrupted the intended endowments of my face or arms perhaps it is most accurate to say that i was timeless timeless in adulthood and every solid object seemed there to serve in me my new strength i looked down at the blocks of marble tile which made up the floor and saw in them a depth a proof of process wondrous and barely understood i wanted to go out again speak to the flowers pick them up in handfuls i wanted to talk urgently with the stars i dared not seek the shrine for fear of marius but if he had not been around i would have gone there and knelt at the mother and merely looked at her looked at her in silent contemplation listening for the slightest articulation though i knew quite certainly after watching mariuss behavior that there would be none she had moved her right arm without the seeming knowledge of the rest of her body she had moved it to kill and then to invite i went into the library sat down at the desk where lay all my pages and i waited finally when marius came he too was freshly dressed his hair parted in the middle and combed to his shoulders he took a chair near me it was ebony and curved and inlaid with gold and i looked at him realizing how very like the chair he was a great preserved extension of all the raw materials which had gone into it nature did the carving and inlay and then the whole had been lacquered i wanted to cry in his arms but i swallowed my loneliness the night would never desert me and it was faithful in every open door with its intruding grass and the veined olive branches rising to catch the light of the moon blessed is she who is made a blood drinker i said when the moon is full and the clouds are rising like mountains in the transparent night probably so he said he moved the lamp that stood on the desk between us so that it didnt flicker in my eyes i made my steward at home here i said i offered him bath bed and clothes do you forgive me i love him and will not lose him its too late now for him to go back into the world hes an extraordinary man marius said and most welcome here tomorrow perhaps he can bring your girls then the boys will have company and there will be some discipline by day flavius knows books among other things youre most gracious i was afraid you would be angry why do you suffer st i cannot read your mind i did not obtain that gift no this wasnt correct i could read flaviuss mind i knew the boys at this very moment were very relieved by flaviuss presence as they helped him dress for bed we are too closely linked by blood he said i can never read your thoughts again either we are thrown back on words like mortals only our senses are infinitely keener and the detachment we know at some times will be as cold as the ice in the north and at other times feelings will enflame us carry us on waves of burning sea hmmm i said you despise me he said softly contritely because i quenched your ecstasy i took from you your joy your convictions he looked quite genuinely miserable i did this to you right at the happiest moment of your conversion dont be so sure you quenched it i might still make her temples preach her worship im an initiate i have only begun you will not revive her worship he said of that i assure you you will tell no one about her or what she is or where she is kept and you will never make another blood drinker my if only tiberius had such authority when he addressed the senate i said all tiberius ever wanted was to study at the gymnasium at rhodes to go every day in a greek soak and sandals and talk philosophy and so the propensity for action flowers in men of lesser mettle who use him in his loveless loneliness is this a lecture for my improvement do you think i dont know this what you dont know is that the senate wont help tiberius govern rome wants an emperor now to worship and to like it was your generation under augustus which accustomed us to forty years of autocratic rule dont talk to me of politics as though i were a fool i should have realized that you understood it all he said i remember you in your girlhood nobody could match your brilliance your fidelity to ovid and his erotic writings was a rare sophistication an understanding of satire and irony a wellnourished roman frame of mind i looked at him his face too had been wiped dean of discernible age i had time now to relish it the squareness of his shoulders the straightness and firmness of his neck the distinct expression of his eyes and wellplaced eyebrows we had been made over into portraits of ourselves in marble by a master sculptor you know i said even under this crushing and annoying barrage of definition and declaration which you make to me as if i were weeping for your ratification i feel love for you and know full well that we are alone in this and married to one another and i am not unhappy he appeared surprised but said nothing i am exalted bruised in the heart i said a hardened pilgrim but i do wish you would not speak to me as if my full indoctrination and education were your primary concern i have to speak this way he said gently his voice was all kindness in its heat it is my primary concern he said if you can understand what happened with the end of the roman republic if you can understand lucretius and the stoics whole then you can understand what we are you have to do this ill let that insult pass i answered im not in the mood for listing for you every philosopher or poet i have read nor for recounting the level of talk around our nighttime table pandora i dont mean any offense but akasha is not a goddess remember your dreams she is a vial of precious strength your dreams told you she could be used that any unscrupulous blood drinker could pass on the blood to another that she is a form of demon host to the power we share she can hear you i whispered outraged of course she can for fifteen years ive been her guardian ive fought off those renegades from the east and other connivers from the african hinterlands she knows what she is no one could have guessed his age save from the seriousness of his expression a man in perfect form that was what he seemed i tried not to be dazzled by him by the pulsing night behind him and yet i wanted so to drift some wedding feast i said i have things to say to the trees they will be there tomorrow night he said the last image i had of her passed before my eyes colored in ecstasy she took the young pharaoh from his chair and broke him into sticks i saw her before that revelation at the beginning of the swoon running down the corridor laughing a slow fear crept over me what is it marius asked confide in me when i drank from her i saw her like a girl laughing i recounted then the marriage the flood of rose petals and then her strange egyptian temple full of frenzied worshipers at last i told him how she had entered the chamber of the little king whose advisors warned him of her gods she broke him up as if he were a boy of wood she said little king little kingdom i picked up my pages which earlier i had placed on this desk i described the last dream i had had of her when she threatened screaming to walk into the sun and destroy her disobedient children i described all the things i had seen the many migrations of my soul my heart hurt so much even as i explained i saw her vulnerability the danger that was embodied in her i explained finally how i had written all this in egyptian i was weary and wished truly that i had never opened eyes on this life i felt the keen and total despair again of those nights of weeping in my little house in antioch when i had pounded on walls and driven my dagger into the dirt if she had not run laughing down that corridor what did the image mean and the little boy king broken so helplessly i made a sum of it easily enough i waited for mariuss belittling remarks i hadnt much patience for him now how do you interpret it he asked gently he tried to take my hand but i withdrew it its bits and pieces of her recollection i said i was heartbroken its what she remembers there is but one suggestion of a future in it all i said there is only one comprehensible image of a wish our wedding that we be together my voice was full of sadness yet i asked him why do you weep again marius i asked she must gather recollections like flowers picked at random from the garden of the world like leaves falling into her hands and from these recollections she fastened for me a garland a wedding garland a trap i have no migrant soul i think not if i did have a migrant soul then why would she alone one so archaic helpless irrelevant to the world itself so out of fashion and out of power be the one to know this to make it known to me the only one to know i looked at him he was engaged yet crying he showed no shame in it and would obviously render no apology what was it you said before i asked that i can read minds makes me no wiser than the next man i smiled that is the key how she laughed as she led me to you how she wanted me to behold you in your loneliness he only nodded i wonder how she knew to cast her net so far i said to find me across the rolling sea lucius thats how she knew she hears voices from many lands she sees what she wants to see one night here i badly startled a roman who appeared to recognize me and then slunk away as if i were a danger to him i went after him thinking vaguely that there was something to this his excessive fear i soon realized a great weight distorted his conscience and twisted his every thought and movement he was terrified to be recognized by someone from the capital he wanted to leave he went to the house of a greek merchant pounding on the door late by torchlight and demanded the payment of a debt owed to your father the greek told him what he had told him before that the money would be repaid only to your father himself the next night i sought lucius out again this time the greek had a surprise for him a letter had just come from your father by military ship this was perhaps four days before your own arrival the letter plainly stated that a favor was being asked of the greek by your father in the name of hospitality and honor if the favor was granted all debts were canceled everything would be explained by a letter accompanying a cargo destined for antioch the cargo would take some time as the ship had many stops to make the favor was of crucial importance when your brother saw the date of this letter he was stricken the greek who was thoroughly sick of lucius by this time slammed the door in his face i accosted lucius only steps away of course he remembered me the eccentric marius of long ago i pretended surprise to see him here and asked after you he was in a panic and made up some story about your being married and living in tuscany and said that he was on his way out of town he hurried off but the moments contact had been enough to see the testimony hed given the praetorian guard against his family all lies and to imagine the deeds that had resulted from it the next time on waking i couldnt find him i kept watch on the house of the greeks i weighed in my mind a visit to the old man the greek merchant some way to lay down a friendship with him i thought of you i pictured you i remembered you i made up poems in my head about you i didnt hear or see anything of your brother i presumed hed left antioch then one night i awoke and came upstairs and looked out to see the city full of random fires germanicus had died never retracting his accusations that piso had poisoned him when i reached the house of the greek merchant it was nothing but burnt timbers i caught no sight or sound of your brother anywhere for all i knew they were all dead your brother and the greek merchant family all through the nights after i searched for sight or sound of lucius i had no idea you were here only an obsessive longing for you i tried to remind myself that if i mourned for every mortal tie i had had when alive i would go mad long before i had learnt anything about my gifts from our king and queen then i was in the booksellers and it was early evening and the priest slipped up to me he pointed to you there you stood in the forum and the philosopher and students were bidding you farewell i was so dose i was so overcome with love i didnt even listen to the priest until i realized he was speaking of strange dreams as he pointed to you he was saying that only i could put it all together it had to do with the blood drinker who had recently been in antioch not an uncommon occurrence i have slain other blood drinkers before ive vowed to catch this one then i saw lucius i saw you come together his anger and guilt were nearly blinding to me with this blood drinkers vision i heard your words effortlessly from a great distance but would not move until you were safely away from him i wanted to kill him then but the wiser course seemed to stay right with you to enter the temple and stay by your side i was not certain of my right to kill your brother for you that it was what you wanted i didnt know that until id told you of his guilt then i knew how much you wanted it done of course i had no idea how clever you had become that all the talent for reason and words id loved in you when you were a girl was still there suddenly you were in the temple thinking three times faster than the other mortals present weighing every aspect of what faced you outwitting everyone and then came the spectacular confrontation with your brother in which you caught him in the most clever net of truths and thereby dispatched him without ever touching him but instead drawing three military witnesses into complicity with his death he broke off then said in rome years ago i followed you you were sixteen i remember your first marriage your father took me aside he was so gentle marius youre destined to be a roaming historian he said i didnt dare tell him my true estimation of your husband and now you come to antioch and i think in my selfcentered manner as you will promptly note if ever a woman was created for me it is this woman and i know as soon as i leave you in the morning that i must somehow get the mother and father out of antioch get them away but then this blood drinker has to be destroyed and then and only then can you be safely left safely abandoned i said do you blame me he asked the question caught me off guard i looked at him for a seemingly endless moment allowing his beauty to fill my eyes and sensing with intolerable keenness his sadness and desperation oh how he needed me how desperately he needed not just any mortal soul in which to confide but me you really did want to protect me didnt you i asked and your explanation of all points is so completely rational it has the elegance of mathematics there is no need for reincarnation or destiny or any miraculous allowance for any part of whats happened its what i believe he said sharply his face grew blank then stern i would never give you anything short of truth are you a woman who wants to be humored dont be fanatical in your dedication to reason i said these words both shocked and offended him dont cling to reason so desperately in a world of so many horrid contradictions he was silenced if you so cling to reason i said then in the passage of time reason may fail you and when it does you may find yourself taking refuge in madness what on earth do you mean youve made of reason and logic religion its obviously the only way you can endure whats happened to you that youre a blood drinker and custodian apparently of these displaced and forgotten deities they arent deities he grew angry thousands of years ago they were made through some mingling of spirit and flesh that rendered them immortal they find their refuge obviously in oblivion in your kindness you characterize it as a garden from which the mother gathered flowers and leaves to make a garland for you a trap as you said but this is your sweet girlish poetry we do not know that they string very many words together i am no sweet girl i said poetry belongs to everyone speak to me i said and put aside these words girl and woman dont be so frightened of me i am not he said angrily you are even as this new blood races through me still eats at me and transforms me i cling to neither reason nor superstition for my safety i can walk through a myth and out of it you fear me because you dont know what i am i look like a woman i sound like a man and your reason tells you the sum total is impossible he rose from the table his face took on a sheen like sweat but far more radiant let me tell you what happened to me he said resolutely good do tell me i said in straightforward manner he let this go by i spoke against my heart i wanted only to love him i knew his cautions but for all his wisdom he displayed an enormous will a mans will and i had to know the source of it i concealed my love how did they lure you they didnt he said calmly i was captured by the keltoi in gaul in the city of massilia i was brought north my hair allowed to grow long then shut up amid barbarians in a great hollow tree in gaul a burnt blood drinker made me into a new god and told me to escape the local priests go south to egypt and find out why all the blood drinkers had been burnt the young ones dying the old one suffering i went for my own reasons i wanted to know what i was i can well understand i said but not before i saw blood worship at its most grisly and unspeakable i was the god mind you marius who followed you adoringly all over rome and it was to me that these men were offered ive read it in caesars history youve read it but you havent seen it how dare you throw at me such a trivial boast forgive me i forgot your childish temper he sighed forgive me i forgot your practical and naturally impatient intellect im sorry i regret my words i had to witness executions of rome it was my duty and that was in the name of law who suffers more or less victims of sacrifice or the law very well i escaped these keltoi and went to egypt and there i found the elder who was the keeper of the mother and the father the queen and the king the first blood drinkers of all time from which this enhancement of our blood flows this elder told me stories that were vague but compelling the royal pair had once been human no more a spirit or demon had possessed one or both lodging itself so firmly that no exorcism could oust it the royal pair could transform others by giving the blood they sought to make a religion it was overthrown again and again it was overthrown anyone who possesses the blood can make another of course this elder claimed ignorance of why so many had been burnt but it was he who had dragged his sacred and royal charges into the sun after centuries of meaningless guardianship egypt was dead he said to me the granary of rome he called it he said the royal pair had not moved in a millennium this filled me with the most remarkable and poetic sense of horror well one days hot light was not enough anymore to destroy the ancient parents but all over the world the children swered and this cowardly elder given only pain for his reward a burned skin lost the courage required to continue the exposure of the royal pair he had no cause one or another akasha spoke to me she spoke as best she could in images pictures of what had happened since the beginning how this tribe of gods and goddesses had sprung from her and rebellions had occurred and how much history was lost and purpose was lost and when it came to the forming of words akasha could make but only a few silent sentences marius take us out of egypt he paused take us out of egypt marius the elder means to destroy us guard us or we perish here he took a breath he was calmer now not so angry but very much shattered and in my ever increasing vampiric vision i knew more about him how very courageous he was how very determined to hold to principles in which he believed in spite of the magic that had swallowed him whole before he had had time even to question it his was an attempt at a noble life in spite of all my fate he said was directly connected to hers to them if i left them the elder would sooner or later put them in the sun again and i lacking the blood of centuries would burn up like wax my life already altered would have been ended but the elder did not ask me to install a new priesthood akasha did not ask me to install a new religion she did not speak of altars or worship only the old burntout god in the northern grove among the barbarians had asked me to do such a thing when he sent me to the south to egypt the motherland of all mysteries how long have you kept them over fifteen years i lose count they never move or speak the wounded ones those burnt so badly that time will take centuries to heal them they learn that i am here they come i try to extinguish them before their minds can give forth a flash of a confirming image to other distant minds she doesnt guide these burnt children to where she is as she once guided me if i am tricked or overwhelmed she moves only as you saw to crush the blood drinker but she has called you pandora reached out for you and we know now to what exact purpose and ive been cruel to you clumsy he turned to me his voice grew tender tell me pandora he asked in the vision you saw when we were married were we young or old were you the girl of fifteen i sought too early perhaps or the mature full blossom of a creature you are now are the families happy are we comely i was hotly embraced by the sincerity of his words the anguish and the pleading that lay behind them we were as we are now i said cautiously answering his smile with my own you were a man fixed in the prime of life forever and i as i am at this hour believe me he said with sweetness in his voice i would not have spoken so harshly on this of all nights but you have now so many other nights to come nothing can kill you now but the sun or fire nothing in you will deteriorate you have a thousand experiences to discover and what of the ecstasy when i drank from her i asked what of her own beginnings and her suffering does she in no way connect herself to the sacred what is sacred he asked shrugging his shoulder tell me what is sacred was it sanctity you saw in her dreams i bowed my head i couldnt answer certainly not the roman empire he said certainly not the temples of augustus caesar certainly not the worship of cybele certainly not the cult of those who worship fire in persia is the name isis sacred anymore or was it ever the elder in egypt my first and only instructor in all this said that akasha invented the stories of isis and osiris to suit her purposes to give a poetry to her worship i think rather she grafted herself upon old stories the demon in those two grows with each new blood drinker made it must but to no purpose that it may know more he said that it may see more feel more through each of us which carries its blood perhaps it is such a creature as that and each of us is but a tiny part of it carrying all its senses and capacities and returning our experiences to it it reaches out through us to know the world i can tell you this he said he paused and put his hands on the desk what burns in me does not care if the victim is innocent or guilty of any crime it thirsts not every night but often it says nothing it does not talk of altars to me in my heart it drives me as though i were the battle steed and it the mounted general it is marius who weeds the good from the bad according to the old custom for reasons you can well understand but not this ravening thirst this thirst knows nature but no morality i love you marius i said you and my father are the only men ive ever really loved but i must go out alone now what did you say he was amazed its just past midnight youve been very patient but i have to walk alone now ill come with you you will not i said but you cant simply roam around antioch on your own alone why not i can hear mortal thoughts now if i want to a litter just passed the slaves are so drunk its a wonder they dont drop the thing and heave the master into the road and he himself is fast asleep i want to walk alone out there in the city in the dark places and the dangerous places and the evil places and the places where even where even a god would not go this is your vengeance on me he said i walked towards the gate and he followed pandora not alone marius my love i said turning taking his hand it is not vengeance the words you spoke earlier girl and woman they have always circumscribed my life i want only now to walk fearlessly with my arms bare and my hair down my hack into any cavern of danger i choose i am drunk still from her blood from yours things shimmer and flicker that should shine i must be alone to ponder all youve said but you have to be back before dawn well before you have to be with me in the crypt below you cant merely lie in some room somewhere the deadly light will penetrate he was so protective so lustrous so infuriated i will be back i said and well before dawn and for now my heart will break if we are not as of this moment bound together we are bound he said pandora you could drive me mad he stopped at the bars of the gate dont come any farther i said as i left i walked down towards antioch my legs had such strength and spring and the dust and pebbles of the road were nothing to my feet and my eyes penetrated the night to see the full conspiracy of owls and little rodents that hovered in the trees eyeing me then fleeing as if their natural senses warned them against me soon i came into the city proper i think the resolution with which i moved from little street to little street was enough to frighten anyone who would have contemplated molesting me i heard only cowardice and erotic curses from the dark those tangled ugly curses men heap on women they desire half threat half dismissal i could sense the people in their houses fast asleep and hear the guards on watch talking in their barracks behind the forum i did all the things the new blood drinkers always do i touched the surfaces of walls and stared enchanted at a common torch and the moths that gave themselves up to it i felt against my naked arms and fragile tunic the dreams of all antioch surrounding me rats fled up and down the gutters and the streets the river gave off its own sound and there came a hollow echoing from the ships at anchor even from the faintest stirring of the water the forum resplendent with its ever burning lights caught the moon as if it were a great human trap for it the very reverse of an earthly crater a manmade design that could be seen and blessed by the intransigent heavens when i came to my own house i found i could climb to the very top easily and there i sat on the tiled roof so relaxed and secure and free looking down into the courtyard into the peristyle where i had really learned alone on those three nights the truths that had prepared me for akashas blood in calmness and without pain i thought it through again as if i owed this reconsideration to the woman i had been the initiate the woman who had sought refuge in the temple marius was right the queen and king were possessed of some demon which spread through the blood feeding upon it and growing as i could feel it doing in me now the king and queen did not invent justice the queen who broke the little pharaoh into sticks did not invent law or righteousness and the roman courts bumbling awkwardly towards each decision weighing all sides refusing any magical or religious device they did even in these terrible times strive for justice it was a system based not upon the revelation of the gods but upon reason but i could not regret the moment of intoxication when id drunk her blood and believed in her and seen the flowers come down upon us i could not regret that any mind could conceive of such perfect transcendence she had been my mother my queen my goddess my all i had known it as we were meant to know it when we drink the potions in the temple when we sing when we are rocking in delirious song and in her arms i had known it in mariuss arms id known it as well and in a safer measure and i wanted only to be with him now how ghastly her worship seemed flawed and ignorant being elevated to such power and how revealing suddenly that at the core of mysteries there should lie such degrading explanations blood spilt on her golden gown all images and meaningful glimpses do but teach you deeper things i thought again as i had in the temple when i had settled for the consolation of a basalt statue it is i and i alone who must make of my new life a heroic tale i was very happy for marius that he had such comfort in reason but reason was only a created thing imposed with faith upon the world and the stars promise nothing to no one i had seen something deeper in those dark nights of hiding in this house in antioch in mourning for my father i had seen that at the very heart of creation there very well might lie something as uncontrollable and incomprehensible as a raging volcano its lava would destroy trees and poets alike so take this gift pandora i told myself go home thankful that you are again wed for you have never made a better match or seen a more tantalizing future when i returned and my return was very rapid full of new lessons in how i might pass quickly over rooftops scarce touching them and over walls when i returned i found him as i had left him only much sadder he sat in the garden just as he had in the vision shown to me by akasha it must have been a place he loved behind the villa with its many doors a bench facing a thicket and a natural stream bubbling up and over the rocks and spilling down into a current through high grass he rose at once i took him in my arms marius forgive me i said dont say such a thing im to blame for it all and i didnt protect you from it we were in each others arms i wanted to press my teeth into him drink his blood and then i did and felt him taking the blood from me this was a union more powerful than any i had ever known in a marriage bed and i yielded to it as i never yielded in life to anyone i felt an exhaustion sweep me suddenly i withdrew my kiss with its teeth come on now he said your slave is asleep and during the day while we must sleep he will bring all your possessions here and those girls of yours should you want to keep them we walked down the stairs we entered another room it took all mariuss strength to pull back the door which meant simply that no mortal man could do it there lay a sarcophagus plain of granite can you lift the lid of the sarcophagus marius asked i am feeling weald its the sun rising try to ift the lid slide it to one side i did and inside i found a bed of crushed lilies and rose petals of silken pillows and bits of dried flower kept for scent i stepped in turned around sat and stretched out in this stone prison at once he took his place in the tomb beside me and pushed the lid back to its place and all the worlds light in any form was shut out as if the dead would have it so im drowsy i can hardly form words what a blessing he said there is no need for such an insult i murmured but i forgive you pandora i love you he said helplessly put it inside me i said reaching between his legs fill me and hold me this is stupid and superstitious it is neither i said it is symbolic and comforting he obeyed our bodies were one connected by this sterile organ which was no more to him now than his arm but how i loved the arm he threw over me and the lips he pressed to my forehead i love you marius my strange tall and beautiful marius i dont believe you he said his voice barely a whisper what do you mean youll despise me soon enough for what ive done to you not so oh rational one i am not as eager to grow old wither and die as you might think i should like a chance to know more to see more i felt his lips against my forehead did you really try to marry me when i was fifteen oh agonizing memories your fathers insults still sting my ears he had me all but thrown out of your house i love you with my whole heart i whispered and you have won you have me now as your wife i have you as something but i do not think that wife is the word for it i wonder that youve already forgotten your earlier strenuous objection to the term together i said scarce able to talk on account of his kisses i was drowsy and loved the feel of his lips their sudden eagerness for pure auction well think of another word more exalted than wife suddenly i moved back i could not see him in the dark are you kissing me so that i will not talk yes thats exactly what i was doing he said i turned away from him turn back please he said no i said i lay still realizing dimly that his body felt quite normal to me now because mine was as hard as his was as strong perhaps what a sublime advantage oh but i loved him i loved him so let him kiss the back of the neck he could not force me to turn towards him the sun must have risen for a silence fell on me which was as if the universe with all its volcanoes and raging tides and all its emperors kings judges senators philosophers and priests had been erased from existence ii well david there you have it i could continue the plautusterence style comedy for pages i could vie with shakespeares much ado about nothing but that is the basic story that is what lies behind the flippant capsule version in the vampire lestat fashioned into its final trivial form by marius or lestat who knows let me lead you through those points which are sacred and burn still in my heart no matter how easily they have been dismissed by another and the tale of our parting is not mere dissonance but may contain some lesson marius taught me to hunt to catch the evildoer only and to kill without pain enwrapping the soul of my victim in sweet visions or allowing the soul to illuminate its own death with a cascade of fantasies which i must not judge but merely devour like the blood all that does not require detailed documentation we were matched in strength when some burnt and ruthlessly ambitious blood drinker did find his way to antioch which happened only a few times and then not at all we executed the supplicant together these were monstrous mentalities forged in ages we could hardly understand and they sought the queen like jackals seek the bodies of the human dead there was no argument between us over any of them we often read aloud to each other and we laughed together at petroniuss satyricon and we shared both tears and laughter later as we read the bitter satires of juvenal there was no end of new satire and history coming from rome and from alexandria but something forever divided marius from me love grew but so did constant argument and argument became more and more the dangerous cement of the bond over the years marius guarded his delicate rationality as a vestal virgin guards a sacred flame if ever any ecstatic emotion took hold of me he was there to grab me by the shoulders and tell me in no uncertain terms that it was irrational irrational irrational irrational when the terrible earthquake of the second century struck antioch and we were unharmed i dared speak of it as a divine blessing this set marius into a rage and he was quick to point that the same divine intervention had also protected the roman emperor trajan who was in the city at the time what was i to make of that for the record antioch quickly rebuilt itself the markets flourished more slaves poured in nothing stopped the caravans headed for the ships and the ships headed for the caravans but long before that earthquake we had all but come to blows night after night if i lingered for hours in the room of the mother and the father marius invariably came to collect me and bring me back to my senses he could not read in peace with me in such a state he declared he could not think because he knew i was downstairs deliberately inviting madness why i demanded must his domination extend to every corner of our entire house and garden and how was it that i was his match in strength when an old burnt blood drinker found his way to antioch and we picked up the word of his killing and had to do away with him we are not matched in minds i demanded only you could ask that question came his reply of course the mother and father never moved or spoke again no blood dreams no divine directive ever reached me only now and then did marius remind me of this and after a long while he allowed me to tend the shrine with him to see full well the extent of their silent and seemingly mindless compliance they appeared utterly beyond reach their cooperation was sluggish and frightening to witness when flavius fell ill in his fortieth year marius and i had the first of our truly terrible battles this came early on well before the earthquake it was by the way a wondrous time because the wicked old tiberius was filling antioch with new and wonderful buildings she was the rival of rome but flavius was ill marius could scarce bear it he had become more than fond of flavius they talked about aristotle all the time and flavius proved one of those men who can do anything for you from managing a household to copying the most esoteric and crumbling text with complete accuracy flavius had never put a single question to us as to what we were in his mind i found devotion and acceptance far superseded curiosity or fear we hoped flavius had only a minor illness but finally as flaviuss fever grew worse flavius turned his head away from marius whenever marius came to him but he held on to my hand always when i offered it frequently i lay beside him for hours as he had once lain beside me then one night marius took me to the gate and said hell be dead by the time i come back can you bear this alone do you run from it i asked no he said but he doesnt want me to see him die he doesnt want me to see him groan in pain i nodded marius left marius had long ago laid down the rule that no other blood drinker was ever to be made i didnt bother to question him on this as soon as he was gone i made flavius into a vampire i did it just the way the burnt one marius and akasha had done it to me for marius and i had long discussed the methods withdraw as much blood as you can then give it back until you are near to fainting i did faint and wake to see this splendid greek standing over me smiling faintly all disease gone from him he reached down to take my hand and help me to my feet marius walked in stared at the reborn flavius in amazement and said get out out of this house out of this city out of this province out of this empire flaviuss last words to me were thank you for this dark gift that is the first i ever heard that particular phrase which appears so often in lestats writings how well this learned athenian understood it for hours i avoided marius i would never be forgiven then i went out into the garden i discovered marius was grieving and when he looked up i realized that he had been utterly convinced that i meant to go off with flavius when i saw this i took him in my arms he was full of quiet relief and love he forgave me at once for my absolute rashness dont you see i said taking him in hand that i adore you but you cannot rule over me can you not consider in your reasonable fashion that the greatest part of our gift eludes you its the freedom from the confines of male female you cant convince me he said for one moment that you dont feel reason and act in the manner of a woman we both loved flavius but why another blood drinker i dont know except that flavius wanted it flavius knew all about our secrets there was a an understanding between me and flavius he had been loyal in the darkest hours of my mortal life oh i cant explain it a woman s sentiments exactly and you have launched this creature into eternity he joins our search i replied about the middle of the century when the city was very rich and the empire was about as peaceful as it was ever going to be for the next two hundred years the christian paul came to antioch i went to hear him speak one night and came home saying casually that the man could convert the very stones to this faith such was his personal power how can you spend your time on such things marius demanded christians they arent even a cult some worship john some worship jesus they fight amongst one another dont you see what this man paul has done no what i said i didnt say i was going to join the sect i only said i stopped to hear him who is hurt by that you your mind your equilibrium your common sense its compromised by the foolish things in which you take an interest and frankly the principle of truth is hurt he had only just begun let me tell you about this man paul marius said he never knew either the baptizer john or the galilean jesus the hebrews have thrown him out of the group jesus and john were both hebrews and so paul has now turned to everyone jew and christian alike and roman and greek and said you neednt follow the hebrew observance forget the feasts in jerusalem forget circumcision become a christian yes that is true i said with a sigh its a very easy religion to take up he said its nothing you have to believe that this man rose from the dead and by the way ive combed the available texts which are floating all over the marketplaces have you no im surprised youve found this search worthy of your time i dont see anywhere in the writings of those who knew john and jesus where these two are quoted as saying either one of them will rise from the dead or that all who believe in them will have life after death paul added all that what an enticing promise and you should hear your friend paul on the subject of hell what a cruel vision that flawed mortals could sin in this life so grievously that they would burn for all eternity hes not my friend you make so much of my passing remarks why do you feel so strongly i told you i care about what is true what is reasonable well theres something youre missing about this group of christians some way in which when they come together they share a euphoric love and they believe in great generosity oh not again and are you to tell me this is good i didnt answer he was returning to his work when i spoke you fear me i said to him you fear that ill be swept off my feet by somebody of belief and abandon you no no thats not right you fear that you will be swept up that the world will somehow entice you back into it so that you wont live here with me the superior roman observer recluse anymore but go back seeking mortal comforts of companionship and proximity to others friendship with mortals their recognition of you as one of them when you are not one of them pandora you talk gibberish keep your proud secrets i said but i do fear for you that i will admit fear for me and why he demanded because you dont realize everything perishes everything is artifice that even logic and mathematics and justice have no ultimate meaning thats not true he said oh yes it is some night will come when you will see what i saw when i first came to antioch before youd found me before this transformation which should have swept away everything in its path you will see a darkness i went on a darkness so total that nature never knows it anywhere on earth at any time in any place only the human soul can know it and it goes on forever and i pray that when you finally can no longer escape from it when you realize it is all around you that your logic and your reason give you some strength against it he gave me the most respectful look but he didnt speak i continued resignation will do you no good i said when such a time comes resignation requires will and will requires decision and decision requires belief and belief requires that there is something to believe in and all action or acceptance requires a concept of a witness well there is nothing and there are no witnesses you dont know that yet but i do i hope when you find it out someone can comfort you as you dress and groom those monstrous relics below the stairs as you bring their flowers i was so angry i went on look back on me when this moment comes if not for forgiveness look back on me as a model for i have seen this and i have survived and it matters not that i stopped to listen to paul preach of christ or that i weave flowers into crowns for the queen or that i dance like a fool under the moon in the garden before dawn or that i that i love you it matters not because there is nothing and no one to see no one i sighed it was time to finish go back to your history this stack of lies that tries to link event to event with cause and effect this preposterous faith that postulates that one thing follows from another i tell you its not so but it is very roman of you to think so he sat silent looking up at me i couldnt tell what his thoughts were or what his heart felt then he asked what would you have me do he had never looked more innocent bitterly i laughed did we not speak the same language he heard not one word i had uttered yet he presented me not with a reply but only with this simple question all right i said ill tell you what i want love me marius love me but leave me alone i cried out i had not even thought the words just came leave me alone so that i may seek my own comforts my own means to remain alive no matter how foolish or pointless these comforts appear to you leave me alone he was wounded so uncomprehending looking so innocent still we had many similar arguments as the decades passed sometimes he would come to me after he would fall into long thoughtful talks about what he felt was happening with the empire how the emperors were going mad and the senate had no power how the very progress of man was unique in nature and something to be watched how he would crave life he thought until there was no more life even if there is nothing left but desert waste he said i should want to be there to see dune folding upon dune he went on if there was but one lamp left in all the world id want to watch its flame and so would you but the terms of the battle and its heat never really changed at heart he thought i hated him for having been so unkind on the night i was given the dark blood i told him this was childish i could not convince him that my soul and my intelligence were infinitely too large for such a simple grudge and that i owed him no explanation for my thoughts words and deeds for two hundred years we lived and loved together he became ever more beautiful to me as more and more barbarians from the north and from the east poured into the city he felt no necessity to dress like a roman anymore and frequently wore the jeweled clothes of the easterners his hair seemed to be growing finer lighter he seldom cut it which of course he would have had to do every night had he wanted it short it was a splendor on his shoulders as his face grew ever more smooth away went the few lines that could so easily design anger in his expression as ive told you before he greatly resembles lestat only he is more compact of build and jaw and chin had hardened just a little more with age before the dark gift but the unwanted folds were receding from his eyes sometimes for nights on end in fear of a fight we didnt speak there was between us always a continuous physical affection embraces kisses sometimes the mere silent lock of our hands but we knew we had now lived far beyond a normal human life span you need from me no detailed history of that remarkable time it is too well known only let me place here a few reminders only let me describe for you my perspective on the changes happening all over the empire antioch as a thriving city proved indestructible the emperors began to favor it and visit it more temples went up to the eastern cults and then christians of all kinds poured into antioch indeed the christians of antioch comprised at last an immense and fascinating bunch of people arguing with each other rome went to war on the jews crushing jerusalem completely and destroying the sacred hebrew temple many brilliant jewish thinkers came to antioch as well as alexandria twice or perhaps even three times roman legions pushed past us north of us into parthia once we even had a little rebellion of our own but rome always resecured the city of antioch so the market closed for a day on went the trade the great lust of the caravans for the ships and of the ships for the caravans and antioch was the bed in which they must wed each other there was little new poetry satire satire seemed the only safe or honest expression of the roman mind now and so we had the riotously funny story the golden ass by apuleius which seemed to make fun of every religion but there was a bitterness to the poet martial and those letters of pliny which reached me were full of dire judgments on the moral chaos of rome i began as a vampire to feed exclusively on soldiers i liked them their look their strength i fed so much so on them that in my carelessness i became a legend amongst them the greek lady death this on account of my clothes which to them appeared archaic i struck at random in the dark streets there wasnt a chance of their ever surrounding me or stopping me so great was my skill my strength and my thirst but i saw things in their rebellious deaths the blaze of a pitched battle in a march a handtohand struggle on a steep mountain i took them down gently into the finish filling myself to the brim with their blood and sometimes through a veil it seemed i saw the souls of those whom they themselves had slain when i told marius this he said it was just the kind of mystical nonsense he would expect of me i didnt press the point he watched with keen interest the developments of rome to me they seemed merely surprising he pored over the histories of dio cassius and plutarch and tacitus and pounded his fist when he heard of the endless skirmishes on the rhine river and the push northward into britannia and the building of hadrians wall to forever keep away the scots who like the germans would yield to no one they are not patrolling preserving containing an empire any longer he said conserving a way of life its just war and trade i couldnt disagree it was really even worse than he knew if he had gone as often as i did to listen to the philosophers he would have been appalled magicians were appearing everywhere claiming to be able to fly to see visions to heal with the laying on of hands they got into battles with the christians and the jews i dont think the roman army paid them any attention medicine as i had known it in my mortal life had been flooded with a river of eastern secret formulae amulets rituals and little statues to clutch well over half the senate was no longer italian by birth this meant that our rome was no longer our rome and the title of emperor had become a joke there were so many assassinations plots squabbles false emperors and palace coups that it soon became perfectly clear that the army ruled the army chose the emperor the army sustained him the christians were divided into warring sects it was positively astonishing the religion didnt burn itself out in dispute it gained strength in division occasional furious persecutions in which people were executed for not worshiping at roman altars only seemed to deepen the sympathy of the populace with this new cult and the new cult was rampant with debate on every principle with regard to the jews god and jesus the most amazing thing had happened to this religion spreading wildly on fast ships good roads and wellmaintained trade routes it suddenly found itself in a peculiar position the world had not come to an end as jesus and paul had predicted and everybody who had ever known or seen jesus was dead finally everyone who had ever known paul was dead christian philosophers arose picking and choosing from old greek ideas and old hebrew traditions justin of athens wrote that christ was the logos you could be an atheist and still be saved in christ if you upheld reason i had to tell this to marius i thought sure it would set him off and the night was dull but he merely countered with more outlandish talk of the gnostics a man named saturninus popped up in the forum today he said perhaps you heard talk of him he preaches a wild variant of this christian creed you find so amusing in which the god of the hebrews is actually the devil and jesus the new god this was not the mans first appearance he and his followers thanks to the local christian bishop ignatius are headed for alexandria there are books with those ideas already here i said having come from alexandria they are impenetrable to me perhaps not to you they speak of sophia a female principle of wisdom which preceded the creation jews and christians alike want somehow to include this concept of sophia in their faith it so reminds me of our beloved isis your beloved isis he said it seems that there are minds who would weave it all together every myth or its essence to make a glorious tapestry pandora you are making me ill again he warned let me tell you what your christians are doing they are tightly organizing this bishop ignatius will be followed by another and the bishops want to lay down now that the age of private revelation had ended they want to weed through all the mad scrolls on the market and make a canon which all christians believe i never thought such could happen i said i agreed with you more than you knew when you condemned them they are succeeding because they are moving away from emotional morality he said they are organizing like romans this bishop ignatius is very strict he delegates power he pronounced on the accuracy of manuscripts notice the prophets are getting thrown out of antioch yes youre right i said what do you thinks is it good or bad i want the world to be better he said better for men and women better only one thing is dear the old blood drinkers have by now died out and there is nothing you or i or the queen and the king can do to interfere in the flow of human events i believe men and women must try harder i try to understand evil ever more deeply with any victim i take any religion that makes fanatical claims and demands on the basis of a gods will frightens me you are a true augustan i said i agree with you but it is fun to read these mad gnostics this marcion and this valentinus fun for you perhaps i see danger everywhere this new christianity it isnt merely spreading its changing in each place as it spreads its like an animal which devours the local flora and fauna and then takes on some specific power from the food i didnt argue with him by the end of the second century antioch was a heavily christian city and it seemed to me as i read the works of new bishops and philosophers that worse things than christianity could come upon us realize however david that antioch did not lie under a cloud of decay there was no sense in the air of the end of the empire if anything there was bustling energy everywhere commerce gives one this feel that false sense that there is growth and creativity perhaps when there is none things are exchanged not necessarily improved then came the dark time for us two forces came together which bore down on marius straining all his courage antioch was more interesting than it had ever been the mother and the father had never stirred since the first night of my coming let me describe the first disaster because for me it was not so hard to bear and i had only sympathy for marius as ive told you the question of who was emperor had become a joke but it really became a howl with the events of the early s the emperor of the moment was caracalla a regular murderer on a pilgrimage to alexandria to see the remains of alexander the great he had for reasons no one knows even now rounded up thousands of young alexandrians and slaughtered them alexandria had never seen such a massacre marius was distraught all the world was distraught marius spoke of leaving antioch of getting far far away from the ruin of the empire i began to agree with him then this revolting emperor caracalla marched in our direction intending to make a war on the parthians north of us and to the east of us nothing out of the ordinary for antioch his mother and you need not remember these names julia domna took up residence in antioch she was dying from cancer of her breast and let me add here that this woman had with her son caracalla helped murder her other son geta because the two brothers had been sharing imperial power and threatening to make a civil war let me continue and again you need not remember the names troops were massed for this eastern war against two kings to the east vologases the fifth and artabanus the fifth caracalla did make war achieve victory and return in triumph then only miles from antioch he was assassinated by his own soldiers while trying to relieve himself all this cast marius in a hopeless frame of mind for hours he sat in the shrine staring at the mother and the father i felt i knew what he was thinking that we should immolate ourselves and them but i couldnt bear the thought of it i didnt want to die i didnt want to lose life i didnt want to lose marius i did not care so much about the fate of rome life still stretched before me extending the promise of wonders back to the comedy the army promptly made an emperor out of a man from the provinces named macrinus who was a moor and wore an earring in his ear he at once had a fight with the dead emperors mother julia domna because he wouldnt allow her to leave antioch to die elsewhere she starved herself to death this was all too dose to home these lunatics were in our city not far away in a capital which we mourned then war broke out again because the eastern kings who were caught off guard before by caracalla were now ready and macrinus had to lead the legions into battle as i told you the legions now controlled everything somebody should have told macrinus instead of fighting he bought off the enemy the troops were hardly proud of this and then he cracked down on them taking away some of their benefits he didnt seem to grasp that he had to maintain their approval to survive though of course what good had this done for caracalla whom they loved whatever the sister of julia domna named julia maesa who was a syrian and of a family dedicated to the syrian sun god seized this dreary moment in the life of the lusty legions to put her grandson born of julia soemis in power as emperor it was an outrageous plan actually for any number of reasons first and foremost all three julias were syrian the boy himself was fourteen years old and also he was a hereditary priest of the syrian sun god but somehow or other julia maesa and her daughters lover gannys managed to convince a bunch of soldiers in a tent that this fourteenyearold syrian boy should become the emperor of rome the army deserted the imperial macrinus and he and his son were hunted down and murdered so high on the shoulders of proud soldiers rode this fourteenyearold boy but he didnt want to be called by his roman name he wanted to be called by the name of the god he worshiped in syria elagabalus the very presence of him in antioch shook the nerves of all citizens at last he and three remaining julias his aunt his mother and his grandmother all of them syrian priestesses left antioch in nicomedia which was very near to us elagabalus murdered his mothers lover so who was left he also picked up an enormous sacred black stone and brought it back to rome saying that this stone was sacred to the syrian sun god whom all must now worship he was gone across the sea but it took sometimes no more than eleven days for a letter to reach antioch from rome and soon there were rampant rumors who will ever know the truth about him elagabalus he built a temple for the stone on the palatine hill he made romans stand around in phoenician gowns while he slaughtered cattle and sheep in sacrifice he begged the physicians to try to transform him into a woman by creating a proper opening between his legs romans were horrified by this at night he dressed as a woman complete with a wig and went prowling taverns all over the empire the soldiers started to riot even the three julias grandmother julia maesa his aunt julia domna and his own mother julia soemis started to get sick of him after four years four years mind you of this maniacs rule the soldiers killed him and threw his body in the tiber it did not seem to marius that there was anything left of the world we had once called rome and he was thoroughly sick of all the christians in antioch their fights over doctrine he found all mystery religions dangerous now he served up this lunatic emperor as a perfect example of the fanaticism gaining ground in the times and he was right he was right it was all i could do to keep him from despair in truth he had not yet confronted that terrible darkness i had once spoken of he was far too agitated far too irritated and quarrelsome but i was very frightened for him and hurt for him and didnt want him to see more darkly as i did to be more aloof expecting nothing and almost smiling at the collapse of our empire then the very worst thing happened something we had both feared in one form or another but it came upon us in the worst possible form one night there appeared at our eternally open doors five blood drinkers neither of us had caught the sound of their approach lounging about with our books we looked up to see these five three women and a man and a boy and to realize that all wore black garments they were dressed like christian hermits and ascetics who deny the flesh and starve themselves antioch had a whole passel of these men in the desert roundabouts but these were blood drinkers dark of hair and eye and dark of skin they stood before us their arms folded dark of skin i thought quickly they are young they were made after the great burning so what if there are five they had in general rather attractive faces wellshaped features and groomed eyebrows and deep dark eyes and all over them i saw the marks of their living bodies tiny wrinkles next to their eyes wrinkled around their knuckles they seemed as shocked to see us as we were to see them they stared at the brightly lighted library they stared at our finery which was in such contrast to their ascetic robes well said marius who are you cloaking my thoughts i tried to probe theirs their minds were locked they were dedicated to something it had the very scent of fanaticism i felt a horrid foreboding they started timidly to enter the open door no stop please said marius in greek this is my house tell me who you are and then i perhaps shall invite you over my threshold youre christians arent you i said you have the zeal we are said one in greek it was the man we are the scourge of humanity in the name of god and his son christ we are the children of darkness who made you asked marius we were made in a sacred cave and in our temple said another a woman speaking in greek also we know the truth of the serpent and his fangs are our fangs i limbed to my feet and moved towards marius we thought you would be in rome said the young man he had short black hair and very round innocent eyes because the christian bishop of rome is now supreme among christians and the theology of antioch is no longer of great matter why would we be in rome asked marius what is the roman bishop to us the woman took the fore her hair was severely parted in the middle but her face was very regal and regular she had in particular beautifully defined lips why do you hide from us we have heard of you for years we know that you know things about us and where the dark gift came from that you know how god put it into the world and that you saved our kind from extinction marius was plainly horrified but gave little sign of it i have nothing to tell you he said perhaps too hastily except i do not believe in your god or your christ and i do not believe god put the dark gift as you call it into the world you have made a terrible mistake they were highly skeptical and utterly dedicated you have almost reached salvation said another the boy at the far end of the line whose hair was unshorn and hung to his shoulders he had a manly voice but his limbs were small you have almost reached the point where you are so strong and white and pure that you need not drink would that that were true its not said marius why dont you welcome us asked the boy why dont you guide us and teach us that we may better spread the dark blood and punish mortals for their sins we are pure of heart we were chosen each of us went into the cave bravely and there the dying devil a crushed creature of blood and bone cast out of heaven in a blaze of fire passed on to us his teachings which were what asked marius make them suffer the woman said bring death eschew all things of the world as do the stoics and the hermits of egypt but bring death punish them the woman had become hostile this man wont help us she said under her breath this man is profane this man is a heretic but you must receive us said the young man who had spoken first we have searched so long and so far and we come to you in humility if you wish to live in a palace then perhaps that is your right you have earned it but we have not we live in darkness we enjoy no pleasure but the blood we feast on the weak and the diseased and the innocent alike we do the will of christ as the serpent did the will of god in eden when he tempted eve come to our temple said one of the others and see the tree of life with the sacred serpent wound around it we have his fangs we have his power god made him just as god made judas iscariot or cain or the evil emperors of rome ah i said i see before you happened on the god in the cave you were worshipers of the snake youre ophites sethians nassenians that was our first calling said the boy but now we are of the children of darkness committed to sacrifice and killing dedicated to inflicting suffering oh marcion and valentinus marius whispered you dont know the names do you theyre the poetic gnostics who invented the morass of your philosophy a hundred years ago duality that in a christian world evil could be as powerful as good yes we know this several spoke at once we dont know those profane names but we know the serpent and what god wants of us moses lifted the serpent in the desert up over his head said the boy even the queen of egypt knew the serpent and wore him in her crown the story of the great leviathan has been eradicated in rome said the woman they took it out of the sacred books but we know it so you learned all this from armenian christians said marius or was it syrians a man short of stature with gray eyes had not spoken all this while but he stepped forward now and addressed marius with considerable authority you hold ancient truths he said and you use them profanely all know of you the blond children of darkness in the northern woods know of you and that you stole some important secret out of egypt before the birth of christ many have come here glimpsed you and the woman and gone away in fear very wise said marius what did you find in egypt asked the woman christian monks live now in those old rooms that once belonged to a race of blood drinkers the monks dont know about us but we know all about them and you there was writing there there were secrets there was something that by divine will belongs now in our hands no there was nothing said marius the woman spoke up again when the hebrews left egypt when moses parted the red sea did the hebrews leave something behind why did moses raise the snake in the desert do you know how many we are nearly a hundred we travel to the far north to the south and even to the east to lands you would not believe i could see marius was distraught very well i said we understand what you want and why you have been led to believe that we can satisfy you i ask you please to go out in the garden and let us speak respect our house dont harm our slaves we wouldnt dream of it and well be back shortly i snatched mariuss hand and pulled him down the stairs where are you going he whispered block all images from your mind they must glimpse nothing they wont glimpse i said and from where i will stand as i talk to you they wont hear either he seemed to catch my meaning i led him into the sanctuary of the unchanged mother and father closing the stone doors behind me i drew marius behind the seated king and queen they can probably hear the hearts of the pair i whispered in the softest manner audible but maybe they wont hear us over that sound now we have to kill them destroy them completely marius was amazed look you know we have to do this i said you have to kill them and anybody like them who ever comes near us why are you so shocked get ready the simplest way is cut them to pieces first and then burn them oh pandora he sighed marius why do you cringe i dont cringe pandora he said i see myself irrevocably changed by such an act to kill when i thirst to keep to myself and keep these here who must be kept by somebody that i have done for so long but to become an executioner to become like the emperors burning christians to commence a war against this race this order this cult whatever it is to take such a stand no choice come on there are many decorative swords in the room where we sleep we should take the big curved swords and the torch we should go to them and tell them how sorry we are for what we must impart to them then do it he didnt answer marius are you going to let them go so that others will come after us the only security lies in destroying every blood drinker who ever discovers us and the king and queen he walked away from me and stood before the mother he looked into her eyes i knew that he was silently talking to her and i knew that she was not answering there is one other possibility i said and its quite real i beckoned for him to come back behind them where i felt safest to plot what is it he asked give the king and the queen over to them and you and i are free they will care for the king and queen with religious fervor maybe the king and queen will even allow them to drink thats unspeakable he said exactly my feelings we shall never know if we are safe and they shall run rampant through the world like supernatural rodents so do you have a third plan no but im ready we use the fire and the swords together can you tell the lies that will charm them as we approach armed and carrying torches oh yes of course i said we went into the chamber and took up the big curved swords that were keenly sharp and came from the desert world of the arabs we lighted another torch from that at the foot of the stairs and we went up together come to me children i said as i entered the room loudly come for what i have to reveal requires the light of this torch and you will soon know the sacred purpose of this sword how devout you are we stood before them how young you are i said suddenly the panic swept them together they made it so simple for us by clustering in this manner that we had the task done in moments lighting their garments hacking their limbs ignoring their piteous cries never had i used my full strength and speed never my full will as i did against them it was exhilarating to slash them to force the torch upon them to slash them until they fell until they lost all life also i did not want them to suffer because they were so young so very young as blood drinkers it took quite some time to burn the bones to see that all was ashes but it was finally done and we stood together marius and i in the garden our garments smeared with soot staring down at blowing grass making certain with our eyes that the ashes were blown in all directions marius turned suddenly and walked fast away from me and down the stairs and into the mothers sanctuary i rushed after him in panic he stood holding the torch and the bloody sword oh how they had bled and he looked into akashas eyes oh loveless mother he whispered his face was soiled with blood and grime he looked at the flaming torch and looked up at the queen akasha and enkil showed no sign of any knowledge of the massacre above they showed neither approval nor gratitude nor any form of consciousness they showed no awareness of the torch in his hand or his thoughts whatever they might be it was a finish for marius a finish to the marius i had known and loved at that time he chose not to leave antioch i was for getting away and taking them away for wild adventures and seeing the wonders of the world but he said no he had but one obligation and that was to lay in wait for others until he had killed every one of them for weeks he wouldnt speak or move unless i shook him and then he pleaded with me to leave him alone he rose from the grave only to sit with the sword and the torch waiting it became unbearable to me months passed i said you are going mad we should take them away then one night very angry and alone i cried out foolishly i would i were free of them and you and leaving the house i did not return for three nights i slept in dark safe places i made for myself with ease every time i thought of him i thought of his sitting motionless there so very like them and i was afraid if only he did know true despair if only he had confronted what we now call the absurd if only he had faced the nothingness then this massacre would not have demoralized him finally one morning just before sunrise when i was safely hidden a strange silence fell over antioch a rhythm i had heard there all my days was gone i was trying to think what could this mean but there was time to find out i had made a fatal miscalculation the villa was empty he had arranged for the transport by day i had no due as to where he had gone everything belonging to him had been taken and all that i possessed scrupulously left behind i had failed him when he most needed me i walked in circles around the empty shrine i screamed and let the cry echo off the walls he never returned to antioch no letter ever came after six months or more i gave up and left of course you know the dedicated religious christian vampires never died out not until lestat came dressed in red velvet and fur to dazzle them and make a mockery of their belief that was in the age of reason that is when marius received lestat who knows what other vampire cults exist as for me i had lost marius again by then i had seen him for only a single precious night one hundred years earlier and of course thousands of years after the collapse of what we call the ancient world i saw him it was in the fancy fragile times of louis xiv the sun king we were at a court ball in dresden music played the tentative blend of clavichord lute violin making the artful dances which seemed no more than bows and circles across a room i suddenly saw marius he had been looking at me for a great while and gave me now the most tragic and loving smile he wore a big fullbottomed curly wig dyed to the very color of his true hair and a flared velvet coat and layers of lace so favored by the french his skin was golden that meant fire i knew suddenly he had suffered something terrible a jubilant love filled his blue eyes and without forsaking his casual posture he was leaning his elbow on the edge of the clavichord he blew a kiss to me with his fingers i truly could not trust my eyes was he really there was i myself sitting here in boned and lownecked bodice and these huge skirts one pulled back in artful folds to reveal the other my skin in this age seemed an artificial contrivance my hair had been professionally gathered and lifted into an ornate shape i had paid no mind to the mortal hands which had so bound me during this age i let myself be led through the world by a fierce asian vampire about whom i cared nothing i had fallen into an ever existing trap for a woman i had become the noncommittal and ostentatious ornament of a male personality who for all his tiresome verbal cruelty possessed sufficient force to carry us both through time the asian was off slowly taking his carefully chosen victim in a bedroom above marius came towards me and kissed me and took me in his arms i shut my eyes this is marius i whispered truly marius pandora he said drawing back to look at me my pandora his skin had been burned faint scars but it was almost healed he led me out on the dance floor he was the perfect impersonation of a human being he guided me in the steps of the dance i could scarce breathe following his lead shocked at each new artful turn by the rapture of his face i could not measure centuries or even millennia i wanted suddenly to know everything where he had been what had befallen him pride and shame in me held no sway could he see that i was no more than a ghost of the woman hed known you are the hope of my soul i whispered quickly he took me away we went in a carriage to his palace he deluged me with kisses i dung to him you he said my dream a treasure so foolishly thrown away you are here you have persevered because you see me i am here i said bitterly because you lift the candle i can almost see my strength in the looking glass suddenly i heard a sound an ancient and terrible sound it was the heartbeat of akasha the heartbeat of enkil the carriage had come to a halt iron gates servants the palace was spacious fancy the ostentatious residence of a rich noble they are in there the mother and the father i asked oh yes unchanged utterly reliable in their eternal silence his voice seemed to defy the horror of it i couldnt bear it i had to escape the sound of her heart an image of the petrified king and queen rose before my eyes no get me away from here i cant go in marius i cannot look on them pandora they are hidden below the palace there is no need to look on them they wont know pandora they are the same ah the same my mind sped back over perilous terrain to my very first nights alone and mortal in antioch to the later victories and defeats of that time ah akasha was the same i feared i would begin to scream and be unable to control it very well said marius well go where you want i gave the coachman the location of my hiding place i couldnt look at marius valiantly he kept the pretense of happy reunion he talked of science and literature shakespeare dryden the new world full of jungles and rivers but behind his voice i heard the joy drained from him i buried my face against him when the carriage stopped i leapt out and fled to the door of my little house i looked back he stood in the street he was sad and weary and slowly he nodded and made a gesture of acceptance may i wait it out he asked is there hope youll change your mind ill wait here forever its not my mind i said i leave this city tonight forget me forget you ever saw me my love he said softly my only love i ran inside shutting the door i heard the carriage pull away i went wild as i had not since mortal life beating the was with my fists trying to restrain my immense strength and trying not to let loose the howls and cries that wanted to break from me finally i looked at the dock three hours left until dawn i sat down at the desk and wrote to him marius at dawn we will be taken to moscow the very coffin in which i rest is to carry me many miles the first day marius i am dazed i cant seek shelter in your house beneath the same roof as the ancient ones please marius come to moscow help me to free myself of this predicament later you can judge me and condemn me i need you marius i shall haunt the vicinity of the czars palace and the great cathedral until you come marius i know i ask of you that you make a great journey but please come i am a slave to this blood drinkers will i love you pandora running back out in the street i hurried in the direction of his house trying to retrace the path which i had so stupidly ignored but what about the heartbeat i would hear it that ghastly sound i had to run past it run through it long enough to give marius this letter perhaps to let him grasp me by the wrist and force me to some safe place and drive away before dawn the asian vampire who kept me then the very carriage appeared carrying in it my fellow blood drinker from the ball he stopped for me at once i took the driver aside the man who brought me home i said we went to his house a huge palace yes count marius said the driver i just took him back to his own home you must take this letter to him hurry you must go to his house and put it in his hands tell him i had no money to give you that he must pay you i demand that you tell him he will pay you tell him the letter is from pandora you must find him who are you speaking of demanded my asian companion i motioned to the driver to leave go of course my consort was outraged but the carriage was already on its way two hundred years passed before i learned the very simple truth marius never received that letter he had gone back to his house packed up his belongings and the following night left dresden in sorrow only finding the letter long after as he related it to the vampire lestat a fragile piece of writing as he called it that had fallen to the bottom of a cluttered traveling case when did i see him again in this modern world when the ancient queen rose from her throne and demonstrated the limits of her wisdom her will and her power two thousand years after in our twentieth century still full of roman columns and statues and pediments and peristyles buzzing with computers and warmthgiving television with cicero and ovid in every public library our queen akasha was wakened by the image of lestat on a television screen in the most modern and secure of shrines and sought to reign as a goddess not only over us but over humankind in the most dangerous hour when she threatened to destroy us all if we did not follow her lead and she had already slaughtered many it was marius with his reasoning his optimism his philosophy who talked to her tried to calm her and divert her who stalled her destructive intent until an ancient enemy came to fulfill an ancient curse and struck her down with ancient simplicity david what have you done to me in prodding me to write this narrative you have made me ashamed of the wasted years you have made me acknowledge that no darkness has been ever deep enough to extinguish my personal knowledge of love love from mortals who brought me into the world love for goddesses of stone love for marius above all i cannot deny the resurgence of this love for marius and all around me in this world i see evidence of love behind the image of the blessed virgin and her infant jesus behind the image of the crucified christ behind the remembered basalt image of isis i see love i see it in the human struggle i see its undeniable penetration in all that humans have accomplished in their poetry their painting their music their love of one another and refusal to accept suffering as their lot above all however i see it in the very fashioning of the world which outshines all art and cannot by sheer randomness have accumulated such beauty love but whence comes this love why is it so secretive about its source this love that makes ram and trees and has scattered the stars over us as the gods and goddesses once claimed to do so lestat the brat prince woke the queen and we survived her destruction so lestat the brat prince had gone to heaven and hell and brought back disbelief horror and the veil of veronica veronica an invented christian name which means vera ikon or true icon he found himself plunged into palestine during the very years that i lived and there saw something that has shattered the faculties in humans which we cherish so much faith reason i have to go to lestat look into his eyes i have to see what he saw let the young sing songs of death they are stupid the finest thing under the sun and the moon is the human soul i marvel at the small miracles of kindness that pass between humans i marvel at the growth of conscience at the persistence of reason in the face of all superstition or despair i marvel at human endurance i have one more story to tell you i dont know why i want to record it here but i do perhaps its because i feel you a vampire who sees spirits will understand this and understand perhaps why i remained so unmoved by it once in the sixth century that is five hundred years after the birth of christ and three hundred years since i had left marius i went wandering in barbarian italy the ostrogoths had long ago overrun the peninsula then other tribes swept down on them looting burning carrying off stones from old temples it was like walking on burning coals for me to go there but rome did struggle with some conception of itself its principles trying to blend the pagan with the christian and find some respite from the barbarian raids the roman senate still existed of all institutions it had survived and a scholar sprung from the same stock as myself boethius a very learned man who studied the ancients and the saints had recently been put to death but not before he had given us a great book you can find it in any library today it is of course the consolation of philosophy i had to see the ruined forum for myself the burnt and barren hills of rome the pigs and goats roaming where once cicero had spoken to the crowds i had to see the forsaken poor living desperately along the banks of the tiber i had to see the fallen classical world i had to see the christian churches and shrines i had to see one scholar in particular like boethius he had come from old roman stock and like boethius he had read the classics and the saints he was a man who wrote letters that went all over the world even as far as to the scholar bede in england and he had built a monastery there some great flare of creativity and optimism in spite of ruin and war this man was of course the scholar cassiodorus and his monastery lay at the very tip of the boot of italy in the paradisal land of green calabria i came upon it in early evening as i planned when it looked like a great and splendid lighted little city its monks were copying away ferociously in the scriptorium and there in his cell wide open to the night sat cassiodorus himself at his writing a man past ninety years of age he had survived the barbarian politics that doomed his friend boethius having served the aryan ostrogoth emperor theodoric having lived to retire from civil service he had survived to build this monastery his dream and to write to monks all over the world to share what he knew with them of the ancients to conserve the wisdom of the greeks and the romans was he truly the last man of the ancient world as some have said the last man who could read both latin and greek the last man who could treasure both aristotle and the dogma of the roman pope plato and saint paul i didnt know then that he would be so well remembered and i didnt know how soon hed be forgotten vivarium on its mountain slopes was an architectural triumph it had its sparkling ponds to catch and hold fish the characteristic which gave it its name it had its christian church with the inevitable cross its dormitories its rooms for the weary guest traveler its library was rich in the classics of my time as well as gospels which have now been lost the monastery was rich in all the fruits of the field all crops needed for food trees laden with fruit fields of wheat the monks cared for all of this and they dedicated themselves to copying books day and night in their long scriptorium there were beehives there on this gentle moonlighted coast hundreds of beehives from which the monks harvested honey to eat and wax for sacred candles and royal jelly for an ointment the beehives covered a hill as big as the orchard or the farmland of vivarium i spied on cassiodorus i walked among the beehives and marveled as i always do at the inexplicable organization of bees for the mysteries of the bees and their dance and their hunting for pollen and their breeding was all known to my eye long before it was understood by the human world as i left the hives as i moved array towards the distant beacon of cassiodoruss lamp i looked back i beheld something something collected itself from the hives something immense and invisible and forceful that i could both feel and hear i was not gripped by fear merely sparked by a temporary hope that some new thing had come into the world for i am not a seer of ghosts and never was this force rose out of the very bees themselves out of their intricate knowledge and their countless sublime patterns as though they had somehow accidentally evolved it or empowered it with consciousness through the means of their endless creativity meticulousness and endurance it was like an old roman woodland spirit of the forest i saw this force fly loosely over the fields i saw it enter the body of a straw man who stood in the fields a scarecrow which the monks had made with a fine round wooden head painted eyes crude nose and smiling mouth a creature whole and entire who could be moved from time to time intact in his monks hood and robe i saw this scarecrow this man of straw and wood hurry whirling and dancing through the fields and the vineyards until he had reached cassiodoruss cell i followed then i heard a silent wail rise from the being i heard it and i saw the scarecrow in a bending bowing dance of sorrow its bundled straw hands over ears it didnt have it writhed with grief cassiodorus was dead he had died quietly within his lamplighted cell his door open at his writing table he lay grayhaired ancient quiet against his manuscript he had lived over ninety years and he was dead this creature this scarecrow was wild with suffering and grief rocking and moaning though it was a sound no human could have heard i who have never seen spirits stared at it in wonder then it perceived that i was there it turned he for so it seemed in this ragged attire and body of straw reached out to me he flung out his straw arms the straw fell from his sleeves his wooden head wobbled on the pole that was his spine he it implored me he begged me for the answer to the greatest questions humans and immortal have ever posed he looked to me for answers then glancing back again at the dead cassiodorus he ran to me across the sloping grass and the need came out of him poured from him his arms out as it beheld me could i not explain could i not contain in some divine design the mystery of the loss of cassiodorus cassiodorus who had with his vivarium rivaled the hive of bees in elegance and glory it was vivarium which had drawn this consciousness together from the hives could i not ease this creatures pain there are horrors in this world i whispered it is made up of mystery and dependent upon mystery if you would have peace go back to the hives lose your human shape and descend again fragmented into the mindless life of the contented bees from which you rose he was fixed and he listened to me if you would have fleshly life human life hard life which can move through time and space then fight for it if you would have human philosophy then struggle and make yourself wise so that nothing can hurt you ever wisdom is strength collect yourself whatever you are into something with a purpose but know this all is speculation under the sky all myth all religion all philosophy all history is lies the thing whether it be male or female drew up its bundled straw hands as if to cover its mouth i turned my back on it i walked away silently through the vineyards in a little while the monks would discover that their father superior their genius their saint had died at his work i looked back in amazement to discover that the figure of straw remained organized assuming the posture of an upright being watching me i will not believe in you i shouted back to this man of straw i will not search with you for any answer but know this if you would become an organized being as you see in me love all mankind and womankind and all their children do not take your strength from blood do not feed on suffering do not rise like a god above crowds chanting in adoration do not lie it listened it heard it remained still i ran i ran and ran up the rocky slopes and through the forests of calabria until i was far far away from it under the moon i saw the sprawling majesty of vivarium with its cloisters and sloped roofs as it surrounded the shores of its shimmering inlet from the sea i never saw the straw creature again i dont know what it was i dont want you to ask me any question about it you tell me spirits and ghosts walk we know such beings exist but that was the last i saw of that being and when next i drifted through italy vivarium had been long destroyed the earthquakes had shaken loose the last of its walls had it been sacked first by the next wave of ignorant tall men of northern europe the vandals was it an earthquake that brought about its ruin no one knows what survives of it are the letters that cassiodorus sent to others soon the classics were declared profane pope gregory wrote tales of magic and miracles because it was the only way to convert thousands of superstitious uncatechized northern tribes to christianity in great en masse baptisms he conquered the warriors rome could never conquer the history of italy for one hundred years falls into absolute darkness after cassiodorus how do the books put it for a century nothing is heard from italy ah what a silence now david as you come to these final pages i must confess i have left you the smiles with which i gave you these notebooks were deceptive feminine wiles marius would call them my promise to meet with you tomorrow night here in paris was a lie i will have left paris by the time you come to these lines i go to new orleans its your doing david you have transformed me you have given me a desperate faith that in narrative there is a shadow of meaning i now know a new strident energy you have trained me through your demand upon my language and my memory to live again to believe again that some good exists in this world i want to find marius thoughts of other immortals fill the air cries pleas strange messages one who was believed gone from us is now apparently known to have survived i have strong reason to believe that marius has gone to new orleans and i must be reunited with him i must seek out lestat to see this fallen brat prince lying on the chapel floor unable to speak or move come join me david dont fear marius i know he will come to help lestat i do the same come back to new orleans even if marius is not there i want to see lestat i want to see the others again what have you done david i now contain with this new curiosity with this flaming capacity to care once more with reborn capacity to sing i now contain the awful capacity to want and to love for that if for nothing else and there is indeed much more i shall always thank you no matter what suffering is to come you have quickened me and nothing you do or say will ever cause the death of my love for you the end
