the nameless offspring clark ashton smith many and multiform are the dim horrors of earth infesting her ways from the prime they sleep beneath the unturned stone they rise with the tree from its roots they move beneath the sea and in subterranean places they dwell in the inmost adyta they emerge betimes from the shutten sepulcher of haughty bronze and the low grave that is sealed with clay there be some that are long known to man and others as yet unknown that abide the terrible latter days of their revealing those which are the most dreadful and the loathliest of all are haply still to be declared but among those that have revealed themselves aforetime and have made manifest their veritable presence there is one which may not openly be named for its exceeding foulness it is that spawn which the hidden dweller in the vaults has begotten upon mortality from the necronomicon of abdul alhazred in a sense it is fortunate that the story i must now relate should be so largely a thing of undetermined shadows of halfshaped hints and forbidden inferences otherwise it could never be written by human hand or read by human eye my own slight part in the hideous drama was limited to its last act and to me its earlier scenes were merely a remote and ghastly legend yet even so the broken reflex of its unnatural horrors has crowded out in perspective the main events of normal life has made them seem no more than frail gossamers woven on the dark windy verge of some unsealed abyss some deep halfopen charnel wherein earths nethermost corruptions lurk and fester the legend of which i speak was familiar to me from childhood as a theme of family whispers and head shakings for sir john tremoth had been a schoolmate of my father but i had never met sir john had never visited tremoth hall till the time of those happenings which formed the final tragedy my father had taken me from england to canada when i was a small infant he had prospered in manitoba as an apiarist and after his death the bee ranch had kept me too busy for years to execute a longcherished dream of visiting my natal land and exploring its rural byways when finally i set sail the story was pretty dim in my memory and tremoth hall was no conscious part of my itinerary when i began a motorcycle tour of the english counties in any case i should never have been drawn to the neighborhood out of morbid curiosity such as the frightful tale might possibly have evoked in others my visit as it happened was purely accidental i had forgotten the exact location of the place and did not even dream that i was in its vicinity if i had known it seems to me that i should have turned aside in spite of the circumstances that impelled me to seek shelter rather than intrude upon the almost demoniacal misery of its owner when i came to tremoth hall i had ridden all day in early autumn through a rolling countryside with leisurely winding thoroughfares and lanes the day had been fair with skies of pale azure above noble parks that were tinged with the first amber and crimson of the following year but toward the middle of the afternoon a mist had come in from the hidden ocean across low hills and had closed me about with its moving phantom circle somehow in that deceptive fog i managed to lose my way to miss the milepost that would have given me my direction to the town where i had planned to spend the ensuing night i went on for a while at random thinking that i should soon reach another crossroad the way that i followed was little more than a rough lane and was singularly deserted the fog had darkened and drawn closer obliterating all horizons but from what i could see of it the country was one of heath and boulders with no sign of cultivation i topped a level ridge and went down a long monotonous slope as the mist continued to thicken with twilight i thought that i was riding toward the but before me in the wan dusk there was no faintest gleaming or flare of color to betoken the drowned sunset a dank odor that was touched with salt like the smell of sea marshes came to meet me the road turned at a sharp angle and i seemed to be riding between downs and marshland the night gathered with an almost unnatural quickness as if in haste to overtake me and i began to feel a sort of dim concern and alarm as if i had gone astray in regions that were more dubious than an english county the fog and twilight seemed to withhold a silent landscape of chill deathly disquieting mystery then to the left of my road and a little before me i saw a light that somehow suggested a mournful and teardimmed eye it shone among blurred uncertain masses that were like trees from a ghostland wood a nearer mass as i approached it was resolved into a small lodgebuilding such as would guard the entrance of some estate it was dark and apparently unoccupied pausing and peering i saw the outlines of a wroughtiron gate in a hedge of untrimmed yew it all had a desolate and forbidding air and i felt in my very marrow the brooding chillness that had come in from the unseen marsh in that dismal evercoiling fog but the light was promise of human nearness on the lonely downs and i might obtain shelter for the night or at least find someone who could direct me to a town or inn somewhat to my surprise the gate was unlocked it swung inward with a rusty grating sound as if it had not been opened for a long time and pushing my motorcycle before me i followed a weedgrown drive toward the light the rambling mass of a large manorhouse disclosed itself among trees and shrubs whose artificial forms like the hedge of ragged yew were assuming a wilder grotesquery than they had received from the hand of the topiary the fog had turned into a bleak drizzle almost groping in the gloom i found a dark door at some distance from the window that gave forth the solitary light in response to my thricerepeated knock i heard at length the muffled sound of slow dragging footfalls the door was opened with a gradualness that seemed to indicate caution or reluctance and i saw before me an old man bearing a lighted taper in his hand his fingers trembled with palsy or decrepitude and monstrous shadows flickered behind him in a dim hallway and touched his wrinkled features as with the flitting of ominous batlike wings what do you wish sir he asked the voice though quavering and hesitant was far from churlish and did not suggest the attitude of suspicion and downright inhospitality which i had begun to apprehend however i sensed a sort of irresolution or dubiety and as the old man listened to my account of the circumstances that had led me to knock at that lonely door i saw that he was scrutinizing me with a keenness that belied my first impression of extreme senility i knew you were a stranger in these parts he commented when i had finished but might i inquire your name sir i am henry chaldane are you not the son of mr arthur chaldane somewhat mystified i admitted the ascribed paternity you resemble your father sir mr chaldane and sir john tremoth were great friends in the days before your father went to canada will you not come in sir this is tremoth hall sir john has not been in the habit of receiving guests for a long time but i shall tell him that you are here and it may be that he will wish to see you startled and not altogether agreeably surprised at the discovery of my whereabouts i followed the old man to a booklined study whose furnishings bore evidence of luxury and neglect here he lit an oil lamp of antique fashion with a dusty painted shade and left me alone with the dustier volumes and furniture i felt a queer embarrassment a sense of actual intrusion as i waited in the wan yellow lamplight there came back to me the details of the strange horrific halfforgotten story i had overheard from my father in childhood years lady agatha tremoth sir johns wife in the first year of their marriage had become the victim of cataleptic seizures the third seizure had apparently terminated in death for she did not revive after the usual interval and displayed all the familiar marks of the rigor mortis lady agathas body was placed in the family vaults which were of almost fabulous age and extent and had been excavated in the hill behind the manorhouse on the day following the interment sir john troubled by a queer insistent doubt as to the finality of the medical verdict had reentered the vaults in time to hear a wild cry and had found lady agatha sitting up in her coffin the nailed lid was lying on the stone floor and it seemed impossible that it could have been removed by the struggles of the frail woman however there was no other plausible explanation though lady agatha herself could throw little light on the circumstances of her strange resurrection half dazed and almost delirious in a state of dire terror that was easily understandable she told an incoherent tale of her experience she did not seem to remember struggling to free herself from the coffin but was troubled mainly by recollections of a pale hideous unhuman face which she had seen in the gloom on awakening from her prolonged and deathlike sleep it was the sight of this face stooping over her as she lay in the open coffin that had caused her to cry out so wildly the thing had vanished before sir johns approach fleeing swiftly to the inner vaults and she had formed only a vague idea of its bodily appearance she thought however that it was large and white and ran like an animal on all fours though its limbs were semihuman of course her tale was regarded as a sort of dream or a figment of delirium induced by the awful shock of her experience which had blotted out all recollection of its true terror but the memory of the horrible face and figure had seemed to obsess her permanently and was plainly fraught with associations of mindunhinging fear she did not recover from her illness but lived on in a shattered condition of brain and body and nine months later she died after giving birth to her first child her death was a merciful thing for the child it seemed was one of those appalling monsters that sometimes appear in human families the exact nature of its abnormality was not known though frightful and divergent rumors had purported to emanate from the doctor nurses and servants who had seen it some of the latter had left tremoth hall and had refused to reture after a single glimpse of the monstrosity after lady agathas death sir john had withdrawn from society and little or nothing was divulged in regard to his doings or the fate of the horrible infant people said however that the child was kept in a locked room with ironbarred windows which no one but sir john himself ever entered the tragedy had blighted his whole life and he had become a recluse living alone with one or two faithful servants and allowing his estate to decline grievously through neglect doubtless i thought the old man who had admitted me was one of the remaining servitors i was still reviewing the dreadful legend still striving to recollect certain particulars that had almost passed from memory when i heard the sound of footsteps which from their slowness and feebleness i took to be those of the returning manservant however i was mistaken for the person who entered was plainly sir john tremoth himself the tall slightly bent figure the face that was lined as if by the trickling of some corrosive acid were marked with a dignity that seemed to triumph over the double ravages of mortal sorrow and illness somehow though i could have calculated his real age i had expected an old man but he was scarcely beyond middle life his cadaverous pallor and feeble tottering walk were those of a man who is stricken with some fatal malady his manner as he addressed me was impeccably courteous and even gracious but the voice was that of one to whom the ordinary relations and actions of life had long since become meaningless and perfunctory harper tells me that you are the son of my old school friend arthur chaldane he said i bid you welcome to such poor hospitality as i am able to offer i have not received guests for many years and i fear you will find the hall pretty dull and dismal and will think me an indifferent host nevertheless you must remain at least for the night harper has gone to prepare dinner for us you are very kind i replied i fear however that i am intruding if not at all he countered firmly you must be my guest it is miles to the nearest inn and the fog is changing into a heavy rain indeed i am glad to have you you must tell me all about your father and yourself at dinner in the meanwhile ill try to find a room for you if youll come with me he led me to the second floor of the manorhouse and down a long hall with beams and panels of ancient oak we passed several doors which were doubtless those of bedchambers all were closed and one of the doors was reenforced with iron bars heavy and sinister as those of a dungeon cell inevitably i surmised that this was the chamber in which the monstrous child had been confined and also i wondered if the abnormality still lived after a lapse of time that must have been nearly thirty years how abysmal how abhorrent must have been its departure from the human type to necessitate an immediate removal from the sight of others and what characteristics of its further development could have rendered necessary the massive bars on an oaken door which by itself was strong enough to have resisted the assaults of any common man or beast without even glancing at the door my host went on carrying a taper that scarcely shook in his feeble fingers my curious reflections as i followed him were interrupted with nerveshattering suddenness by a loud cry that seemed to issue from the barred room the sound was a long evermounting ululation infrabass at first like the tombmuffled voice of a demon and rising through abominable degrees to a shrill ravenous fury as if the demon had emerged by a series of underground steps to the open air it was neither human nor bestial it was wholly preternatural hellish macabre and i shuddered with an insupportable eeriness that still persisted when the demon voice after reaching its culnunation had returned by reverse degrees to a profound sepulchral silence sir john had given no apparent heed to the awful sound but had gone on with no more than his usual faltering he had reached the end of the hall and was pausing before the second chamber from the one with the sealed door ill let you have this room he said its just beyond the one that i occupy he did not turn his face toward me as he spoke and his voice was unnaturally toneless and restrained i realized with another shudder that the chamber he had indicated as his own was adjacent to the room from which the frightful ululation had appeared to issue the chamber to which he now admitted me had manifestly not been used for years the air was chill stagnant unwholesome with an allpervading mustiness and the antique furniture had gathered the inevitable increment of dust and cobwebs sir john began to apologize i didnt realize the condition of the room he said ill send harper after dinner to do a little dusting and clearing and put fresh linen on the bed i protested rather vaguely that there was no need for him to apologize the unhuman loneliness and decay of the old manorhouse its lustrums and decades of neglect and the corresponding desolation of its owner had impressed me more painfully than ever and i dared not speculate overmuch concerning the ghastly secret of the barred chamber and the hellish howling that still echoed in my shaken nerves already i regretted the singular fortuity that had drawn me to that place of evil and festering shadows i felt an urgent desire to leave to continue my journey even in the face of the bleak autumnal rain and windblown darkness but i could think of no excuse that would be sufficiently tangible and valid manifestly there was nothing to do but remain our dinner was served in a dismal but stately room by the old man whom sir john had referred to as harper the meal was plain but substantial and wellcooked and the service was impeccable i had begun to infer that harper was the only servant a combination of valet butler housekeeper and chef in spite of my hunger and the pains taken by my host to make me feel at ease the meal was a solemn and almost funereal ceremony i could not forget my fathers story and still less could i forget the sealed door and the baleful ululation whatever it was the monstrosity still lived and i felt a complex mingling of admiration pity and horror as i looked at the gaunt and gallant face of sir john tremoth and reflected upon the lifelong hell to which he had been con demned and the apparent fortitude with which he had borne its unthinkable ordeals a bottle of excellent sherry was brought in over this we sat for an hour or more sir john spoke at some length concerning my father of whose death he had not previously heard and he drew me out in regard to my own affairs with the subtle adroitness of a polished man of the world he said little about himself and not even by hint or implication did he refer to the tragic history which i have outlined since i am rather abstemious and did not empty my glass with much frequency the major part of the heavy wine was consumed by my host toward the end it seemed to bring out in him a curious vein of confidentiality and he spoke for the first time of the ill health that was all too patent in his appearance i learned that he was subject to that most painful form of heart disease angina pectoris and had recently recovered from an attack of unusual severity the next one will finish me he said and it may come at any time perhaps tonight he made the announcement very simply as if he were voicing a commonplace or venturing a prediction about the weather then after a slight pause he went on with more emphasis and weightiness of tone maybe youll think me queer but i have a fixed prejudice against burial or vault interment i want my remains to be thoroughly cremated and have left careful directions to that end harper will see to it that they are fulfilled fire is the cleanest and purest of the elements and it cuts short all the damnable processes between death and ultimate disintegration i cant bear the idea of some moldy worminfested tomb he continued to discourse on the subject for some time with a singular elaboration and tenseness of manner that showed it to be a familiar theme of thought if not an actual obsession it seemed to possess a morbid fascination for him and there was a painful light in his hollow haunted eyes and a touch of rigidly subdued hysteria in his voice as he spoke i remembered the interment of lady agatha and her tragic resurrection and the dim delirious horror of the vaults that had formed an inexplicable and vaguely disturbing part of her story it was not hard to understand sir johns aversion to burial but i was far from suspecting the full terror and ghastliness on which his repugnance had been founded harper had disappeared after bringing the sherry and i surmised that he had been given orders for the renovation of my room we had now drained our last glasses and my host had ended his peroration the wind which had animated him briefly seemed to die out and he looked more ill and haggard than ever pleading my own fatigue i expressed a wish to retire and he with his invariable courtliness insisted on seeing me to my chamber and making sure of my comfort before seeking his own bed in the hall above we met harper who was just descending from a flight of stairs that must have led to an attic or third floor he was carrying a heavy iron pan in which a few scraps of meat remained and i caught an odor of pronounced gaminess almost virtual putrescence from the pan as he went by i wondered if he had been feeding the unknown monstrosity and if perhaps its food were supplied to it through a trap in the ceiling of the barred room the surmise was reasonable enough but the odor of the scraps by a train of remote halfliterary association had begun to suggest other surmises which it would seem were beyond the realm of possibility and reason certain evasive incoherent hints appeared to point themselves suddenly to an atrocious and abhorrent whole with imperfect success i assured myself that the thing i had fancied was incredible to science was a mere creation of superstitious diablerie no it could not be here in england of all places that corpsedevouring demon of oriental tales and legends the ghoul contrary to my fears there was no repetition of the fiendish howling as we passed the secret room but i thought that i heard a measured crunching such as a large animal would make in devouring its food my room though still drear and dismal enough had been cleared of its accumulated dust and matted gossamers after a personal inspection sir john left me and retired to his own chamber i was struck by his deathly pallor and weakness as he said good night to me and felt guiltily apprehensive that the strain of receiving and entertaining a guest might have aggravated the dire disease from which he suffered i seemed to detect actual pain and torment beneath his careful armor of urbanity and wondered if the urbanity had not been maintained at an excessive cost the fatigue of my daylong journey together with the heavy wine i had drunk should have conduced to early slumber but though i lay with tightly closed lids in the darkness i could not dismiss those evil shadows those black and charnel larvae that swarmed upon me from the ancient house insufferable and forbidden things besieged me with filthy talons brushed me with noisome coils as i tossed through eternal hours and lay staring at the gray square of the stormdarkened window the dripping of the rain the sough and moan of the wind resolved themselves to a dread mutter of halfarticulate voices that plotted against my peace and whispered loathfully of nameless secrets in demonian language at length after the seeming lapse of nocturnal centuries the tempest died away and i no longer heard the equivocal voices the window lightened a little in the black wall and the terrors of my nightlong insomnia seemed to withdraw partially but without bringing the surcease of slumber i became aware of utter silence and then in the silence of a queer faint disquieting sound whose cause and location baffled me for many minutes the sound was muffled and far off at times then it seemed to draw near as if it were in the next room i began to identify it as a sort of scratching such as would be made by the claws of an animal on solid woodwork sitting up in bed and listening attentively i realized with a fresh start of horror that it came from the direction of the barred chamber it took on a strange resonance then it became almost inaudible and suddenly for awhile it ceased in the interim i heard a groan like that of a man in great agony or terror i could not mistake the source of the groan which had issued from sir john tremoths room nor was i doubtful any longer as to the causation of the scratching the groan was not repeated but the damnable clawing sound began again and was continued till daybreak then as if the creature that had caused the noise were wholly nocturnal in its habits the faint vibrant rasping ceased and was not resumed in a state of dull nightmarish apprehension drugged with weariness and want of sleep i had listened to it with intolerably straining ears with its cessation in the hueless livid dawn i slid into a deep slumber from which the muffled and amorphous specters of the old hall were unable to detain me any longer i was awakened by a loud knocking on my door a knocking in which even my sleepconfused senses could recognize the imperative and urgent it must have been close upon midday and feeling guilty at having overslept so egregiously i ran to the door and opened it the old manservant harper was standing without and his tremulous griefbroken manner told me before he spoke that something of dire import had occurred i regret to tell you mr chaldane he quavered that sir john is dead he did not answer my knock as usual so i made bold to enter his room he must have died early this morning inexpressibly shocked by his announcement i recalled the single groan i had heard in the gray beginning of dawn my host perhaps had been dying at that very moment i recalled too the detestable nightmare scratching unavoidably i wondered if the groan had been occasioned by fear as well as by physical pain had the strain and suspense of listening to that hideous sound brought on the final paroxysm of sir johns malady i could not be sure of the truth but my brain seethed with awful and ghastly conjectures with the futile formalities that one employs on such occasions i tried to condole with the aged servant and offered him such assistance as i could in making the necessary arrangements for the disposition of his masters remains since there was no telephone in the house i volunteered to find a doctor who would examine the body and sign the death certificate the old man seemed to feel a singular relief and gratitude thank you sir he said fervently then as if in explanation i dont want to leave sir john i promised him that id keep a close watch over his body he went on to speak of sir johns desire for cremation it seemed that the baronet had left explicit directions for the building of a pyre of driftwood on the hill behind the hall the burning of his remains on this pyre and the sowing of his ashes on the fields of the estate these directions he had enjoined and empowered the servant to carry out as soon after death as possible no one was to be present at the ceremony except harper and the hired pall bearers and sir johns nearer relatives none of whom lived in the vicinity were not to be informed of his demise till all was over i refused harpers offer to prepare my breakfast telling him that i could obtain a meal in the neighboring village there was a strange uneasiness in his manner and i realized with thoughts and emotions not to be specified in this narrative that he was anxious to begin his promised vigil beside sir johns corpse it would be tedious and unnecessary to detail the funereal afternoon that followed the heavy sea fog had returned and i seemed to grope my way through a sodden but unreal world as i sought the nearby town i succeeded in locating a doctor and also in securing several men to build the pyre and act as pall bearers i was met everywhere with an odd taciturnity and no one seemed willing to comment on sir johns death or to speak of the dark legendry that was attached to tremoth hall harper to my amazement had proposed that the cremation should take place at once this however proved to be impracticable when all the formalities and arrangements had been completed the fog turned into a steady everlasting downpour which rendered impossible the lighting of the pyre and we were compelled to defer the ceremony i had promised harper that i should remain at the hall till all was done and so it was that i spent a second night beneath that roof of accurst and abominable secrets the darkness came on betimes after a last visit to the village in which i procured some sandwiches for harper and myself in lieu of dinner i returned to the lonely hall i was met by harper on the stairs as i ascended to the deathchamber there was an increased agitation in his manner as if something had happened to frighten him i wonder if youd keep me company tonight mr chaldane he said its a gruesome watch that im asking you to share and it may be a dangerous one but sir john would thank you i am sure if you have a weapon of any sort it will be well to bring it with you it was impossible to refuse his request and i assented at once i was unarmed so harper insisted on equipping me with an antique revolver of which he himself carried the mate look here harper i said bluntly as we followed the hall to sir johns chamber what are you afraid of he flinched visibly at the question and seemed unwilling to answer then after a moment he appeared to realize that frankness was necessary its the thing in the barred room he explained you must have heard it sir weve had the care of it sir john and i these eight and twenty years and weve always feared that it might break out it never gave us much trouble as long as we kept it wellfed but for the last three nights it has been scratching at the thick oaken wall of sir johns chamber which is something it never did before sir john thought it knew that he was going to die and that it wanted to reach his body being hungry for other food than we had given it thats why we must guard him closely tonight mr chaldane i pray to god that the wall will hold but the thing keeps on clawing and clawing like a demon and i dont like the hollowness of the sound as if the wall were getting pretty thin appalled by this confirmation of my own most repugnant surmise i could offer no rejoinder since all comment would have been futile with harpers open avowal the abnormality took on a darker and more encroaching shadow a more potent and tyrannic menace willingly would i have foregone the promised vigil but this of course it was impossible to do the bestial diabolic scratching louder and more frantic than before assailed my ears as we passed the barred room all too readily i understood the nameless fear that had impelled the old man to request my company the sound was inexpressibly alarming and nervesapping with its grim macabre insistence its intimation of ghoulish hunger it became even plainer with a hideous tearing vibrancy when we entered the room of death during the whole course of that funereal day i had refrained from visiting this chamber since i am lacking in the morbid curiosity which impels many to gaze upon the dead so it was that i beheld my host for the second and last time fully dressed and prepared for the pyre he lay on the chill white bed whose heavily figured arraslike curtains had been drawn back the room was lit by several tall tapers arranged on a little table in curious brazen candelabras that were greened with antiquity but the light seemed to afford only a doubtful dolorous glimmering in the drear spaciousness and mortuary shadows somewhat against my will i gazed on the dead features and averted my eyes very hastily i was prepared for the stony pallor and rigor but not for the full betrayal of that hideous revulsion that inhuman terror and horror which must have corroded the mans heart through infernal years and which with almost superhuman control he had masked from the casual beholder in life the revelation was too painful and i could not look at him again in a sense it seemed that he was not dead that he was still listening with agonized attention to the dreadful sounds that might well have served to precipitate the final attack of his malady there were several chairs dating i think like the bed itself from the seventeenth century harper and i seated ourselves near the small table and between the deathbed and the paneled wall of blackish wood from which the ceaseless clawing sound appeared to issue in tacit silence with drawn and cocked revolvers we began our ghastly vigil as we sat and waited i was driven to picture the unnamed monstrosity and formless or halfformed images of charnel nightmare pursued each other in chaotic succession through my mind an atrocious curiosity to which i should normally have been a stranger prompted me to question harper but i was restrained by an even more powerful inhibition on his part the old man volunteered no information or comment whatever but watched the wall with fearbright eyes that did not seem to waver in his palsynodding head it would be impossible to convey the unnatural tension the macabre suspense and baleful expectation of the hours that followed the woodwork must have been of great thickness and hardness such as would have defied the assaults of any normal creature equipped only with talons or teeth but in spite of such obvious arguments as these i thought momentarily to see it crumble inward the scratching noise went on eternally and to my febrile fancy it grew sharper and nearer every instant at recurrent intervals i seemed to hear a low eager doglike whining such as a ravenous animal would make when it neared the goal of its burrowing neither of us had spoken of what we should do in case the monster should attain its objective but there seemed to be an unvoiced agreement however with a superstitiousness of which i should not have believed myself capable i began to wonder if the monster possessed enough of humanity in its composition to be vulnerable to mere revolver bullets to what extent would it display the traits of its unknown and fabulous paternity i tried to convince myself that such questions and wonderings were patently absurd but was drawn to them again and again as if by the allurement of some forbiddem gulf the night wore on like the flowing of a dark sluggish stream and the tall funeral tapers had burned to within an inch of their verdigriseaten sockets it was this circumstance alone that gave me an idea of the passage of time for i seemed to be drowning in a black eternity motionless beneath the crawling and seething of blind horrors i had grown so accustomed to the clawing noise in the woodwork and the sound had gone on so long that i deemed its evergrowing sharpness and hollowness a mere hallucination and so it was that the end of our vigil came without apparent warning suddenly as i stared at the wall and listened with frozen fixity i heard a harsh splinteriag souod and saw that a narrow strip had broken loose and was hanging from the panel then before i could collect myself or credit the awful witness of my senses a large semicircular portion of the wall collapsed in many splinters beneath the impact of some ponderous body mercifully perhaps i have never been able to recall with any degree of distinctness the hellish thing that issued from the panel the visual shock by its own excess of horror has almost blotted the details from memory i have however the blurred impression of a huge whitish hairless and semiquadruped body of canine teeth in a halfhuman face and long hyena nails at the end of forelimbs that were both arms and legs a charnel stench preceded the apparition like a breath from the den of some carrioneating animal and then with a single nightmare leap the thing was upon us i heard the staccato crack of harpers revolver sharp and vengeful in the closed room but there was only a rusty click from my own weapon perhaps the cartridge was too old any rate it had misfired before i could press the trigger again i was hurled to the floor with terrific violence striking my head against the heavy base of the little table a black curtain spangled with countless fires appeared to fall upon me and to blot the room from sight then all the fires went out and there was only darkness again slowly i became conscious of flame and shadow but the flame was bright and qickering and seemed to grow ever more brilliant then my dull doubtful senses were sharply revived and clarified by the acrid odor of burning cloth the features of the room returned to vision and i found that i was lying huddled against the overthrown table gazing toward the deathbed the guttering candles had been hurled to the floor one of them was eating a slow circle of fire in the carpet beside me and another spreading had ignited the bed curtains which were flaring swiftly upward to the great canopy even as i lay staring huge ruddy tatters of the burning fabric fell upon the bed in a dozen places and the body of sir john tremoth was ringed about with starting flames i staggered heavily to my feet dazed and giddy with the fall that had hurled me into oblivion the room was empty except for the old manservant who lay near the door moaning indistinctly the door itself stood open as if someone or something had gone out during my period of unconsciousness i turned again to the bed with some instinctive halfformed intention of trying to extinguish the blaze the flames were spreading rapidly were leaping higher but they were not swift enough to veil from my sickened eyes the hands and features if one could any longer call them such of that which had been sir john tremath of the last horror that had overtaken him i must forbear explicit mention and i would that i could likewise avoid the remembrance all too tardily had the monster been frightened away by the fire there is little more to tell looking back once more as i reeled from the smokeladen room with harper in my arms i saw that the bed and its canopy had become a mass of mounting flames the unhappy baronet had found in his own deathchamber the funeral pyre for which he had longed it was nearly dawn when we emerged from the doomed manorhouse the rain had ceased leaving a heaven lined with high and deadgray clouds the chill air appeared to revive the aged manservant and he stood feebly beside me uttering not a word as we watched an everclimbing spire of flame that broke from the somberroof of tremoth hall and began to cast a sullen glare on the unkempt hedges in the combined light of the fireless dawn and the lurid conflagration we both saw at our feet the semihuman monstrous footprints with their mark of long and canine nails that had been trodden freshly and deeply in the rainwet soil they came from the direction of the manorhouse and ran toward the heathclad hill that rose behind it still without speaking we followed the steps almost without interruption they led to the entrance of the ancient family vaults to the heavy iron door in the hillside that had been closed for a full generation by sir john tremoths order the door itself swung open and we saw that its rusty chain and lock had been shattered by a strength that was more than the strength of man or beast then peering within we saw the claytouched outline of the unreturning footprints that went downward into mausolean darkness on the stairs we were both weaponless having left our revolvers behind us in the deathchamber but we did not hesitate long harper possessed a liberal supply of matches and looking about i found a heavy billet of watersoaked wood which might serve in lieu of a cudgel in grim silence with tacit determination and forgetful of any danger we conducted a thorough search of the wellnigh interminable vaults striking match after match as we went on in the musty shadows the traces of ghoulish footsteps grew fainter as we followed them into those black recesses and we found nothing anywhere but noisome dampness and undisturbed cobwebs and the countless coffins of the dead the thing that we sought had vanished utterly as if swallowed up by the subterranean walls at last we returned to the entrance there as we stood blinking in the full daylight with gray and haggard faces harper spoke for the first time saying in his slow tremulous voice many years ago soon after lady agathas death sir john and i searched the vaults from end to end but we could find no trace of the thing we suspected now as then it is useless to seek there are mysteries which god helping will never be fathomed we know only that the offspring of the vaults has gone back to the vaults there may it remain silently in my shaken heart i echoed his last words and his wish
