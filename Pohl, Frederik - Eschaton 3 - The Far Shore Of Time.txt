chapter one we were actually on our way home when it happened we didnt have any doubt that that was where we were going and we were boy ready we had been months and months in the captivity of a weird alien creature from another world the one we called dopey he was alien all right he looked sort of like a large chicken with a kittens face and a peacocks tail and he had kidnapped the lot of ussnatched us right out of the old starlab astronomical satellite and thrown us into some kind of spacetraveling machine that whisked us from hereto some unbelievably distant there in no time at all and there was where dopey kept us in one damn miserably uncomfortable prison or another on this unpleasant planet we had never heard of before that was a truly nasty experience but the way it looked to us at the time it was over against the odds we had escaped our chance to get away came when some rival gang of nonhumans these ones called the horch invaded our prison planet in the confusion we fought our way to the mattertransmitter thing and jumped in and were on our way home i was the last to climb into the machine and i saw the pale lavender flash that meant it was working and i came out again but i wasnt home at all the place i was in didnt look at all like starlab a pair of those silveryspidery horch wheeled fighting machines that had been trying to kill us were standing there not half a dozen meters away this time they werent shooting at me though if they had been i couldnt have shot back because something i couldnt see grabbed me from behindno enveloped me in an allpoints hug that didnt let me move a muscleas i heard the machines door open again dopey spilled out on top of me plume all ruffled little cat eyes glaring around in terror he took one look at the machines and began to shake something hard and painful was pressing behind my right ear i managed to yell a question at dopey and just before the lights went out he sobbed an answer agent dannerman we are in the hands of the horch and that was the nastiest the very nastiest moment of all part two interrogation chapter two when i woke up i was lying on a hard glassy floor my head felt as though someone had taken a baseball bat to it i kept my eyes prudently closed for a moment i listened trying to figure out where i was and what i was doing there all i heard was an occasional skritchytinkly sound like an incomplete set of cheap wind chimes and now and then a faint whir that sounded a little like skate wheels on a hard floor that told me nothing useful so i took the plunge i opened my eyes and scrambled to my feet that made my headache worse but was the least of my immediate worries i was in serious trouble the room i found myself in was smallish and square with shiny walls that looked as though they were made of some sort of pale yellow porcelain there was nothing on the wallsno windows no decorationsonly a couple of doors both securely closed i was not alone in the room two bizarre machines were hovering over a small chest made out of the same primrose chinaware as the walls they werent the spidery horch fighting machines id seen before what they looked like more than anything else was a pair of squat crystalline christmas trees they had spiky glass branches coming off a central trunk and twigs off the branches and needles off the twigsyes and littler needles coming off the needles too for all i knew there were still littler needles than those as well but i didnt see them each of the machines was topped off by a sort of glassy globe where the angel should have been on a proper christmas tree and these were faceted and glittery like the rotating mirror spheres people rent to cast little spangles of light around a dance floor one of the things was a pale green the other a rosy pink it seemed to methat was hope speaking not wisdomthat they looked pretty fragile whatever they were up to i thought i would have something to say about because one swift kick would shatter a quorum of their glassy needles i was quite wrong about that of course they evidently took notice of the fact that i was awake the green one did something queer with some of its needles clusters of them rearranged themselves fusing into colorless faintly glowing lenses pointing in my direction while the other extended a branch toward something i couldnt see inside the porcelain box i must have made a sudden move because there was a quick new pang from my head i reached up to touch the part that hurt and made an unpleasant discovery something that didnt belong there was just behind my ear it was ribbed and hardsurfaced and faintly warm to the touch like my own flesh it seemed to be embedded in my skin it hadnt been there before and i didnt like it that was when the littler oneits needles were like slivers of shellpink glassrolled up close to my face waving its nearest sprig of needles under my nose then it really surprised me it spoke to me it said you will be asked questions answer them quickly and accurately that put a different face on things i know it sounds peculiar but when the machine said that to me it actually made me feel a bit better interrogation was something i understood having done plenty of it myself i spoke right up i said my name is james daniel dannerman i am a citizen of the united states of america and a senior agent of the american national bureau of investigation i have been a captive of the beloved leaders who are your enemies as well as my own the christmas tree unhurriedly stuffed a fist of needles into my mouth to shut me up and the needles werent fragile at all they were curiously warm they didnt hurt but it was like being gagged with a mouthful of steel wool it said you have not been asked those questions answer only the questions you have been asked im not sure what i tried to say in response with that glassy birds nest stuffed in my mouth it only came out as wumf but it made the thing remove the needles from my mouth and speak again you will now supply information the machine said concerning the conspecific persons you identify as scuzzhawks did their poor personal hygiene and use of psychoactive materials adversely affect their mortality and reproduction rates chapter three of all the things i could have expected to be interrogated about by a horch machine that one was about at the bottom of the list i did know all about the scuzzhawks of course they were an ultralight plane gang that roamed the american southwest scandalizing lawabiding citizens the scuzz were more or less based in orange county california but they rallied anywhere from bakersfield to tijuana they didnt bathe much they didnt wear much eitherthere was a limit to how much load their frail little craft could lift and they reserved most of their carrying capacity for beer and shotgun shells they painted the wings of their ultralights with obscene slogans they relieved themselves wherever they felt a need which was frequentlyeven while they were airborne and often enough over the clean wellkept patios of respectable homeowners the scuzzhawks were not nice people they earned their fuel and food and beer and dope by drugdealing and petty crime and sometimes crimes that were not so petty and early in my career with the bureau i had been assigned to infiltrate them that mission hadnt been my choice when it was over i felt lucky to get out of it alive and generally diseasefree why this pinkglassy christmas tree was asking about them i could not guess but the reason didnt matter the important thing was that it did want to know about them that gave me bargaining room information is a valuable commodity worth trading for i said lets be reasonable here ill tell you all you want to know about the scuzzhawks but first i have a couple of questions of my own whats this thing behind my ear the rosepink one didnt answer that it simply rolled away on its little wheels to the chinaware chest where it extruded enough twiglets to open the chest and take something out while greenie rolled forward and grabbed me again it was strong too it held me tightly but not painfully i would have guessed that some of those glassy needles would have punctured my skin where they touched they didnt retracted i supposed like a playful kittens claws then i saw what the pink one was carrying toward me and i felt better right away the thing it had taken out of the chest was a helmet of a kind i had seen before dopey had given us one when he was our jailer and it was a truly wonderful little gadget when i wore it i could tap into the mind of that other dan dannerman the copy of me who had been sent back to earth in a marvelous kind of virtual reality with the helmet on i could see what that other dan was seeing feel what he was feeling hear everything he heard to all intents and purposes i was therenot counting that i couldnt do anything just observe it had not occurred to me that the same kind of helmet could be used to give me a sort of briefing lecture instead but if that was what pinkie had in mind i was all for it i said chattily thats better theres no reason for us to argue is there were both on the same side you work for the horch i was taken prisoner by the beloved leaders and the enemy of my enemy is my friend right pinkie wasnt listening it was fitting the helmet over my head and i didnt resist i waited complacently until it had flipped the earflaps into position expecting some sort of lecture with diagrams orwell i didnt know exactly what to expect but i was pretty sure it was going to be helpful in some way it wasnt it not only wasnt helpful at all it was bloody awful as soon as everything was snapped down i found myself indeed in another place but it was not any place i would have chosen i was lying flat on my back and i was looking up at a couple of the christmas trees and i was yelling the one standing over me was an unfamiliar golden color and it was methodically ripping my clothes off i was struggling to stop it but there wasnt any use to that i was tightly fettered to a kind of operating table i couldnt move a muscle not even when goldglass began to operate it started by pulling out my toenails one by one then as my yells of protest turned to agonized screams of pain it did even worse with one set of its twiglets it grasped me by my private parts and with others it began to hack away see the virtual reality those helmets provided didnt feel at all virtual it felt bloody damn real the pain was real my screaming was real i was fully aware that i was for no reason i could understand being slowly and painfully tortured to death and i was bellowing with agony accordingly goldglass didnt seem to care about my screaming one way or another it went right on with what it was doing and then as it gouged a slit in the skin of my belly from breastbone to the beginnings of my pubic hair and then began methodically flaying the skin off my body the pain passed the point of being endurable i endured it though i kept on enduring it for much longer than i would have thought possible until the machines rummagings in my belly seemed to hit something crucial then i think i died and then the other christmas tree the real pinkcolored one lifted the helmet off my head and i was once again cowering on that chinaware floor still screaming but intact i had my clothes on again i was alive again andnot counting the headache that still persistedas far as i could tell in as good shape as i had ever been toenails balls bowels and all that is physically i was all right though the memory of the pain was nearly as bad as the pain itself and pinkie said now you will answer our questions about those conspecific persons called scuzzhawks chapter four from then on i answered all its questions all right i had learned that that was a good idea when i hesitated all it had to do was gesture toward the box with the helmet then i stopped hesitating right away see no matter what youve heard nobody ever holds out against serious protracted physical torture the body doesnt allow it when real agony starts the body cuts the volitional part of the brain right out of the circuit it doesnt matter what your intentions are first you suffer then you scream then you do whatever the person inflicting the pain wants you to do including giving away every secret you ever knew bureau doctrine told us there were things we could sometimes do about it provided you had a chance to do themincluding as a last resort biting down on a capsule of one of the bureau drugs that turn off all physical sensations so the guy whos interrogating you can do any horrible thing he likes and you just dont feel a thing provided that is that youve had a chance to get the capsule into your mouth ahead of time even that doesnt really solve the problem you know exactly what is happening when the guy starts inflicting major and irreversible damage on the only body you own then you almost certainly talk anyway i didnt have to go the way of irreparable body damage the pain was enough i talked and kept on talking for a very long while i dont know how long exactly the only way i had of measuring time was by the internal clocks of my belly bladder and bowels by their count that first round of questioning went on forever i told the glass machines everything there was to tell about the scuzzhawks greenglass taking it all down with his microphones and lenses that wasnt the end of it then pinkie switched without a pause to questions about the precise nature of their smuggling operation and what smuggling meant in the context of earths more or less independent political entities called nations each with its own laws about what was forbidden or taxed and then it wanted a detailed catalogue of all the sorts of things that were smuggleddope money for laundering weaponsand then what the weapons were used for which led to many more questions on some large subjects crime terrorism why such aberrations were permitted to continue when they obviously interfered with the orderly workings of government and commerce then without warning the lights went out in the camera lenses the greenglass machine that had been operating them turned to the wall and a door opened and the pink one said go through there and attend to your biological needs we will resume when you have finished i hesitated perhaps i hesitated a moment too long because my headache was still slowing my reflexes but the machine wasnt patient it reached out toward me in a way i didnt like i turned and hurried to the doorway chapter five the biologicalneeds room was a twin of the one id just left bare walls of the same yellow chinaware no windows no pictures the big difference was that there were three doors instead of twoall securely locked against my immediate attempts to open themand in addition to the chinaware chest against the wall there was a pile of food on a low chinaware table the food at least was familiar i had seen it all before in fact i had seen a lot of it we had been living on identically that same grub for months me and pat in all her copies and rosaleen artzybachova and jimmy lin and martin delasquez apart from a few unfamiliar and unappetizing ropy twists of something smelly and purplish it was the food dopey had copied for us when we were his prisoners duplicated from the stores on the starlab orbiter we had been snatched from apples corn chips heaps of dried or irradiated meals in cans and jars and cartons every one of which i was totally sick of when i first saw that pile of rations it made me suddenly aware that i was as a matter of fact pretty hungry when i realized it was the same boring stuff id eaten much too much of already a lot less so there were a couple of jugs of water beside the stack of rations i took a swig out of one of themit tasted flat as though it had been distilledbut while that relieved one biological need it just made another one worse i had to pee i looked doubtfully at the floor when we were captives of dopey and his beloved leaders our cell had this trick floor that doubled as a sewageremoval system any waste that hit the floor was absorbed and carried away without leaving even a stain even human waste this canaryyellow porcelain stuff was something else again it didnt look promising however nature was not to be denied i selected a corner of the room and let fly and when i was through i watched without much optimism to see if the urine would seep away it didnt i said shit all right thats a trivial thing but it was one more damn blow on top of a lot of others you have to remember that just hours before my future had seemed really bright home safe with the dear pat adcock i had just discovered i loved but i wasnt home i wasnt safe pat was god knew where and i was worse off than ever literally now i didnt even have a pot to piss in so i did the only thing i could do i fell back on my bureau training i took a deep breath i crammed some corn chips into my mouth popped open a random jar i looked around the room to see if any curious eyes were observing medidnt matter if they were of courseand i began to tap systematically at the walls and chest and doors now why did i do that it wasnt out of any real hope i didnt see that i had an ice cubes chance in hell of ever getting back to nbi headquarters in arlington with whatever odd bits of information i might learn through all this poking and prying i did it anyway because it was my job back in basic training the meanest of my drill instructors had explained that to us while we were lined up as sweating and stinking and sodden as we were right after the obstacle course and just before the fivekilometer run dis rarely show sympathy this one had none at all what are you tired you dont know what tired is yet you assholes are gonna be a lot worse off than this before youve put your twenty years in times youre gonna be exhausted and shitting your pants but that dont let you off nothing whatever happens whatever the bad guys do to you you do your job if they beat the piss out of you if they cut off your balls and gouge out your fuckin eyes you dont forget what im saying you aint paid to give up youre paid to keep on doing what youre missioned to do so if theres a miracle and you get out alive you can report on every goddam thing you see and hear any questions i was stupider in those days i said sir how are we going to see anything if theyve gouged out our eyes she had an answer for that she said you fall down and gimme thirty sohaving nothing promising to doi did what i coulddo i knew what i wanted to do i wanted to get out of this place and find some way to get back to the transit machine and zap myself back home i didnt quite see how i was going to arrange that but the first step was to gather information so i tapped the walls and tried the doors every way i could think of the doors stayed locked they were perfectly ordinary doors that swung open on hinges the way a door should do nothing exotic or super hightech except that they didnt seem to have any handles however i pushed or kicked them they didnt move neither did the lid of the chest when i went back to that i didnt give up i rummaged through the pile of food to see if there was anything hidden under it and i even took one fairly nauseating taste of the purplish stuff and i pulled and tugged at the unknown object behind my right ear trying to figure out what that was all about i could tell a few things about it it was about the size of a pigeons egg it was smoothsurfaced either metal or ceramicwhen i tapped my fingernail against it it sounded more ceramic than metal but i couldnt be sure it was ribbed and the skin of my scalp seemed to have grown right around it as though it belonged there the way your gums surround your teeth but that was all i could tell about the thing so i went back to my tapping and probing because even if there wasnt any drill sergeant around to make me do pushups if i didnt that was my job and while i was hard at it nibbling at some kind of dried fruit bar while i did one of the doors opened it let in another couple of those glassy robotsone bronze one cherry red i didnt think i had seen either of them beforealong with my former captor and present traveling companion the little alien creature with a body like a peacock and a face like a nastyminded cat dopey the robots stood silently communing for a moment but i didnt see what they were up to i was looking at dopey it was clear that the ugly little creature had been having at least as hard a time as i his decorous little muumuu was stained and where it opened for his peacock plume it was shredded the plume itself was muddily dark with none of its usual shifting iridescent colors dopeys fur had stains of its own his belly bag was missing and he was wearing a decoration i hadnt seen before it was ribbed like my patch and gold in color which my own might well have been since i couldnt see the thing the only difference was that his patch was on top of his head instead of behind one ear he gazed at me blearily out of those kitten eyes and groaned we are in terrible trouble agent dannerman he informed me then he waddled over to the food and began attacking the purplish stuff without another word i didnt need to be told that we were in trouble but there was a good side to it now i had someone i could talk to without penalty what stopped me was the presence of the christmas trees i eyed them warily but they were ignoring me they had busied themselves with domestic chores the cherrycolored one was mopping my little pool of urine from the floor while the other did something to the porcelain chest that opened it up inside the chest was a heap of something that looked like oatmeal the bronze one tapped the side of the chest with a thrust of branches and pointed another cluster at me this is to contain your excrements it said do not continue to soil the floor and then the two of them left i had been a captive before but this was the first time i had been given a litter box like some old ladys pet cat the place was full of humbling experiences but we were alone and it was my chance to talk to dopey i followed him to the food stacks and said all right as you say were in trouble but where are we in trouble and how did we get here he chewed greedily for a moment before he answered or didnt answer actually he said still chewing if you have eaten all you wish agent dannerman you would be well advised to sleep now you may not get many opportunities well i knew that but what he said sounded odd to me i couldnt quite think why then i realized that dopey had spoken to me in english that was when i became aware that i hadnt been speaking english with the christmastree machines i had been talking to them in their own chirpy language of which i could have sworn i had never known a single word chapter six well i was exhausted and i still had the residual headache but i figured out the explanation for that fast enough it had to be the thing theyd stuck on my head that accounted for my sudden fluency in horch the important thing was that in whatever language i now had someone who might answer some questions for me just tell me what happened i coaxed he looked at me and then at the remainder of his meal then he made the bodywriggle that was his version of a shrug very well but you should have deduced it for yourself agent dannerman when we entered the transit machine we were transmitted to your starlab you and i along with the others but of course once a pattern has been constructed in the machine for transmission it remains available so that from that pattern copies may be made at any time as you will recall i had previously made copies of your dr adcock for you i didnt have to be reminded of that i remembered everything there was to remember about pat adcock therefore it should not surprise you that the horch made copies of us so that we could be questioned but where are we i certainly dont recognize this placeis it some kind of horch base it is now he said sourly nevertheless it is the same base on the same planet in the same globular cluster that we were in before i do not know by what treachery the horch were able to break into our transmission channels but it enabled them to surprise and occupy this baseat great cost in lives and materiel of course but the horch do not care about such things of course the horch have obviously made some changes in the structures to suit their own purposes i assume from the changes that some time has elapsed since we were transmitted how much time i demanded he just did that bodytwitching shrug again i tried another tack about the questioning dopey theyre asking some pretty funny questions wouldnt you think theyd want to know the important stuff about earth like our technology what kind of weapons we have like that but they surely know all those things already agent dannerman he said looking surprised they are simply filling in gaps in the knowledge obtained from the others of us whom they have already copied and questioned did you think we were the first as a matter of fact that was exactly what i had thought i wished i could go on thinking it because if they had questioned other copies of dopey and of me it was unpleasantly likely that they had also done the same thing with the same brutal tactics to rosaleen and jimmy and martin and to pat to my own pat my own pat whom i knew to be a pretty selfwilled person when she chose to be she wouldnt have taken any more guff from the christmas trees than i had at first and then they would have done to her what they did to me that was not something i could bear thinking about while i was thinking about it anyway because i couldnt help myself dopey was going about his own business he didnt speak to me again he finished his meal decorously relieved himself in the litter box then selected a spot on the floor and crouched down tucking his head under his plume for a nap i couldnt let that happen because i needed to get the image of pat being ripped open by a robot out of my mind i said wait a minute dopey he pulled his head back out again and regarded me crossly you are willful agent dannerman he complained did you not understand what i said about sleeping when we could i did but i wanted to ask you something why do they have to torture us that made him wrinkle up his little cat mouth in annoyance because they want truthful answers of course but cant they just make us do whatever they want i touched the ribbed thing behind my ear by putting some kind of controller in with this language thing he blinked the cat eyes at me controller like the one the beloved leaders implanted in you i explained so you would have to do whatever they wanted he made an indignant noise and stood up straight on his tiny legs glaring at me you are so stupid agent dannerman why do you think i have a controller implanted in me by the beloved leaders i looked at him in surprise dont you of course not there is no need for that i am a rational being as are all of my people and so we know where our interests lie his pursy little mouth was twitching and his plume was angry red but then he calmed down enough to explain the bearers which you call docs do require such devices to be of value to the beloved leaders because they are very willful beings the warriors also need to be controlled the reason for this is that in the course of their duties many of them must inevitably be dispatched to the eschaton although they have been informed that this death is actually a boon not a tragedy their natures prevail they are not able to rid themselves of their instinct for selfpreservation which would interfere with their duties for the rest of us servants of the beloved leaders my people included selfinterest takes a different form we are glad to obey the beloved leaders because we know what they can do to us if we fail them he didnt seem sleepy anymore just scared his plume faded to a bilious green as he said you do not know the beloved leaders agent dannerman you have never even seen one i have been more fortunatenot once but three times one even spoke to me though not in person of course it was while i was monitoring your planet from the orbiter starlab and a beloved leader addressed me on a screen to give me an order i was very frightened agent dannerman if you are not also frightened it is because you do not understand the immensity of their power or the consequences of their wrath do you really think your pitiful little planet can withstand the beloved leaders it cannot as i have told you you are a fool their scout vessels found your earth once they will find it again if indeed they have not already done so it is true that these evil horch and their machines are also extremely powerful i do not think they will prevail against the beloved leaders though when the eschaton comes i believe it is the beloved leaders who will rule rule all of us for eternity and oh agent dannerman i have failed them and so i am very very frightened of what that eternity will be chapter seven that was the end of dopeys conversation he put his head under his plume again and kept it there i thought i heard him sobbing for a few moments but then he was quiet i fell asleep then too not because i wanted to but because i couldnt help it when the greenglass machine woke me up dopey was still in his corner making the faint muffled snickering sound that did him for snoring and an idea was forming in my mind i didnt have much time to think it out because greenie was already snaking one branch of its twiglets under my right arm to get me up then hustling me back to the interrogation room but on the way i remembered doctrine basic bureau tradecraft said that if you couldnt get your interrogators to give you the information you wanted perhaps you could at least lead the questioning in such a way that even the questions were informative in practice sessions back in my training days it had seemed like something that might work id never tried it in the field but it was worth a shot it was something to do when the only alternative was simply to give up it seemed that the machines had heard all they wanted to hear about the scuzzhawks now the topic of the day was sex what did sexual intercourse feel like if it was pleasurable why did some human beings deprive themselves of it how often had i had sexual intercourse and under what circumstances and with what persons and why why was sexual intercourse with another person preferable to masturbation what forms of sexual experience other than direct stimulation existed and what did i mean by fetishism and masochism how was it possible that some of my conspecifics could achieve sexual gratification just by inflicting pain on others i did what i could i answered every question and tacked on a little question to each answer masturbation didnt the horch masturbate hugging and kissing i supposed the horch had their equivalents and didnt some horch get a charge out of hurting other horch without exception none of my questions got an answer mostly they were ignored sometimes greenie cautioned me to stick to straight responses twice it gestured toward the porcelain box that held the helmet which was enough and the questioning went on and on when it stopped at last it was only long enough for me to relieve myself and cram down a few bites of food and then it started again chapter eight i dont know how long the interrogation sessions went on i tried to keep count of them but there wasnt much point to that the number didnt tell me much because i had no good measure of how many hours each lasted or how long i was allowed to sleep when i did i didnt know either whether it really mattered for me to keep on sounding the walls trying to peer past the doors when they were opened even once deliberately falling against one of the christmas trees to see how they felt i wished for dopeys presence so i could ask him more questions that didnt happen often we seemed to be on different schedules once when greenglass woke me up i caught a glimpse of him sound asleep but when i was allowed back in the biologicalneeds room he was gone and the questions didnt stop sports how were players selected for football teams and why would any sentient being risk life and limb in so violent an activity currency what determined how many japanese yen were given for one american dollar what caused inflation why did humans play board games how was ownership of land areas determined what was the role of the stock market and i was reaching the ragged edge of fatigue i wasnt getting very far with trying to slip questions in either i was pretty sure that the robots were very familiar with that little stratagem and i thought i knew why they had dealt with dan dannermans before and they knew our tricks then i thought i saw an opening the questioning turned to religion what was the nature of the religious experience what evidence did the priests and preachers have for the existence of a god or a heaven or for that matter of a hell or some other form of postlife reward or punishment for transgressions and all of a sudden i saw what i had been waiting for i had something to tell them that i was pretty sure would dislodge some data for me excuse me i wheedled the very model of a prisoner beaten down past the point of resistance trying to curry favor with his captors but if you permit i can tell you a story from my personal experience that might illuminate some of these questions for you greenglass paused its needles stirring in silence apparently thinking that over then it spoke do so it said what i wanted to tell the machine about was a memory of my grandmother from when i was six or seven years old that was when my parents began to make me spend a few weeks each summer at uncle cubbys place on the jersey shore uncle chubby was j cuthbert dannerman the one with the money i didnt specially want to be spending summers in his house uncle cubby wanted it because he liked having kids around now and then possessing none of his own and my father who hadnt done nearly as well with his career as his older brother wanted me to be there too because he was well aware that when uncle chubby died there would be a considerable estate for someone to inherit well that part didnt work out for me for one reason or another but those summers in new jersey turned out not to be so bad after i had cried myself to sleep for a week or so i began to enjoy myself my cousin pat came along most summers for the same reasons unfortunately she was a girl but at least she was someone to play with and after a while her gender turned out to be an asset that was when we discovered some interesting new games like ill show you mine if you show me yours the bad part of the summers was that grandmother dannerman was there too grandmother dannerman was a dying old woman but she was taking her time about it she was bedridden feeble and incontinent there was always a faint smell of oldlady pee in her bedroom although the big windows that looked down to the river were generally open wide after her fifth or sixth major operation she had got religion and she wanted me and pat to have it too she explained that when she died she was going to go to heaven because she had been a good christian woman she fully intended to see us there with her so once a day after our naps and before we were allowed to go swim in the river she taught us bible stories in her tiny wheezy voice that was a drag it did make playing doctor under the boat deck half an hour later a little more exciting but it never had the effect on us that grandmother dannerman intended she didnt make us want to go to heaven she told us there was no sin there and what was the fun of someplace where you werent allowed to sin a little that was then this was now and i thought i had finally found a good use for grandmother dannermans sermons i told them to the greenglass christmas tree and obedient to my training i did my best to put a little spin on them the angels in the old ladys heaven were they sort of like the way the horch would be at the eschaton did the bright angelic swords of fire correspond to the weapons of the horch when we all got there would we spend our time singing and playing music and never ever doing anything the horch might consider a sin thats what i tried it didnt work very well greenglass didnt want questions from me greenglass wanted only facts the first couple of times i tried throwing in a question it simply ignored what i asked then it instructed me to stop doing that and then it got worse see i couldnt stop i was convinced that i had no other way of gaining information and i kept on doing it and so the christmas tree took its inevitable next step that was the second time i got the helmet it was just as agonizing as before but it had a surprising result i expect i screamed a lot when greenglass at last took the helmet off my head and i lay there shaken and miserable i saw that something had changed one of the rooms doors had opened something i had never seen before was looking in at us it was a pretty hideous specimen what it looked like more than anything else was a scaleddown model of one of the dinosaurs id seen in the museums when i was a kidan apatosaurus they called that kindonly this one was standing on its hind legs and wearing a kind of lavishly embroidered jogging suit its arms werent like a dinosaurs though they were lightly furred and as sinuous as an elephants trunk and so was its long long neck with a little snaky head at the end of it that darted around inquisitively it had a round little belly that was covered by a circular patch of embroidered goldit almost looked like a particularly fancy maternity dressand i recognized it at once from the pictures dopey had shown us when we were his captives it was the enemy i guess my screaming had attracted it and so i was in the presence of a living breathing horch when the horch entered the room the christmas trees stopped what they were doing their twiglets turning deferentially toward it it did not speak to them it came toward me arms and neck swaying and it darted its little head at my face sniffing and staring into my eyes then the long neck whipped the head away and the creature turned toward the door to the biologicalneeds room the door opened at once and the horch passed through followed by the rosypink robot what they were doing there i could not see though i could hear sounds from inside the room the horch and the christmas tree were twittering to each other though i couldnt make out the words there was something else going on too squeaking gasping noises i couldnt identify then the horch came back into the interrogation room didnt speak simply left it again through one of the other doors with that long neck curved back and the snaky little eyes peering at me rosypink buzzed back on its little rollerskate wheels to where i lay it didnt comment on the visit from the living horch it didnt resume the questioning either attend now to your biological needs it said and that was the end of that session the mystery sounds had come from dopey he wasnt alone either a bronzecolored christmas tree was holding him down while a pale yellow one was doing some obviously painful things to him it looked like a torture session to me and that was both surprising and wrong i mean sinfully wrong a violation of order and propriety interrogations didnt take place in the biologicalneeds room no prisoner likes to see changes in the rules because changes are almost always bad so i squawked a feeble sort of protest it didnt go any further than that the pale yellow one extended a clutch of branches menacingly in my direction and i took the hint i shut up i couldnt help watching though every time the machine touched dopey he twitched and squeaked in pain though they werent asking him any questions then abruptly they released him and rolled out of the room as soon as they were gone i knelt beside dopey he was breathing hoarsely obviously hurting are you all right i asked he turned the kitten eyes on me no agent dannerman i am not all right he gasped leave me alone i couldnt do that did you see that thing it was a living horch wasnt it dopey gave me a look of disdain of course he said pulling himself together he stood up uncertainly then limped toward the water jug i followed you werent surprised to see him he took his time about answering drinking from his little cupped hands it seemed to revive him the horch rule here he said licking his lips what is surprising if one looks in on our interrogation did you expect it to be kinder than its machines as a matter of fact i had sort of he looked like he was inspecting the way we were treated i said unwilling to give up what little hope i could find i thought he might do something to help us maybe he gave me a look of contempt and said his favorite thing you are a fool agent dannerman kindness from a horch not kindness i said stubbornly common sense if we get sick we wont be any good to them in which case he said they will simply scrap us and make new copies now i wish to sleep he looked as though he needed it all right i said reluctantly i forgot theyd been torturing you he gazed at me with an expression of blended contempt and woe torturing me no agent dannerman they were not torturing me they were doing worse they were giving me medical treatment to keep me alive now let me sleep chapter nine day followed day and the pointless endless questioning went on on the robots capricious choice of subjects childhood games how many players were necessary for hideandseek were little league baseball players paid like their adult colleagues theater what had christopher marlowe written besides dr faustus and the jew of malta what was the function of the chorus in greek drama those questions puzzled me at first i certainly knew a lot about theater because thats what i had majored in in college but why did they ask me about the parts i didnt know instead of the earlytwentiethcentury playwrights i had studied it took me several days to figure it out and when i did the answer gave me no pleasure the robots had asked all the obvious questions already but they had asked them of some other dan dannerman as dopey had said now they were simply filling in the gaps that remained along about then that living horch dropped in again on my interrogation this time he didnt come alone the horch who came with him was female there was no doubt about that the evidence was clear because she was suckling an infant horch with one pendulous breast though otherwise the two adults were hard to tell apart they both wore the colorful jerkins with soft flexible halfsleeves over their snaky arms the only difference in their costumes was that her belly was covered not by embroidered fabric but by a shiny metal dome almost like a medieval knights helmet if it hadnt been on he wrong part of her anatomy when the infant released her breast it dangled over the metal dome until she tucked the breast away and slung the infant under one ropy arm the babys little neck swinging foolishly around the interrogation had stopped the robots standing silent and immobile the two adult horch paid them no attention they conferred for a moment snaky necks almost intertwined and the little rattlesnake heads so close together that i couldnt hear anything then the female darted her head in my face the least grandson of the two eights djabeertapritch she saidi thought that was the name she used as close as i could make it outis of the opinion that your physical state is deteriorating is that the case i goggled at her the last thing i had expected was that a horch would concern itself with my physical state while i was puzzling over that the other horch took a hand it is to your advantage to answer her bureau agent james daniel dannerman he said please respond the most startling part of that was the please but the other thing that struck me was that although there was no doubt they were speaking the same language the males accent was markedly different the females was identical with that of the robots his was throatier and more drawn out i managed to answer yes theyre really giving me a hard time djabeertapritch is also of the opinion that if you were allowed to rest however you might survive indefinitely the female stated i didnt much care for the way that was put but i managed to answer i hope so i said cautiously and that was the end of the interview the two of them marched out without another word the baby flailing about under its mothers arm and at once my interrogators returned to life tell us greenglass said as though there had been no interruption why you consider craps a game of skill while roulette is merely chance and we went right on with the interrogation i decided that what the female horch had said was a good thing however unattractively it had been put i almost believed that the horch were beginning to take an interest in my future that was encouraging it suggested that i might actually have one but when i saw dopey again he cackled humorlessly at me do not attribute kindness to the horch agent dannerman he advised their motives are their own i could see that he hadnt been receiving much kindness from them his breathing was fast and shallow and he was clearly in pain i dont think of myself as a person without compassion treacherous little freak that he was dopey was still the closest thing i had to a friend anywhere within some distance measured in lightyears and i didnt really want to cause him more suffering on the other hand the thought that i might somehow survive all this had revived my desire to learn whatever might be advantageous to the human race i said doing my best to sound sympathetic i guess theyre forcing you to tell them all kinds of things dopey that is a correct assumption agent dannerman including the things that you wouldnt tell us when we were your prisoners including everything why do you ask because i said if youve been spilling your guts to the horch robots already whats the point in keeping secrets from me anymore he considered that grayly for a moment then gave his wriggly sort of shrug very well agent dannerman what is it you wish to know i said everything everything turned out to include more information than i could grasp in a single session since those sessions occurred only at the convenience of the robots they didnt come very often either and they didnt last long when they did worse than that a lot of what dopey admitted to having told the christmas trees did nothing for me i had no particular interest in the dietary needs of the other species who worked for the beloved leadersdocs fighters half a dozen other serving racesand when i asked him what part those other weirdos played in the grand beloved leaders scheme his answers made little sense to me but the christmas trees had also asked him in detail about the way he had come to earth and that might be worth knowing it was radio that had done us in one of the random scouting ships of the beloved leaders had detected some early terrestrial broadcasts and that was the signal they had been looking for at once the ship changed course homing in on the radio signals and we had become targets all that took time how much time dopey couldnt tell me with any precision but from the nature of those first broadcastssports events political speeches random news programs and all in am sound radio onlyi figured out that the scout ship had had to be more than a hundred lightyears away at the time of i detection which meant something over a hundred years of travel time for the ship and sometime along the way as the ship sniffed its way down the electronic scent trail of humanity dopey was dispatched to the ship to begin the task of deciphering what those broadcasts were all about not just one of me dopey clarified it is what i am f trained for but the volume of data was too great for a single person to handle many broadcasts from many parts of your planet and ultimately with vision as well as sound we eavesdropped on every scrap of voice and picture altogether there were seven copies of me to share the work of deciphering your preposterous number of languages i do not know what happened to the other six but i was the one who was tasked to remain on your starlab orbiter until you and your party came to investigate that was as far as we got in that session and i was burning with impatience to learn more when the next chance came dopey was looking frailer and closer to his eschaton than ever he didnt really want to go on talking to me but i wasnt willing to let him stop he told me how the scouting ship had dropped off the pod that attached itself to starlab and how they had filled the old satellite with recording and transmission devices he described the scout ship itself to mea vessel much larger than starlab with a crew of dozens of beings of several different races and then he became obstinate this is all foolishness agent dannerman he complained what is the use of telling you all this when there is no chance that you can pass it on to your conspecifics i said staunchly im still alive dopey so there is always a chance but he said reasonably you do not know if your planet still exists we have no way of knowing how long it has been before these copies of us were made i had an answer for that it cant be very long i told him if it was all over on earth they wouldnt still be asking me all those questions he looked at me in surprise that is not so you are forgetting agent dannerman that the horch and the beloved leaders wish to know everything possible about all intelligent species even the extinct ones it will make them easier to rule at the eschaton chapter ten i wasnt willing to believe that i couldnt afford to but it stayed in my mind i stripped down and used my wretched underwear for a washcloth while dopey watched me with lackluster curiosity while i was wringing out my shorts and draping them on the edge of the table to dry i said if i only had some clean clothes id almost feel human that wasnt entirely true but i was trying to cheer dopey up it didnt work very well he didnt respond he just sat there perched on the far edge of the table with his eyes half closed and his great peacock fan the color of mud he had been taking punishment all right there were rips in the periphery of his fan that hadnt been there before and new stains on the jumper he wore i tried again encouragingly we dont have to give up you know theres always a chance to escape he didnt answer that either just sat there breathing raggedly he wasnt asleep his eyes were more or less open and he hadnt pulled his fan over his head to shut me out but he wasnt listening i gave up i spooned some water out of the drinking jug into one of the cups of dehydrated stew and ate one of the apples while the stew was soaking i tugged at the lid to the litter box thinking it might be some kind of weapon if i could get it off i couldnt then i saw that dopey had begun to move he levered himself painfully off the table and waddled slowly over to the water jugs he drank some then splashed some over himself i took him by his frail little arm and said clearly i intend to escape i need you to help me make a plan he grunted without actually answering i squeezed harder on the arm talk to me i demanded he wrenched himself free if you make a plan he said you are telling the horch what to expect are you an even greater fool than i thought butbut that was why i asked in english he sighed they listen in no matter what language we speak whether we see them or not they are observing us at all times i said hell of course it was only an illusion but i had believed we had at least that much privacy i shouldnt have that was a bureau trick too id done it myself after youve interrogated a couple of suspects for a while you put them together and listen to what they say to each other he was talking again in any case he said gloomily there is no hope of escape we will die here agent dannerman and the next time i see you we will be at the eschaton his certainty was bringing out all the stubbornness in me if theres really going to be an eschaton i said but of course there will i shook my head at him pat didnt think so and shes an expert in that subject an earthhuman expert he sneered all the same pat said it had been conclusively shown that there wasnt enough mass in the universe to make it contract again it will go on expanding forever and never shrink down again to the big crunch so no eschaton she said there was no doubt about that at all dopey made the gagging rattle in his throat that was his version of a contemptuous laugh your primitive beliefs both the beloved leaders and the horch are far far wiser than dr pat adcock there is no question he turned his back on me and limped over to gaze without much interest at his purple food you dont seem real happy about it i offered he put a small chunk of the stuff in his mouth chewing unenthusiasticallyand sloppily crumbs were falling to the floor then with his mouth full he said you do not understand agent dannerman i have betrayed the beloved leaders their judgment will be sure oh maybe not i said it might go the other way you know maybe the horch will win and then you wont have to face your beloved leaders he turned the cat eyes on me mournfully do you think that would be better for me or for you either he swallowed the rest of what was in his mouth then put the remainder of the stuff down in any case agent dannerman he said i think i will find out which it is quite soon well he was right about that a few sessions later when the christmas trees released me for my peeandchow break i discovered dopey lying next to the table his plume dragged limply on the floor one of his kitten eyes was closed to a slit and the other queerly distended neither was looking at me and his body was cold i shouted but no one came when one of the crystal robots did eventually appear it paid no attention to my dead companion it only hustled me off to my next interrogation and when i came back to the room his body was gone chapter eleven never mind about the next while the easy way to describe it is that it was more of the same but thats not accurate it was worse not only was i now alone more alone than i had ever been in my life but too little sleep for too long was doing me in my thinking was getting fuzzy every time i got to the biologicalneeds room i fell asleep at once without bothering to eat and that was not improving my state i cant say that i was giving up hope because i hadnt had all that much hope to begin with but i was getting too bleary even to think about a future and then something did come along the christmas trees questions had been getting sillier and more erratic than ever sometimes both machines stood silent for a few moments apparently deep in thought before coming up with some new asininity then after a particularly lengthy period of cogitation pinkie rolled away from me and stood silently beside greenglass whose lenses began to disappear both machines seemed to shrink into themselves retracting whole hordes of their finer needles remember i was staggeringly weary by the time it registered with me that the robots were in some sort of standby state and thus in good condition to be attacked it was too late to do anything about it the door opened three living horch came in the one with the funny accent the female i had seen before and an unfamiliar male who wore the same gleaming metal belly helmet as the female the female darted her head toward greenglass i suppose giving it an order i couldnt hear i didnt have any trouble seeing the results though both christmas trees sprang into action they advanced on me and grabbed me but not as they had done before this time not all their needles were retracted they pricked me in a hundred places and they hurt i yelped in pain and surprise that didnt stop them they investigated most of the parts of my body with their sharp little spikes then without a word they dropped me to the floor and rolled back to the horch at the door there was a lowtoned conversation while i was picking myself up and then the two horch with the metal belly plates left the christmas trees went into standby mode and the one with the embroidered fabric stomacher came toward me bureau agent james daniel dannerman he said the interrogation is terminated you have been given to me for disposal it was the first time i had ever been close enough to a live horch to touch so i summoned all the energy i had and grabbed him by the throat tell those robots not to interfere youre going to take me out of here i croaked as menacingly as i could make it he didnt seem worried he didnt need to be he was a lot stronger than i was both of the christmas trees snapped out of their down mode and sprang forward but he waved them away those ropy arms of his pulled my fingers from his throat without effort yes of course he said transportation has been arranged he turned and left through the open door and carrying me the greenglass christmas tree rolled after him part three the compound chapter twelve outside the interrogation room the christmas tree waited for a moment while the horch climbed onto a funnylooking kind of threewheeled velocipede he flopped onto it on his back belly up with his long neck twisting around so he could see where he was going then he whizzed away and we followed as before it wasnt a sightseeing trip the machine carried me hugged to its bristly needles my face pressed so that i could get only gimpses of the scenery but i recognized it dopey was right the last time id seen any of this it had been shattered and smoking junk but it was definitely the old beloved leaders base the fires out now and here and there a christmas tree diligently taking the ruined machinery apart the horch made better time on his tricycle than we did he was waiting beside it when we arrived and the christmas tree set me down we were at the edge of the builtup base with that vast empty ochercolored desert in front of us a different kind of vehicle was parked there with an alien standing next to it i recognized the creature as one of the huge pale multiarmed ones we called docs but there was something odd about it it took me a moment to realize what it was all the docs i had seen before wore nothing but a kind of jockstrap while this one was fully clothed i turned as i heard a skitter of wheels on pavement behind methe christmas tree was skating away its work here evidently finishedand when i turned back the horch was looking me over he sniffed at me with the little nostril slits in his pointy snake nose then drew his head back to stare into my eyes you will be all right i think he said this medical sapient will take you to a safe place and care for you he signaled to the doc who picked me up more gently than the machine and held me as the horch came over for a last word i could feel the breath from its mouth as his head stretched toward me perhaps you will want a name for me you can call me beert trilling the r clipping the final t it is the short form of my name as yours is dan another one called me that before he died i was practicing saying the name for myself when he got to the last part then i opened my mouth to ask about this other one but beert wasnt listening yes you say my name quite well no questions now please i have duties to attend to but i will come to you when i can in any case everything will be explained to you if you survive if you survive these creatures from other planets were great at dropping conversationstoppers on me helping me to survive appeared to be the docs job he didnt speak but he laid me down on a bench in the vehicle and began to palp my throat belly groin skull i didnt see him do anything to make the vehicle start but while he was poking at me the door closed the car lurched and evidently on autopilot we began to glide away on its air cushion the doc rolled me over and began doing something radical to the small of my back it didnt hurt but it felt unwelcome then it began to feel a little better if i had been a little less bonewearyfrazzled i might have tried to see where we were going i didnt there were no windows operating in the car and besides the docs ministrations were making me feel a little bit relaxed for the first time in quite a while so i suppose i fell asleep at least i was surprised when the door opened and i realized the car had stopped another doc peered in the two of them my medic and the new one mewed at each other in a highpitched language i had never heard before then they helped me out of the car i was standing in bright sunshine with half a dozen of the docs gathered around to stare at me the new one spoke you are dannerman he informed mewell more accurately she informed me it wasnt until a little later that i got the genders straight my name is was something i had a lot of trouble pronouncing much less writing down it started with a kind of baritone purring sound then something like clearing the throat and at the end finishing with a deeptoned hiss the closest i can come is pirraghiz you are safe here she went on do you know what this place is i frowned at her she was rapidly making my pleasant languor evaporate and that struck me as a stupid question how would i know what it was then i looked around more carefully and i did there were a couple of strangelooking buildings that i knew i had never seen before shiny yellow like the chinaware walls of the interrogation room five or six meters high and sort of elliptical in plan with sides that tapered up from the ground what they reminded me of mostly was pictures i had seen of the ancient civil war ironclad the merrimac and they were not in the least familiar however that wasnt all that was in sight there was a little stream not far away crossed by steppingstones there were trees in the distance there was something that looked like a primitive stone fireplace and there was a tepeelike thing that wasnt exactly a tepee the last time id seen any of those jimmy lin had given them a name he called them yurts oh my god i said because yes it was a very familiar place i lived in those yurts when i was a captive of the beloved leaders that is correct pirraghiz told me gently you lived here before now you will stay here again while we feed you and try to make you well chapter thirteen i spent most of the next few days sleeping as far as i could tell pirraghiz never slept at all every time i woke up she was there carrying me to a toilet spoonfeeding me more of the foods i had been eating for so long rubbing the small of my back with that special little touch of hers that seemed to be meant to put me back to sleep and always did so for the next fortyeight hours at least it could have been more i was pretty much out of it i was hazily aware that sometimes she was doing other things to memassaging poking cupping my head in her two largest handsbut i didnt know why except that it felt good now and then i know others came into the room to look at me mostly other docs but once or twice i think the horch those fuzzy periods of nearly waking didnt last when pirraghiz saw that i was wakeful she touched me with one gentle talon and i was gone again when the time came that i was very nearly wideawake for very nearly an hour or so at a time i took a closer look at my surroundings the bed i was in was comfortable enough except for being maybe a little firmer than i would have preferred however it was built to doc dimensions nearly four meters long and more than half that in width the room was in the same statuesque scale on the walls there were a couple of murallike paintings or still photographs i couldnt decide which one was a group of doc infants at play the other a misty idealized scene of a seashore with gentle waves breaking on a pinksand beach elsewhere along the walls were shelves that contained clothes and thingspirraghizs i supposedand others with spools of a glassy sort of ribbon a squat cylindrical thing by the window blew air at me i supposed for comfort in recesses in the walls there was a thing like a chromium soup bowl a meter across that was standing on one edgefor what purpose i did not knowand a couple of smaller bowls of a different kind that were filled with a kind of peat moss unfamiliar bluegreen buds poked out of the moss the whole place had a livedin look naturally enough it was pirraghizs own room she had given it up for me when she came to check up on me she was astonished to find me standing up before she said anything she carefully felt me all over then more or less satisfied she allowed me to walk to the toilet on my own i havent said what the toilet was like there were three of them lined up huge docsized things that looked like chic sale outhouses on pilings they were built right over the flowing stream and you got to them by a small bridge i must have said something that pirraghiz hadnt expected because she looked at me curiously are you dissatisfied with the sanitary arrangements no of course not well a little surprised anyway its just that the sanitary arrangements dont seem very sanitary on earth a lot of people get very upset if they find anyone using the streams for toilets because of the risk of spreading infection that stopped her cold the snowy mossy eyebrows went up in astonishment are you telling me she asked sounding scandalized that your excrement may contain live pathogens doesnt everybodys the great bland face was wearing an expression of revulsion that is a disgusting concept dannerman no we will have to provide you with other facilities for the protection of other species who are downstream from us and you must not excrete into the river anymore by the time pirraghiz was finally letting me feed myself and did not immediately put me back to sleep as soon as i was finished i was remembering the lessons my old di had beaten into me i had a duty it was time for me to start scoping this place out so i insisted on being allowed to go outside physically i was feeling pretty goodno more than that i was feeling better than i had in a long time i was still weak though when we came to a short flight of stairs i wasnt really ready fortall docsized stairs they werepirraghiz didnt stop to ask permission she just picked me up and carried me to the outside door and i was glad she had i had not expected it to be night outside if i had had any uncertainty about where we were the sight of that night sky removed it my dearly beloved astronomy expert pat had suspected that the prison planet we were on was in the middle of a globular cluster which she said was a collection of maybe thousands of stars crowded so close together that the whole clutter of them was bound by each others gravity sailing around in complex orbits and all very very near all the rest there were certainly hundreds in that overhead night sky that were very near to us giant brilliant lightbulbs hanging in the heavens blue and red and yellow and white and all the shades in between at least a dozen of them were as bright as the moon from earth and a couple so incredibly bright that i squinted when i looked at them in one corner of the sky there was a cobwebby film of white brighter than the milky way it wasnt anything like the milky way though according to pat the milky way was made up of millions and billions of individual stars so distant that their light smeared together into a luminous blur this stuff she thought was masses of gas and plasma that some of the stars were stealing from each other pat had had something else to say about this display according to her in a globular cluster novas and supernovas might be relatively common and when a star exploded in one of those ways it was likely to release floods of seriously damaging radiation with very bad results for any living thing nearby when i said something about that to pirraghiz she said of course that is so dannerman showers of deadly radiation are quite frequent that is why the horch restored the protective shield over this planet as soon as they finished occupying the base it was down for only a few days but in that time many persons of many species died from it then she touched my throat with one of her lesser arms and frowned you are being too active for your first time out come back you can eat and then you should rest some more there will be plenty of time to explore i didnt actually need to do a lot of exploring i already knew this place very well before we escaped back to earthi mean before the ones of us that did successfully escape didwe had spent a lot of time here it was a prison or zoo where the beloved leaders kept a few samples of the sentient races they had metand often exterminated we lived in the yurts but we didnt build them some others had lived here before us and we guessed died here too because all that remained of them was their works now the compound belonged to the liberated docs or at least to the thirty or so surviving ones that had managed to escape being killed in the fighting the docs looked a lot different now the ones i had been used to seeing were silent they obeyed orders and when no orders were given they stood frozen waiting for the next command these present docs were never still as they worked around the compound chattering back and forth in their high chirpy voices and they were fully clothed they wore decorous trousers over their lower parts and above the waist a sort of loose gaily colored blouse with sleeves for all six of their arms each wore a huge floppy hat to keep the sun away as i peered inside the surviving yurtit looked like the one we had kept our food in but it was empty nowi felt that gentle touch on my neck i turned it was pirraghiz of course once more taking my pulse or whatever it was she did when she touched me there are you getting tired she asked anxiously i assured her i wasnt though i was pretty certain she knew my condition better than i did i pointed to the yurt how come you left this one standing she looked faintly embarrassed or as much so as a creature with a great mosscovered moon of a face could look it did not seem right to remove them all the people who built them are gone and there was no other way to remember them i know this is not a sensible thing dannerman then she patted my shoulder with a lesser hand it wasnt a medicinal touch this one or even a particularly affectionate one it was the way your mother might put her hand on your shoulder when she wants your full attention i have a question for you dannerman you have been all over this area looking at everything yet you have seen almost everything here before so what is it that you are looking for the truthful answer was a way to get out of here and go home i was pretty sure she suspected as much but i didnt want to confirm it for her and anyway there was something else id been hoping to find so i told her the other thing a grave a friend of mine died here her name was patsy and she was killed by some electric amphibians we buried her around here she bought it without question she patted me again consolingly this time and said i will lead you to it the plot was farther away from the yurts than id remembered but i recognized it at once the ground had settled a littlewhich suggested to me that some time had elapsed before the horch whipped up this present copy of mebut you could see where it was touchingly someonei was willing to bet it had been pirraghizhad put one of those flower bowls on it however it wasnt alone there was another plot beside it a little less sunken with its own little bowl of pale buds when i asked pirraghiz she looked at me mournfully he was another copy of you dannerman djabeertapritch begged for him when the machines decided it was better to abandon him and make a fresh one they let djabeertapritch have him but he was too far gone for us to make well he died and we buried him next to your friend pirraghiz was about as tactful a nonhuman as id ever met well that doesnt say much considering who the other nonhumans were but she was a good scout she ambled away leaving me to mourn for my dead other self i dont think that is exactly what i was doing though i was thinking about funerals of bureau agents when an agent is buried hes entitled to a military ceremony complete with the rifle volley from the honor guard and the bugler playing taps and all he usually gets it too except when they havent found enough of him to bury i couldnt provide any of that for this other me but taps kept running through my mind there are words to the melody a fact that most people dont seem to know and the last line of the song says all is well safely rest god is nigh i guess a little of grandmother dannermans bible lessons had rubbed off on me after all because i was certainly hoping that was true chapter fourteen as my strength began to come back i got serious about my duties as an agent of the nbi i would need to be in the best possible physical shape if an opportunity to escape ever turned up so i began systematic exercises that worried pirraghiz a little at first because she wasnt sure doing jumpsquats was good for me but she finally stopped objecting and i got more diligent about spying again pirraghiz had the right of it when she said id seen about as much of the compound grounds as there was to see the inside of their twostory longhouses was a different matter there might well be some kinds of technology there that were worth knowing about so i spent some time pondering over them i figured out what some of the domestic appliances were for easily enough the desk was a deskprobably its surface was a mosaic of squares the size of my palm but it had nothing on it except some stacks of my food rations and no drawers to open the bowlshaped object that stood on its rim in the wall turned out to be a kind of tv though i didnt know how to turn it on the stubby purring cylinder on the floor was as i had guessed a kind of air conditioner it had some unfamiliar features it not only wafted warm air into the room when the night grew chilly and cool air in the heat of the day but the scents that came out of it varied with the temperature of the air they smelled meaty and almost sweaty at night and like freshcut greenery during daylight that was interesting but not the kind of thing the bureau would be wild to hear aboutassuming i ever got the chance to see arlington again the real puzzle about all this machinery was where the power came from there werent any wall outlets or cables going to them but they kept on going anyway i found pirraghiz outside and asked her about it she didnt seem to object to my curiosity but she wasnt much help either she seemed preoccupied gazing toward the stream where two other docs were standing i am only biomedical dannerman she explained i know nothing of mechanical things mrrranthoghrow might know and who is mrrmrrran mrrranthoghrow dannerman he is a friend he comes here sometimes and you can ask him if you like for now would you like me to show how the picture bowl works she was still gazing toward the creek yes please i said and then i saw what she and the other docs were looking at i thought at first that it was one of the flat rocks that were used as steppingstones across the water though this one was of an odd greenish color then the rock moved it erected stalked eyes to peer at the nearby docs then it raised itself on short splayed legs and walked away i turned to pirraghiz what the hell was that ah she said understanding you have never met a shelled person before have you and when i asked what a shelled person was doing here among the docs she was amused is that hard to understand dannerman all we species were enslaved one way or another by the others why should we not talk to one another now and then that sounded interesting can i talk with them too not in this case no she has no language you could understand some of the other species do and if one comes here i will tell you now i will show you how to work the picture bowl turning the picture bowl on was easy once you knew how i had been looking for controls on the bowl itself but there werent any they were in the desk you moved a section of the top aside in the right way and it uncovered a sort of clockface tiny holes arranged in a circle with what might have been numbers inscribed over each the numbers were meaningless to me the little holes werent much help at first either pirraghiz showed me how they worked by delicately extruding a claw to poke into them but i didnt have a claw the first thing pirraghiz showed me in the bowl was the planet we were on it appeared like a globe in three dimensions in the bowl and she showed that it could be rotated or zoomed in this is where we are she announced pointing with a lesser arm it looked like a park seen from above i recognized the familiar hexagonal patterns that had been enforced by the beloved leaders energy walls imprisoning each group of us in our own little space now those walls were vanished but lines of abrupt discontinuities in the kinds of vegetation showed where they had stood some of the plants looked to be in bad shape and when i said as much to pirraghiz she said of course dannerman when the shield was down the radiation killed many things and not simply plants there had been nine captive species in the zoo of the beloved leaders some of them had come from worlds with a higher concentration of oxygen than this place and so extra allotments had been routinely pumped into their enclaves when everything broke down the oxygen stopped and one whole speciespirraghiz called them treelivershad gasped and died two others had needed extra humidity for their health which had been supplied in the same way most of those species had survived but they are not comfortable away from their own areas pirraghiz informed me so you will not see them here i stared at the picture of the planet outside of the enclaves everything around was the rustcolored arid rock and sand it was not an attractive planet why do you suppose the horch bothered to take this place over i asked pirraghiz sighed i do not know the horch do not tell us everything simply because the others had it perhaps and why did the beloved leaders have it in the first place i asked covering a yawn perhaps because it is so hostile to living things apart from their preserves there was no place on it for the captive species to escape to she said but she hadnt missed the yawn are you overtired again she asked fretfully and then hold still she pinched a fold of my belly flesh in her surprisingly gentle paws the claws considerately retracted the results made her give a disapproving lipsmack you must gain more body fat dannerman you must eat more im getting pretty tired of corn chips and spaghetti bolognese i complained she said defensively i added water and heated it precisely following the instructions on the container i shrugged she looked thoughtful for a moment then turned off the picture bowl she opened some of the food containers that had come from the starlab store and one by one fished out a tiny crumb from each she tasted them experimentally i see she said at last wait for a moment dannerman she was gone for a lot more than a moment and when she came back all six arms were carrying packets and clumps of strangelooking vegetable things taste this she ordered holding out an object that looked like a small skyblue corncob with the kernels removed i looked at it with skepticism how do i know it wont poison me i demanded she gave me a surprised stare but did you not see me analyzing your food these are quite compatible with your dietary needs also i am right here in case there is any unexpected adverse effect actually it wasnt bad tasting a little like a very mild onion she opened up a pot of thick stuff the consistency of honey and advised me to dip the cob into it it was peppery and rather good becoming adventurous i reached for a fruit she had split open spiky on the outside round and reddish within but she snatched it out of my hands one moment dannerman wait then i saw another way in which those little retractable talons were useful the fruit was full of tiny greenish seeds she quickly coaxed them out with her claws one after another then she handed the fruit to me it was moist and cool and it tasted vaguely of roasted chestnuts pirraghiz looked approving now it is safe dannerman but you must never eat the seeds the other one of you did by accident perhaps he would have lived if he had not now try this handing me a sort of lemoncolored potato it will make you sleepy and so you will rest the new food was an improvement and so was the picture bowl that looked like a spys dream of a bonanza i figured i could roam around the channels and learn everything there was to know about the horch that was borrowing a page from dopeys book it was just what he had done about the earth when he was monitoring all of our broadcasts from starlab that had worked out for dopey it didnt for me i managed to work the controls with a toothpicksized scrap of ceramic pirraghiz found for me i picked channels more or less at random not knowing any other way to do it most of them were incomprehensible to me there were a lot of what i supposed were the entertainments of the horch something like choir singing something like no plays they didnt entertain me there were scenes of what probably were a number of different planets or different parts of the same planet those had voiceover commentaries all right and those might have given me a lot of information if i could have understood them i couldnt they were in the highpitched and totally incomprehensible language of the docs there was certainly data to be got from the bowl i just didnt know how to go about getting it and then while i was scowling at a particularly uninformative viewa pair of horch were silently playing some sort of board gamethe picture bowl beeped at me the gameplayers disappeared and another horch was staring out of the bowl at me hello dan he said and i realized it was my friendor my captoror actually my savior the one named djabeertapritch evidently the picture bowl doubled as some kind of communications device i said guardedly hello beert if he detected anything in my tone he didnt show it he said i am sorry i have not been able to visit you in person dan there is much i am trying to learn from our horch cousins so must spend much time with them also with some projects of my own we will have more time together when you come to our nest it was the first i had heard that he planned to move me again when will that be when you are fully recovered are you feeling better now dan quite a lot i admitted that is good he said sounding as though his mind was elsewhere now there is someone i wish you to meet he added more briskly getting to the point i have a reason for this go outside now pirraghiz is waiting to take you to him goodby that was the end of the conversation beert disappeared and was looking at the horch gameplayers again when i had turned off the picture howl and climbed down the stairs pirraghiz was hurrying toward me it is a wet one dannerman she told me taking my arm to speed me along he has language so you can speak to him come he is in the creek perhaps that should have warned me it didnt we were almost to the stream when i saw that someone was half submerged in the water only it wasnt a someone it was a slategray creature the size of a hippopotamus it had a writhing medusa mustache of tentacles around its mouth and it wore a collar i knew it well i tugged myself free of pirraghizs arm and walked away shaking i couldnt help it pirraghiz came after me put one hand worriedly on my throat bent to peer into my face the great pale face was puzzled you are upset dannerman what is wrong i pointed to the amphibian thats wrong those things murdered a friend of mine her name was patsy and shes the one who is buried next to the other one of me she was bathing she didnt even know there were any of those things in the water but there was a scuffle and they electrocuted her she stood for a moment looking from me to the amphibian so you wont even talk to this wet one i won t djabeertapritch wishes it she wheedled no she sighed this episode was certainly unfortunate she said reasonably but it is an event in the past it is true that the wet ones use an electric charge for defense but only when they feel threatened this one will not attack you dannerman i wont give it the chance she stood there looking down at me you cannot forgive that incident i shook my head forget it never forgive itmaybe later but not now she was silent for a moment then she said sadly then can you forgive me dannerman i stared at her for what she seemed reluctant to speak but she sighed again and went on you know that there were other copies of yourself and your comrades and that they were examined physically i did know i knew what those physical examinations were like too because pat five had gone through them and she told me i felt a flush of remembered rage you mean they were vivisected i said yes that is true she said her tone mournful what is also true is that i was one of the ones who did the vivisection dannerman chapter fifteen was i angry at pirraghiz you bet i was in fact angry wasnt a strong enough word i was seething with rage my nursemaid and pal was one of the torturers who had cut up the helpless bodies of my living screaming friends the first thing i thought of doing was to find the nearest rock and pound her head bloody with it i didnt exactly do that i did pick up a rock but i didnt attack pirraghiz with it i threw it as hard as i could at the nearest tree and then i stalked away leaving her gazing unhappily at my back i didnt look back i kept right on walking right out of the compound along one of the ancient trails that wound through the woods it had rained during the night and the footing was still a little slippery i suspected pirraghiz was trailing after me but i didnt turn around i didnt want to talk to one of the creatures who had carved up my friendsand mebit by bit while they were wideawake and screaming just to see what made them tick as you might do with an unfamiliar machine and with no more regard for the machines feelings what i had gone through with the christmas trees helmet didnt compare to their ordeal it didnt bear thinking about so i did my best not to think about it it didnt matter what mattered was getting out of there and there was only one way to do that the transit machine was obviously still workingthe horch machines had used it to make me my job was to get back to it and away but i couldnt do it without help and the only help around was the person who was silently following along the trail no more than eight or ten meters behind so i turned around and beckoned to pirraghiz im sorry i told her as she approached i overreacted it was a shock to me thats all i understand that you couldnt help yourself she looked at me warily do you understand dannerman she asked i patted her great upper arm i do pirraghiz you had a control implanted in your brain and you had to do whatever the beloved leaders wanted yes but do you understand do you know what it is like to be owned there was an expression on pirraghizs face that i had never seen there before i couldnt tell whether it was sorrow or implacable anger wellmaybe not exactly but you should know dannerman she told me sternly what happened to us may happen to your own people in exactly the same way we were not always slaves of the beloved leaders we had our own lives on our own planetthat was many eights of eights of generations ago and we have only stories to remind us of what it was like but it was a good lifei thinkand then the beloved leaders came and they saw a use for us we were a clever people we still are she paused to give me a challenging look i said of course you are i know that but do you also know what it is like to be clever and to be owned under the beloved leaders we could do almost nothing they did not order us to do most of the time we could not even speak to each other only when we were very young or when we were permitted to breed that surprised me breed i didnt know no dannerman you didnt know i did once bear a litter of three after i was bred to the male perjowlsti but i was allowed to keep them with me only until they were half grown then i watched while another doc implanted them with controllers they were very young and frightened i had to lie to them i said it would do them no harm no harm do you hear me dannerman i told them it would do them no harm and i do not know what became of them since the horch came i have not seen them or perjowlsti perhaps they were killed in the fighting she turned away from me and was silent for a moment i thought she might be weeping if docs ever wept i reached up and touched her shoulder i hadnt forgotten about the vivisection but i couldnt help feeling compassion i said im sorry pirraghiz she said yes her voice muffled when she turned around the great cow eyes were dry and her expression was less angry i too am sorry she said for what will happen to your own species i straightened up my own species she nodded with the great head her hat flopping ludicrously you will serve them too if they wish it something was tasting very bad in the back of my throat i did my best to repress it what would they want us for i do not know dannerman but she thought for a moment then sighed have you ever seen the warriors of the others i remembered a halfdissolved corpse of a bashful id seen in our escape no yes i mean ive seen a dead body butwait a minute are you trying to tell me theyd make bashfuls out of us i do not know what a bashful isi had used the english wordbut to use you to fight their battles for them when there is occasion for fighting yes i think so it is known that your species is good at wars and violence was that not the reason for your own work before you were captured i was aghast no we wont let that happen if were going to fight well fight them of course you will dannerman she agreed somberly as i suppose we did all those years ago even now sometimes you see the control channels are very effective but they are not perfect if one of us finds himself surrounded by a kind of wall of metal meshi do not know the name for it i guessed a faraday cage she shrugged perhaps in such a situation the controls are weakened then we have enough volition sometimes to try to fight back but we do not succeed as soon as that happens the others of our own kind who still belong to the beloved leaders come at once and recapture us or kill us they have no choice just as i had none when the beloved leaders caused me to cut the flesh of your conspecifics she gazed down at me searchingly it is not only persons of your own species that have been vivisected in that way by us you are only the most recent the same has been done to members of every captive speciesthe wet ones the shelled persons the treelivers even the captive horch even to my own people and in every case she broke off looking at me in a different way what is it dannerman she had puzzled me what do you mean captive horch she looked at me with surprise but i thought you knew what did you think djabeertapritch was i blinked at her a horch of course she sounded impatient certainly he is a horch but until the other horch captured this base he was a prisoner too he and all his nest dannerman look you can almost see the farms they cultivated just past these trees they were kept here since their ancestors were captured long ago for study and yes to be experimented on just as your people were that was unexpected news i had thought of the horch simply as horch they were conquerors i had not imagined that beert himself had once been a conquered i stared through the tangled vegetation toward where pirraghiz had said beerts people still lived i couldnt see anything that looked like farms but i knew what i had to do i had to try my best to avert that horrible prospect of a subjugated earth and the place to do it was not here i turned to pirraghiz you said beerts village was out there the nest of the formerly captive horch is yes all right im as well as i need to be and i want to see beert im going there now she did not seem surprised only thoughtful i do not know if he will be at the nest he may have called from the base ill wait for him you do not know the way dannerman you have never been there ill find it it is a long walk i am not sure you are yet strong enough for that i didnt let her finish thats my problem i said but she finished anyway so i will carry you there myself and she did hoisted me up into the crook of one of her great arms and trotted away part four the nest chapter sixteen dopey had always preferred being carried by a doc to walking i could see why pirraghiz held me comfortable and secure and the ride despite those elephant legs of hers was rapid and just about joltfree as we left the beaten path to cross over into horch territory she had to push her way through wet brush considerately she pushed the soggy branches away from me with one or another of her spare arms then as we passed that invisible dividing line where weedy trees gave way to shrubs we were in horchland the difference between the two compounds was the difference between wilderness and civilization behind us was jungle ahead neatly cultivated cropland we came out onto a dirt road that bordered a couple of hectares of green stalks of grain shoulderhighi dont mean pirraghizs shoulder of course between the rows two snaky heads popped up to stare at us in astonishment pirraghiz paid them no attention but turned left on the road and loped along although the road was dirt it was smooth and almost rutless even after the rain obviously the horch were careful about keeping their place tidy a kilometer or two ahead i could see something that looked like a huge sixsided barn but before we got there i heard a whirring noise from behind us pirraghiz didnt bother to look behind she just moved courteously over to one side allowing a vehicle to shoot past us it was a threewheeled cart a little like the one beert had used when he rescued me from the interrogation chambers that one had had a motor though this one was pedaldriven by its occupantone of the horch who had gawked at us from the cropland i supposed he lay flat on his back feet pumping at the pedals as fast as he could while his neck swayed back and forth between staring at us and watching the road ahead as we got closer to the barnlike structure i could see that it was a kind of wickerwork tenement four or five stories tall with porches jutting out at every level some of the porches were enclosed in coarse screens others open to the sky i could see figures on some of them perhaps taking the air the whole thing looked like something some tribe of aborigines might have built for themselves out of willow withes and bamboo in the days before the european colonizers came along with their whiskey guns row houses and syphilis it was the biggest structure in sight but it wasnt the only one i began to see sheds nearby and a couple of peculiar trees all circled by little clusters of flowering bushes for decoration the trees were branchless until near the top where they spread out in a crown like royal palms the most peculiar thing about the trees was that they were all bent at a sharp angle from the ground up and all at the same angle there was something that looked like a wicker band shellpeople were moving around it and as we moved toward one side behind the main building a smaller structure appeared of a wholly other kind this one wasnt wicker it was made of the same glossy ceramic stuff as my former cell though this was pinkish in color a pair of the horch christmas trees were industriously unloading some sort of equipment to take inside it i wasnt pleased to see them there but pirraghiz paid them no attention she set me down carefully wait dannerman i will see if djabeertapritch is here she left me standing in a plot of damp spiky grass i suppose the horch equivalent of a front lawn there were low wicker benches scattered aroundunoccupied and a few smaller trees with buttercupyellow blossoms although the robots werent paying any attention to me i was uncomfortable in their presence i walked a little way around the great house to get out of their sight when i looked up the wovensapling side of the building i discovered that someone was looking back at me three or four of those snaky heads were peering over the side of one of the porches i waved but the only response i got from them was to pull hastily back some completely out of sight one still staring at me with just the nose and eyes showing as long as i was here i told myself i should be keeping my eyes open for the kind of information the bureau would want to hear when i got back the trouble was there didnt seem to be very much sensitive information lying around so i made do with what was available to start i heard shrill soprano singing coming from nearby it was that bandshell thing and it seemed to be functioning as a kind of horch kindergarten eight or ten tiny horch infants danced around as they sang waving their sinuous arms and necks more or less gracefully the two littlest ones werent dancing they lay on their backs in tiny wicker baskets looking like some kind of musical calamari as they waved their limbs and piped along with the others there was one adult with them to conduct the performance by the swellings under her jumpsuit i judged she was female she moved quickly to interpose herself between me and her charges thrusting her head toward me suspiciously what are you she demanded that wasnt an easy question to answer before i had figured out how to describe myself she gave the necktwist that was like a human nod yes now i remember you are djabeertapritchs new pet i didnt respond to that i was digesting the implications of that word pet and anyway she was still talking please go away you are distracting the children and they must prepare to sing for the greatmother her tone was commanding and she gestured accordingly she was right all the children had stopped what they were doing to goggle at me i apologized im sorry if i interrupted you im just waiting for beertfor djabeertapritch i mean you should not wait here she said crossly i might have argued but then i saw two horch ambling around the perimeter of the building toward us they seemed in no hurry they werent looking in our direction at all they were in animated conversation with each other their necks winding close together except when they paused to examine some detail of the buildings structure there was something about them that was different it took me a moment to figure it out and then i had it it was the way they were dressed all horch seemed to like to ornament their round little bellies but not all in the same way beert as well as this teacherhorch and the little ones in her class sported a circle of colorfully embroidered fabric there these two were dressed like the female i had seen with beert in the interrogation room their belly bowls were shallow domes of bright metal as shiny as chrome i didnt have good feelings about the metalwearing brand of horch the strollers didnt seem to have noticed me and i preferred to keep it that way i nodded politely to the teacher and left as inconspicuously as i could when pirraghiz found me i was in the middle of a sort of car park of those threewheeled velocipedes they were ingeniously put together out of four or five different kinds of wood wheels bearings and all there you are you should have stayed where i left you she scolded now come the greatmother has summoned beert i will take you to a room that is available where you can wait for him and i will go back home to get food for you and to pick up some of my own things so that i can stay with you here the wicker building was wicker all the way through wicker walls wicker floors wicker stairsand a lot of themto take us to the upper levels i marveled at the kind of engineering skills it had taken to create a fivestory building out of withes woven together they must be pretty good designers i offered to pirraghiz breathing hard she looked down at me with concern of course they are horch but are you all right should i carry you again i shook my head i wasnt willing to let her know how quickly i tired not to mention that the steps sagged and protested pirraghizs weight with soft squeaking sounds i didnt think it was a good idea to add my weight to hers the stairs we were climbing circled an interior courtyard like the atrium in a fivestory roman villaif any roman villa ever got five stories high balconies ran all around the inside of the structure at every level and a few horch paused in whatever they were doing on them to peer at us we went up three flights and i was panting in earnest by the time pirraghiz reached the right level she took me to a doorrather like a thick woven curtain and flung it open this is where you will stay she announced the room wasnt anything like the sterile chambers where the horch machines had questioned me it wasnt like any place i had ever been in before i said politely it looks fine im glad they had a spare room for me they have very many spare rooms she said somberly there are very few of this greatmothers nest left will you be all right if i leave you alone for a while it will only be for a little bit then djabeertapritch will be here there is a place to sleep perhaps you should do that it will not be long until he arrives i think she said again to reassure me you will be quite safe if you need anything you can call and someone will come but do not eat anything until i return with proper food for you it had been a long time since anyone had fussed over me in that way i couldnt help laughing thank you mother i said you can go honestly go she went but actually i had barely begun to investigate my new room when i felt the wicker floor vibrate again with her heavy tread when i turned to the door there she was again carrying a large pottery bowl this is in case you need to relieve yourself while i am away dannerman she said now i will leave again and she did the room the horch had given me was a good size maybe three meters by four the walls were unadorned except that on the interior ones the wickerwork had been woven together in strands of several varieties of withes of different colors the result was rather pretty almost like an abstract tapestry the outside walls were made of darker more robust basketwork and something like clay had been plastered into the wicker to seal the walls against the weather outside the door to the balcony outside was made of accordion folds of the same material and they were ajar when i stepped out to look around i had a view of farm fields beyond the outbuildings and the curiously bent trees a stream cut through themthe same stream that went through the old compound i supposed there were little rainbowshaped japanesegarden bridges over the stream here and there oddly not all the fields appeared to be under cultivation some seemed to have been farmed once but now bore only a scraggle of weeds that was all i saw from the balcony because i didnt stay there long adult horch weighed about as much as i did and i suppose the builders had allowed some margin of safety but it sagged disturbingly under my weight so i stepped back inside as i did i noticed something i hadnt seen before both the doorframe and the outer edges of the accordion doors were thick with some kind of pale purplish mildew it was the kind of thing any earthly housekeeper would scrub away as soon as detected were the horch as sloppy as that i didnt think so the stuff seemed to be there for a purpose there were heavy cloth drapes attached to the lintel and doors they were rolled back but it looked as though they could be pulled out to cover the moldy purple stuff i put that aside for later thought inside the room were the chamber pot and the bed their purposes were unmistakable i used them in turn thankfully this bed was a lot softer than pirraghizs it was basically a sort of round mattress on the floor maybe a hundred and fifty centimeters acrossjust about long enough for me to stretch out the mattress was covered with something that felt like flannel and stuffed with little round lumps like bolls of cotton when i sprawled out on it i meant only to rest and think about what i was going to say to beert when he arrived but i think i dozed off what roused me was a sound from outside it was an airplane when i got to the balcony to look out it was just landing in one of those untended fields coming down slow and nearly vertically like one of the bureaus vtols it rolled only a few meters and as soon as it stopped a horch got out met by a couple of others who had been standing by was the one who had just arrived beert i couldnt tell but he was wearing the cloth belly patch while the abdomens of the two who were meeting him glittered metallically in the sunlight the three of them were having an animated conversation snaky arms and necks swirling around i couldnt hear of course but i wished i could some of the flailing arms were pointing toward the buildingin fact to the balcony i was standing on i hastily stepped back more or less out of sight but it was too late to matter the three had finished their conversation one of the shinybellied ones climbed into the plane still yammering at the other and the one who had just arrived entered the building chapter seventeen the newcomer was beert all right when i went to the door of my room and peered down the circular stairway i saw him coming up the ropy neck pointed straight at me he called i did not think you would come here without authorization dan he sounded aggrieved i didnt want him angry at me but i stood my ground i said im well now beert i didnt see any reason to wait he came up and stood beside me his pointy little face only centimeters from my own you do not know all the reasons for what i do dan he said glumly and waved me into the room he closed the door behind us and sat on the edge of the bed regarding me the greatmother did not expect you yet he sighed i will have to apologize to her greatmother that was the second or third time id heard her mentioned and she sounded important im sorry if i got you in trouble i apologized he waved the apology away with both sinuous arms i am not in trouble dan but it is not appropriate for things to happen in the nest that the greatmother doesnt know about where is pirraghiz she went back to get some stuff it isnt her fault beert it was all my idea yes i had supposed so he said moodily it has been observed that your species is often unruly he thought for a moment long neck swaying and then said you see dan i am engaged in a number of discussions with the cousins i had to leave them to come here and i cannot stay very long perhaps we can spend a little time together but first i must speak with the greatmother about your presence here can you remain in this chamber while i make arrangements for you sure i can but id rather he was waving both arms and the neck at me again please dan do not be still unruly it will not take me long stay here when he came back he looked less fussed the greatmother extends you the courtesy of the nest he told me sounding pleased about it when she has time she wishes to meet you in person but when that may be i cannot say do you need to eat actually i had been beginning to think of food but i shook my head pirraghiz doesnt want me eating anything until she comes back to check it out yes thats wise very well im afraid everyone is quite busy since we are so shorthanded now but i think i have something that will occupy you until pirraghiz shows up come first i will show you the parts of the nest he did too from where we stood on the landing he showed me the door to something he called the repository of the nesta sort of library i gathered we looked in on the childrens dormitory where a dozen or so little ones were taking their naps the same ones i had seen at the band shell i thought because the female who was standing guard over them was familiar beert told me her name he told me the names of all the five or six horch we met along the way but i didnt retain any of them they all greeted beert with friendly respect sometimes intertwining necks even the teacherguard they seemed to be an affectionate bunch when we were on the ground floor beert paused at the entrance he slapped the accordion door with one arm and said like any suburbanite with a new splitranch what do you think of our nest then dan when i told him as politely as i could that it was very nice but it struck me that wicker was a peculiar choice of materials for building a multistory habitat he said in surprise but we could work only with what we had dan the others gave us nothing the others the ones you call the beloved leaders when they dumped our ancestors here we had no tools no machines only our bare arms and teeth do you not think we did well every section of the nest reinforces every other it has stood for many generations like this and will for generations more unless theres a fire i said that amused him but there is no fire in the nest ever he said and led me to the shed that was used for cooking and eating this one was made of clay bricks like adobeand as likely to wash away in the first rain i thought but he showed me how the clay was covered with some sort of vegetable sap to protect it from the weather a meal was being prepared though the smells were unfamiliar they were definitely food and i was beginning to wish that pirraghiz would get back the two horch doing the cooking were friendly but busier than any two persons needed to be chopping up vegetables grinding tubers in a mortar tending their cooking fires when i asked beert if everyone always worked so hard around here the question seemed to disturb him not always he said moodily then he sighed we do not have enough people for all the work he admitted the farms to be tended the children to be cared for the nest to be kept in repair before we were he hesitated over the next words before we were set free it was different then there were enough of us to do all that needed to be done and to have time enough to rest and to study and to do all the other things we enjoy but now many of us have left the nest to go where his head darted around uneasily when the cousin horch freed us they offered to take us out of here many nestsiblings went to the planets of the cousins they wanted to see what a life of leisure was like with machines to tend to all the drudgery this was natural enough dan they had every right to do so and the greatmother did not object but you didnt go it is my nest he said simply and then glanced at the shadow cast by one of those bentover trees but look at the time i must hurry the penny dropped of course the trees had been coaxed to grow in that direction so that they could function as gnomons in vast sundials the eight bushes planted around them marking the horch equivalent of the hours of the day i was so struck by the ingenuity of the system that i hardly heard the rest of what beert said which was i have something to give you before i leave he wrapped one of those arms around my shouldersit was warmer than i had expectedand led me to the pink structure the two christmas trees i had seen before were standing immobile not far away but beert ignored them he seemed in good spirits if rushed this is my personal laboratory he said with pride i looked at it and at him does that mean youre some kind of a scientist scientist no dan i am a student all i hope to learn is what the cousins already know and this is where i try to learn it the thing i wish to give you is in the laboratory but there are delicate machines here it is better if you dont come inside until you know enough about them to take care wait just a moment he unlocked the doorat least i guess that was what he did he pressed both arms against the door in a complicated sinewavey pattern something like an identification signature i suppose anyway the door opened lights sprang up inside and he went in i peered after him beert had been right about the machines the place was full of them in all stages of completion it looked like the way he had been learning his cousins science was by taking some of their gadgets apart and rebuilding them more important it also looked like this was the place i had been looking for if there were secrets of horch technology for me to steal and take back to the bureau there was a whole treasure trove of them right here and he had implied that sooner or later i would be allowed to examine them more closely it was the most hopeful thing that had happened to me since beert rescued me from the torturers the only sour note was those two horch robots most of their twigs were retracted but i knew they could spring into action at any moment when beert came back carrying something in a wicker basket he saw me watching them uneasily do not worry about the robots dan he reassured me you are here with the permission of the cousins and there will be no problem the cousins have been very kind this laboratory could not have been built without their help now let us go back to your chamber chapter eighteen i never learned beerts age but there was something boyish about him all the way up the steps he was hissing softly to himself it was almost a chuckleand darting his head almost teasingly toward mine but he didnt speak until we were in my room and the door was closed i was feeling pretty cheerful myself partly contagion from beert partly the thought of all those horch secrets waiting for me in his lab then he lifted the lid of the wicker basket this is something you may use while pirraghiz and i are gone he said happily he took something out of the basket i recognized it at once and suddenly was not happy at all it was one of those beloved leader helmets i jumped back snarling no that blew beerts own cheerful mood he darted his head at me incredulously you do not wish this oh wait perhaps i understand are you thinking of the way the interrogation machines used this device no i am not giving you this for that purpose i do not intend to cause you pain indeed you can operate it for yourself see here are the selectors he flipped up the little tab on the side of the helmet exposing its nest of colored grooves as though he were revealing a great secret it wasnt news to me though ive seen this already i told him rosaleen artzybachova was tinkering with one like it while we were captives that surprised him did she so i was not aware of this was she able to operate the helmet satisfactorily well no not very he wagged his long neck at me indeed i think she would have had great trouble doing so the selectors are designed for tinier digits than yoursthe talons of your dopey or of one of pirraghizs people let me see if i can find some implement you can use while he was scrabbling in the basket i took the little ceramic toothpick pirraghiz had given me out of my pocket like this you mean he swooped his head down almost to touch it then peered up at me you astonish me sometimes dan yes that will do he took the little splinter out of my hand with the end of one armit split like an elephants trunk to pick it up securely i said isnt this a beloved leader device no longer he said absently tweaking the colored lines it is now ours he had pressed the helmet against his belly and seemed to be staring at nothing then sounding satisfied he said yes here it is see dan holding up the helmet for me to look at i have accessed some of their records for you you can change from one to another if you wish but activate only the green selector otherwise you will be in other files and it will be difficult for you to return to the ones of interest do you remember how to put the helmet on i did i held the thing warily unable to forget what it had done to me with the christmas trees but was beert likely to be playing unpleasant tricks i hoped not i swallowed i pulled it over my head snapped the eyeshades in place and just as before i was instantly in another place i was on a familiar street in new york city vendors lined the sidewalk i had stopped at one of the stalls i was picking up bits and pieces of the kitschy merchandise this one had to offer and i felt strange i felt female my body was not the one i had been born with it was tightly bound at the breasts and when i saw my hands the nails were bright orange and one finger bore a ring like a dragon with wings outspread female hands all right certainly not my own ishe seemed to be interested in an oldfashioned wristwatch with the hands of mickey mouse pointing out the time but when the vendor spoke to her she put it back and turned away as always with the helmet i was there i saw everything this body looked at i felt everything she touched i smelled a faint wisp of roasting lamb from a pita joint on the corner and heard the scream of sirens from somewhere nearbyfire ambulance police car i could not tell which and the body i was occupying was not interested enough to look i pulled the helmet off my head confused what am i looking at i demanded keep looking beert advised you will see someone you know well so the other dan said these events are not happening now he added these are recordings of transmissions which were received some time ago see it for yourself hesitantly i put the helmet back on the body i was wearing glanced at her own watch and now hurrying crossed the street and turned a corner i recognized the entranceway it belonged to the midtown office building that held the dannerman astrophysical observatory my grandfathers legacy to immortalize his name where i had once gone to work for my cousin pat the body announced herselfthe name meant nothing to meto the floor guardnew since my timeand while she waited for him to call her escort she was covertly eyeing the man i realized that i was looking at a man through the eyes of a woman and it was instructive to see where her eyes went face shoulders with special attention to the region of the crotch both front and back then some other man i didnt recognize came down passed her through the turnstiles into the elevator up into pats waiting room and there i saw people i knew quite well as i entered the room pats receptionist janice dupage got up from her desk and greeted me with a quick hug sorry im late iiapologized and janice said thats all right just let me sign out and then we can go out of the corner of my eye i caught a glimpse of pete schneyman just glancing at us as he passed through the reception room and while janice was picking up her purse and checking her makeup the elevator door opened again the person who came out was someone i knew very well indeed it was dr patrice adcock my cousin my pat the pat i loved the pat i had lost my hostesss eyes were studying her too in her own way while janice said you remember my friend from the cruise the one i didnt take there was an edge to her voice as of some remembered grievance but pat only said of course she shook hands shook her hand i was actually touching the warm firm hand of the woman i loved and then she turned away and went into her own office and i tore the helmet off my head what is this i demanded whose body was i in was it patrice it was not any one of your party beert said heavily his neck hanging low other humans were implanted with the transmitters i scowled at him how could that be then a particularly nasty thought crossed my mind and i said unless beerts little snake head swung toward mine looking into my eyes yes dan he said the others have reached your planet now chapter nineteen i dont know when beert left my room i was under the helmet obsessively eavesdropping on the many many unwittingor sometimes wittinghuman beings who were wearing the bugs implanted by the others i knew of only six persons who had been bugged and returned to earth the five of us in the original batch from starlab plus patrice from the ones who had been in captivity now there seemed to be hundreds of them so there was no question about it i had to believe that what beert said was true the others were on earthsomehowand going right ahead with their plans and if i were ever to hope to get back andsomehowhelp fight them off it had to be done quickly all the same i couldnt help peering out at my planet through the eyes of the bugged ones they came in all varieties there was a young woman in what i supposed was china wearing the tracking collar of a housearrest prisoner sullenly trampling seedlings into mud with her bare toes and seeing nothing but the other young women in the paddy and the old man who was dumping more baskets of seedlings at its rim there was a store clerk in some hot and spanishspeaking place a blackjack dealer on what seemed to be a cruise ship from the gentle rolling of the floor a dozen or so in prisons a lot of the bugged ones were in prisons and a lot of those i took to be chinese from the uniforms they wore and the totally incomprehensible language they spoke i didnt spend much time with the ones who spoke languages i couldnt understand there were a fair number of englishspeaking ones and a sizeable number of those were also in some kind of detention some like that first chinese girl wore tracking collars as they went glumly about their business most were in a cell some were being interrogated and the questioners were getting little joy from the answers they got uniformly the bugged ones claimed to have no knowledge of how the little gadgets had been implanted in their skulls once just once i saw a face i recognized the face belonged to nat baumgartner an nbi agent i had worked with once on the michigan militia what nat was doing was standing in a hospital operating room looking more worried than any bureau agent should let himself look in the presence of a prisoner i was his prisoner i lay on my back staring up at the operatingtheater lights while someone i couldnt see was doing something with an iv in my arm i supposed my host was about to undergo surgery most likely to remove the bug from his brain but i never found out for sure shortly after that my carrier went unconscious and that transmission stopped for good and all the time that i was looking through the eyes of other people one part of my mind was scheming what to do about this situation make pirraghiz take me to the transit machine and go no first take a quick snatchandgrab run through beerts laboratory and collect all the horch technology i could carry to take back no before that pump him for what he might know about the horch plans for earth if any and for any guidance he can give about what to do to resist the beloved leaders no no there were too many things to think out and i couldnt think clearly about them while i was hunting frantically through the files of all those bugged humans but i couldnt stop doing it either the person i was really looking for was pat i was convinced there had to be other files in which she would appear i picked frantically at the green line in the selectors but i couldnt find them apart from that one glimpse in the observatory office she never turned up for me again by dumb luck i did finally connect again with the woman who had gone to the observatory to meet janice dupage and watched it all over again for the sake of that one brief glimpse of pat that brief glimpse was all there was when i watched the fileill the way through all that happened was that the woman went to lunch with janice dupage the good part was that i could taste the caesar salad the woman ordered but there was nothing else what they talked about was the cruise janet had missed and how it had come to an end when something went wrong with the ships engines and after they had left the restaurant and were crossing a street abruptly and strangely the transmission ended i mean it just stopped at one moment i was laughing and clutching janices arm as we dodged past a stopped truck i heard janice scream and that was it the next moment i was in total darkness with no sight or sound or smell at all i took the helmet off to puzzle over that for a bit something like that had happened before when the man in the operating room went to sleep that was anesthesia i had no doubt but what kind of person went to sleep in the middle of crossing a new york street i had the helmet back on when i felt touch on my shouldermy real shoulder when i took the helmet off it was pirraghiz she wasnt alone standing next to her was a male doc reaching out one of his arms in hospitable fashion to shake my hand this is my friend mrrranthoghrow she told meas close as i can come to his name which sounded like a voiceless purr a coughing sneeze and a yowl at the end he came along to help me carry what i needed for you but he cannot stay this time i hope to see more of you soon mrrranthoghrow said politely i mumbled something back my mind was still full of what i had seen under the helmet i hardly noticed when he left again pirraghiz was looking at me curiously are you all right dannerman she asked are you hungry once reminded i was in fact i was ravenous i dont know how long i had been under the helmet but while i was devouring the food pirraghiz set before me i discovered it was dark outside my window not inside the room though the whole chamber was illuminated with a soft glow which i saw came from the mossy stuff around the doorframe i paid it only minimal attention still thinkingworrying about what the others might be doing to my world pirraghiz watched in silence it wasnt until i had swallowed the last of the berryflavored tomatoish thing that was my dessert that she removed the dishes and said it is sleeping time i will show you how to cover the light dannerman simply pull these drapes out so and cover the light like this do you see she left one little section uncovered leaving the room dim but there was enough light for me to see that she was regarding me with concern i will be in the next room if needed she said the greatmother has given it to me for as long as you want me here i grunted then she reached down and touched the helmet i had left on the table did djabeertapritch give you this so you could see what is happening in your home oh yes i said sitting on the edge of the bed he certainly did she sighed it is a sad thing i know all of you from your planet found it most unpleasant that got my attention you mean the copies you made of me yes often copies of yourself dannerman but also of the others some copies of all of you were shown this material at the beginning of their interrogations copies of pat of course but it was you who were most useful since you had a broader experience of the world she paused looking down at me in the dimness this upsets you but information was wanted and so what happened was inevitable inevitable making a copy of pat and killing her was inevitable she looked defensive i am sorry i know this troubles you the fact that so many bad things are happening to your people troubles me too she stopped to consider for a moment then sighed but honestly dannerman it does not trouble me very much you are not alone how many sixtyfours of sixtyfours of sixtyfours of sixtyfours of persons have been sent early to the eschaton in this struggle and many of them died far more painfully than your rosaleens and pats here in this nest we have made ourselves look away from such horrors dannerman we could not survive otherwise chapter twenty those scenes in the helmet had put the fear of god into me well fear of the others anyway they were definitely taking over my planet every last person i cared abouteven pat even my other selfwas threatened with becoming a zombie servant of the others just like the docs it was about the worst news i had ever had to face i didnt see how i would be able to sleep with that haunting me i was wrong about that though i dropped off as soon as pirraghiz left the room and i didnt even dream maybe that was my own way of turning away like pirraghiz from what was too hard to face it didnt last the minute i woke up there it was i didnt have any choice i had to face it i stumbled across the dimly lit room to the balcony my mind full of what i had seen when i threw the accordion slides open it was bright daylight outside and three or four horch were getting into their tricycles to go to work in the fields i stared at them without seeing them thinking hard what i wanted to do more than anything else was to escape from this place back to earth to face whatever was still happening there what i had to do first though was something different one additional warm body wouldnt be much help to the human race to be of any use at all i had to bring something useful back with me whats more i had to do it now always assuming that was to say that what i had seen was what was still happening and not ancient history when pirraghiz heard me moving around she came in bringing food as soon as she was in the room she glanced at the drapes shook that big head reprovingly and began to fuss with them without waiting to hear anything i might have to say she scolded you mustnt cover the lights during the day dannerman they have to charge up with sunlight so that you can use them after dark i wasnt in a mood to be instructed about housekeeping i said to her back how long have i been here she left off fussing with the drapes and turned around peering at me what i want to know i insisted those scenes in the helmet they come from all different timessome winter some not i cant tell anything from them and i need to know how much time has passed do you mean since the horch liberated this planet let me see she stroked the mossy beard on her chin counting to herself about four sixtyfours of days i think a little more i did the arithmetic in my head allowing for the fact that this planets days were shorter than earths it came out to about six months a long time and a lot could have happened but it wasnt ancient history all right i said now i want to know everything there is to know about the horch and the belovi mean the others lets get started pirraghiz was obliging but she was puzzled too and she had a lot of questions what exactly was it that i wanted to know when all my answers kept adding up to that same single wordeverythingshe sighed i must have advice on this she told me wait for me eat i will be back very soon she was too i was sipping from a ceramic bowl the last of something that tasted salty and faintly sour when she appeared at the door she looked pleased much of what you want to learn may be in the repository of the nest she announced the greatmother has given permission to take you thereas soon she said tidily beginning to pick up die dishes from my breakfast as i put these in my room i didnt want to wait for that or for anything but pirraghiz was firm her room was about the same size as minepretty small for a docand she had fitted it with enough belongings to make me think she planned to stay for a while among the tiny potted flowers and the bricabrac i saw one of those great cubical cookers dopey had used i thought of how much heat those things could produce and wondered if beert knew she had it in his firefree nest pirraghiz caught my stare and asked is something wrong i didnt want to get into a discussion so i lied i was wondering why the horch have so many empty rooms like this i said why she said closing the door and leading me down the steps the reason is simple when the horch liberated this planet all of the captive horch who wished it were returned home well taken to horch planets anyway it has been so long since they were brought here that none of them really has a home anywhere else anymore that much i knew more or less but i kept her talking but not djabeertapritch and these others she gave me one of those massive armsandshoulders shrugs the ones who stayed in this nest do not always agree with all the things about the cousin horch that got my interest if beert and the cousins disagreed there might be a place to drive a useful wedge between them what kind of things but pirraghiz was not willing to be drawn out on that you must ask djabeertapritch himself she said now here is the repository of the nest the repository of the nest was a library and it looked like one it was a suite of three or four rooms all lined with ceilinghigh shelves in two rooms an assortment of wooden boxes were shelved most of them looking ancient and worn in the third some of the wooden boxes had been replaced with bright yellow cubes made of the horch ceramic in that room a young horch female was working at a high table a spread of documents in front of her she gave us an unwelcoming glance but pirraghiz paid no attention pirraghiz knew what she was looking for she went at once to a great doublefronted chest of drawers that sat in the middle of the room and began pulling out an assortment of those silvery spools i had seen in her own room back in the compound as she picked each one out she scanned the legend on its label before putting it back frowning i took one of the rejects from her hand to look it over she didnt resist she only whispered be careful with it but it wasnt helpful its label bore a string of curlicues and jagged linesidentifying its contents i supposed but the writing meant nothing to me the gadget behind my ear had its limitations the horch had given me their spoken language but hadnt bothered to make me literate i wasnt one of the bureaus language wonks outside of english the only one i knew well was german but being unable to read any language i could speak at all was new to me and depressing i left pirraghiz and wandered over to where the young female was at work she had one of the antique wooden boxes open carefully transferring its contents to a ceramic one on the floor next to her was a kind of balloon almost a meter across with its valve gently hissing she elevated her head warningly as i came close do not breathe moisture on the records she ordered these are very old and very delicate i moved back a step turning my head sharply away from her as though about to be inspected for a hernia mollified she explained what she was doing the documents were the total records of the captive horch colony from their earliest beginnings her job was to transfer them from their original containers to the new ones given by the horch cousins when she finished the box she would seal it and then purge the air out of it with an inert gas from the balloon at her feet she was obviously proud of the responsibility the greatmother had given her she even pulled a few sheets out of their boxes for me to see the earliest ones were very old scratched on tough leaves later the sheets were paper somehow or other made by the colonists but when the librarian read me a few lines there was nothing there worth trying to remember after their capture the colonists had had a tough time and their hardships were what they wrote about interesting even touching but useless and so it seemed were the book spools pirraghiz was sorting through i am sorry dannerman she told me i do not think there is much here that will tell you what you want to know these are gifts of the cousins to this nest and they are all music and drama and such things nothing about the others or technology no dannerman djabeertapritch may have some of that sort but they are not in the repository of the nest she hesitated there is one story which is very old and famous it is about horch who lived long ago if you would like to see it yes very well but let us do it in my room so we will not disturb this female in her work so i viewed the thing all the way through it lasted for a couple of hours in the first ten minutes i realized there was nothing useful here but i stayed with it anywayremember i got my doctorate in drama and in spite of everything i was hooked the story took place in a horch city time not specified and the plot was easy enough to follow it was a kind of a love story a female horch and a male horch wanted to mate but since they were from the same gens though not blood relatives they couldnt the various threads of the plot struck me as pretty universal it was romeo and juliet combined with oedipus rex and a few snatches of arthur millers a view from the bridge the male was a space pilot the female some kind of a farmer that didnt mean she dug seedlings into the mud with her toes none of these horch however ancient in time had to do much purely physical work for that sort of thing they had machines those were pretty primitive compared to the latest christmastree models but they were good enough to free the horch for more intellectual pursuits some of the characters in the play were artists some philosophers some teachers some as far as i could tell engineers i cant say i followed every detail of the story there were a lot of references that went right past me but there are plenty of those in shakespeare too the basic story was clear enough except that i kept thinking what a pity it was that i hadnt had this experience while i was in graduate school what a hell of a doctoral dissertation i could have writtenmaybe even one that somebody might actually have wanted to read pirraghiz had gone about her own business while i was watching the bowl she timed her return perfectly coming back in just as the story finished and she wasnt alone the male named mrrranthoghrow was with her after the two of them had greeted me she looked at me apologetically was any of that what you wanted to know i came alive not exactly i was more interested in your field technology weapons that sort of thing not weapons he protested i have no experience with weapons that is what the warriors and the horch fighting machines are for all right then i pointed to the viewing bowl what makes that thing run he scratched his beard do you mean where the power comes from there is a small unit in the base which provides that it is called a i heard the word he said but it meant nothing to me something like a battery i guessed i used the english word because i didnt have one in horch but when i explained a device in which power from another source is stored and released as needed he shook his great head i have never seen the charged up dannerman i know nothing of such matters i am a mechanic trained in that alone the power in each machine comes from he searched for a term i might understand and came up with an accumulator but what it accumulates and what it accumulates it from i do not know perhaps djabeertapritch can tell you if he wants to but the others had no reason to instruct me in such matters when i disassembled and rebuilt the transit machine for the horch i knew what components needed to be connected in certain fashions but i do not understand how it works suddenly there was a rush of hot blood to my brain i stared at him you worked on the transit machine with others yes and it is in working order certainly the cousin horch use it all the timefor making copies such as yourself and also for tracing channels to other installations of the others i swallowed my throat tight strictly as a theoretical question i saidi didnt want to scare him off too soonwould it be possible for me to use that machine to say transmit me back to my planet he looked startled and so did pirraghiz oh dannerman she said sorrowfully understanding at once what i was getting at so did mrrranthoghrow his voice was sympathetic as he said i am sorry dannerman it is impossible i wasnt giving up although my pulse was racing why impossible the horch wouldnt have to know you could just smuggle me in he was shaking that great moonfaced head i could not do that without their consent dannerman he said gently but that is not the reason it simply cannot be done nothing can be transmitted to any locus unless there is a receiver there and die receiver in your starlab has been destroyed part five marooned chapter twentyone there was another little period of time there that id just as soon forget the next days passed but they took a long time doing it pirraghiz clucked over me and tried to cheer me up she proposed entertainments promised that beert would soon come back with good news produced tasty new mealsshe did everything she could to cheer me but i didnt cheer i was trying to adjust to the fact that i was marooned in this place for the rest of my life while my world was going to hell and there was nothing i could do about it i think i was a big frustration to pirraghiz she deserved better she was my maid valet cook and washerwoman and alldaylong companion life with her around was like living in a fivestar luxury hotel with my personal jeeves to care for all my needs if she had a life of her own she didnt let it interfere with her total attendance on me she washed and mended my ragged clothes she tended my chamber pot whisking it away to be sterilized and cleaned before i had to use it again she fed me about as well as i had ever been fed in my lifefound new ways to improve the preserved swill from starlab and added to it actual fresh vegetables salads soups little cakes dripping with something like fruitflavored honey there was even milk it didnt come from an actual cow of course because there werent any of those within many lightyears but it was a sweetish butterscotchcolored fluid that came pirraghiz said from the females of one of the other captive species that startled me dont they object when you take their milk away from them she wagged her great head reprovingly dont be foolish dannerman it is not taken it is bartered they give us things we do not have and we give them things of ours in return these females are well repaid for what they have in plenty to spare i looked again at what was in my cup but it still tasted good and while i was checking it out pirraghiz saw an opportunity i am glad that you are taking an interest in this dannerman would you like to know more about the other captive species i considered that for a moment then shrugged why not i said meaning since i was going to be stuck here for the rest of my life why not find out what that life was going to be like pirraghiz beamed that is good dannerman i thought you might feel so and so i have prepared something for you wait one moment she disappeared into her own room and when she came back she was carrying the familiar helmet it wasnt what i had expected i protested ive already seen all i need to see of whats happening back home oh dannerman she sighed do you think it was only your people who were bugged that is not so sentient beings of many many different species have worn the transmitters species you have never seen of kinds you cannot imagine including some of those who shared captivity with you i could not find all of those in the records she said apologetically but i have selected a single individual from eight different species some of the species are here some are not later on i can add others if you wish she waited for me to make up my mind i hefted the helmet for a moment indecisively curiosity won gingerly i put it on and pulled down the flaps i heard pirraghizs voice giving lastminute instructionssimply say next when you want to go to another subject dannerman and i will make the change for you and then the helmet took over i was no longer myself i wasnt in my chamber in the horch nest i was surrounded by total blackness there was nothing to be seen smelled or felt except that there before me not two meters away was an image of a creature that looked like a frog with the mouth of an alligator its skin was as fuzzy as a peach and more or less the same color on one bony arm it wore a thing like a wristwatch but that was glowing with a pale blue light and there were three golden bracelets on the other it was dressed in tunic and leggings of a shimmery silky material it had four large ears on each side of its elongated head and a cluster of bright pink feathers topping it offprobably a hat or a decoration i thought since the feathers didnt seem to be growing out of the creatures skull it wasnt moving at all i figured that out easily enough what i was looking at was just a picture showing me what the first species pirraghiz had selected for my viewing pleasure looked like and in a moment the blackness winked away now i wasnt looking at the creature anymore now i was that creature what i was looking atand smelling and hearing and feelingwas a warm sunny seaside gentle ocean waves were breaking on a pebbly beach where two or three ungainlylooking catamarans were drawn up i was sittingsquatting actually on the side of another catamaran eating something that crunched in my jaws and tasted richly of blood i was not alone there were two other alligatorfrogs just below me on the beach doing something or other with large netsrepairing them i supposed i was looking particularly at one of them and it was giving me occasional sidelong glances in return i was conscious of a kind of warm stirring that felt like sexual tension as i looked ati guess at her unless of course that one was male and the body i was inhabiting was female but i could think of no good way of checking that people talk wistfully about wanting a change in their lives generally meaning something like a better job a new boyfriend a week on some island resortanything at all as long as it is different i know the sovereign recipe for that just slip one of the helmets on your head and tap into the mind of a truly alien being and youll never find anything more different as long as you live it wasnt just the sights and smells that were different my borrowed body interpreted them in ways that were completely foreign to me there was a pervading stink of rotten fish in the air powerful enough to make me hold my nose if id had one to hold but i wasnt disliking it it was actually making me hungry my hearing was far better than ever before not only could i hear the distant sounds of insects and the lapping of the waves on the shore i could hear precisely where they were the frogs multiple ears were as directional as sonar i could hear the other alligatorfrogs calling to each otherdeep baritone hissing like a dragons voicebut that was where the helmets capacities ran out i couldnt understand a word they said then flick the scene changed i was still in the creatures body or in the body of one just like him but i was in a series of different places doing a variety of different things once my host was teamed with another frog both of them wearing a kind of harness and pulling something that was heavybut i couldnt see what it wasalong a marshy dirt road between stands of headhigh rushes once he and a couple of others were making a lot of noisesinging together or making threats i couldnt tell which once he was asleep none of it was very intelligible so i called next frog gone away blackness all around me i was looking at another picture this one was a fat tentaclenosed thing the general shape of a hippopotamus and i knew what it was at once i was looking at a wet one one of the amphibians that had killed patrice perhaps in the interests of scientific curiosity i should have made the effort to understand what life was like for a wet one i didnt i wasnt ready for going into that particular mind as soon as i saw it i yelled next it took a moment for pirraghiz to reactsurprised i guess that i wanted to cut that one so short but then i felt the faint scrabbling of her talons as she poked at the controller on the side of the helmet and i had a new bizarre creature to look at i kept going through the roster of diverse but all nonhuman beings that pirraghiz had accessed for me there was a shelled person like the one i had seen in the compound very strange that experience was because the shelled person seemed to see other living things like the docs as luminous and it had two distinct ranges of odordetecting senses one for in the water and one for on land i tried a thing that looked like a feathered gorilla with batlike membranes that joined its arms to its body and let it leap and glide for short distanceson i guess a planet with a lesser gravity because i did not think that would work on earth number five was a fourlegged furry thing that made its home in a cave with its mate and half a dozen young why the beloved leaders had bothered to bug it i didnt know because it certainly didnt look very civilized to me number six number six i knew very well bewildered i took the helmet off my head it was unexpectedly dark in the roomevidently the sun had set while i was in the helmetbut i could see pirraghiz she wasnt hovering nearby as i expected she was over by the window pulling the drapes back from the lightgivers she turned around questioningly ive just seen dopey i told her the one who died she said comfortably yes of course the talker did you simply see his image dannerman or did you go on to experience him seeing the image was plenty he was just the way i saw him last all tattered and beaten up with that big turkeygobbler thing of his drooping and all the colors gone hes about to die pirraghiz and i dont want to experience any of that dannerman i would not ask you to i chose that view of the talker on purpose so that it would be easy for you to recognize him the tapes however are from other parts of his life i scowled at her what parts oh dannerman they are parts that i think will interest you why do you not put the helmet on and see so there i was in dopeys body i knew it was so because his head the little cathead was bent to look at the familiar goldenmesh belly bag he wore i could feel his little fingers inside the muff fiddling with what might have been a kind of keypad i wasnt comfortable in dopeys body his range of vision must have been different from mine because the colors were odd i felt odd too there was a sort of slow rhythmic muscleflexing sensation at the base of my spine but in my own body i dont have any muscles there perhaps it had something to do with that scaly peacock plume he carried i thought and then he looked up i caught my breath what he was looking at was a screen and on it were four or five figureshuman figuresand the nearest of them was me it was something from my own life that i was seeing there were the five of uspat and rosaleen artzybachova jimmy lin general delasquez and myself when we had first arrived in starlab we had come theregod it seemed a century agoin the hope of finding some kind of extraterrestrial technology that would make us rich and what we were doing was squabbling over the division of the beloved leaders stuff we saw all around us i remembered it well i saw us yelling at each other and i saw jimmy lin get hit on the head and then i felt dopeys little hands scrabbling in his belly bag there was a bluish flash on the screen at once all five of us stopped cold in the middle of the argument we didnt fall down we couldnt being in starlabs microgravity but we went limp we didnt speak anymore we began to drift around the space in the orbiter dopey had somehow put us all to sleep then he got to work he glanced back over his shoulder for the first time i saw that there were two docs standing immobile behind him in a cramped little space i had never seen before they began to move at once one of them pushed at a section of wall which opened before him the other picked dopey up and carried him through that hidden door dopeys body felt pleased with itself i could feel the warmth and sensual pleasure that emanated from the great peacock fan that my own body didnt have but dopeys did as we glided down a passage one mystery was solved i caught a glimpse of the stenciled sign on the wall we had just come through it was supposed to be a fuel tank dopey had emptied it out and made it into a hideyhole so he could watch us without being seen i think i was in a kind of shock again what happened next wasnt entirely comprehensible but i couldnt stop watching dopeys docs methodically lifted all five of us one by one and put us into the transit machine then each time without pause they lifted us out again and went on to the next one when we had all been transmittedand copiedthey went to work on the next stage one of the docs held rosaleens unconscious form while the other opened a cupboard on the wall he took out a coppery object the size and shape of an almond while the first doc talons extended slashed a litde gash in the back of rosaleens neck i had never seen an implant put in before i saw it happen to rosaleen i saw it happen to delasquez and jimmy lin and i saw it happen to me and i saw it happen to pat adcock the woman i loved i could see her unconscious and limp i could almost touch her i yearned for her and when it was all over i took the helmet off my head and stared blindly at the room around me pirraghiz said something to me but i wasnt listening i got up and walked over to the balcony door slid it open and stepped outside it was full night now and overhead was that spectacular starswarming sky i wasnt looking at that either all i was seeing was pat once abandoned to dopey and his docs on the orbiter now abandoned with the rest of the human race to whatever the beloved leaders chose to do with them i had never felt more helplessand hopeless and useless in my life a moment later i felt the wicker floor move in protest and pirraghiz stepped out beside me i wondered for a moment if it would hold her great weight then i wondered whether that mattered at all she said tentatively dannerman was i wrong to show you what dopey did to you on your starlab i thought that over for a moment then i shook my head it isnt you who are wrong pirraghiz whats wrong is that everything is going to hell and i cant do anything about it she said softly yes i know what you are going through that made me turn and stare at her do you do you know what it feels like to see everyone i love about to be turned into robots and to be able to do nothing about it of course i do dannerman i knew that for a very long time for all the time i wore the others controller i was even more helpless than you are now i did their bidding i had no hope at allbut then you see suddenly the horch cousins came and i was free oh and do you think theres any chance that somebody will come charging along to help me she looked at me for a long moment i could see the struggle going on in her mind over what answer to give me honesty won out over compassion she said somberly no in truth dannerman i do not chapter twentytwo it wasnt easy for me to reconcile myself to spending the rest of my lifewhat might be a very long lifemarooned with the horch in this place i tried to think of things i might usefully do i couldnt think of any then i began to think of things that might make it more bearable for me im not too proud of some of those buthell for the first time in my life i was defeated i could see no way of helping anyone else so my ideas began to get pretty selfish when beert finally showed up bubbling with good news i made up my mind to try one of those selfish ideas out on him all excitement he told me the greatmother would see me at last and i put it to him thats great beert i said but ive been thinking about something i dont know what pirraghiz had told him about my state of funk everything i guess and he didnt seem patient with it about what he demanded about a favor you could do me if you wanted to if those other horch let you have me as a well a pet do you think theyd allow you to have another one the snaky neck twisted around so that his eyes could peer into mine i think i had hurt his feelings i do not like to ask my cousins to allow me things dan i do not understand what you mean i mean pat adcock ah he said well it wasnt ah exactly but it was the same sort of exhalation of breath indicating that he comprehended the breath was warm on my face you wish me to have a copy of your sexual partner made for you is that it his tone sounded disappointed in me it made me defensive is that too much to ask he paused the sinuous neck curling and straightening thoughtfully i dont know if it is too much tell me why you want this now he was making me angry why do you think because im frustrated and lonely and hopeless thats why and you think it would make you happier to copy someone you care about who then would herself become frustrated and lonely and hopeless well it sounded all different when he put it like that but he didnt give me a chance to try to defend myself he took me firmly by the arm with one of those sinewy tentacles of his and said we will speak of this later dan but now we must go we must not keep the greatmother waiting the greatmother kept us waiting though we trudged to the topmost level of the nest where a subadult horch let us into a room far larger than my own and with many more furnishings there an ancient female horch lay sprawled on an immense bed she had an ungainly thing like a huge metallic corset wrapped around her midsection it could not have been comfortable to sleep in but she wasnt sleeping her long neck dangled limply off the side of the bed her eyes half open but unseeing i whispered to beert is she all right shh of course she is all right she is simply accessing certain files her belly viewer is a thing like your helmet do you understand i didafter the moment it took me to figure out that the belly was where horch kept their brains since of course their heads were too small i kept looking at beert to see if he seemed to be getting receptive to my request but his head was down low staring at the floor i couldnt tell what he was thinking and just as i was making up my mind to ask him again the greatmother stirred her limbs straightened her head lifted to gaze at me while her arms snaked down to the latches of her viewer that was the cue for beert to spring forward to help her when she had the thing unlatched he carefully stowed it away in its wicker container turned his head toward me and said proudly the greatmother will speak to you now the first thing she did was to direct beert to lay out some food and drink for us while i was munching on the only part that looked familiar she explained to me that she had been viewing some of the scenes of our life as captives of the others it was all like a silent film for her since she couldnt understand any of our talk but djabeertapritch had filled her in and she was full of questions did the old female rosaleen artzybachova possess among us the rightful dignity and authority that she herself had in her nest had i in fact bred with the young female pat adcockthat is with one of the three young female pat adcocksand if so what had led me to choose that one over the identical other two and if breeding was desirable why had the old female not assigned a pat to each of the other two males in our party so that all three might become pregnant when i told her there would be no young coming from our quick idyll the idea of contraceptives startled her but why would this pat not wish to gestate she asked incredulously i ran through all the reasons in my mind and settled on one that she might view sympathetically we did not wish to bear a child to suffer captivity in a place far from home i said and saw beerts head swerve toward me thoughtfully she wriggled her neck at me in gentle reproof if our ancestors had thought that way when our planet was overrun you and i would not be having this conversation life is worth saving dannerman offspring are worth having always she flipped her neck in a complicated curve and then asked politely has djabeertapritch told you all you want to know about our nest not everything i said and then i hesitated for a moment maybe i was a little annoyed with beert for not promising to make me a pat but i didnt feel like being tactful i said right out i know this is a sensitive matter but is it true that you dont get along with your cousins in the beloved leader base beert gave me a shocked warning hiss but the greatmother answered at once we are all one folk dannerman it is however true that some of the ways of our cousin horch have changed greatly in the long long time we have been separated from them while this nest has kept to the old ways the ways of your home planet of our particular home planet the two eights there were many planets inhabited by our species when we were taken dannerman and each had its own customs now there are even more the two eights was one of the newest and smallest at the time with only eight sixtyfours of sixtyfours of sixtyfours of sixtyfours of inhabitants i calculated quickly something less than million most of the other horch planets were much larger when the others camebut perhaps djabeertapritch has told you all this not all i think she gave beert that quick reproving necktwist he said hastily i have been busy with the cousins greatmother as you know she patted his arm affectionately of course well you know dannerman that all through our stargoing history we horch had met many strange species a few of them nearly sentients those we always treated with kindnessas you have seen we in this nest have treated you yourself dannerman when the others scoutship came to our world it was the first time another species had come through space to us the ones who came to us were not the others themselves the others were too frail to come to the surface of our planet but they sent their subject species and those were welcomed all that they asked was given to them they did tell us of the eschaton that was one gift of the others it was the only one she looked inquiringly at beert who was twitching restively they also gave us death he growled she sighed yes that is so it is what the others often give and they have many ways of giving it they alter the reaction of a star so that it goes nova or change the orbit of a small planetoid so that it collides with the planet they would destroy they can bring about an emission of poisonous gases from a planets oceans if they choose or they can do what they did to our two eights in their laboratories the others developed a terrible new disease made out of the proteins of our own bodies and they spread it secretly among us and we began to die many many of the people of our planet died nearly all on the two eights fewer than sixtyfour sixtyfours survived those were the ones who were brought here and we are their descendants or she corrected herself somberly the descendants of those who survived what happened here the others interrogated our first generations without mercy many of us died here as well usually in great pain even when we no longer had any information to give we were still valuable to the others because we were still genetically horch so from time to time they seized numbers of us and carried them away to test new diseases and weapons on them and that is what our lives were like dannerman for eights of generationsuntil our cousins of the eight plus three came and set us free abruptly the greatmother sat straighter on her bed her head sprang up to mine until her pointy hardskinned nose was almost touching my own now i will give a more complete answer to your question dannerman the eight plus threes have treated us very well they shared everything they have with us and they offered to take anyone who wished to a horch planet to live most of my nest did go willingly a few of us did not our cousins have had a long history of struggle and warfare which we did not share it has changed them as our lifetimes of captivity have changed us we in this nest wish to make a different life for ourselves though we do not know how but we intend to try what you must remember is that we are all still horch dannerman we will never do anything to harm our cousins djabeertapritch understands this well you must understand it too chapter twentythree when we left the greatmother beerts bubbly mood was restored she likes you dan he said on the way down the staircase his neck dancing with pleasure now we can act do you remember our earlier conversation my heart leaped the one about pat no not the one about pat he said crossly we have had other conversations have we not i am speaking about the one in which i told you that you could help another person in a great matter as we walked out into the open air i tried to remember oh that i said disappointed you mean the one where you didnt tell me what it was or what i was supposed to do how could i forget all that irony was wasted on him yes that conversation exactly he said abstractedly glancing at that benttree sundial he frowned the person who needs your help will be here shortly but first we must go to my laboratory if you dont mind i didnt mind didnt have much chance to object either because beert was leading me rapidly toward his pink shed i looked around apprehensively while he was opening the door but the christmas trees were absent when he touched something just inside the doorway bright lights sprang up and he said with pride this is my personal workspace it was certainly something special there werent any luminous fungi here the lights beert had turned on came from the glowing walls themselves with additional spotlights that were fixed on specific items one a workbench with several gadgets and tools on it a couple of larger gadgets on the floorand one other thing i swallowed the other thing stood motionless against one wall the light sparkling from its million little needles it was a christmas tree i must have made a sound because beert twisted his neck around from where he was taking objects out of a cabinet and tossing them into a basket when he saw where i was looking he reassured me i have told you that you need not fear the robots this one in particular i have taken it apart and rebuilt it and now it does not even have a channel to the central controls urn i said studying the thing but it didnt move so i decided to take him at his word why do you bother i asked he seemed a little embarrassed his face held low and not meeting my eyes i want to learn all that our cousin horch know dan it is the only way this nest can ever hope to stand on its own and he added pride returning and his head lifting i have even been able to build some instruments for my own use like this he lifted one of the gadgets from the workbench and held it high it was a sort of fishshaped flattened oval looking rather like a metallically glittering flounder or sole it is a scrambler dan it generates static which interferes with the communications channels of the others instruments of this sort were very valuable to the cousins when they attacked this base i looked at it with more respect valuable was a conservative word for it something like it would have come in very useful when we were captives it wasnt the only thing around either beerts lab was full of hightech alien gadgets of all kind it was exactly what id been looking for to take back to the bureaus technicians when id still had hope of that but i didnt have that hope anymore beert was still talking this particular device is not exactly like theirs i built it in a different shape to serve the purposes it is planned for and had to waterproof it to protect its power that reminded me and its selfpowered he stared at me of course why would it not be well i said ive been wondering about that ive looked at some of your other gadgets and i dont see any wires he made a hissing noise of exasperation there are no wires each device draws its energy from that wasnt the end of his sentence it was just the point at which it turned into gibberish and i couldnt understand it anymore i asked what i said it draws its energy from the garble of the garble garble which is present in the garblegarblegarble that was no improvement i shook my head apologetically i guess this translator thing doesnt work as well as i thought i said touching the thing behind my ear i didnt understand any of that he sighed wriggling his neck regretfully i said if you could just try to explain a little i did try he said testily you simply do not have the background to understand the words and i do not have time to teach you just now the person i wish to help will be waiting for us he put the scrambler in the basket with the other things and closed the lid gesturing for us to leave the lab outside beert slammed the door behind us and grabbed my arm i let him lead me toward the stream that went through the grounds of the nest and there standing by one of those round little bridges i saw the person beert wanted me to help it was no friend of mine the thing was a wet one one of the amphibians who had killed patrice i didnt say anything to beert well maybe thats not true i think i probably did say something like screw this under my breath but i doubt that beert heard me i wrenched my arm free from his grip turned around and walked away not looking back for no more than three or four meters then i stopped beert was a funnylooking little dinosaur and his unpredictably fluctuating moodshis often childish moodssometimes made that particular little dinosaur difficult to live with but he had done his best to befriend me had in fact saved my life just for starters and if he was now asking me to help him even to help him do something for a species i hateddidnt i owe him something oh hell i said this time out loud and turned around beert was peering after me i retraced my steps to the stream bank exactly what is it that you want me to do i asked chapter twentyfour i dont know if beert had any idea of why i had walked away he didnt comment maybe he figured it was just another bit of earthhuman queerness he simply said as though nothing had happened i will show you and began pulling things out of his little basket and carefully setting them on the ground next to the wet one who was studying me intently with those bulging hippopotamus eyes that were set on the top of his head i didnt speak neither did he i did see that the tentacular electric organs that sprouted from his face were writhing restlessly that didnt seem to be a friendly sign it crossed my mind that beert might have misjudged the situation and i instinctively began looking around for something that might work as a weapon if the thing suddenly jumped me beerts tap on my shoulder distracted me and i looked around are you paying attention he asked crossly see this is how the scrambler fits on the wet ones body he had it in his other hand and began carefully to place it on the amphibians gross belly just behind its tiny midarms i wondered what he was going to use for glue to make it stick to the wet ones hide but he didnt have to do that he had something more effective than glue a metal socket was actually embedded in the amphibians flesh the creature had evidently allowed someone to fasten the socket to his body surgically right through the skin there were two similar sockets flanking the one with the scrambler and the next thing beert did was to attach a couple of stout leather pouches to them then he pulled the last of the baskets contents out it was a pair of handguns my handguns two of the twentyshot bureauissued guns that had been my basic carry weapon ever since i became an agent i nearly lost it one more time as the anger i had managed to push back out of sight boiled over again if anybody was going to have my guns it damn well ought to be me i made a grab for them snarling hey those are mine the amphibian slithered a half step away toward the stream grunting a protest but it didnt try to stop me it didnt have to beert was fast as well as strong he dropped the weapons and his two rubbery arms clamped quick and hard around my wrists he didnt raise his voice actually he said these two projectile weapons are for the wet one if you have a requirement for one it can be copied for you but i do not see any such necessity i wrenched free of his grip he let me go but his arms stayed near mine and his face danced before me they belong to me i complained that thing is a killer how do i know he isnt going to shoot me with them beert said patiently he has no such intention that was when the amphibian spoke up surprising me he wasnt easy to understand he spoke that same horch language naturally enough i could see that he was wearing an implant of his own tucked under his jaw but he didnt have the same sort of vocal cords as i did or even as the horch did the sounds he made were more like a hoarse unpleasant kind of roaring than conversation and i had to strain to make them out that is true shall i now speak of unfortunate past events i guess the question was rhetorical because the wet one went right on talking the lethal pulsing of your female person should not have happened he stated the sharpobject stabbing of our persons by yours should not have happened as well the reason for these wrong happenings may be that my party was in other water where we did not know its tastes in home water he explained where our females stay and the pups are reared we know which tastes are persons and which are prey and which do not matter in other water we may not know all the tastes yours were strange to us and then your persons attacked us so they were wrongly pulsed he regarded me for a second with those knobbed eyes then finished there is nothing else to speak on this matter i listened to his little speech impatiently and turned to beert whats he talking about he is telling you that the death of your friend was an accident beert said irritably as obviously it was it is time you put this anger out of your mind i considered that for a moment but damn him beert was right i didnt much like being taught right from wrong by a snakyheaded monster from outer space but i gave in but what the hell does he need my guns for beert gave me his approving necktwist that is better dan the reason to arm this person is that the greatmothers have given permission to return him to his home planet where he is going to resist the rule of the others resist the rule of the others that changed things it didnt necessarily make us friends the first feeling that flooded my mind was simple burning envy this creature was going to go home while i was stuck helplessly here i was suddenly more jealous than i have ever felt in my life but the facts were plain if i couldnt do anything to help my own human race at least i might be able to do something to harm the damn others it was only revenge but it was better than nothing beert was picking one of the guns off the ground he held it out to me gingerly it is for these that we need your help dan the wet one will be in grave danger when he arrives at his home planet he needs a weapon his ability to stun or kill other organisms with electrical shocks works only underwater and at close range that is not good enough sure i said perplexed but why do you need one of my guns seems to me those horch fighting machines had plenty of firepower beert gave me that negative neckwave he cannot use the energy weapons of our cousins they would interfere with his electrical senses these projectile things of yours might work but we are not well sure of how to use them look i have made these containers for them he pulled one of those flexible sacks off its clamp and i realized they were intended to be holsters for the guns unfortunately he said sadly the containers do network well can you help that put me right in familiar territory so i grinned at him if theres one thing im good at i said its guns show me the problem he did actually there wasnt a single problem there were a lot of them the first one was that beert had put the holsters in on the wrong sides i had heard that the flashier cowboy gunmen of the old westtheir tv versions anywaywore their guns like that performing a lightning crossdraw when they had to kill some bad guy that wouldnt work for the wet one because his anatomy wasnt up to the job his short skinny midarms were as conspicuously inadequate as the arms of a tyrannosaur they wouldnt stretch that far when beert reversed the holsters we put the guns into themafter i made sure the safeties were well and truly onand had the amphibian practice draws that was an improvement but it suggested something else to me when he actually shoots a gun he should fire with his arm straight out otherwise he may get a broken bone these twentyshots dont have much recoil but he doesnt have much arm the wet one who was listening intently immediately began trying that out i sighed as i watched him practice as much as you can before you go i advised another thing where do you think you might be doing this shooting in the water or out of it beert swirled his head at me in alarm will immersion in water harm the weapon oh no theyre waterproof all right what about it i was looking at the amphibian who answered for himself in most cases i think in air thats good im worried about shooting the gun underwater its not made for that and with the resistance of the water it might blow up in your hand try not to do that nowi crossed my fingerslets see how good a shot you are unsurprisingly he wasnt good at all the horch had nothing like a firing range but beert produced a wad of some kind of packing material out of the basket i wadded up some of it and tossed it in the stream for a target when the amphibian reared up on his front flippers he had just enough clearance to draw the guns and fire them his tentacles nervously elevated out of the line of fire beert was taking notes skipping nimbly out of the way when the amphibians shots went wildest then when the wet one reached the point of being maybe able to hit the side of a barn if he were locked inside i decided he was about as good as he was going to get i told beert the holster clasp is too tight youll have to ease it up a little hell need reloads too have you got more ammunition it took a moment to make beert understand that the weapon did not produce its own endless supply of bullets but then he gave me the headtwist we can copy as much as needed copy a lot there isnt going to be a gun shop where hes going and youll have to make something for him to carry them in i thought for a moment then with some reluctance told the wet one i think youd better keep the safety off you might have trouble handling it if you need to shoot in a hurry just dont touch that trigger until you want to fire now lets see how good you are at reloading he wasnt good at that either but he eventually got the idea after a fashion that was as far as we got because beert was fidgeting i must go back to my laboratory to make these changes in the equipment he told the wet one who made no response except to turn and head for the stream just as he was entering the water he paused turned ponderously around and spoke to me in that horrible roaring voice your metal killing device may be valuable to me also your instruction in its use for this i owe you the debt of thanks if i can repay it i will then he slipped into the stream and was gone a couple of those electricshock appendages appeared briefly above the water fluttering in the air almost as though he were saying goodby then nothing showed but those two knobby eye sockets and a pair of vshaped ripples in the water leaving beert and me looking after him beert made that hissing sort of sigh he is a brave person he informed me i just nodded i had formed that opinion of the wet one myselfalong with a fair amount of residual envy and anyway i had something else on my mind beert wasnt giving me much chance to bring it up as soon as i am finished in the laboratory he said happily i must go to my cousins to talk to the greatmother of the eight plus threes so that we may schedule a time when mrrranthoghrow may operate the transit machine for him i will send pirraghiz to you dan i swallowed and took the plunge theres one other thing i said yes ive been thinking about what you said you were right so lets just forget about making that copy of pat for me i told him horch cant smile dont have the facial muscles for it but i could have sworn he was looking at me in an affectionate way it is forgotten dan i am glad and he gave my arm a gentle pat before he turned and hurried away listen im only human get me depressed enough and you might see a person selfisher than you would have believed but i didnt have to stay selfish all the time part six fighting back chapter twentyfive there was another lesson that old drill instructor of mine had taught us in between the pushups and the tenkilometer runs what she said was listen assholes its always better to do something than nothing you hear me if it dont do nothing else itll make you feel better she was right it did my situation hadnt improved a hair in any tangible way but i felt different i felt for the first time that i was playing some part however insignificant in an action that might cause the beloved leaders some aggravation even if only a little moralewise that was a big plus it almost made me feel as though this interminable lonely life that stretched ahead of me might be worth living after all so i decided to start looking for other ways to do the others harm i dont know exactly what i was thinking of maybe leading a charge of horch fighting machines into some beloved leader stronghold the way they had taken over the prisonplanet base but whatever i was going to do to the others the first step was to get to where the action was beert was the logical person to talk to on that subject but he wasnt available when he wasnt over in the horch base to negotiate with the cousins he was locked up in his workshop making the changes in the wet ones armament i decided to pester pirraghiz about it she was in her room sterilizing my chamber pot for me and mrrranthoghrow was with her i hesitated in the doorway pirraghizs room was no bigger than mine but she had somehow found time to put in homey touches of her own some of those tiny flowers in a planter clothing neatly hung her own much larger bed she had turned the room into a very personal habitation and belatedly it crossed my mind that they might have preferred being alone in it apparently not as soon as pirraghiz saw me she waved me in with a spare arm are you hungry she asked at once but i shook my head i wasnt looking for food i want to know about the wet one i said i she looked surprised but recited he is being sent back to his own planet so that i know that tell me how hes getting there she looked at mrrranthoghrow who answered for her he will be transmitted on the captured transit machine of the others of course and how does he know how to get there ah the doc said enlightened you want to know how the wet one will find his way to his home the horch have been working on such problems ever since they occupied this base capturing a transit machine of the others is very useful to them once we had it disassembled the robots began tracing its channels that is the one great advantage the horch have over the others pirraghiz added the others are very strong but the horch have in some cases been able to enter the others channels while the others have never been able to enter theirs i mulled that over i could see the strategic importance of that does that mean theres a channel direct to the wet ones planet of course not dannerman mrrranthoghrow said not from this outpost but there are channels to a nexus which has many channels one will take the wet one to his destination he was annoying me what is a nexus it is a sort of center where many channels come together he said patiently in this case it is a large installation which also was captured from the others now it belongs to the horch there was great damage in the fighting but much of its equipment is intactjust as is the case here what kind of installation he gave me one of those massive shrugs i had no reason to ask such a question dannerman i only know that it is much larger than this installation here pirraghiz had been silent watching me but then she spoke up dannerman i think you are jealous of the wet one do you want to go with him i started to shake my head then decided to admit it i think i could help him fight against the others im a lot better with those guns than he is she made a clucking sound with those thin lips you would be discovered at once dannerman and then you would die its my risk to take and his as well his only hope is secrecy dannerman and even so he has very little chance to survive there in company with someone as conspicuous as you he would have no chance at all i said stubbornly im going to ask been if i can go along anyway when will i see him she waved that off impatiently soon this afternoon i think but what is the use of that he will simply say no and then i will ask him again and keep on asking him until he says yes this is something i have to do you dont understand what its like not to be able to do anything for my friends she sighed do i not i am jealous of the wet one too i hadnt expected to hear that from her because youd like to try to rescue your own planet i guessed rescue it but we have no planet anymore dannerman it is long destroyed our people no longer exist except as slaves of the others countless numbers of them all over the universe she sighed no i am jealous because he has a home to return to she paused fingering her little amulet and then added somberly even though it is certain that he will see it only long enough to die there i didnt want to accept what pirraghiz said but i couldnt get rid of the sneaking suspicion that she was right did it make any sense for me simply to get myself killed on some planet not even my own would it even inconvenience the beloved leaders at all logically i had to agree that it would not but did i have any other way to strike a blow at them i couldnt think of any i told pirraghiz to call me when beert was available and went back to my room and what i did there was to put on that helmet again mrrranthoghrow had selected another set of taps on the bugged people on earth for me and i wanted to see them i think maybe what i had in mind was to remind myself of what the beloved leaders were doing to my own people it didnt work that way the first person i saw was me and what i was doing was flying out of a transit machine and when the person whose eyes i was looking through turned i saw jimmy lin and dopey and a pair of docs and rosaleen artzybachova and martin delasquez and pat my pat looking scared and worn and generally shook up but looking mostly very good indeed to me it didnt take me long to figure out where i was i was in starlab and the bunch of us had just made our escape from the prison planet it was patrice who i was eavesdropping onhad to be because she was the only one of us who was bugged at that time but it was pat i wanted to see and touch and be with i didnt switch to any other file i stayed with that one i listened to us congratulating ourselves on having got away from the damn beloved leaders i watched myself destroy the transit machine so we couldnt be followed i listened as ithat other icalled the bureau on starlabs ancient radio and painfully worked out a way of communicating with them that the rest of the world and especially the beloved leaders might not hear with all the rest of the gang i got into the rickety old crewrescue vehicle that had been berthed at starlab since the last time any astronomer visited it i stayed with them as its engines fired up and we started the long bouncing bucketing drop toward earth and i would have stayed a lot longer if i could in spite of the fact that a suspicion was dawning in my mind what stopped me in the end wasnt that i got tired of seeing pat or that that new thought needed to be pursued it was pirraghiz dannerman i have brought you some food and beert is here now if you want to see him i took the helmet off and blinked at her she was taking little fruits and biscuits out of a coppery mesh bag and laying them before it i ignored them didnt you tell me that the transit machine on starlab wasnt working anymore she blinked back at me why yes dannerman that is so thats what i thought i saidthe other possibility having been that that other dannerman hadnt done as thorough a job of destruction as he thought all right lets go i want to see beert right away to ask him if you can throw your life away with the wet one at least take the meal with you she said scooping it all back into the bag as she handed it to me she said it is a foolish idea and he will surely say no you might be right i agreed but maybe i have a better idea now chapter twenty when i knocked on the laboratory door beert let me in at once look here he said neck and arms awriggle i have taken your advice give me one of the ammunition carriers that last part was aimed at his christmas tree not me the thing was hovering over a workbench littered with the usual cryptic array of gadgets the robot immediately picked one up and brought it over to hand to beert who handed it happily to me it was heavy it was also streamlined and curved like the other things beert was attaching to the wet one and it had the same clamp arrangement to hold it in place which meant i thought that the wet one would have had more sockets carved into his flesh i admired his dedication see beert was saying proudly reaching to touch the thing in my hand this release will fit the wet ones digits it is this button here he needs only to touch it and it flies open beert did it did revealing half a dozen gleaming clips for the twentyshot also there are eight sixteens of additional clips and several others of the projectile weapons in those containers there gesturing at a pair of oblong boxes of that same rubbery materialbut those he will not be able to carry with him perhaps he can hide them somewhere and come back to them when they are needed his little head was close to mine the curly eyelashes fluttering excitedly he was waiting for a compliment i thought so i obliged thats fine i said and glanced at the hovering robot can you turn that thing off i asked beert pulled his head away to regard me but i have told you dan there is nothing to fear from this machine i reached out and caught his neck pulling his head toward me so that i could whisper i want to ask you about something i dont want the cousins to hear i dont want that thing listening beert went suddenly tense he didnt pull away as he easily could have and i felt his warm breath on my face as he thought that over this robot does not interface with the others as i have told you please beert he sighed go into inactive mode he ordered the christmas tree then to me warningly dan you recall what the greatmother said to us we do not agree with the cousins in all things but they are still horch i dont want to harm the cousins i just want a favor from you and i think it is better if they dont know about it i hesitated looking at the christmas tree needles retracted immobile but could it still hear i had to hope not so i began check me out on this beert when the wet one goes he wont be heading for his home planet hell be going to something they call a nexus where there are all sorts of channels that belong to the others yes thats true then and another thing when i was using the helmet i saw something funny i went on i was in patrices mind and we were in starlab i saw myself destroy the transit machine there but i didnt lose contact even after it was destroyed i think that means that theres another transit machine somewhere nearby thats still workingi dont know where maybe in the scout ship that found earth in the first place but still working anyway and somehow or other youre still tapping into that channel i guess from this nexus yes yes beert said testily i suppose all that is so but i still do not know what favor you want of me and then he took a deep breath because beert was not a stupid being by then he did know chapter twentyseven it took a lot of persuasion and he fought me all the way transmit you to this scout ship but you do not know for sure even that it exists the one that visited your planets system may be long gone on some other errand or i said doggedly it may not at least theres some sort of contact and what else could it be oh dan he said sorrowful though sympathetic do you know what you ask i do not believe the cousins would permit it thats why i dont want them to know about it but i give you my word i mean no harm at all to the cousins what about harm to yourself a ship of the others is not like your tiny starlab orbiter such ships are quite large and they are well guarded there will be fighters of the others standing by at the transit machine watchful that they may be invaded by the cousins as this base was i know pirraghiz told me all about the others ships then you also know that they will kill you as soon as you appear i shrugged maybe i can kill them first more likely you cannot dan he scoffed you alone against wellarmed fighters oh i said we earth people have a pretty good combat record pirraghiz said so herself he waggled his neck at me reprovingly then tried a different tack and even if they do not kill you what can you accomplish do you think you can simply leap through space from the scout ship to your planet whatever i can do it will be more than i can do sitting here in your jail that silenced him for a moment i do not think of myself as your jailer dan he said sorrowfully then set me free he was silent again for quite a while his head swerving indecisively aboutdarting toward the immobile robot as though about to start it up again returning to search my face at close range while i i was estimating the distance to the nearest workbench i could see that there were all sorts of things there that i thought the bureaus techs would have liked to play with more immediately important i saw a sort of chisel a pink ceramic blade with a handle shaped for beerts grip not mine but i thought i could hold it well enough in a pinch whats more i was pretty sure that the blade could cut right through that sinewy neck of his well let me make that clear i certainly wasnt intending to kill beert i was merely hoping that he would believe i would once i put the knife to his throat the real question was whether threatening his life would force him to help me i wasnt proud of myself for thinking of taking a knife to a being who had befriended me i wasnt even sure that i could bring myself to do it but then i thought of what awaited my whole worldincluding patand i inched a bit closer to the workbench finally beert gave one of his whispery sighs i do not see that this would directly threaten the interests of the cousins he said reluctantly though perhaps it is better if they are not consulted but even if i were willing to do what you wish i do not know how to do it well i did or hoped i did anyway when you transmit the wet one to this nexus transmit me too i had been thinking it all out as far as i could and i laid it all out for beert the horch in this nexus probably could find a channel to the scout ship for me if not at least to whatever beloved leaders relay station was passing on the data from the bugged humans if they could find the channel presumably they could use it to send me there and then i would take my chances beert listened in brooding silence then finally raised his serpentine arms to stop me he said somberly do you know dan i was sure that if i helped you at all sooner or later you would ask me to do something that the cousins had not approved then why did you help me reflectively he rubbed his chin against the edge of the workbench i am not sure probably because i had seen so many of you die perhaps because you and i had both been captives of the others in any case i thought it harmless to keep you alive even to let you learn all you wished of our ways since there was no possibility you could use that knowledge against us i havent really learned very much i said wheedling he lifted his head to gaze closely at me again you have learned enough to lie to me havent you but very well if i were you i would fear the cousin horch as much as i did the others perhaps i do already let me find mrrranthoghrow and tell him what he is to do part seven the nexus chapter twentyeight the aircushion van that took us to the old beloved leader base was big but the eleven or twelve hundred kilograms of us of one species or another crowded it pretty tight beerts christmas tree stood at the central control pedestal pirraghiz and mrrranthoghrow sat one on each side of the vehicle i guess for balance the wet one had the rear seat all to himself while beert and i were in front beert wasnt talking his neck glumly waving from side to side and i didnt press him i took a piece of the stuff pirraghiz had given me out of my pocket and began to eat itit looked like a carrot and crunched like one but it had a sort of lemonade flavor beert suddenly darted his head toward the coppermesh bag between my feet and then up to confront me in my face what have you got there he asked suspiciously extra food i saiduntruthfully i dont think i convinced him to take his mind off it i jerked a thumb at the christmas tree do we have to have that thing with us i asked it will carry the gear for the wet one he said grumpily and it will go with him to the nexus in case there are any problems but he let it go at that and then we were arriving we climbed a rise in that rustred rock desert that seemed to be the prison planets natural state and the dilapidated buildings of the base were right in front of us they looked naked the horch hadnt bothered to replace the silvery energy dome of the beloved leaders the place looked like and was not much more than a junkyard of damaged beloved leaders machines as soon as we stopped the christmas tree silently gathered all the wet ones possessions guns and scrambler and ammunition boxes and led the way outside pick him up beert ordered and mrrranthoghrow obeyed the wet one was a lot of mass and ungainly to handle but the doc lifted him and carried him out of the car puffing slightly with the effort as pirraghiz followed beert and i got out just behind them then as the two docs moved out of the way i saw what was standing just inside the building line i froze a silvery horch fighting machine was poised there between a wrecked manhigh purple cylinder and a heap of coppery junk that might once have been anything at all i knew all about those fighting machines two of them had done their best to kill me and all the others as we tried to escape the first time and they had come pretty close the good part was that they had turned out very vulnerable to a gunshot having been designed to expect more sophisticated weapons but that was not of immediate importance since i didnt have a gun my adrenaline surged but the machine wasnt paying any attention to us it stood like a statue on its spidery wheeled legs evidently abandoned there when the fighting was over i breathed again but i kept my eye on it as i sidled past and that was what kept me from seeing the other christmas tree the one that was barring our path the first i knew of it was the sound of its little rollerskate wheels but as i looked around it spoke stop there it ordered it didnt look hostile its needles were mostly retracted but it didnt look as though it wanted to get out of our way either beert shouldered his way past our own christmas tree to confront it this wet one is to be transmitted to his own world for which the greatmother of the eight plus threes has given permission he told it it cannot walk well on land so these persons are here to carry it there was another noise of wheels coming from somewhere nearby deeper and louder than a christmas trees skates but the robot paid no attention it extended a branch of needles toward me what is the reason for this other organism being here it asked if the question was meant for me i didnt answer it i was squinting down the passage where a pair of those horch threewheeled velocipedes were rolling toward us each cart carried a single cousin horch their belly plates gleaming and their necks extended in curiosity toward us i was wondering if my whole plan was going to collapse right there beert answered for everyone this other organism is my project for which the greatmother has also given permission i am investigating whether such a primitive person could learn to use advanced technology or whether he is at too low a level to be a possible ally against the others whether the christmas tree was buying that i couldnt tell but it didnt matter one of the cousin horch spoke up we have been called for nothing it is only djabeertapritchs puppy well he didnt say puppy exactly what he said was more like immature lowerform creature possessed for entertainment and he sounded amused as he said it but he went on to the christmas tree he is harmless let them pass escort them to the transit machine in case they need help and the other cousin horch said to beert equally amused you are still not used to the blessings of technology yourself are you djabeertapritch imagine using organisms to carry another organism you should have summoned a vehicle and with the horch equivalent of chuckles the two of them rolled away for the benefit of the glass robot i did my best to look harmless while for beert and the docs doing my best to prove the cousin horchs estimate of me wrong i hadnt cared for being called a puppy what i cared about was that the guard christmas tree had been instructed to accompany us it did it rolled along in silence apart from the occasional faint jingle of its needles it paused when we paused so that mrrranthoghrow panting could turn the burden of the wet one over to pirraghiz for a while it didnt seem to be paying any attention to us other than that though the sparkly ball at its top was flickering rapidly it was just there and it stayed there until we reached the space where the great green transit machine stood two other christmas trees stood there apparently waiting for us worse still one of the spiderlegged fighting machines stood immobile against a wall it seemed to be in standby mode but i was pretty sure that it would come to life very quickly if needed the only plus factor among those unwelcome negatives was that there were no living horch cousins on the scene but i wished their machines would go away and they had no apparent intention of that when pirraghiz had set the amphibian down beert looked around at the machines we have come to transmit this wet one on his mission he announced in case they were interested they didnt seem to be i know of no way of telling what a christmas tree is looking atone configuration of needles is pretty much like anotherbut i didnt think they were even watching as mrrranthoghrow opened a flap on the side of the transit machine and began rearranging its little rainbows of color beerts own christmas tree was busy too it was expertly fitting all the wet ones paraphernalia into its receptacles on the amphibians body there was something i wanted there so i walked over to where that was going on the amphibian raised himself up staring at me with those hippopotamus eyes i patted his thick body encouragingly good luck i said loudly enough so that everyone could hear at the same time relieving him of one of his guns that wasnt hard to do since the holsters were made for quick release i didnt think anyone had seen me whether the amphibian had i didnt know those electric medusa snakes around his broad mouth were waving wildly but not coming close to me i wish the same to you he said thickly and waddled over to the transit machine there was no ceremony mrrranthoghrow held the door open the amphibian climbed in beerts personal christmas tree followed lugging the ammunition cases mrrranthoghrow slammed the door shut and touched one of the colored lights and a moment later he opened the door again and the chamber was empty the wet one was on his way that was when we came to the hard part i picked up my little coppermesh bag of goodies and strolled to where mrrranthoghrow was holding the door for me we will now transmit this other organism beert announced and everything went bad at once all three of the robots spoke up no said the violet one we have no instructions for more than one transmission why did this organism take the weapon from the wet one the greenish one asked and the third one the pale orange jobber that had stopped us in the first place moved toward me what has the organism got in that bag has he been stealing from you djabeertapritch the whole scheme was falling apart before my eyes i could not let that happen not when i was so close wait beert ordered but the robots werent waiting and neither was i i had the gun in my hand i got the pale orange robot right in the globe at its top first shot i was drawing a bead on the second one when pirraghiz grabbed me she leaped into the machine me and my bag in her arms mewing at mrrranthoghrow who put his hands on the controls beert bellowed in surprise and anger but he was looking at the fighting machine which had come to life and was advancing toward us i dont suppose beert was thinking very clearly what he did was jump into the transit machine with pirraghiz and me and the door closed i was on my way to a place very far from earth as it happened but on my way chapter twentynine travel in these alien gomachines was no trouble at all you got in at one place you came out at a different one that was all there was to it this time the other place was really different the first thing i noticed about it was that it was a microgravity environment like starlabs where i weighed nothing at all no thats wrong the first thing i noticed about this nexus was that three ugly horch fighting machines were standing there looking ready to blow my head off thats wrong too though because they werent standing they were clinging to a network of cables that spanned the baremetalwalled room we were in and they hung there in three different orientationsheads up tails up every which way upbecause the microgravity gave them no place to stand on beert flailing around for something to grab on to squawked dont shoot mercifully they didnt i still had my twentyshot in my hand but i dont think i could have fired it to any effect if they had pirraghiz was holding me tight but pirraghiz was floating herself until she managed to catch on to a couple of the cables then things stopped whirling around for me such were the advantages of a few extra arms by a doorway a couple of the glass robots were tugging the great bulk of the wet one away they stopped as we got there one of them an unfamiliar prussian blue shot out a crystalline tendril in our direction and spoke we were not informed of a second transmission what is your purpose here i didnt have a good answer for that so i was glad that the question seemed to be aimed at beert he didnt look as though he had a good answer either he had caught one of the lines to moor himselfupside down relative to me as it happenedand his neck was darting this way and that worriedly that had me worried too could he forgive me for shooting up one of his cousins machines and if he couldnt what then the only thing i was sure of was that whatever might come after that would not be good news for me as inconspicuously as possible i jammed the gun in my pocket to get it out of sight but i kept that hand near it just in case i was well aware that if beert said the wrong word one of those fighting machines would start shooting and that would be the end of this particular dan dannerman of course i would certainly be shooting back but it wouldnt do any good in the long run because i wasnt fool enough to think i could defeat the whole horch race singlehanded which would not have kept me from giving it a try the machine apologetically repeated its question and beert finally bestirred himself i am djabeertapritch of the two eights he said sounding wretched but determined i was a captive of the others my ancestors were caught there when the two eights planet was invaded and i am one of their descendants the christmas tree silently processed that information for a moment then extended one branch toward pirraghiz and me and what are these organisms they are my servants since i am from a lost colony we have not had machine servers for many generations i am used to using living species to work for me the larger of the two was carrying the wet one the other isa volunteer like the wet one beert said miserably not looking at me he is to be transmitted to his own planet to resist the others the machine processed some more and evidently did some unheard communicating after a bit it said you are welcome here djabeertapritch of the two eights the greatmother of this nest instructs me to provide you with quarters and whatever else you need until she can come to welcome you in person since beert hadnt blown the whistle on me at least not yet my chances of making it back to earth began to look a little better that was when i remembered that i didnt want to come back emptyhanded the little coppermesh bag of goodies i had swiped from beerts lab was a good start but i wanted more there wasnt much more to be seen the corridors we were scudding through were starkly bare i remembered being told that this place like the prison planet had fairly recently been captured from the others no doubt there had been a lot of wreckage but no doubt too that had been some time ago and the resident horch had had time to clean up nestled in one of pirraghizs arms i had every chance to look around but there wasnt much to look at we on the other hand must have been an interesting spectacle for the locals the two christmas trees were making easy work of tugging the wet one along though the amphibian himself was emitting snuffling noises of discomfort and complaint pirraghiz had no trouble carrying me hand over hand along the cables even though behind us beert had glumly wrapped both his rubbery arms around one of her huge feet to be towed as well the corridors werent entirely empty along the way we passed half a dozen of the christmastree robots who simply got out of the way but showed no sign of interest in us and one or two living horch who did but although the horch goggled at us as we passed they didnt interfere there was a mixup when we got to our destination it was in a better neighborhoodsome of the rooms were occupied here and a couple of infant horch stuck their heads out of the doorways to see the sightbut the room the christmas tree offered beert was small heaven knows what cattle pen the robot had had in mind for us lesser breeds but beert was having none of it they must all stay with me he declared in a tone that accepted no arguments the robot didnt offer any actually it communed with itself for a moment or twoprobably really was communicating with higher authorityand then led us to a larger suite it wasnt just large it was handsomely furnished it had a central reception area with those horch bowlshaped tvs and racks of the horch glitterytape books strapped in place so they wouldnt float away and webbing to hold an occupant in place while he watched or read and lighting that could be brightened or dimmed with switches that looked like mushroom caps a couple of short passages led to other rooms also nicely arranged evidently nothing was too good for a horch who had suffered captivity under the others our robot guide indicated that the largest of the sleeping rooms was to be beerts so we underlings checked out the others each had sets of sleepwebbings attached to the walls a good size for me but nowhere near adequate for pirraghiz or the wet one pirraghiz didnt complain the amphibian did it is very dry here it roared is there no water anywhere and why am i not already on my way to my home i left pirraghiz to try to placate him i could hear beert in his own room talking to the robot but i didnt want to see beert just then so i explored what i was really looking for was some small additional bits of horch technology to add to the store in my bag but there wasnt much of that i did find a nifty zerog toiletluckily because the need was getting acute whether the technology was horch or beloved leader i couldnt tell but it was kilometers better than anything on starlab i would have been glad to take that along if i could since i couldnt i made do with another couple of the glittertape books when i got back to my room beerts christmas tree was relieving the wet one of his weapons and gadgets to stow away then it came to me a branch extended meaningfully i hesitated but pirraghiz commanded give the weapon to it and i passed over my twentyshot when it had put the gun away i marked the place but it was as well there as in my pocket for the time being then the christmas tree ordered us into beerts room i found him nervously rubbing at a stain on his tunic his long supple neck dancing all around his body as he checked his outfitlike a debutante about to be presented to the queen i thought and found out how close i was it is the greatmother of this nest he told me she is actually coming here herself to see us be very respectful to her danand when she has gone you and i have much to talk about chapter thirty the greatmother did not travel alone first came a couple of new christmas trees dexterously scrambling along the cables and bearing gifts one had a variety of capsules and clumps of what appeared to be the food beert had requested the other a rubbery ovoid the size of a pig that contained water and when the wet one found that out he begged to have some of it sprayed on him there wasnt time for that for the next to enter was the greatmother herself this one was even fatter than the greatmother of beerts nest and a lot more fashionably dressed she wore silvery body armor that covered not only her belly but nearly her whole torso it struck me that that had to be uncomfortably heavy garments and all the creature had to mass at least a quarter of a ton but not of course here she came floating weightlessly into the reception chamber towed by a pair of glass robots to save her the bother of swarming along the cables herself her long neck was covered with bangles like a ubangis and it was dancing a hula of greeting the greatmother gave the most cursory of glances at the clutch of us lesser species and addressed herself directly to beert i welcome you djabeertapritch of the two eights she declared touching her nose almost to his we are glad to have you in our nest but how does it happen that you come it was clear that beert was the one she was welcoming i was sure that if pirraghiz and i had turned up without a live horch as company our reception would have been a lot less hospitable for beert she was different the greatmother was thrilled to meet a conspecific who had endured the vile captivity of the others she wasnt disposed to question beerts stumbling explanation of his nests history and the rapidly invented mixup that had brought him here either actually his rather creative description of the blunders that had made it happen amused her she had a superior kind of tolerance of one planet in the horch federation for another reminding me of the way canadians talked about new zealanders in the british commonwealth well what do you expect of a bunch of eight plus threes she asked jovially she cast a mildly disapproving eye at the amphibian and me it is odd however she added that horch should concern themselves with the problems of lesser species they are more worthy than they seem greatmother beert said humbly permit me to introduce them she shrugged that idea away impatiently neck and arms all twisting at once my least of grandsons is interested in such other organisms i am not but tell me of your captivity djabeertapritch you were allowed no machines at all but how did you live i am sure beert had more urgent things to talk to her about than his nests tribulations but he was not capable of denying the request of a greatmother we were horch he said simply we used what we had or could make for building materials we took clay from the ground and long thin shoots from the local vegetation i didnt want to hear it all again so i took a chance excuse me i said deferentially addressing beert the wet one needs water so if we may withdraw the greatmother answered for him it was the first time she had spoken to me directly go go she said irritably but leave food for djabeertapritch the poor thing must be hungry we all crowded into one of the other rooms or all but beert and his personal robot which remained behind to serve him his meal i had two things on my mind for one i knew i was going to have that little talk with beert before long and i wasnt looking forward to it i was definitely looking forward to the other though however much i tried to warn myself that there were many hurdles still to get across i could almost taste the nearness of my escape to earth while pirraghiz was taking charge of the food we had carried away with us sniffing and tasting each item i looked around the room for things that might be useful when i got back by the time she had approved a few things for my meal i decided there werent any but there might be information worth having pirraghiz handed me a collection of fruits and spoke doubtfully to the amphibian i do not know if any of this is suitable for you wet one the wet one waved a flipper at her the robot with the sack of water was carefully spraying his rubbery skin a squirt at a time like spanish peasants taking wine from a goatskin while a second robot was busy mopping up the droplets that splashed away the wet one was wriggling with pleasure as his skin welcomed the damp but it did not distract him from his purpose i do not need to eat now he grumbled in that thick muddy voice i will eat well when i have been transmitted to my own planet when will that happen his bath boyrobot answered him the channels are being prepared the greatmother will give the order to transmit you when she wishes i thought that was a good opportunity to try to get some information so i interrupted can you tell us what kind of a place were in the spraying robot did not respond but the one on mopup detail stopped what it was doing and extruded a glittering branch of twiglets in my direction this is a nest of the four and ones formerly occupied by the others it said that wasnt informative i said i mean what is it that was no better the robot stood silent and impassive only the glittering ball at its top flickering unhelpfully pirraghiz sighed put down the loaf of something she was breaking into pieces for me and issued an order display the appearance of this artifact we are in she commanded the christmas tree it worked the thing immediately went to the video bowl fussed with the controls for a moment and did as commanded an image sprang up in the bowl it was obviously a space station of some kind but what it looked like was a childs impromptu buildingblock construction all jagged angles and bits and pieces tacked on it gleamed of metal though not very brightly at first i thought it was a kind of engineering drawing since it was displayed against a background of solid black like the images id seen of other species in the helmet but then pirraghiz said what are those things and i saw that the blackness was not quite complete it was a sky and not a kind of sky i had ever seen before it was certainly nothing like the brilliant globularcluster display of the prison planet it wasnt even like a starry night on earth there were no stars at all instead there was a scattering of fuzzily glowing little scraps of light hard to make out most were white some bluish one or two a ruddy orange in color and apart from them there was nothing but blacknesstotal unrelieved unfriendly blackness i had not been in love with an astronomer for nothing my god i said those are galaxies ever since the five of us found ourselves on the prison planet i had been aware that we were far from home not this far though not in intergalactic space even the globular cluster of stars that surrounded us could have been somewhere within that fuzzy whirlpool of stars that was our own galaxy but now no we werent even that close anymore i know its silly if we had been close enough to see earth as a star in the sky say marooned on the surface of mars i still would have had no way of getting to it other than one of these alien transit machines and with the machines no distance was really far wherever i was i was as close to home as a single step no matter how many millions of lightyears i had to cross to get there all the same it felt different it felt frightening it wasnt until pirraghiz touched me on the shoulder that i realized i was still staring at that picture in the bowl are you all right dannerman she asked anxiously you arent eating i looked down at the crinkly pale fruit in my hand then gave it back to her im not hungry i said you should eat she said but if that is not what you want to do just now perhaps you should go to beert have you forgotten than he wanted to talk to you well actually i had at least for the moment but it was something that needed to be done so i headed for the reception room i was surprised to find that beert was still talking he had just got to the beginnings of the building of the nest and their invention of a kind of paper and the greatmother was absorbedly listening still but when i came in she glanced at me with the absent look a visitor might give the family cat as it slunk into a room then shook herself i am being selfish djabeertapritch she sighed all the nest will want to hear your story we must have a banquet and sing so that you can teach them what horch can do however wretched their circumstances i am honored by your visit greatmother he said lowering his head respectfully yes she agreed and as her personal christmas tree began to bear her away she twisted her neck teasingly and added you will enjoy the banquet djabeertapritch we will show you someone you have never seen before chapter thirtyone the talk with beert didnt get off to a good start what was on my mind was why we were so far from anything at all what was on his was wonder about who this previously unknown someone might be it turned out quickly that he couldnt answer my question and naturally i hadnt a clue about his so we got serious i said im sorry if i got you in trouble beert he gave me one of those nosetonose looks for a moment then pulled away you should not have destroyed one of the cousins machines he said sorrowfully judicious the rest is my fault now show me what you have in that bag he caught me by surprise that time but i sighed and retrieved the bag there are times when you just have to throw in your hand and take whats coming to you when i loosened the drawstring and shook it gently its contents spilled out all the little odds and ends of horchware that i had surreptitiously filled it with tools stolen from beerts laboratory a batch of pirraghizs tapes and the ones i had taken from the room here i had been careful when i opened it but the things began to fly around the room i caught as many as i could and beert reached out for others he stared at the first one that came his way a black oblong with rows of dimples along its side this is mine he said i didnt answer and he darted his head toward me you took it from my workshop i didnt say anything to that either i was busy cramming the loose items back in the bag beert didnt stop me he even handed a couple of them back to me but he wasnt meeting my eyes anymore when i had everything stowed away again i cleared my throat i didnt want to tell you about these things i said no you would not he agreed these are horch technology they came from the cousins i did not think you would try to take such things with you i do not think my greatmother would approve i said miserably i didnt like doing it beert but what choice did i have do you remember what you said that in my place you would fear the cousin horch as much as the others well i do beert gave me a look i couldnt read then turned away well twisted away is a better way to put it he corkscrewed his neck around itself until it came to rest with his chin on his shoulder or what would have been his shoulder if hed had one looking away from me i need to think he said leave me dan and i did pirraghiz insisted that i eat so i did then she urged me to sleep because there was no knowing when i might get the chance again so i tried to do that too sleep didnt come quickly though what made it difficult was my conscience the difficulty was that although this beert was a weirdlooking creature with a snaky neck and the face of a rattlesnake not to mention that he was also a member of that race who had just finished murdering a whole bunch of my fellow humans one of whom had been mein spite of all that he was something else he was one of the only two friends i had left anywhere in this part of the universe and i had put him in the deep shit and had every prospect of getting him in deeper still you might ask how i could do something like that to a friend i guess the only proper answer would be practice because actually i had had plenty of experience along those lines betraying friends was basically the job description of what i did for the national bureau of investigation we called it infiltration in order to get the goods on some gang of criminals or terrorists or whatevermy first step was to make some new friends who would remain my friends just as long as it took me to get the evidence that would put them in prison for most of their adult lives i had never had much of a problem with my conscience in those days because those friends werent friends at all they were bad guys and they needed to be put away but beert wasnt a bad guy neither was my other new friend pirraghiz and i was definitely screwing up her life too so i didnt get much sleep hanging on to the webbing in my alien room in this alien thing called a nexus neither did anyone else because it wasnt long until one of the christmas trees poked in on me and announced the channels for the wet one have been accessed it may proceed now to its transmission chapter thirtytwo i dont know if beert had slept either when i got to where the wet one was beert was there too painstakingly reattaching all the amphibians gear to his body but he didnt speak to me he didnt speak on the way back to the transitmachine chamber either the trip seemed shorter than it had coming the other way maybe because my mind wasnt on what we were doing what my mind was occupied with was wondering what beerts mind was i knew he was feeling guilty i didnt know what he would do about it if duty overcame friendship he only had to speak a couple of words and my hopes of ever getting back to earth would be right down the tube or if he dithered indecisively for very long that would be nearly as bad what i wanted was to be on my way before it occurred to anybody to put in a call to the eight plus threes a couple of the christmas trees were waiting for us at the transit machine so was a living horcha very young horch i thought because he was no more than half beerts size but handsomely decked out in a scaleddown version of his greatmothers body armor i am kofeeshtetch he saidor something like that he was talking to beert but his neck was swaying toward me and the wet one i am the greatmothers least grandson can these organisms talk kofeeshtetch turned out to be pretty nearly the best thing that had happened to me in a while he was a pampered and fairly well spoiled youngster and that was very good for us lower organisms he wasnt just interested in us he was fascinated he was even more fascinatedno the right word is thrilled thrilled enough to be peeing his pants if hed had anyat what we two aborigines were planning to do invade strongholds of the others do it singlehanded when i myself am grown he boasted breathlessly i too will command forces to capture stations and worlds from the others just as my parents did in this installation but i will not of course be foolish enough to attempt it alone do you imagine that you have any hope of succeeding at all i wasnt sure whether he was asking the wet one or me but i wanted to be the one who answered with the generous help of you horch yes i said beert gave me a disapproving look translated as shut up you ve made enough trouble it is kind of you to take an interest kofeeshtetch he said doing his best to be polite to a grandson of a greatmother but we have urgent business this wet one is most uncomfortable in this dry and weightless environment he should begin his mission without delay the youth shrugged impatiently of course but first i wish to hear his plans in detail speak to me if you can wet one the amphibians little electric whiskers were twisting about for a moment i thought the greatmothers least grandson was going to get a cattleprod shock to hurry him along but courtesy and prudence won out the wet one began telling his plans in his thick slobbery voice kofeeshtetch listened with a lot less courtesy his neck drawn back from the wet one in repugnance i can hardly understand this one he remarked to beert he speaks very poorly as do you i am disappointed he turned to the nearest christmas tree at least display for me what his planet looks like alsoshooting one arm in my directionthe planet of this one we have not yet identified the other organisms home the machine apologized do so meanwhile the display there was no doubt that kofeeshtetch was used to having his orders obeyed they were another of the christmas trees the one hovering by the transit machine quickly swung itself to a tv bowl in the wall and made adjustments as a picture sprang up in the bowl the amphibian caught his breath in a sort of loud abbreviated snore to me the picture was just a planet and not a particularly interesting one none of its few land masses looked anything like earth but it meant something to the amphibian he croaked that is it i believe that is my true home water one of his shocking tendrils was resting on the image touching a wide bay that looked like any other wide bay to me it didnt seem to mean much to kofeeshtetch either as he pulled himself closer one of those meanlooking fighting machines got in his way but he shoved it rudely aside then he made a sound of disgust this is a very tedious object wet one he told the amphibian there is too much water but if you wish to go there then do so and he waved to the christmas tree who opened the door of the transit machine the amphibian crawled in attachments and all and the other robot tossed his ammunition boxes after him the door closed kofeeshtetch made a gesture of dismissal i do not think that wet one will survive for long he remarked and that was all there was to it after a moment beert sighed i would have liked to wish him well on his venture he said meditatively in any case thank you for your help kofeeshtetch but now i am quite tired i think i will go to my chamber and rest before the banquet are you coming dan i looked at the young horch he seemed poutily disappointed in the entertainment but he hadnt left you go ahead beert i said i think kofeeshtetch still has some questions for me so ill stay a bit it took me about thirty seconds to get the kid juiced up againhe was after all a kid all i had to do was to ask him if he would please grant me the favor of telling me how his ancestors had captured this installation that did it he was off and then all i had to do was make the appropriate thrilled noises from time to time his story was full of horch names that i didnt retain and matters of who took precedence over whom that i didnt understand in the first place most of it though was blowbyblow descriptions of how his parents technicians had managed to insert their fighting forces into the others channel and how the first wave of horch fighting machines had been destroyed in a few moments and how the horch had sneaked a second wave in through a different transit machine while the defenders were distracted by what was happening at the first one and and on and on kofeeshtetch loved the subject he acted it out with limbs and neck flying in all directions it was interesting to me too as an insight into how the horch did their fighting but at that moment not very i wanted to get on to my own problem but i didnt want to interrupt when kofeeshtetch got to the point where their horch robots were mopping up the rags and tags of flesh that was all there was left of the others warriors i began to hope for an ending the greatmother has told me he was saying proudly of how vile the stench of those decomposing corpses was so that for a time it was difficult to breathe even more difficult to eat without vomiting to carry on the work of this installation was very hard carry on i did interrupt him then but this was an others installation why would you want to carry on their work he gave me a scornful hiss thrusting his head in my face his breath was not nearly as inoffensive as beerts of course it had been operated by the others what of it the others are filthy vermin but there are some few objectives we share in common do you want to hear the story of my parents or do you not i wanted to hear what those common objectives were but i wanted even more to get to my own desires your parents were very very brave i said with admiration i only hope that i can be as brave and as successful when i too fight against the others kofeeshtetch swayed his neck indecisively back and forth for a moment i could see that he was reluctant to give up his favorite subject but he was torn i understood his dilemma when my uncle max adcock the notverysuccessful buccaneer capitalist told me about the next great stock raid or franchise operation that was going to make him rich at last if only uncle cubby would help him out with a little seed capital i always listened to the tenyearold i was at the time it was exciting i dont mean that i liked uncle max apart from the fact that he was my cousin pats father i didnt have much use for the man kofeeshtetch didnt have a lot of use for lower organisms like me either but he had the same yearning to hear about exciting adventures tell me your plan he said sulkily actually the word plan was a lot more dignified than my hazy notions deserved but i did my best i said a scout ship of the others is somewhere near my home planet with your greatmothers gracious permission and assuming the proper channels can be accessed i am going to invade it and kill everyone aboard hum he saidactually it was more like an approving growl but he looked puzzled what do you mean by a scout ship it was my turn to be puzzled neither beert nor pirraghiz had had any difficulty knowing what i was talking about so why did he i floundered in order to discover civilizations like mine the others send out exploring vessels which travel slower than light speed when they find one yes yes he said sounding impatient but such vessels come in many varieties both for us horch and the others which kind do you mean i winced it had never occurred to me that there might be different kinds but i said staunchly whatever kind is there it doesnt matter i will slip aboard and start shooting only i added there is a problem i wont be able to do any of that unless i have weapons and a scrambler to disrupt their communications like those the wet one had now those are gone kofeeshtetch was waving his arms reprovingly you are so ignorant he complained all such patterns are stored in the transit machine it would be quite simple to make copies if there were any point to it but is there i am not satisfied that your plan is good he meditated for a moment then gave a decisive neckswirl i wish to see this scout ship for myself he turned his head to the nearest christmas tree and barked i am waiting havent you found that planet for me yet you wouldnt think a christmas tree could look embarrassed but this ones branches and twiglets hung low we have not yet made a positive identification that bugged me of course you can do it youve been relaying data from it for months the robot didnt extend even one tiny spring in my direction to kofeeshtetch it said relays occur automatically we have traced all such but there are two eights of planets transmitting this sort of data can this organism say whether his people use radio i resisted an impulse to laugh oh yes all the time i said still to the horch that eliminates some then how many moons does this planet have one big one then kofeeshtetch the robot said shooting out a sprig of needles to touch the controls of the screen it is likely that this is the planet you seek and when the picture had formed in the bowl it was i could see the dagger of india stabbing down into the indian ocean with the little island of sri lanka dripping off its tip as the planet slowly spun i could see africa emerge and the beginnings of europe there was something strange about the image though tiny dots of reddish light that i had never seen before were sprinkled around the globe but there was no doubt what i was looking at i swallowed thats the earth i said suddenly homesick kofeeshtetch was not sentimental not the planet he snapped at the robot isnt there a survey vessel of the others nearby we have identified one yes here is a plot of its transit machines three or four of those reddish lights appeared close together against a background of stars it was the stars more than those little lights that made me catch my breath this was none of that awful intergalactic black nor all those multicolored headlights of the globular cluster these were my own stars the very constellations you can see from earth i recognized at least one of them the seven stars in a cupandhandle pattern that every child knows as the big dipper kofeeshtetch wasnt interested in stargazing so many transit machines he muttered can we see the ship itself at once stars and ruddy lights vanished and we were looking at another set of childrens tinkertoys we have no view of the specific craft but it is probable that it is this model the robot said it looked to be smaller than the nexus itself or at least a little less complicated but it impressed kofeeshtetch but this is no mere robot scout it must be in fact a major vessel of the others he swung his head to face mine you could not possibly succeed in attacking it singlehanded it will be staffed with many many warriors of the others all better armed than you such a venture would require a fullscale assault almost as large as the one with which our nest stormed this place that was not at all what i wanted to hear i think im more or less brave but im not stupid a oneman suicide venture against impossible odds didnt sound attractiveat least unless there was nothing better on offer i took a chance i dont suppose you could interest your greatmother in well in launching such an attack kofeeshtetch laughed in my face little raucous puffs of bad breath he didnt say anything he didnt have to his laughter made it quite clear that the horch were not going to launch a major battle to please a lower organism like me especially over a pissant little planet like earth what he did say was your plan is not worth pursuing perhaps you should return to the eight plus threes i will leave you now to prepare for the feast the greatmother is providing for djabeertapritch he looked like he was getting ready to do it too i could feel my dreams collapsing around me but one faint hope of an idea was percolating through my mind wait a minute i begged can i see the planet earth again i had nearly lost him he was just a child after all if i wasnt about to pursue the feats of derringdo that fired up his kid imagination he had no further use for me he hung indecisively from his cable for a moment then said petulantly oh very well but do it quickly quickly was how the robot did it the planet had revolved a little more now we were looking at the atlantic ocean south america bulging out into it and the east coast of the united states just visible on the periphery i peered at that unfamiliar scattering of red spots clustered mostly along the shorelines i pointed what are those kofeeshtetch gestured and then the robot answered me we have no definite identification they appear to be satellite installations but we do not know their purpose but theyre smaller and theyre right on the surface of the earth that is not precisely accurate the machine corrected me if you will observe they are all in the water regions of the planet close to the land masses but not on them but still i began to argue i didnt finish kofeeshtetch waved me to silence he was beginning to catch the spirit that might be a workable plan he said thoughtfully a smaller installation only one transit machine each perhaps only operated by machines certainly with a much smaller complement than the ship in spaceyes this may be worth considering i will think on this and perhaps seek advice from the greatmother when i got back to my room as jubilant as i dared be pirraghiz was waiting for me she listened but didnt comment as i told her what had happened wheres beert i asked i must tell him djabeertapritch is sleeping dannerman this has been exhausting for him she didnt sound excited at all and she was bringing me down with her but he will want to hear all this i insisted she gave me one of those sixlimbed shrugs you can speak to him when he wakes dannerman she said firmly he has some important decisions to make and he has ordered me to let him rest it is better if you rest also would you like to eat first chapter thirtythree i didnt get a chance to talk to been after his sleep i didnt get much sleep for myself either because pirraghiz woke me up to tell me that the greatmothers banquet was just about to happen and wed better get a move on i could have wished for a little more warning i really needed to talk to beert but when i tried to grab him he simply waggled his neck at me later dan he said sounding distracted and not really all that interested we cant keep this greatmother waiting i was also conscious of really beginning to need a bath and there wasnt anything of that sort in the chambers theyd given us so unwashed i followed beert and the christmas tree along the roped passages hoping that the horch sense of smell was not acute because i was sure i was a lot less than fragrant just then i could hear the noise from the feast long before the banquet hall was in sight the hall was shaped like a pyramidwell like a tetrahedron with four triangular sides none of which was either a floor or a ceilingand it was big it had to be there were at least forty horch present they werent sitting they werent even doing what horch do instead of sitting down like a human being they just hung there clipped to one or another of the brightly glowing cords that were stretched across the volume of space like strands of a d spiderweb and they were very loudly singing it is hard to say what a horch group sing sounded like it was a little like the howling of a pack of constipated wolves a little like hogs grunting ferociously as they battled for tidbits in a pen the big difference was that the horch were doing all that in unison and that there were lyrics to the tune they sang they sang of the greatest of greatmothers and of the undying delightsor of the lateron undying delights that is after theyd finished whatever other dying they had to get thereof living forever cherished in the greatest of greatmothers love does that sound awful sure it does it was they hadnt waited for us to arrive they were eating as they sang a squad of the glassy robots were busily slithering along the cords hand over handwell branch over twigto serve the diners with great gobs of something that looked like pink mashed potatoes only gluey enough to hold together in a ball clusters of figlike fruits that probably werent fruits at all because they were squirming hinged food dishes containing stuff that i couldnt see but could smell when the nearest horch opened theirs mesh bags of what might have been nuts or vegetables orwell anything at all all i could see through the mesh was varicolored lumps of god knew what the other thing the horch were doing was drinking out of bagpipelooking bladders with spouts on one end the horch took the spouts in their triangular little mouths when they wanted a drink and then some of them pointed the spouts at friends nearby and squeezed for fun i guess the thin streams of yellowish liquid looking unpleasantly like urine splashed when they hit another horch and kept on going when they missed it didnt matter which they did though the christmas trees were diligently sucking the spilled liquid out of the air as they passed these masters of the universe were having their fun at a kind of college fraternity brawl i guess the overworked robots werent enjoying it but probably they werent programmed to enjoy anything anyway our personal robot first escorted beert to the heart of the web the greatmother was there and eating industriously pausing in her own consumption only now and then to stuff some particular delicacy into the mouth of her least grandson kofeeshtetch having their mouths full didnt keep them from singing along welcomingly waving beert to join in pirraghiz and i werent included in the invitation we werent given the good seats either a pair of serving robots dropped their waitering duties long enough to tug us to webs at one vertex of the tetrahedron then they scuttled away to fetch fresh delicacies for the horch we werent alone there there were three or four horch nearby singing along lustily with the others though they couldnt have been very high rankingour place was the exact equivalent of a table by the kitchen door in a human restaurant even to the procession of serving robots that streamed back and forth past us our neighbors didnt stop singing they darted their heads to glance at us as we arrivednot cordially i could almost hear them asking each other what cretin had invited these nastylooking lower orders to the feast especially ones who smelled as strange as pirraghiz and no doubt me we werent totally neglected after a few moments the robots began dropping tidbits off for us too first there were a couple of net bags containing some of those things like green plums i remembered from my interrogation days then a wine sack then two lumps of that pink dough they didnt hand them to us they attached them somehow to the cables we were clinging to i didnt see how exactly because i was trying to figure out what was going on up in the highrent district the greatmothers party wasnt singing anymore the least grandson seemed to have left the group but i could see beert and the greatmother talking to each other necks intertwined in deep conversation i was pretty sure what they were talking about it was me every once in a while one or both of them would dart their heads in my direction but what was being said i couldnt guess i could only hope that it had nothing to do with my destruction of valuable horch machinery at the eight plus threes pirraghiz interrupted my fairly apprehensive thoughts about that by poking my shoulder eat she said that was easier said than done i didnt see how i could hang on to the cable and eat at the same time pirraghiz solved the problem for me she had linked herself to the cable with one of her lesser arms now she took a firm hold of my leg with another thus safely mooring me while she finished picking over the goodies the robots had left us with a couple more having six arms certainly had its points she drew me close enough to hear her over the noise of the singing which was getting even more boisterous you can eat this she said offering me a lump of the pink dough some of the fruits too after i pick the seeds out not the liquid not anything else the pink stuff was warm and soft and smelled a little like garlic i nibbled at it to be polite although i was hungry i still had the hope in my heart now dwindlingly faint that before long i would be where i could get a thick steak with french fries and a few slices of red ripe tomatoes and maybe even a bottle of beer look pirraghiz said sounding surprised what she was pointing at was the least grandson rapidly swinging himself in our direction looking as though he had something to talk to us about he did as soon as he was near he announced importantly i have solved the problem of the order of battletheoretically provided it is allowed to occur listen attentively he didnt have to say that i was doing it already he settled himself in close to my head and stared into my eyes there are three eights and two of the vessels on your planet he informed me one is considerably larger than the others so we will not attack that one to one of the smaller ones first we will send in two waves of fighting machines two at a time i had thought he said meditatively of perhaps using a pair of the warriors of the others as a deception tactic for the first wave he surprised me you have some of their warriors of course quite a few were still alive though wounded when this place was taken most did not survive but some did even after questioning later when they had been removed from the control of the others the greatmother gave them to me as pets i possess a number of such creatures he told me proudly i study them to learn what lesser organisms are like so as to be prepared for dealing with them at the eschaton perhaps sometime i will show some of them to you this particular lesser organism was getting impatient i coughed to get him back on track that would be nice but about your plan yes the order of battle i decided against using the organic warriors since they are no longer controlled they have become quite cowardly and i do not trust their fighting skills so we will use our machines in the first two waves then you and your uhassociatehe was looking at pirraghizwill go in the third transmission also armed with copies of your projectile weapons by then the fighting machines should have neutralized whatever forces the others have in place not many i think the others will not expect us to bother them in a place like that then you will be free to act as you wish i was rapturously hanging on every word then he brought me down assuming of course that the greatmother gives such orders i believe she and djabeertapritch of the two eights are discussing it now he twisted his neck to look in her direction then he said in sudden alarm i believe she is getting ready to speak i must go i will talk to you further later on that is i will if the project still seems feasible i could have wished for fewers ifs and maybes but i could feel my heart speeding up pirraghiz was looking at me curiously she had certainly heard every word but if she wanted to say something about the exchange she didnt have a chance because just then the singing stopped at some signal i hadnt caught everyone was silent even the robots paused in their rounds for a moment as the greatmother began to speak nestmates and honored guest she begani noticed the honored guest was in the singular pirraghiz and i were not included we rejoice at this time at the reunion of a lost nest with the grand consortium of the horch we are greatly and most pleasantly surprised to have djabeertapritch descendant of our people of the two eights with us i have made him a promise which i will keep at this celebration she darted a coquettish look in beerts direction what i have not decided she went on sounding like a teasing santa claus with a young child on his lap is whether it is better to prolong his suspense a bit longer or to reveal the surprise to him now that brought on murmurs from the audience i could hear that some of them were saying now while others said no make him wait and a fair number were speaking what i took to be jocular obscenities but they were all laughing about it even the greatmother the greatmother bent her neck to her least grandson who was tugging at her arm i noticed that kofeeshtetch was hanging upside down relative to her but she didnt seem to carewell that didnt matter as much for the horch as it would for us since their heads could go every which way then she lifted her head giggling my least grandson asks to have the surprise now she announced djabeertapritch do you agree beert wasnt doing any of the laughing seemed to have something serious on his mind but he rose to the occasion i will be pleased with whatever pleases the greatmother he said diplomatically yes of course very well this surprise is a very great fool djabeertapritch she was unwise enough to come to this place after the fighting had begun and we did not allow her to leave the greatmother paused for dramatic effect then issued an order to the robots bring the prisoner in chapter thirtyfour every horch head in the banquet hall turned toward one of the vertices of the tetrahedron where the diners were scrambling to get out of the way they needed to for what entered was a procession first came a fighting machine in full combat alert backing into the room with its weapons trained on what followed that was a couple a christmas tree chained to a creature with spindly legs and arms and a head like a jackolantern another fighting machine brought up the rear also with dead aim on the captive i knew what she was at once i was in the presence of one of the others one of dopeys beloved leaders a member of the species that at this very moment was casually deciding whether it would be more advantageous to annihilate everyone i knew and loved or turn them into abject slaves when pirrzghiz put one worried arm on me i realized i was shaking i gave her a nod to reassure her but i couldnt stop i wasnt the only one affected for most of the horch this poor captive was old news but not for beert his neck and both arms were stretched out toward her frozen motionless and his little snake mouth was open in shock the greatmother made that choking staccato sound that was a horch laugh well djabeertapritch she said delighted with her effect how do you like your surprise would you like to speak to her ask her some questions about how it feels to be a captive as you were to her people he managed to make a slow negative shake of his head but that was it the female beloved leader was not so reluctant she turned that great round scarecrow head toward beert and spoke through her huge teeth i excrete into the mouth of your greatmother she said in a shrill piping venomous voice i will do the same to all of you when the eschaton comes and you organisms are all shrieking in pain as we trample you under our feet she was speaking perfect horch far better than beerts farmboy drawl i saw the reason one of those ribbed golden scabs tucked under the swell of the pumpkin where it joined the skinny neck when she leaned forward to hiss at beert i saw too that the last link of the chain that held her to the christmas tree had actually been grafted into her flesh they were taking no chances with this representative of the ultimate enemy the greatmother was switching her head about ominously i thought for a moment there was going to be a major hissing match between the two of them if not something more physical beert prevented it he spoke up prisoner he said the greatmother called you a fool but you are an even bigger fool than you know you will not win we horch are stronger and braver and wiser than you and even the lower species are going to rise against you he turned to the greatmother have i permission to speak now she graciously waved her neck in assent and he began to talk i hung there in suspense almost dreading to hear what he was going to say he began i speak to you from the belly revered greatmother and to all you horch of the four and ones i am djabeertapritch of the two eights which is no more that was a letdown for me right there beert wasnt delivering any casual talk it was an oration i was willing to bet that the son of a bitch had been rehearsing it to himself all along discouraged i slumped back waiting for him to get to a point but i was the only one in the room who felt that way every one of the horch had stopped their foolery and were listening with their little mouths wideopen beert seemed to intend to give the whole history of his nest when the horch came to the two eights they slew us by the sixteens of sixteens of sixteens most cruelly and treacherously well i had heard all of that and about how the survivors had been taken to the prison planet and what happened to them there however the four and ones were eating it up they hissed and moaned when he spoke of how people from their nest had been studied and used for experimental purposes and when he came to their rescue by the eight plus threes there were scattered cheers i might have cheered myself because that was when he got to what i wanted to hear then our little nest was free at last as were the members of those other species whom the others had imprisoned there and it is of those other species that i would speak revered greatmother now he had my full attention all right some of you have seen the wet one whom we have helped return to his own planet to do battle with the others who have enslaved it his species was fortunatea little fortunatebecause their planet still exists not all were that lucky you all know the species of the large one with many limbshis neck was outthrust toward pirraghizbecause some of them were here when you bravely captured this place their fate may be the worst of all not only were they compelled for a long long time to be the servants of the others but their planet is long lost the planet of the fourlimbed one whose name is dan is yet free but perhaps not for long the others have already begun to infiltrate it dan wishes to be returned there so that he can help fight them off he hesitated eyeing me with a look i couldnt interpret then he said dans are a simple people greatmother their machines are crude they have little wisdom and they are not a peaceful race i say only of them that their people are divided among themselves with many nations which make their own customs and laws and sometimes actually go to war with each other shocked stir among the horch beert went bravely on overriding the mutterings nevertheless they do not deserve to be made slaves of the others it is not their fault that their limbs are stiff and their brains are imprisoned in a box of bone on their necks they are not animals their brains are in some ways almost the equal of our own so i ask you to help him in this cause revered greatmother andhe hesitated then got it outi ask you for more than that i wish to go with him myself to do what i can to prevent what happened to my planet from happening to his greatmother will you grant me this wish when beert finished speaking there was a stir among the assembled horch our nearest neighbors craned their necks to study pirraghiz and me curiously silently at first then not so silent one of them abruptly clapped his hinged feeding dish against his belly armor then another did then they were all doing it rhythmically like the kind of wewantatouchdown thing that people do at football games and then they began to sing again first one or two then the whole damn collection of them at once i dont think it was the same song i had heard before but i wasnt paying attention to the words i was staring at beert the guy had taken me by surprise not only had he chosen not to denounce me as a capricious destroyer of horch machines but what was this about coming to earth with us that had never been part of the plan i realized pirraghiz was shaking my leg i blinked at her the greatmother is beckoning us she whispered i think she wants us to come to her they were all looking at us as a matter of fact even the greatmother as soon as i was close she darted her head at mine inspecting me at close range far more thoroughly than before but i was looking at the female other at close range i could see that the creature had not had an easy life lately her clothing was smudged and torn and there were recent scars on the bulbous pumpkin face as pirraghiz set me down not two meters away the other rattled her chains and hissed venomously at me the greatmother didnt even look at her i tire of this filths presence she said to the air remove her as the crystal robots were dragging the other away the greatmother twisted her neck to look at beert you are determined to do this she asked to risk your life for the sake of some lower organisms he didnt look at me i am determined he said then she sighed it will be done my least grandson has prepared a plan which we will follow and added you are very brave djabeertapritch and so he was in more ways than the greatmother knew part eight going home chapter thirtyfive when the greatmother said do it she didnt mean do it on tuesday she didnt even mean do it when the feast was over kofeeshtetch disappeared at once promising to meet us at the transit machine and then it was maybe five minutes before a pair of christmas trees came charging along the cords to drag me and beert away pirraghiz following cheers broke out as we left and then another burst of raucous song i was glad enough not to have to stay for that we stopped by the rooms to collect beerts personal glass robot that was useful since it gave me a chance to pick up my little mesh bag of horch goodies beert gave me a dark look but didnt say anything and we were at the transit machine long before kofeeshtetch and the troops our christmas trees deserted us then to fiddle with the machine and i finally got the chance to ask beert the question on my mind why beert why are you coming with us he swung his face partly toward mine then away to the air he said i want to be able to go back to my own nest that didnt make sense why not just jump in that thing and go home this time he did look at me and if i did that what would i tell my greatmother that i turned loose somebody who had destroyed a horch machine with a bag of horch material and no way to know what you do with it no dan i cant go home yet though i wish with all my belly i could but i began trying to be reasonable but then i ran out of time for being reasonable as kofeeshtetch made his entrance the kid had an entourage with him not only the four deadly horch fighting machines but a large ugly alien which had four or five tiny different aliens clinging to his fur i had seen them in pictures before but never alive the bashfuls and the happies as the comics had named them on earth i promised to show you my other species kofeeshtetch said proudly this large being is a warrior of the others the little ones are used for delicate work by them do not fear the warrior he added kindly he has been freed of his bondage and will do you no harm kofeeshtetch allowed us a moment to admire his menagerie then waved them off and gave one of the robots his orders then he turned to us and got down to business he extended one arm toward the tv which the robot had made to display the globe of earth again and said of the three eights and two vessels of the others which are on your planet i have chosen this one for your mission i looked where he was pointing the thing was down in the gulf ofaqaba of all places i demanded why he looked almost embarrassed it is not near any of the others also i liked the look of that funnylooking land mass no i said strongly and then remembered to add please do you remember what djabeertapritch said about our many independent countries well that ones in the wrong country i stabbed at the map in the vague direction of the east coast of the united states over here would be better can you enlarge this part of the globe the christmas tree did and i saw the eastern seaboard swell up before me there were four or five of those ruddy dots between florida and newfoundland the bestlooking one was not far from the alligator shape of long island as close to the bureau headquarters in virginia as i could get i pointed at it that one please oh very well kofeeshtetch said sulkily and gave an order to the christmas tree by the machine which began to fiddle with the controls anyway he said brightening now it is time remember the order of battle these two fighters first they have their orders then two more to mop up then you djabeertapritch withahthe dan i wish you all good luck pirraghiz stirred wait a minute she said im going too also djabeertapritch will want his own personal robot with him kofeeshtetch gave her an angry look it is very foolish to make trivial changes in a battle plan just before the engagement he complained but it would be better that way beert said his tone placating perhaps my robot could go with the second wave of fighting machines then us then no djabeertapritch pirraghiz said firmly i will go before you we do not know what the conditions will be when we arrive kofeeshtetch looked at beert who nodded agreement then gave up all right he said now if youre ready first wave go it was the quietest beginning of a battle i can imagine the first two fighters entered the machine the door closed it opened again the second wave entered with beerts christmas tree it closed as pirraghiz was going into the machine i checked my twentyshots one in each hand then i remembered something oh kofeeshtetch you were going to tell me what this installation was for he blinked his little snake eyes at me his mind clearly changing gears he threw a look at the transit machine already yawning open for beert and me you are upsetting the timetable he said pettishly why the installation is for the eschaton of course now go chapter thirtysix it was peaceful when we got into the transit machine it wasnt when we got out whatever we had arrived ina chamber the size of an eighteenwheeler truck metal walls filled with displays and gadgetsit stank partly it smelled of scorched protein like an ancient fishandchips store after a long busy winter night when nobody had cared to open a window partly it smelled of seared metal and destruction it looked that way too the fighting seemed to be over though most of our firstwave fighting machines had already become sizzling junk in the first quick glance i saw an unfamiliar doc with a copper blanket over his headi recognized my goodies baga distraught dopey perched at one end of the chamber and a couple of dead beloved leader warriorbashfuls the place was suffocatingly hot and it was noisier than i would have believed most of the noise didnt come from the crackling metal or the whimpering dopey perched at one end of the compartment as he gazed with horror at the horch beert the deafening part came from my friend pirraghiz bafflingly she was shrieking at the top of her lungs a long meowing garble in her own impenetrable language she sounded either terrified or in pain i swore to myself in alarm and staggered toward her in the sudden earth gravity looking for the wound that was causing her such agony there didnt seem to be any still screaming she shook me off at the same time gesturing to the strange doc with the copper blanket over his head i had no idea what she wanted from him but after a moment he did wounded as he wasone of his lesser arms was terribly burnedhe limped over to the control boards and quickly played his clawed hands over the colored dots when the doc said something to pirraghiz she stopped screaming at once and gave him a quick hug of greeting then she bent to examine his burned arm and tsktsked over itin her case it was actually a sort of bupbup soundbefore she turned to me wrahrrgherfoozhi think thats what she said the docs name wasneeds attention i fear he may lose that arm i must try to help him well sure i said but what was all the screaming about pirraghiz was already delicately probing the skin around the docswell shoulder at least around the little bony bump where his burned lesser arm joined his torso her full attention was on his injuries and she didnt look up i didnt want the others to know what was happening she said still gently working away on him so as soon as the machines and i got him neutralized with the mesh i turned off the scrambler and began to screamyelling that there were explosions water was coming in all that sort of thing my intention was to make the others believe we had some kind of a terrible accident she explained then as you saw we turned off the communicator and the transit machine is that all right it was a hell of a lot better than all right i wished i had thought of it myself what i said was an inadequate thank you she spared me a quick glance yes but dannerman what do we do now that was what i needed to figure out it was great to be back on earth again but i was still a long way from arlington i took a moment to get a better idea of what i had to work with the horch fighting machines had been surgically efficient in their assault as far as i could tell none of the fittings of the sub had been damaged but i didnt see much that was helpful there had been two beloved leader warriors on the sub both now dead there had been four horch fighting machines three of which were now scrap the bashfuls had put up a pretty good fight before they died beerts personal robot seemed unharmed so did the dopey who had stopped his terrified whining and was staring from one to the other of us as pirraghiz and i talked there was something i needed to know about that dopey so watching him what i said to pirraghiz was the first thing we do is kill the dopey so he cant make any trouble pirraghiz stiffened in surprise the dopey didnt he just kept looking back and forth at the two of us with an occasional frightened glance at beert even his tail plume didnt change color so either he was a wonderful actor or he didnt understand the horch language we were speaking as pirraghiz began to object i said cancel that i pointed to the wounded doc can he drive this thing she gave me a strange look but then she mewed at the doc and he mewed back yes he can wrahrrgherfoozh is engineer for this vessel he can operate any part of it but he wants to know where to drive to another good question if i can see some kind of a map ill tell him more mewing then the locators are turned off dannerman she reported they are part of the communication system while i was absorbing the notion that we were somewhere in the atlantic ocean and blind she added however wrahrrgherfoozh says it is possible for him to alter the system to receive only and not to transmit but that will take some time that lifted a huge weight from my soul tell him to do it then he is badly hurt dannerman i do not think we can save that arm that was when beert spoke up he had been quietly talking to his christmas tree and he said dan i have used my machine to work on many devices of the others perhaps it can help i looked at pirraghiz can it and when she nodded then tell them to get on with it i mean please the christmas tree scuttled over to the board pirraghiz explained to the doc what was going on and i had my first chance to say anything to beert he was standing silent his head darting this way and that his arms slumped by his side he looked dejected i said beert listen im sorry that i got you into this he turned the head toward me but all he said was yes there was nothing to be done for the dead warriors the one surviving fighting machine was poking at the ruins of the other three but it didnt look like they were going to be repairable for a good long time if ever by then the dopey had managed to collect himself he fixed his little kitten eyes on me and spoke up sprechensie deutsch he asked he was looking at me panamayoo paruski parlezvous i cut him off try english he switched at once gazing at me intently i must ask why are you here do you have any understanding of what fate awaits you for daring to bring a filthy horch into a vessel of the beloved leaders they have to catch us first i said it was oddly pleasing to be speaking my own language again even with this creature but they surely will he said reasonably then it will be terrible for you you have only one chance to avoid the worst of the punishment and that is to destroy the horch and his machine with that projectile weapon of yours at once and then forget it i said but i put it more strongly what i mean is shut up ill talk to you later but if you dont keep quiet now i will turn you over to the filthy horch that didnt stop him either i turned my back on his arguments and spoke in his own language to beert do you think you could get your fighter to scare him not kill him just make him be quiet beerts head lifted to gaze at me then you dont really want him killed of course i dont beert what use is he dead i want him alive to be interrogated do you think i would actually murder an unarmed person he gazed at me in silence for a moment then he said i was not sure chapter thirtyseven it didnt take the doc and the christmas tree as long as i feared to get some of the systems running and then the wall over the controls blossomed into a display a golden dot marked our position there werent any other dots nearby which i thought was good and at the top of the picture was an irregular mass which i took to be the coast i grunted at him as i tried to figure out what to do back in those new jersey summers with uncle cubby my parents had sometimes taken me out for a fishing trip in uncle cubbys seldomused cabin cruiser i wished i had paid more attention to the charts what i saw looked nothing like any coastline i remembered then i saw one of the problems i was accustomed to maps in which up was always north evidently the beloved leaders had no such prejudice i guessed the land had to be east andonce i craned my neck to peer at it sidewise and got the doc to widen the viewit made sense island that forked at one end like an alligators opened jaws narrow body of water behind it and then the mainlandlong island i announced great that water over on the left has to be new york bay thats where we want to go tell the doc pirraghiz she didnt move right away she was looking at me puzzledly again so was beert and i realized i had used the english names for what i saw since the horch language didnt have any when i explained to them that new york bay was one of the busiest harbors on earth and we would have no trouble making contact there beert swung his neck around closer to me first answer a question for me dan what will you do when you get there call the bureau i said promptly see if they can get this sub under wraps before the others can see what were doing i stopped there what i had just said didnt sound right to me before i could figure out what it was beert went on and then to tell the truth i hadnt thought much about that then especially about what then would mean for him and pirraghiz why i said i guess well let the bureau figure out what to do next what you mean he said meditatively is that you will turn this vehicle and us over to your human spy organization who will question us and no doubt do their best to copy its technology both others and horch i guess thats about the size of it i admitted he sighedthat shrill horch whistle of released breath that meant resignation he didnt say anything he just nodded to pirraghiz who spoke to wrahrrgherfoozh the doc touched only a few dots on the board but i felt the results at once the submarine was turning and beginning to accelerate the picture on the wall whirled to a new orientation and we were beginning to go home that felt good it felt like things were going to work out after all it even felt as though i were going to get that steak before long and sleep that night in a real bed and maybe even see pat but we werent there yet the air fresheners had removed a certain amount of the stench from the sub and things were quieting down cowed by the horch fighting machine looming over him the dopey was still mutteringbut softly and to himself pirraghiz and the other doc were in close conversation with each other it looked as though they had left the navigation to beerts christmas tree beert himself was standing by the control board gazing at the changing display that showed where we were moving i didnt think he was seeing it though his neck was waving a slow sine as though he were deep in thought when he saw me looking at him he turned his head toward me i have reasoned out he announced that your order to kill the little one was a ruse of some kind not an actual intention thats right beert it was a trick i admitted we bureau agents are full of tricks but listen beert i dont mean to trick you when we get to the bureau they will know how much we all owe to you and pirraghiz because ill damn sure make sure they understand i will be grateful for that he said sadly and made me feel like a rat or more accurately made me feel that he was feeling the way i had when the horch machines were working me over alone depressed pretty near hopeless and all of it my fault there wasnt anything i could do about it though i tried to take his mind off it by changing the subject listen beert ive been meaning to ask you what did kofeeshtetch mean about the nexus thing helping the eschaton it didnt cheer him up he gave me a threesnake shrug perhaps it is something to be used when the eschaton comes yeah but i said nothing physical is going to survive to the eschaton is it isnt everything supposed to go back into a kind of a point at the big crunch so how would they get it there without its turning into a mess of quarks or something he shrugged again i do not know the cousins have not yet shared that kind of knowledge with me pirraghiz didnt know either neither did the wounded doc if the dopey knew he wasnt telling i added that to the lengthening list of questions i was not likely to get answers to any time soon anyway other things were beginning to jostle for attention in my mind like pat very much like pat i was deeply excitingly aware that every minute that passed was getting me closer and closer to the minute when i could actually see and touch her again and although that was fine it wasnt all fine another itchy little needle of reality was beginning to force itself upon me pat already had a dan dannerman what was she going to do with me as we approached new yorks lower bay i got one more of those nasty little stabs of reality pirraghiz assured me that the other doc had assured her that yes it would be possible to bring the sub close enough to the surface to be awash and yes there was a hatch that i could use to get out of and then well then what should i do wave to a passing staten island ferry and hitch a ride to shore use a flashlightif i could find anything like a flashlightto send a message in morse codeif i could remember the morse codeto well to whom and what about security the subs display was really great stuff i could see the wideopen mouth of the bay coney island on one side sandy hook on the other i could see little splotches that had to be ellis island and liberty island i could even see the long old piers that stuck out into the hudson from every side and i could also see objects moving around that i supposed were tankers and cruise liners and excursion boats and what was i going to be doing about them not to mention any us coast guard stuff that might be patrolling against just such a horch sub as ourselves no doubt the human race had figured out that the beloved leaders had sneaked in underwater vessels that had given them the opportunity to kidnap and bug a lot of mariners according to wrahrrgherfoozh the horch stealth capabilities were a lot more effective than any primitive human sonars but i didnt want to take the chance of being depthbombed by some jumpy lieutenant in a coast guard corvette i studied the display change of plan i said both beert and pirraghiz turned to me pirraghizs expression wondering beerts merely resigned i dont think wed better get into all that traffic i told them better if we can find some quiet bay somewhere along the shore show me whats downhere i put my finger on the barrier island that began around the highlands and went south why did i pick there i dont know maybe i thought we might just pull in at uncle cubbys old boat dock and knock on his door i didnt think it long uncle cubby was long dead i had no idea who owned his house and didnt want to investigate theres a bay i said pointing between the sea bright barrier island and the shore lets take a look chapter thirtyeight it wasnt a bay it was the mouth of a river that i had forgotten about but that was just as good slowly and carefully the christmas tree piloted us upstream on this nice wide river with no boats visible anywhere on its surface i never took my eyes off the display not far ahead i saw something that stretched clear across the river which worried me for a moment a dam so wed have to go back and try again but it was a bridge and off to one side of it was a system of docks with small objects moored to them a boat basin thatll do i said hoping i was right in fact it did very well the christmas tree brought us to the surface the robot opened the hatch and i climbed out into a cold wetbut earthlydrizzle i saw lights up on the road i found a little driveway that led up to them and when i was at street level there right across the road was a large and lighted seafood restaurant when i was inside the cashier gave me a thoroughly funny lookreasonably enough i was tattered unwashed and long unshavenbut she pointed me to a telephone anyway there was a scattering of diners in the place curiously most of them in uniform they were staring at me too i turned my back on them naturally i had no encryption facilities i didnt even have a payment card and the restaurants smells of good hot human food were driving me crazy but i managed to get a collect call through to the bureau in arlington the duty officer must have thought i was crazy too but she listened as i talked this is senior agent james daniel dannerman calling im the one thatahi tried to figure out how to put itthe one you havent seen for quite a while because ive been away a long way away relay this information immediately to colonel hilda morrisey or deputy director marcus pell i require immediate pickup and a full squad to take charge of important assets there was a moments silence while she thought that over i thought brigadier morrisey was dead she said doubtfully i dont know which shook me up more hilda dead or hilda a brigadier but i didnt have time to think about it tell somebody in authority at once i ordered and got the restaurant cashier to tell me where i was so i could pass it along and most of all i finished tell them no shooting i guess she did pass the word along because in about twenty minutes half the helicopters in the world seemed to be jockeying to land in the restaurant parking lot and i could hear sirens coming toward us from the highway its amazing what the bureau can do when it puts its mind to it although the gaggle of bureau people who popped out of the first two choppers claimed to be from the new york office i didnt know a soul among them but they knew me jesus dannerman how the hell many of you guys are there anyway one of them asked wonderingly and didnt wait for an answer never mind lets get some damage control going here they did faster than i would have believed possible the next few choppers of federal police and the coopted local cops had the place sealed off they blocked the bridge at both ends with roadblocks on our side to keep anybody from getting near the boat basin a couple of uniformed noncoms were going from table to table in the restaurant to tell the late diners that everything was all right they just couldnt leave just yet because there was a boat down there with a leaky fuel tank and they didnt want anybody hurt in a possible explosion they were erecting screens around the sub itself and a bureau colonel named makalanos this one by then already up from arlington was on the phone to arrange for a navy submarine to tow the horch ship to a secure place underwater it was this colonel makalanos who got back into the sub with me i dont know what he had expected to find but his eyes popped when he saw the dopey the docs the horch machines and beert mother of god he whispered and then pulled himself together tell the meows and those other things whats going on dannerman he ordered theyll all go with the sub and ill put a couple of guards on board too you no not you dannerman im taking you straight to arlington so you can explain all this to the deputy director i dont know what beert had expected either he didnt say he just listened while i told him what the colonel wanted his neck down around his midsection his head tipped upward to regard me sorrowfully ill come back to you as soon as i can i promised just dont let the machines do anything all right he didnt answer that he had stopped looking at me and was staring at the four husky bureau people who were climbing in their weapons at the ready ah beert i said listen everybodys going to be really grateful to you for your help against the others itll be all right he twisted his neck to look at me again i hope that is so he said part nine home at last chapter thirtynine twentyfour hours later i wasnt so enthusiastic about the bureaus efficiency because they had spent those hours very efficiently questioning me they did it in relays three or four of them at a time and they questioned me hard they didnt give up a thing in return either no matter how much i begged to be told what was happening here on earth or what they were doing with beert and pirraghiz or the sub or anything it took me right back to those good old days with the christmas trees and the helmet this time my interrogators werent causing me any actual physical pain true but you know interrogation is interrogation whoever does it if the interrogators are really serious about it its no fun at all for the party being interrogated the place i was in was what we called the pit of pain one of the bureaus interrogation chambers they had me and the interrogators down in the bare little working space where the action took place a table and a few straightbacked chairs and nothing else i knew there were people observing us in the gallery seats that surrounded the pit but i couldnt see them they were hidden behind the oneway mirror walls the first question the bureaus goons asked me was whats that thing on your neck they didnt like the look of it and they didnt like my answer either when i said it was just so i could understand horch not a bit like those beloved leader spy bugs they werent believing a word of it they suspended questioning for a moment just left me with the interrogators glowering at me in silence until someone came back with a couple of strips of coppery mesh which they wound around my head and neck then they wanted to know everything and i mean everything starting with when the dopey and i popped out of the transit machine the questioning was pretty much nonstop they did let me pee a couple of timesnot giving me any decent privacy while i did it of course a bureau goon stood alertly behind me every minute in case i had some kind of evil trick to play with the urinal they even let me eat once or twice dry ham sandwiches that looked as though theyd been salvaged from somebodys lunch meeting and black coffee out of the same urn the interrogators used it was not the homecoming meal i had been dreaming about what they wouldnt let me do at all was sleep when i began getting woozy they handed me a glass of tepid water and a couple of those bureauissue wakeup pills the things woke me right up but i would rather have got horizontal even the christmas trees had been kinder than that i thought id seen the woman who handed me the wakeup pills around the headquarters before i pressed my luck while i was still swallowing i asked her what about my friends in the sub are they all right she might have answered she opened her mouth as though she intended to but one of the other interrogators shouldered her aside he took the glass from my hand and said dont worry about your buddies were taking care of them now tell us about these horch that you say are good guys so i told them about the two eights and their nest and why they were different from the cousin horch it kept going until along about the third or fourth wakeup pill there was a change my interrogators all stopped talking at once turning toward the mirror wall i knew why theyd all heard something on their little earphones at once a little door in the wall opened someone i knew walked in looking both irritated and grim it was the way deputy director marcus pell usually looked i stood up and offered him a hand to shake im agent dannerman i told him the deputy director didnt answer at first he ignored the hand and took one of the straightbacked chairsits previous occupant getting up and out of the way fastand regarded me for a moment that remains to be seen he said how do we know youre who you say you are i guessed fingerprints retinal scan i think i was getting a little lightheaded by then regardless of the pills not good enough he said judiciously i understand the scarecrows can make an exact copy of anybody or anything they like you could be a scarecrow brain wearing a human body for all i know im not i said wearily and couldnt help adding for that matter so could you he didnt take offense he just nodded and said i think we need confirmation of your identity brigadier morrisey come in please the door that opened this time wasnt to the auditorium seats it was the one that allowed suspects and interrogators to get in and out from the corridors outside in a moment a clumsylooking thing like a whiteenameled kitchen refrigerator on wheels rolled in i frowned at it puzzled about what the deputy director was bringing this big metal thing in for annoyed because it was blocking my view i couldnt see my old boss hilda morrisey at all even when the thing rolled up close to me and i could see the door behind it closing again there was no sign of hilda then a voice that i knew came out of the box tell me danno what was the name of the kraut broad from the mad king ludwigs you were shacking up with oh my god i said hilda they told me you were dead what the hell are you doing in that thing itshecame to a full stop right across the table from me there was nothing that looked human about the box it had no face only a rectangle of mirror glass at head height i could not see what was behind it but the voice was hildas all righta little fainter than i was used to a little breathier but definitely hilda im not quite dead danno i got shot up a little is all and the reason im still alive is that ive got this box to keep me going answer the question evidently we wouldnt be catching up on each others news for a while you mean use i asked last name too she ordered i cudgeled my memory keinwasser something like that i never heard her real name until somebody i think it was you told me about it after she was arrested and i wasnt paying a lot of attention if you remember i was in intensive care at the time she didnt comment just rapped out the name of my sergeant when you were working on the dope ring in new york uh mcevoy he was a master sergeant but i dont know his first name your mothers birthday and when i told her that she wanted the names of all my fellow lodgers in rita gummidges rooming house and the date of my promotion to senior agent and the address of the little theater in coney island where my then girlfriend anita berman worked as ticket clerk when she didnt have a part in whatever play they were doing at the time hilda was thoroughmaybe a little more thorough than the deputy director enjoyed because he was drumming his fingers on the table before she was through then she turned the big box to face him looks all right as far as i can tell marcus she said cautiously well get a better fix when the other witness gets here i suggest we let him get some sleep she caught the deputy director in the middle of a yawn of his own he suppressed it and said very well put him in a cell that didnt sound good to me or to hilda we can do better than that marcus she said if hes him hes entitled to a little something ive reserved one of the vip suites downstairs for him i think because he was too sleepy to object pell only shrugged put a double guard on it now take him away the vip suites were what they sounded like plush little accommodations for highranking or otherwise important visitors who might need to be put up temporarily by the bureau they had comfortable beds and private baths and all the fixings i didnt pay much attention to the niceties though i fell into the sack and wakeup pills or none in two minutes i was gone when i woke up there was an orderly standing by my bed a coffee tray in his hand they want you to be ready to leave for another destination shortly agent dannerman there are clean clothes hanging behind the bathroom door of course i asked him what this other destination i was supposed to be leaving for was but the door was already closing behind him by the time i got the question out i swallowed one whole cup of the coffee scalding as it was and headed for the shower while i was dressing i got my first good look at myself in a human mirror i looked skinny and the beard id grown in captivity needed either trimming or shaving off entirely i wasnt sure which i was a good many months behind a haircut too i came out of the bathroom wondering absently if the bureau was going to have a barber wherever i was going a woman was standing by my unmade bed not just any woman this one had the face and form of the one i had been dreaming about i gaped at her unbelievingly pat i croaked that seemed to annoy her actually im patrice she said the pat youre talking about is over at camp smolley and by the way you might be interested to know that shes married now married to you as a matter of fact she didnt give me time to absorb that but went right on listen im starved put your babushka back on and lets get some breakfast while we talk chapter forty i hadnt had anywhere near enough sleep and the question of what the bureau was doing with beert and pirraghiz and the sub hung heavy in my mind but right then not very heavy because i had more personal things to distract me partly it was the presence of patrice adcock she was a lot cleaner and betterdressed than the last time id seen her with her more or less reddish hair curled around her pretty face and looking so exactly like pat that i had to remind myself that she wasnt really pat that was confusing and i had too many other things on my mind to want to be confused about the woman i loved the other part of it was food i didnt hear any order given but almost immediately two bureau noncoms appeared at the door rolling in breakfast tables that were covered with hot plates and cold i think the meal must have been prepared in the deputy directors private kitchen because it was fine there were eggs four of them lightly fried with their perfect golden yolks staring up at me hash browns crisp and oniony a liter or so of orange juice that had obviously been squeezed within the hour crisp bacon cracklycrusted sausages pancakes with melted butter and hot syrup dribbling down their sides more coffeemore of everything in fact it was the precise kind of meal i had been dreaming about for a long time the metalmesh babushka kept getting in the way of my mouth but i didnt let that slow me down i managed to get down a good share of everything in sight as we talked while patrice contented herself with picking at some toast and half a papaya the reason im here she told me is they wanted somebody who knew you to check you out and who better than me so lets get down to it what was the name of uncle cubbys cat that made me grin with my mouth full of sausage starting right out with trick questions are we patrice uncle cubby didnt have a cat grandma dannerman was allergic to them the cook had a little yellow dog but it wasnt ever allowed out of the servants quarters i think its name was molly she made a face at me was it i dont remember so tell me how old you were when we first met and what rooms we had in uncle cubbys house so i told her that and when she went on to ask told her what it was like to swim in the muddybottomed river below the house and the names of uncle cubbys servants or as many of them as either of us could remember and what games we used to play except that when i started to mention the games she and i had played under uncle cubbys big front porch she cleared her throat and changed the subject well i knew why that was i had no doubt that every word we spoke and every expression on our faces was monitored so that the bureaus gumshoes watching us wouldnt miss a thing and there were things patrice didnt choose to discuss in front of strangers by the time i had reached the point where i couldnt eat any more she had run out of questions all right she said and looked away she spoke to the air hilda if hes a fake hes a damn good one come on in the door opened at once and hildas mobile life support rolled in the big white box stopped right in front of me so she could take another good look at my face but when she spoke it was to patrice youre sure about him patrice shrugged as sure as i can be in twenty minutes i think its him all right hilda meditated for a moment then sighed all right patrice but youd better come along with us to doublecheck the choppers waiting patrice frowned as if she might be about to object to the idea i didnt give her a chance all this talk about good times in the old days had put more urgent matters out of my mind but they came flooding back hold it i said whats happening with my friends and the sub and where are we going were going to camp smolley hilda informed me ever been there the old biowar research plant thats where the action is on trying to reverseengineer scarecrow artifacts these days my friends her voice got harsh i said the choppers waiting danno well see your pals when we get there the navy towed the sub to hampton roads for security reasons and now theyre flying it to smolley i stared at her that huge thing flying it but when i tried to ask her about it she wasnt patient anymore youll see when we get there now get your ass in gear chapter fortyone outside it was still dark and there were a few stars in the sky unusually for foggy cloudy northern virginia i didnt think it was going to stay dark for long i didnt have any good idea of the time but a full moon was down near the western horizon and daybreak couldnt be far away getting into the helicopter took a little longer than i would have guessed the problem was hildas lifesupport system we had to wait while they brought up the kind of lift they use to bring meals into passenger jets she rolled her white box onto the lift it elevated her she rolled onto the chopper two attendants guiding her then patrice and i were allowed to board the rotors began to turn before theyd finished strapping hilda down and we were airborne i had about a million more serious questionsreally serious oneson my mind but i couldnt help it first i had to clear up what she had said patrice you said pat was married as she was buckling herself in she paused to give me what struck me as an unsympathetic look i could not guess why pat one youre talking about yes shes definitely married to dan mm for mustache see thats what we call that particular dan because hes got a mustache hes the one who was with us on the prison planet and dan sthe cleanshaved one the one that never got therehes married too to that little girl you were romancing from the theater i guess all your other dans have been taking all your old girlfriends out of circulation while you were away she gave me a considering look i wasnt sure what was in her mind but what she said was maybe you should tidy up that beard a little and keep it for a while dan so we can tell you apart we could call you dan b for beard she went on to explain some of the other problems of nomenclature for all us identical copies she was still patrice just as rosaleen had named her back on the prison planet the pat i had been thinking of as my own particular pat was now called pat one the one who had been pregnant was still pat five and the pat who had been returned to earth with a bug in her head and never got to the prison planet with the rest of us had flatly refused to be given any number so she was called p j while she was telling me how to tell the pats apart by sight it had to do with the colors they worei remembered the important stuff i broke in on her explanations with what about the beloved leaders she looked startled then relaxed i havent heard them called that for a while the scarecrows we call them now what about them jesus patrice nobodys said a word about them but you must know theyre planning to kill off a lot of people whatever you call them why arent you worried she considered that for a moment well i do worry a little bit sometimes she admitted but not much the situation is under control dan honest the scarecrows call in every once in a whilelots of bluster warnings demands we let them come down to talk to usbut its just talk they sneaked in those damn submarines that caught a lot of people and bugged them a while agothe same way i was remember so they could use the people as spies but weve located most of those people and debugged them the scarecrows havent done anything aggressive since then not even their submarines i frowned how did you know they had subs on earth figured it out dan all the bugged people turned out to have been at sea the only scarecrow object from the scout ship landed in the sea had to be only she said without pleasure the damn things arent easy to find every navy in the worlds been looking no luck there was this one turkish destroyer that thought it had one and depthbombed it only it turned out to be an italian submarine but nobody ever actually saw onewell until you brought us yours i mean we dont even know how many of the things there areprobably at least a dozen twentysix i said twentyfive besides the one i brought in oh she said dampened well if youve got some way of locating them probably they could be depthbombed for real i stared at her are you crazy the subs arent the problem the belovthe scarecrow are the problem they can wipe us out any time they like she gave me a strangely indulgent look not really dan we know what theyre capable of dopey told us what he said she went on sounding a lot like a mother telling her twoyearold that there arent really any monsters under the bed was that the scarecrows could tweak a big nearearthpassing asteroid out of its orbit and dump it on the earth and kill us all that way you know like the old kt event that killed the dinosaurs well thats what threat watch is all about dan you dont know what threat watch is though do you its whats been keeping us busy at the observatory i was working there keeping track of all the findings when they called me about you every decent telescope in the world is searching for objects with orbits that can come anywhere near us weve mapped just about everything bigger than a panel truck for ten or twelve au in every direction whether theyre asteroids or comets or canttellwhich i promise theres absolutely nothing big thats in an orbit that can come anywhere near hitting us for a minimum of two years and there isnt any tweaking going on either threat watch hasnt found a single object that shows any signs of interference with its ballistic orbit i wasnt willing to be convinced all right but that isnt the only weapon theyve got patrice theyve turned some suns into novas she was smiling tolerantly at me our sun dan youre not much of an astrophysicist are you cant happen our sun isnt that kind of star she seemed so confident i stared at her youre sure as sure as i can be no the asteroid impact is the only scenario that makes sense and trust me weve definitely got at least two years grace on that one dan every observatorys computer models agree on that two years i thought about two years for a bit it was a lot better than no margin at all but i couldnt help asking and then she gave my hand a reassuring pat ah by then well be ready for them dan there are big new spaceships building all over the world fighters highmass ships with plenty of deltav and weapons i frowned so if the scarecrows nudge an asteroid well nudge it back better than that dan were going to go after the poppa i said fighters weve located the scarecrows scout ship and when were ready well go out and blow the damn thing up then well nudge any asteroid that looks like trouble out of the way she gave my arm a friendly squeeze its okay dan honest we havent just been sitting still and waiting for the bomb to hit well be ready when the time comes so that was good news right if patrice was correct and she sounded really sure of herself the human race wasnt just going to let itself be taken over or wiped out without a fightexactly as i had boasted to pirraghiz and beert but the funny thing was that it didnt feel as good as it ought to i mean to me personally what it felt like was that id been filling myself full of magnolious notions of coming back a hero to save the world and it wasnt looking that way at all the damn situation seemed to be saving itself just fine without me while all that was soaking in i felt the chopper change course a minute later the pilot got on the horn folks he said his voice sounding peculiarly amused were only a couple of i minutes from the camp smolley landing pad but theyve told us we have to orbit for a while there seems to be some tricky traffic ahead of us matter of fact if you look out of your lefthand windows you can probably see it as we turn we did look and boy we saw it all right id never seen anything like it in my life it was a giant blimpcopter shaped like an immense fat sausage its red and green lights blinking and it was settling down toward the earth i dont mean id never seen blimpcopters before actually id even been in one years earlier when we were retrieving some wreckage for evidence from a bombedout survivalist compound this one was a whole lot bigger in the early dawn light it looked like an airborne ocean liner and the funniest part was that slung under it was some other large thing that was shrouded in tarpaulins it took me a moment to figure it out but then i sucked in my breath my god i whispered thats my submarine up ahead hilda was complaining furiously to the pilot because the way her lifesupport box was strapped down she couldnt turn and look out i didnt blame her it was something to see the blimpcopter pilot seemed to be pretty good at his job slowly his whirly blades pulled the big bag down jockeying this way and that a meter or two at a time until his load was resting on a wheeled metal cradle between two low buildings then the aircraft sat there without moving for two or three minutes nothing seemed to be happening except that the envelope of the big sausage wrinkled and shrank a little almost invisibly if i hadnt seen a blimpcopter in action before i wouldnt have known what was going on but i was able to explain it to patrice who had loosened her seat belt and leaned over me to get a better look hes pumping some of the helium back into the highpressure tanks to cut the lift i said into her ear otherwise he wouldnt have neutral buoyancy when he lets go of the load and the rotors couldnt handle it wow she said craning her neck she was practically in my lap it had been a long time since i had had so much woman so close so warm and smelling so good i put my hand on her shoulderto steady herand she turned her head to look quizzically up at me i thoughtno i still thinkthat what had crossed her mind just then was something about kissing it certainly crossed mine kissing pat adcock had been a dream yearned for most thoroughly for a long time and now our lips were not much more than twenty centimeters apart they didnt get any closer she didnt move any nearer and neither did i she was pat adcock all right but she was a different pat adcock and i couldnt sort that out then the moment passed the pilot was already on the horn again okay people they say we can come in to land now make sure your seat belts are fastened will you and patrice straightened up and did as ordered so did i and that particular conundrum had to be set aside again the blimpcopter pilot had eased his big ship down another meter or two until the cables that held his load went slack workmen on the ground had quickly released them and the blimpcopter lifted and went sailing away into the sunrise i lost sight of it as our own pilot was setting us down on the pad a few dozen meters away while we were waiting for somebody to bring up a forklift to get hildas box to the ground i could see that the handlers had already hooked a little tractor to the cradle the sub was on they werent wasting any time the machine was pulling the whole thing sub and all into a cavernous loading dock the size of a hotel ballroom as soon as we were off the chopper a couple of bureau guards were waving us inside next to me patrice stumbled and frowned she was looking curiously toward the perimeter of camp smolley some sort of argument was going on there bureau guards and a couple of soldiers in unfamiliar blue berets yelling at each other but what the squabble was about i could not see the bureau people werent just beckoning us inside they were rushing us inside as soon as the sub and we were in the loading dock its big steel door folded itself down to shut us off from the outside world and the workmen began pulling the tarps off the submarine chapter fortytwo even in that moment i noticed something funny the workmen werent the usual uniformed grunts the bureau used for heavy lifting they were highranking officers i recognized some of them as upper brass from the arlington headquarters and they didnt seem to like being used as manual labor i didnt spend much time thinking about that there was something more important it was the first time id seen the whole scarecrow submarine exposed it didnt look a bit like any vessel id seen before when the tarps came off at one end of the sub they revealed a squaredoff stern with three great openings making a triangle looking like exhaust nozzles on a huge rocket there was neither propeller nor rudder at the bow end was a group of tightly nested jointed rods for what purpose i could not say a whitely gleaming squarish thing was between them it looked vaguely familiar but i couldnt quite place it the rest of the hull was featureless metal marked only by the hatch on the upper deck i heard my name called and turned around it was deputy director marcus pell looking recently slept and freshly bathed from behind me hildas voice said he wants you at the sub go i went the brigadiers and department subheads were rolling a wheeled ladder up to the subs side and pell was standing impatiently beside it up you go dannerman he snapped see if you can keep those freaks of yours from making any more trouble i did as ordered somewhat confused because i had no idea what kind of trouble pell was talking about then the people on the desk opened the hatch and it got a lot more confusing than that the first thing that came out of the sub was the stink worse than ever and with some unpleasant new ingredients added the second thing was a uniformed police lieutenant looking as if hed had a hard ride he glowered at me who the hell are you he demanded and didnt wait for an answer he turned to the deputy director who had followed me up is there somebody who can talk to those freaks they wouldnt let us touch the machinery at all then kept getting in dr evergoods way when she was trying to take care of the doc with the burned arm and and sergeant coughlan was airsick all the way here he finished bitterly that explained the new aroma it didnt explain the fact that the second person out of the sub was a portly black woman in a stained white smock whom id never seen before the deputy director didnt give me a chance to ask questions you heard what the lieutenant said dannerman he snapped get in there and straighten the freaks out as soon as i lowered myself inside beert and pirraghiz came clamoring around me for news and explanations give me a minute i beggedin horch of coursewhile i looked around part of the stink came from three bureauissue body bags stacked one on top of the otherfour body bags actually two bags had been put together to hold a larger carcass that would be the dead doc the other bags would be holding the bodies of the two dead scarecrow warriors another component of the stench was a couple of drying puddles of vomit on the floor just under the perch where the ships dopey was fastidiously shielding his face with his fan and squawking his own raucous complaints at mein english this time the sergeant who had been airsick gave me an aggrieved look and said faintly hes been going on like that the whole time they all have they all still were the surviving doc was holding up his ruined arm now neatly bandaged and a lot shorter than it had been and mewing earnestly to pirraghiz the only things capable of speech or action that werent demanding attention at once were the two machines beerts christmas tree and the surviving robot fighter they stood totally silent and unmoving in a corner of the subs cabin i appreciated that i raised a hand and said loudly in english shut up then in horch im sorry if you had a rough trip but its over now pirraghiz what happened to your friend she was standing next to him with one big hand on his shoulder for comforting at the other nestthe first place they took us to i dont know where it wasthe human female amputated most of his stump she told me she did an excellent job i think i blinked at that you let her operate on him i had no choice dannerman it was clear that she knew what she was doing and the medical attention was urgently needed then she came with us to care for him on the trip but i thought you were the medical one only for dealing with your species dannerman i have been given no skills for my own beert had been standing behind me listening now his neck snaked over my shoulder and his little head twisted to peer sidewise into mine may i speak now dan he asked sounding sorrowful but resigned i do not complain but can you tell me what place we have arrived at and for what purpose it was a tall order but i did my best to pass on to him adding apologies every few sentenceswhat hilda and patrice had explained to me we were at a research facility devoted to analyzing the technology of the others where he and the docs would bei took a moment over the choice of wordswould be cared for i said i didnt want to say imprisoned the hard part of answering his question was when it came to purpose i didnt know what the bureau had in mind for him and didnt much like my suspicions while i was stumbling over that the deputy director stuck his nose down the hatch whats going on he demanded suspiciously come on out of there bring thosethingsout with you that sounded like a good idea the stink was getting to me been and the docs followed me up the ladder agilely enough and in a moment we were all standing uneasily on the slippery rounded deck of the sub which had not been intended for anybody to stand on i could see patrice standing down below a few feet from the big wheeled dolly the sub was resting on the plump black woman was beside her and patrices mouth was open in wonder as she saw beert pell nudged me pointing to the exterior ladder get them down there he ordered and when i added a few sentences to the horch translation of his order trying to reassure them pell demanded even more suspiciously than before what are you saying to them im telling them what you said i informed him all right he grumbled but i want you to translate every damn word both ways do you hear me now move it all of you when we were all on the ground he hadnt finished giving orders you he barked at me go see the doctor he was pointing to the black woman standing with patrice pell did not choose to mention what i was supposed to see her about before i could ask he was already stalking away barking orders at everyone in sight when i got there beert and the docs trailing after patrices eyes were all on beert but she hadnt forgotten her manners this is colonel marsha evergood dan shes a neurosurgeon i shook her hand i hear you have a side specialty in amputating doc limbs i said she acknowledged the remark with a grin it happens im the worlds greatest expert on doc anatomy agent dannerman i didnt plan it that way but ive debugged one and autopsied another now will you hold still for a minute she didnt wait for an answer she reached under my babushka to run her fingers over the thing behind my right ear marcus pell came up behind me as she felt and peered and poked well he demanded testily the doctor withdrew her hand and gave me a friendly pat on the shoulder she pursed her lips considering i cant say for sure without x rays and an ultrasound and maybe a little exploratory surgery but id say its architecturally similar to the scarecrow bugs if so it has probably invaded a lot of tissue i doubt i could remove it without risking serious brain damage hey i squawked pulling away pell didnt even look at me so you think hes transmitting everything he sees he asked marsha evergood shrugged so i answered for her no im not transmitting anything its nothing like that it isnt a spy bug its made by the horch not the uh scarecrows and all it does is give me their language he gave me a glance that time but didnt respond the doctor patted my hand reassuringly i thought what she was trying to tell me was that she wasnt going to turn me into a slobbering idiot with her scalpels no matter what marcus pell wanted at least i hoped so anyway whatever decision he might have wanted to make got deferred by another call on his attention the duty crew had been carrying bits and pieces of loose equipmentincluding my sack of horch goodiesout of the sub they were stacking it all on the floor next to a bureau van but they came to a stop the officer in charge hurried over looking worried deputy director i dont think we can lift the big cadaver without more men and wed better get it into refrigeration pretty fast for a moment it occurred to me to volunteer the docs for the job which they could have handled easily but pell was already gone to sort this new problem out anyway i wasnt in a mood to do him any favors and i had something else i wanted to do i beckoned pirraghiz and beert to come forward patrice i said id like you to meet my two best friends she stumbled over their names but gamely stuck her hand out being a considerate person pirraghiz barely touched patrices hand with her enormous taloned fist but beert wrapped one snaky arm around it he kept his eyes on her but slid his head up close to mine whispering when i answered patrice spoke up what were you saying she demanded oh well i said trying to think of a lie deciding to tell her the truth he uh wanted to know if you were the human female i was talking about back in his nest and you said i shrugged and stuck with the truth i said more or less ah she said nodding more or less then she added in a tone of friendly curiosity tell me something dan why do you wriggle your arms and neck that way when you talk to your friends she caught me by surprise do i i never noticed it maybe im just sort of copying the way beert talks you ought to try to stop it it looks pretty dumb and the look she was giving me that time had no suggestion of kissing in it by then the cleanup crew had loaded the casualties onto a couple of waiting gurneysand a hand truck for the dead docand marcus pell was peremptorily calling my name again those robot machine things in the sub he said sounding harried the crews afraid to touch them can you make them come out i shook my head no but beert can give me a minute beert and i climbed back onto the deck and he called his orders down through the hatch both the robots immediately came to life i wasnt sure how the christmas tree was going to manage the two ladders up and down but it simply extruded four or five more branches and whisked itself along the fighter robot following briskly tell them to get in the van pell ordered when they were down i opened my mouth to ask why but he didnt give me a chance do it he barked and while they were doing it impassive as ever he climbed onto a crate listen up all of you he called those highranking workmen stopped what they were doing and turned toward him you will not repeat not ever under any circumstances mention to anyone at all the fact that you have seen any of this horch technology the scarecrow stuff is different thats covered by the treaty and in a minute well let the un people and everybody else in this project in to see it nothing about the horch understand me this is a national security matter and violation carries a death penalty plus he added savagely i will make you pray for the firing squad long before the sentence is carried out he met the eyes of everybody in the loading area then jumped down and turned to me tell your horch friend to get in the van too he ordered that was pushing it a step too far i didnt know what pell was up to but i didnt feel like going along with it i said no pell looked as astonished as though a waiter had turned down his request for a clean spoon what the hell do you mean no thats an order no i said again beert stays with me i promised him the deputy directors expression changed he didnt look angrier he looked as though he had suddenly turned to ice i dont give a shit what you promised that thing dannerman i want him out of here before anybody else sees him do you want me to put you under arrest right now out of the corner of my eye i saw hildas lifesupport box rolling toward me dangerously but i ignored her i said well deputy director if thats what you want to do i guess i cant stop you i ought to remind you though that im the only one who can speak to these people i dont see how i could do that for you if you put me in a detention cell he stood silent for a moment swallowing what i had said to him it looked as though it might choke him i went on anyway whats the point why do you want this stuff taken away he glanced at hilda standing silently by but didnt say anything until he had finished processing the situation in his head when he had made up his mind all he said was the horch can stay just keep your mouth shut about the equipment i could feel hildas warning eyes on me in spite of her oneway glass i persisted anyway yes but why security he snapped that puzzled me i dont see the problem isnt this place secure from the scarecrows pell had regained his composure when he answered it was as though our little headtohead had never happened its secure from the scarecrows surei hope thats not the problem camp smolley is full of un personnel and i dont want them nosing around the horch materiel its bad enough we have to share the scarecrow technology with them that was even more of a puzzle why are you worrying about the un i thought the scarecrows were the enemy pell gave me the kind of look a kindergarten teacher might give to a child who hadnt covered his coughs and sneezes theyre the present enemy dannerman who knows who our friends are going to be when this is over remember what country pays your salary and keep your priorities straight that was the end of the discussion pell turned away and gestured to the van driver who started up and drove away through a smaller door to the outside then paying no further attention to me pell called to the guard at the inside door open up lets let the rest of the team come in and see what weve got chapter fortythree i dont know how many people had been waiting impatiently on the other side of those doors maybe a hundred or more they came pouring in full of indignation at being kept outside even more full of astonishment when they saw what was waiting for them the ones in front stopped short goggling until the ones behind pushed them forward there was a curious sort of collective sigh then some rushed toward the sub and a dozen or so zeroed in on marcus pell full of complaints and accusations a tall woman in a sari got to him first i must protest this unnecessary delay deputy director pell she snapped sternly under the terms of the un covenant we are entitled to immediate access to every item of scarecrow technology without delay and a man in the uniform of some army i didnt recognize but wearing a blue united nations beret backed her up i have already filed a protest because your people did not allow un observers to be present when this submarine was landed pell wasnt fazed hed had plenty of practice in dealing with indignant foreigners who were pissed off at something the bureau had done he spread his hands benignly i understand your concerns major korman doctor tal but these are exceptional circumstances the scarecrows dont know we have captured this sub and they mustnt find out so we have had to take unusual security precautions he didnt stop there but i stopped listening i had a nearer problem several dozen of the new people had circled my little group staring in fascination at their first sight of a real live horch a couple of them were cameramen shooting from every angle and when beert saw the lenses pointing at him he couldnt help flinching away pirraghiz and the wounded doc wrahrrgherfoozh saw what was happening and moved to surround beert protectively but the audience was all raucously shouting questions did they speak english what happened to the big ones arm how come the other doc was wearing clothes were they dangerous i tried to reassure beert and pirraghiz and at the same time keep the more adventurous of the spectators from reaching out to touch beert but it was hilda the expert in crowd control who rescued us she produced four bureau police to surround us and thenshe must have turned up the gain on her internal microphoneshe thundered at the people dont come too close theres a risk of communicable diseases with the help of the police that made them fall back a little she added more civilly when theyve been examined you will have your proper access to them and before that well arrange for agent dannerman to meet with you in the auditorium to tell his story she didnt give me a chance to react to that while the police were moving the spectators away she came up close to me and said softly id go easy on telling marcus to go screw himself if i were you danno youre not making any friends for yourself that way she was telling me what i knew already i shrugged i already have all the friends i need she was silent for a moment then she said maybe you do its a good thing for you that im one of them and then with a change of tone anyway here comes our transportation the transportation was one of those electricmotored people carriers you see in airports it was big enough to hold all of usincluding the docs though just barely with a couple of bureau uniformed police ahead of us to clear the way we moved pretty fast out of the loading area through the halls of camp smolley hilda wasnt on the vehicle and didnt need to be her boxs wheels kept up easily as she rolled along behind us behind her still half a dozen more guards were following halftrotting to keep up most of them wore the blue un berets all the way the two docs were mewing to each other taking a lively interest in the rooms they passed the fire extinguishers on the walls the water fountains the ceilingmounted tv screens at every intersection that were all displaying the scene in the loading dock though no human beings were present in the halls to watch them because everybody who could get there was there already beert was darting his head in every direction too and full of questions i couldnt tell him much id never been in camp smolley before either i knew right away when we got to the rooms they had reserved for my friends though because two people were standing in front of one of the doors one was a blueberet guard looking uneasy and the huge figure next to him was unmistakably a doc i was astonished to see him there but pirraghiz saw him at the same moment i did and her reaction was a lot more violent she screamed something and leaped off the carrieri thought she was going to overturn the thingand flung herself into the other ones arms the two of them mewing at high volume at each other i got off too turning to hilda oh right i said memory returning at last there were a couple of docs with the bunch that escaped from the prison planet the escape party werent there two of them the other ones dead she said shortly this one we call meow hes been helping out figuring how the scarecrow stuff workscant talk so anybody can understand him but hes good at drawing pictures tell your horch friend this is where hes going to live for a while for a while when i looked inside i hoped that for a while would be really brief because the room they wanted him in was not attractive it was a damn jail cell is what it was it had bars on its one window and a lidless open toilet and a washstand and a narrow cot that was all hilda was watching my face tell him its only temporary she suggested i looked at her yeah sure i said i did tell been that what i didnt tell him was how long only temporary was likely to be in government practice i glossed it over as fast as i could and tried to explain to him how the toilet worked and offered to get more blankets for his cot if he wanted them and promised i would see him as often as i couldi didnt then realize how intensive the questioning was that lay ahead of us and therefore how often that would be beert listened in silence head hung low ropy arms wrapped around his belly for protection all he said his voice lowpitched and somber was what about food dan that took me aback oh hell i said right food i hadnt given that little problem any thought at all so i asked hilda for help she wasnt much theres plenty for the docs and the dopeys she told me the scarecrows sent some food down for themthats how they sneaked their subs along i dont know about the horch what does he eat i turned to pirraghiz for help that took a little doing because all three of the docs were still excitedly mewing to each other wrahrrgherfoozh and the one they called meow were hugging each other at that momentby no means with the same passion as pirraghiz had shown but you can do a lot of hugging with six arms apiece even if one of them is only a stump when i got pirraghizs attention and explained the problem she looked remorseful i did not think dannerman she said sadly let me ask the others they chattered back and forth for a moment then she shook her massive head at me i am not sure she said perhaps i can do for djabeertapritch what i did for you in the nest of the two eightsget samples of all the foods your species eats and see what among them resembles the foods of the horch i understand meow has food of his own i said pointing at the other doc maybe some of that can be used or the food for the dopeys she looked puzzled perhaps she said but why do you call him that it is mrrranthoghrow i stared at her slackjawed mrrranthoghrow exactly he she said happily you would not think that a sixarmed creature with a face like a bearded full moon could look coquettish but she managed it he is a copy of the one we knew in the two eights of course but it is mrrranthoghrow whom the others copied for this mission and he remembers me well from earlier times but you surprise me dannerman did you think i would be so affectionate with a total stranger next stop for me was my press conferencewell there was certainly no press there but that was what it felt like to the person in the hot seat i climbed up onto the platform before the hundreds of staring eyes and gave them a sketchy outline of my adventures with the horch then i opened the floor for questions that was a mistake there were about a million of them and all the time i was searching the hundred or more faces in the room for patrice when i found her squeezed into almost the last row i managed an inconspicuous wave she waved back all right but there was something about her that seemed wrong i took me a moment to figure that out it was the clothes and the hairdo patrice had been wearing a pretty pants suit this one was in bureau coveralls all right she could have changed her clothesnot very likely but possiblebut she hadnt had time to let her hair grow into a long ponytail there was only one possible explanation the woman i was looking at wasnt patrice she had to be pat the real pat and sitting beside her was a man who looked a lot like me except that he wore a mustache and i realized i was looking at the other me danny m the man who was married to pat that did not help my concentration when the deputy director sitting behind me on the platform saw that i was stumbling through the next couple of questions he took pity on meor more likely was afraid that i was getting tired enough to say something he didnt want said he got up and preempted the mike no more questions please he said agent dannerman has had a very exhausting time we must see that he is fed and allowed to rest as he is debriefed over the next few days the records and transcripts will be made available to all of you under the terms of the un agreement please leave now there was a rumble of discontent from the audience at that but they leftor i guess they did pell had me by the arm and escorted me backstage before i could see hilda was waiting there amid the tangle of ropes and discarded pieces of sets nice job danno she informed me the way you duck the questions you dont want to answer youll make a good administrator someday the deputy director gave her an opaque look but all he said was have you got a schedule for dannerman yet working on it marcus hes got to eat first though he looked surprised as though that sort of pampering had never crossed his mind then he looked resigned take care of it he ordered and left without another wordto catch up on his harassing of somebody else no doubt i looked at hilda i hadnt realized i was hungry until she put it in my mind but i was you mentioned food right next door she said rolling away i followed her down a steep ramp through a doorway and came out in a little room i suppose a dressing room at one time now set up with a table and four chairs three of the chairs were occupied already the pat in the bureau coveralls that other dannerman and old rosaleen artzybachova i thought youd like company while you ate hilda said indulgently then less indulgent youve got fortyfive minutes as she left us i fixed my gaze on the pat patrice i guessed very unsure of myself in more ways than one she shook her head no patrice went back to the observatory to work on the threat watch she said im patpat onebut wont i do for now the food was typical bureau onduty fare platters of sandwich materials a big bowl of salad coffee fruit for dessert i was hungry again and i ate but i wasnt paying much attention to it i had never had the experience of sitting down at a table with myself before they began at once to tell me all the news that i hadnt heard from patrice what a commotion theyd made when they got back how this dan and this pat had been put in charge of their dopey and meowhis name is actually mrrranthoghrow i told them and they practiced that for a while without a lot of successand thus assigned to camp smolley and all the while i kept looking at the two of them and trying to figure out just what i was feeling odd that was how i was feeling not uncomfortable exactly just odd i guess it showed because the other dan grinned at me then looked serious and said weird right but youll get used to it and pat said sympathetically we all did except in my case rosaleen put in because i didnt have anything of that sort to get used to when i returned i learned that the other of me had died while we were away that was more than simply a bizarre feeling dan it was quite distressing but as dan saysas dan m saysone gets used to it then patpat onebegan to show me pictures of pat fives triplets they looked like rather ordinary little girls to me somewhat asianlooking as was to be expected considering that what got pat five pregnant was some of the beloved leaders experimentation with sperm from their copy of jimmy lin who had managed to secure visitation rights after a lot of highlevel and acrimonious diplomatic discussion between the united states and the peoples republic and was surprisingly turning out to be a fondly besotted new father and pat five was doing fine too except that the drugs she was taking to enhance her milk flowthree babies sucking away six times a day eachhad made her breasts so sensitive that she complained of being horny all the time and how busy patrice and p j were at the observatory with the threat watch using up so much of their resources and the observatorys scientific staff constantly pissing and moaning i because they werent getting enough observing time to do any real science since the worlds telescopes were kept busy hunting comets that might be a threat all the time out of the corner of my eye i was watching pat my true love whom i had been missing so urgently for so long and what i was thinking was how much she looked like patrice with all of patrices mannerisms and every bit of patrices looks i cleared my throat will she be coming back soon do you think that made them all look at each other i dont know dan m said at last and pat bit her lip and then leaned toward me confidentially i guess you know she said back in the prison planet patrice well had a kind of crush on youthat is you i meanpointing a forefinger at each of us dan dannermans i blinked at that she did rosaleen was laughing a dry old chuckle of course she did dan as did we all she said kindly do not let it make you conceited you were simply the only worthwhile man for many lightyears in any direction what did you expect she gave me a demure look perhaps i should confess that i even had some sorts of foolish oldwoman thoughts about you myself you did that was astonishing too but in a different way patrice didnt exactly get over it either pat went on so when she heard you were herewell look im telling tales out of school but were all kind of family here arent we and now youve just kind of hurt her feelings you know that baffled me what did i do something you said im not sure what did you say she was just a copy of me because were all a little bit sensitive about that well i hadnt done that not exactly anyway what i had done was to admit to her that id told pirraghiz she was more or less the woman in my dreams but what was so bad about that it was true wasnt it they all kept talking mostly dan m telling me about the religious nut who had wormed her way into hildas confidence and repaid it by shooting her and three or four other people i listened and responded but i was still mulling over the patrice problem when hilda herself rolled in finished danno she asked you better be wipe the crumbs off your face because family time is over and the debriefers are waiting to get at you part ten the most important man in the world chapter fortyfour there were half a dozen people impatiently waiting for me in the debriefing room some male some female some wearing the blue un beret and some in bureau tans they didnt waste time they started in right awaydescribe in more detail the robots you called christmas trees one of them commanded and we were off it didnt stop either it didnt even slow down after i told them how the robots had acted i had to tell them what their needles felt like when i touched them and what they had done to me with their damned helmet and what they had been doing to the dopey the questioning didnt even pause for breath my breath i mean the debriefers had plenty of breathing space because they took turns with the questionsuntil hildas great white refrigerator box rolled back into the room times up for this segment she said you go to the sub now danno slow down a little hilda i begged i have to go to the bathroom sure you do danno ive got you down for a pee break right after the next session you can hold it until then cant you and rolled away leaving me to follow her without waiting to hear whether i could or couldnt there were more questions at the submarine but this time they werent for me they were for the two docs who waited there pirraghiz and the recent amputee wrahrrgherfoozh and all i had to do was translate the head debriefer seemed to be a middleaged redhaired woman i sort of knewdaisy fennell her name was one of the bureau higherups she started with the questions before i was all the way inside theyd had the sense to leave the hatch open and so the sub smelled a little better someone had also cleaned up the airsick guards puke but outside of that nothing much had been touched there was one woman in there as we climbed down operating three or four cameras that were methodically scanning around watch where shes shooting fennel ordered we want to know the function of every piece of equipment in this vehicle also as much as these ah persons can tell us about how it works understand start with this one she was pointing where one of the cameras was pointing to a sort of chinese lantern twelve or fifteen centimeters high that was fixed to one wall it glowed with a pale green light and was softly humming to itself i passed the question on to pirraghiz who mewed to wrahrrgherfoozh who spoke at some length when pirraghiz translated for me it came out as wrahrrgherfoozh says it monitors the lighting system i dont know why thats necessary do you and while i was putting that into english for the debriefers she kept on going he also told me what systems are inside it but i did not understand the terms he used one moment please one of the debriefers said while i was adding that he looked unhappy will you please make sure you give us exact wording in every case also ask pirpirrthe one with the purry name to do the same when she translates for you i opened my mouth to ask why but daisy fennell was already talking do as she says dannerman she commanded dr hausman and dr tiempe are linguists the deputy director has given them permission to record your translations so they can work on learning these languages like a sort of rosetta stone do you know what that is dr hausman said eagerly thats why verbatim translations are so important once we can match up individual words we can build a vocabulary and then we can start trying to identify a grammar weve been trying to do that with meow but its been very slow fennel flagged her down another time dr hausman weve got business here dannerman i thought there was supposed to be some kind of chart here that showed where all the other subs were but i dont see it i looked around and spotted the place where it had been but now it was only a sort of glassy oval that displayed nothing at all there i guess its turned off for some reason why is it turned off i put the question to pirraghiz and got the answer from wrahrrgherfoozh he says its because the way the systems are hooked up please the linguist begged exact words also the docs when he speaks to pirraghiz if you dont mind i didnt particularly pirraghiz was less obliging when i told her about it it is very tedious this way she sniffed if these other persons wish to speak the horch language why do you not implant them with language modules of their own when i translated that there was an amused titter all around though she hadnt sounded to me as though she were joking but fennell wasnt amused get the hell on with it dannerman she ordered cut the comedy so i did as best i could trying to translate word for word made the job about twice as tedious and it was tedious enough already still we finally got that message cleared up wrahrrgherfoozh had cut the subs communications out completely when we took over that was good since the scarecrows stopped receiving data from us and thus wouldnt know what had happened but it was also bad because we stopped receiving anything from them at the same time nothing was incoming no talk on the circuits between subs no data to locate the other subs on the screen no nothing at all but when i asked pirraghiz conferred with wrahrrgherfoozh and reported that yes hed never done it before but he thought he could maybe rejigger the subs communications systems so that we could receive without transmitting it wasnt an easy job but if he could get mrrranthoghrow to help him maybe in a day or two fennell didnt enjoy that news meows needed elsewhere she said i shrugged if you think so if you want my opinion id say hes needed here we dont know what the scarecrows are doing do we if pirraghiz could listen in we might be able to find out whether theyve really bought the idea of an accident and the i sooner the better i guess my tone wasnt very deferential because she gave me a hard look ill take it up with the deputy director she said get back to work so i did and we had named and more or less described about half the visible gadgets on the sub when hilda called in to say that it was time for me to go to my next appointment as i came down the ladder pirraghiz and the linguistics team following hilda studied me for a minute are you deliberately trying to piss daisy fennell off she demanded i shrugged not deliberately well youre doing a good job of it she said and then she made a little sound that must have been a chuckle on the other hand i guess it doesnt matter much since she cant get along without you hey i guess none of us can really can we danno how does it feel to be the most important man in the world the most important man in the world it had a nice sound i pondered over it between pauses for translations at the next stop which was in a kind of laboratory id seen the bureaus forensic lab at the headquarters in arlington the one at camp smolley was a lot bigger it was a twentyfourhour operation and it was bustling with all kinds of activity in one room technicians were doing mass spectroscopy its door closed but the nasty dentistsdrill sound leaking through as they sputtered ions off samples of scarecrow metals in another the chemists had other samples bubbling and fizzing under glass hoods the place hilda took us to was a larger room filled with rows of workbenches each of them held its own piece of scarecrow gimmickry being investigated with a handful of techs poking and prodding at its innards we stopped where mrrranthoghrow was waiting with two or three techs one of them wearing the un blue beret while pirraghiz was hugging her longlost friend in greeting i got a look at what was on the bench it was a huge thing the size of hildas mobile box but it wasnt on wheels and instead of being refrigerator white it was iridescently greenish when mrrranthoghrow finished hugging pirraghiz he picked up a sheaf of carefully executed drawings and thrust them at me mewing earnestly this is a part of a transit machine of the others pirraghiz translated it comes from the human astronomical orbiter called starlab and mrrranthoghrow has made these sketches of its parts which these people wish to discuss when one more person arrives by the time i had translated that the one more person was arriving speeding along in her wheelchair with an apologetic expression on her face it was rosaleen artzybachova sorry if ive kept you waiting she said i didnt expect you to be on time im afraid hello meow she was speaking to mrrranthoghrow and the surprising part was that he replied with hello rosaleen in english well almost in english it came out uhwoh wozzaweeeen but close enough hilda of course was having none of that we are seven minutes behind schedule dr artzybachova she said crisply please do not delay us any more of course rosaleen said here dan she plucked a couple of the carefully executed drawings out of my hand and pointed to the sketch of a round object with a partly serrated edge ask him if this thing is meant to fit in with this other one pointing to another sheet with a detail of something that looked like a clamshell and on and on well theres no sense describing every last thing i did around then because there were many too many things to be done see i was the only one who could talk to beert or pirraghiz and through her to the other docs there was a lot of talking to be done and every bit of it required my participation it wasnt much of a stretch for hilda to call me the most important man in the world the busiest anyway so it isnt really surprising that some really important matters just sort of slipped my mind chapter fortyfive i dont know if youve ever found yourself in a situation like mine by that i mean finding yourself back on your home planet when youd pretty much given up hope of ever seeing it again and meeting once more the girl of your dreams more or less and worrying about what your human associates were going to do to your best friend who happened to be a horch and trying to catch up on food sleep and news the accumulated news of a world i hadnt seen for many months and all day long answering questions and asking themof pirraghiz and beertand always every minute hustled from one interrogation place to another with little time to eat and barely enough for sleeping the worst part was the constant interruptions we would go from trying to figure out whether mrrranthoghrow was talking about magnetism or electricity or something entirely different to an emergency trip to the sub where daisy fennell was having hysterics because the doc had begun ripping one whole panel out of the subs wall by the time we finished convincing her that he was just doing what he was told to do up the chain of communication and she finished demanding that he let bureau mechanics observe and record every move hilda was already getting calls from the reverseengineering people to complain that their allotted time was being frittered away and when we got back to the hunk of scarecrow transit machine mrrranthoghrow was in the middle of trying to explain the way the things laserlike weaponry was generated and rosaleen artzybachova was begging to be told where the power came from and while we were trying to deal with that the head of the un detachment showed up to protest that some of the semiorganic scarecrow materiel was making fizzing noises and seemed to be rotting away and why were we wasting time with hardware when valuable stuff was being lost because they didnt know how to preserve it it was pretty hectic trust me on that the only ones who were enjoying it all were the linguists and they were in heaven after months of effort theyd picked up only a few words of doc now they had their rosetta stone me and a completely different new language horch two new languages not just new in the sense that some newly discovered african hill tribes language was new to at least western linguists but wholly new in provenance languages that had developed with no ancestors in common with any language any human being had ever heard before all the way back to the earliest presentient screeches and grunts i could almost smell their ecstatic daydreaming about the papers they would someday contribute to the linguistics journals i was glad they were having fun nobody else was definitely i was not and least happy of all was my friend beert when they brought me in to question him he was bellydown on his army cot head held dejectedly low the way i looked at it he had a lot to be dejected about the room he was in was spartan and not at all private two wallmounted cameras followed him wherever he went which was never very far since the cell was only about two meters by three altogether when we all piled in there was hardly room to move at all they want me to ask you some questions beert i told him his neck had swerved to the two armed guards in un blue helmets yes i supposed that they would he said absently and then asked those persons with the blue metal on their heads are they your cousins something like that i said but that was all the chitchat we were allowed and before we could get down to business the translators were on my case again for verbatim translations of everything we had said when the debriefers questions began he stayed dejected but answered civilly enough it wasnt a very useful interview though the first things the debriefers wanted to know about were weaponry and beert complained that he had had no experience in that area my robot may have more of that data he said but i think not much and then when i translated that hilda cleared her throat since we dont have one of his robots to ask she said warningly lets go on to some other subject i took the hint when disappointed the interrogators switched to questions about other kinds of horch technology beert complained several times that his robot was the one to be asked of such matters but i simply didnt translate technology wasnt a productive area anyway even when beert had answers the terms he used meant nothing to me or to the debriefers that didnt stop them from asking though they were entitled to a full hour they said they claimed every minute of it although the need for sleep was catching up with me and i was yawning long before hilda announced time was up and hustled me out of the room for once the linguists didnt follow that puzzled me but when i asked hilda she said you dont need to take them to bed with you do you bed i had almost given up on the hope of being allowed to go to bed bed danno she confirmed youll need your rest youve got a long day ahead of you tomorrow then she added approvingly you did good in there danno just remember scarecrow stuff tell them everything what you saw and did tell them everything the horch stuff at arlington you dont tell them anything about it at all um i said meaning youve told me all this before and im too tired to hear it again then i said cant you do better for beert than that dump remember we owe him i do remember she said crossly well do the best we can give it a rest i stopped turned and peered into her oneway glass which made her recoil a little what the hell are you up to now danno she demanded im trying to see if you still have a heart as much as i ever did she snapped back off danno you have to get over this nasty little curiosity about what i look like inside this box i can see out but you cant see in and thats the way i want it now go to bed youre going to have a full day tomorrow when the door closed behind me i looked around my room wasnt much better than beerts except that it did have a tv set and washstand and there was a lid on the toilet i thought about turning on the tv to catch a little news before i went to sleep but i lay down to think about it and then i didnt want to get up again i wondered what pat was doing just then then i wondered what patrice was doing then i wondered what it was that was niggling for attention at the edges of my mind then i fell asleep and when i woke up i had forgotten that there was anything like that at all chapter fortysix i knew my new life with the bureau was not going to be any bed of roses i found out just how tough it was going to be as soon as i was awake i was eating the breakfast an orderly had delivereda lot less pleasing than the last human breakfast i had had with its roomtemperature eggs and notquitecrisp bacon when my tv screen beeped at me and displayed my schedule for the day reveille debriefing solo break and medical debriefing with horch lunch debriefing submarine with docs translation technical with docs break and medical debriefing solo dinner debriefing submarine with docs administrative conference medical and retire for night it looked pretty formidable apart from that one surprising exception when hilda came to hustle me over to debriefing solo i said gratefully i guess you do have a heart hilda thanks for that long lunch hour oh that she said turning slightly to see if we were alone we werent she was silent for a moment then said in a lowered tone yes well ill explain about that part when we come to it that was the hilda i knew there was going to be a catch to her generosity and of course there was we got through debriefing solo with its million questions about beerts lab and horch technology in general and break and medicalfive minutes for me to go to the bathroom ten more for a couple of medics to peer down my throat and squirt something nastytasting into it so i wouldnt lose my voiceand debriefing with horch where they asked the same sort of questions of beert with me translating and of course wherever we went our entourage trailed along the linguists did their best to stay out of the way but we now had an additional group keeping us company mostly united nations mps they didnt wear blue berets like the technicians they wore blue helmets and they were everywhere watching everything muttering reports into their pocket screens acting suspicious of everything that was done with the scarecrow stuff but they didnt stay with us when the questioning of beert was over hilda shooed them off agent dannerman must have his time for relaxation she said firmly and they went as soon as they were out of sight she turned to me were going she said briefly bring your horch friend along what i started to ask but didnt bother finishing hilda wasnt answering questions just then i sighed and told beert to come along and when he asked what i would have asked i just shook my head a couple of bureau cops were waiting for us and they led the way to an outside door a van was waiting for us there and when it had taken us to the chopper pad a helicopter was waiting for the van then i guessed were going to arlington arent we i asked hilda and all she said was where else well we did get lunch there such as it was it amounted to no more than the trademark bureau sandwiches and coffee for me and a few scraps of what looked like stewed rhubarb for beert all that pirraghiz had been able to sort out in the time available we werent given much time to enjoy it either the bureaus forensic laboratory was built to do whatever might be needed in any bureau operationeverything from dissecting a spray bomb full of radionuclides in its containment ovens to analyzing the toxins in an assassins needletipped umbrella or picking apart the linings in a smugglers suitcase the place they gave us to eat in smelled of ancient ashes and acids but nothing was going on there at the moment but our lunch nor was much happening in most of the lab chambers we passed on the way in but when hilda informed us lunchtime was over and escorted us to a locked wing of the lab there was plenty at three or four work stations techniciansall bureau people not a single blue un beret in sightwere delicately prizing apart pieces of the wrecked scarecrow fighters at a couple of other benches the objects being examined were the bits and pieces i had stolen from beert and pirraghizher books his instruments beert snorted sadly as he saw them but hilda didnt let us linger keep moving she ordered were going to see the live ones the bureau wasnt taking any chances with the live ones the room the fighting machine and the christmas tree were in was steelwalled a couple of senior bureau technicians were waiting for us gathered around a monitor screen that let them see inside there a pair of bureau sharpshooters were covering the machines from separate angles in case either of them made some sudden hostile move they werent making any apart from an occasional twitch that made hilda ask why they were doing that and when i asked beert he said somberly they are simply running routine systems checks to be sure everything is functioning in case of need there is nothing to fear she mulled that over for a moment then sighed all she said was lets get on with it when we were inside the chamber the sharpshooters came to attention you have to stay out of our line of fire brigadier one of them warned yes yes she said testily but she obediently rolled to one corner of the room and let the technicians take over they knew what they wanted evidently they had studied everything i had said in debriefing about what the christmas trees were capable of and one by one they asked to have the machine put through its paces extend branches down to the tiniest twiglets display its recording lenses speak one of the techs was recording every move while the other gave me orders which i passed on to beert to repeat until he got tired of that and sulkily told the christmas tree do as dan orders then it went a little faster but still interminable when they had seen everything the christmas tree could doat least twicethey turned to the fighting machine that made the sharpshooters more nervous but the machine obediently turned moved and displayed its weaponry for a good twenty minutes then the technicians paused looking at each other wed like to see it fire its weapons one of them said do you think we could take it out to the range you damn well could not hilda barked from her corner neither of these things is leaving this room the tech sighed all right but we need to know its effective killing distance firing rate all that sort of thing but when i asked beert those questions all i got from him was some violent necktwisting do not forget dan he said obstinately i came late to this world of high technology i know nothing of weapons i wasnt sure i believed him i didnt want to call my old friend a liar though so i simply translated his words with a straight face the way i looked at it beert was entitled to an occasional lie when his conscience didnt want him to tell the truth after all he had given me pretty much the same kind of slack when i was in his nest when it was time to leave i was surprised to see that wed had an audience marcus pell was standing outside the cell watching the machines on the monitor he gave me a quick look i remind you agent dannerman that none of this is to be spoken of to anyone especially those un people this is a bureau matter the only person outside the bureau who knows anything about it is the president of the united states yes sir i said a little surprised that he had bothered to take the president into his confidence inside the cell the machines were twitching slightly again and he jerked a thumb at them do they have to be doing that beert says its just systems checks i told him though i knew he had been told that before well i dont like it the deputy director said cant he turn them off when i put the question to beert it seemed to bother him he studied my face at close range for a moment before he said glumly yes dan i could do that why should i because they scare the hell out of some of the people here i do not mind that that is so dan do you remember that i am alone on this planet these machines are the only security i have it isnt much beert i told him first suspicious move either of them makes the guards will destroy it even so he said flatly closing the discussion so i told the deputy director he cant do it he didnt believe me so what was all that palaver about he demanded he was telling me all the reasons he couldnt do it i didnt understand most of it he gave me one of those deputy director looks do you know what i think dannerman he asked i think your pal isnt being entirely frank with us maybe he needs a little encouragement i didnt like the way his mind was going if youre talking about beating the piss out of him thats against bureau policy isnt it only against human beings dannerman nobody ever said anything about space freaks it was impossible for me to tell how serious he was so i reminded him that not only was beert a good friend to whom we owed a debt but we knew so little of his anatomy that torture might kill him he sniffed meaning i did not know what times up he said youre needed back at camp smolley and that was all he said on the way back we had to wait for the dolly to lift hilda into the chopper i took advantage of the moment of privacy to try to get back on the sort of fellowship i owed beert i tried to tell him i knew how he must be feeling but he didnt let me get very far do you indeed dan he asked angrily but then collected himself i suppose you do do not concern yourself about it this is my personal worry not yours what worry do you mean he waved both arms and neck unhappily it is simply that i feel i may have made a mistake i think i will never see my greatmother again and that may be as well for i think she would not approve chapter fortyseven between the debriefing solo and the debriefing submarine with docs there was an hour and a half marked for dinner this time it was real hilda not only gave me all that time for a leisurely meal she let me have it in the little apartment belonging to pat and dan m and she left us alone for it it wasnt exactly a homecooked meal it seemed they didnt do much cooking because both of them worked for a living danthat danwas in charge of camp smolleys resident aliens their dopey and mrrranthoghrow he told me that right now the job mostly amounted to monitoring all the dopeys contacts to keep him from learning anything about the captured sub and beert it wasnt a demanding job the dopeys contacts were few he had been well and truly interrogated long since and there werent many questions left to ask him dan m was waiting for me when i got to the apartment he offered me a drink and i took it gladlyit was the first id been allowed since i got back patll be along in a minute he told me as he poured the canadian and ginger alenaturally he didnt have to ask what i preferred as i was holding the coppermesh babushka out of the way with one hand in order to lift the glass to my lips he gave me a disapproving look why dont you take that thing off he asked we arent going to be talking any military secrets here are we well hilda said i began and then reconsidered hilda after all wasnt there and the thing certainly was a damned nuisance i slipped it off and set it down on the floor next to my chair better he asked fine now you can look over the menu and see what you like he scrolled the screen for me offering comments the gazpacho was more or less all right but they made it with canned tomatoes the soup of the day though generally canned was better he didnt recommend any of the fish but the steaks were pretty good so i studied the menu with care not so much because i was having trouble making up my mind as because i was feeling a little uneasy it was the first time the other dan and i had been alone together it didnt seem to be bothering him muchwell hed had the practice he freshened my drink without being asked and politely offered to show me around the apartment i said no i could see the workroom and bathroom from where i sat the kitchen was only a little appendage off the main room and i had no interest in visiting the bedroom he and pat shared i dont mean that i was consumed with jealousy exactly i just didnt choose to look at their bed while he was placing our orders with the kitchen pat came in looking exactly as i expected her to look sorry she said pell is such a pain in the ass sometimes she took a quick look at the screen made her choices and then sat down next to me explaining what marcus pell had done to make her late it was her job to take the threat watch synoptics as they came in from the observatory and dumb them down enough for marcus pell to understand that was a tricky tightrope for her to walk if she didnt make them simple enough for him to grasp at the first hearing he complained she was wasting his time if she simplified them too muchas tonighthe got suspicious and demanded to know what she was leaving out i listened to her story but not attentively what was mostly on my mind was less what she was saying than the mere presence of pat herself beside me this was the precise pat i loved the pat i had made love to back on the prison planet this was the exact specific identical physical body that i had undressed and explored and had yearned to do the same to again for all that long time i spent with the horch of course so had this other dan dannerman with the mustache i wondered if he felt any jealousy with me sitting right there in the room with them for that matter i wondered if i did i definitely felt something when pat passed me the salt and our fingers touched i was aware that that was the hand that had caressed me and of course the same hand that had caressed him as well that was a jolting thought on the other hand dan m was definitely me wasnt he and was it possible for me to be jealous of myself i didnt know the answer this whole question of living in a world that contained more than one of me took a lot of getting used to and i was nowhere near that point i dont know what dan m made of my absentmindedness but he surely noticed it what he said after a moment kindly was i guess youd like patrice to come back wouldnt you i thought for a moment then came to a conclusion i did want her to come back if only to sort out what if anything i felt for the carbon copy of the woman i loved i said yes she didnt really want to leave dan pat said reassuringly she didnt have any choice about getting back to the observatory were all working for the bureau now patrice too she has to keep me posted on threat watch so i can pass the data along i mulled that over arent there a couple of you pats there already she gave me a forgiving smile pat five has her hands pretty full with the triplets and it needs both patrice and p j to handle the job at the observatory dan they work in shifts theres all the administrative work to do the stuff i used to hatesigning payroll checks travel vouchers have to be approved somebody has to keep the interns in lineespecially keep them from flirting with the bureau spooks these days and then theres the regular staff kip papathanassiou and pete schneyman and all some ways theyre the hardest part of the job patrice says they keep barging in on her at all hours all of them because theyre not getting the observing time to keep up with their cepheid counts or gravitationallensing studies or whatever observing time they know perfectly well that every big telescope is fully committed on threat watch and then theres threat watch itself patrice and p j have the synoptics to prepare every six hours and send me so i can tell the deputy director whats going on now and then when theres something special i even get to brief the president she nodded her head approvingly thats the good part of the job the president isnt a bad guy for a politician and he always treats me as though i were a human being not like marcus pell i chewed away on my steak listening something had crossed my mind about this threat watch thing but there was something else on my mind that drove it out about patrice i said when pat paused for a moment getting the subject back to what interested me you said i hurt her feelings well you did you shouldnt have said she was more or less me dan pat informed me patrice isnt more or less anybody shes herself and also me of course but none of us like to be told were part of a matched set even if we are its better if we just think of ourselves as family isnt it saves a lot of confusion but it didnt not for me anyway thinking of us as family didnt make it easier to handle for me because i had had no experience in that area i had never had a family to get used to no siblings parents long dead no one to call a relative but cousin pat and that was in the days when there was only one cousin pat the fact was that i didnt have much time to be part of a family anyway i didnt have much time for anything at all hilda made sure of that she came to collect me right on the dot hurrying me to my last session of the day this one at the submarine i guess the talk had made me a little absentminded we got through the session at the sub without my noticing anything was wrongwork coming along well wrahrrgherfoozh promising the subs incoming comm systems would be back on line in a day or soand it wasnt until we were in the final talk session between hilda and me that i put up my hand to scratch my head and said oh shit hilda interrupted herself in the middle of telling me that i really had to press beert and the docs harder for information to ask now what danno then she saw for herself oh christ wheres your damn faraday shawl i said apologetically i guess i forgot to put it back on when i was having dinner im sorry sorry well hell hilda i didnt do it on purpose but look if i really was transmitting data to somebody ive done it havent i so why dont we just forget about the damn babushka and after a certain amount of chewing me out she sighed and said oh what the hell maybe we could chapter fortyeight naturally the deputy director blew a fuse but in the long run he had to admit that if there was any damage to be done by letting me off wearing the babushka it was done already and that was the way my life went debriefing translation more debriefing more translation and bed apart from the fact that my head was babushkaless nowand that hilda squeezed twenty minutes in the next day for me to get a haircut and a beard trimevery day the same it wasnt all that unlike the days when the christmas trees were pumping me for everything i knew about the human race i did now have better food and a more comfortable bed and even a little entertainment there wasnt much variety to the entertainment though every morning i turned on the news channels and every morning the news was the same there were stories about plane crashes and stockmarket gyrations there were senators denouncing the opposition party for not responding to the scarecrow threat vigorously enough and opposition leaders denouncing those senators for recklessly damaging national unity in this time of crisis there were sports scores and weather forecasts and about a million other kinds of news items that the media thought worth passing on but there was not ever a single word of any kind about the captured submarine the horch or the unexpected arrival of another dan dannerman so security was holding whatever the faults of the national bureau of investigation it was still outstanding at keeping its secrets buried there was something else that wasnt there and when i had a free moment with hilda i asked her about it dont they have traffic advisories anymore i didnt see anything at all about terrorists on the news oh she said offhandedly those are last years worries the nutsve all calmed down now that theyve got something else to worry about we havent had a terrorist scare in weeks now get a move on they want us at the submarine that stopped me in midthought the schedule says were supposed to be doing solo debriefing i protested not liking the sound of a break in the routine hilda wasnt patient let me worry about scheduling will you danno its the submarine now theyve got the stuff working when we got there hilda waited outside as i climbed up to the subs hatch the linguists trailing as always as always the congestion inside the vessel was acute all three docs the linguists the technicians and me but it was worth the crowding wrahrrgherfoozh and mrrranthoghrow had finally finished the job of rebuilding the subs communications for receiving onlywould have had it done a lot faster mrrranthoghrow said sounding aggrieved if all those bureau and un techs hadnt kept getting in the way well i couldnt blame the techs for that it was their best chance ever to watch people who knew what they were doing in the actual process of repairing a piece of scarecrow machinery the two docs had done a good job the display screen was alight again with all its red dots showing the location of every scarecrow sub the pattern wasnt the same as before as far as i could rememberi hadnt had time for careful scrutiny in the excitement of invading the suband wrahrrgherfoozh confirmed that some of them had changed stations for what reason he could not say more important the two of them had restored the message circuits so that now we could listen in on communications between the ships there werent many of those though wrahrrgherfoozh informed us that crews were discouraged from talking to each other except in emergencies what did come in were occasional bursts of gibberish which wrahrrgherfoozh said were instrumentation reports that were in a machine code unreadable for any of us even himself i think they are sensor readings he said and explained now and then we would get orders from the scout ship to go to a certain point on the sea bottom always near a land mass and at shallow depth and deploy sensors through the forward hatch then the sensor readings are automatically transmitted to the scout ship what do the sensors sense i do not know that dannerman we simply did as ordered that stirred the technicians right up they demanded to be shown how these sensors were extended and controlled and when wrahrrgherfoozh had done that they demanded that he extend them but not right away they ordered wait till we get a camera outside so we can see whats happening so the techs split up a couple of them went out for a camera while others handed a portable screen down through the hatch and all the time they were giving me orders to pass on to wrahrrgherfoozh about what they wanted him to do and he was telling them why he couldnt do some of it and they kept me busy translating back and forth then when camera and screen were in place it got even worse the part they most wanted to see was the sensor but in order to reveal that wrahrrgherfoozh had to deploy four or five of the nested handling rods to get them out of the way id seen it before but i couldnt help sneaking looks at the screen as the rods moved they looked a lot like the tentacles of a squid i wondered what they were intended forto handle objects wrahrrgherfoozh had said but what objects were to be handled he didnt know that hadnt come up yet in his orders from the scout ship that didnt stop the techs from asking him all over againabout the handling tentacles about the sensor that looked a little like beerts snaky head and mouthabout everything and trying to keep up with questions and answers and explanations halfway through pirraghiz looked at me curiously tell me something dannerman this is very difficult for you why do you not do as i have suggested and implant a translation module in some of these others i glanced at the linguists to see if they were about to become annoyed at a little untranslated chatter it didnt look that way they were murmuring to each other and letting the recorders handle our talk i said cautiously ive been thinking about that but the trouble is that i dont have one to implant will you ask wrahrrgherfoozh something for me ask him if it would be possible to build one out of whatever materials are available here she looked surprised but obediently mewed at wrahrrgherfoozh the conversation between the two of them went on for some time before she reported he says yes he thinks it may be possible but quite difficult certain metals and other substances may not exist at all here so they would have to be synthesized or perhaps cannibalized from other pieces of equipment actually that wasnt any worse than i had expected how long does he think it would take oh very long dannerman some sixteens of days at least but why do you wish to make it out of local materials perhaps the lack of sleep was getting to me but i was having trouble understanding her questions what else then she waggled her beard at me you could use the transit machine of course that made no sense you mean send to the horch and ask them to give us a few dozen of the things do you really think they would do that certainly they would not dannerman but there is no need i am not sure she went on meditatively if either wrahrrgherfoozh or mrrranthoghrow is skilled enough to simply make a copy of the implant without making a copy of you as well but that is not necessary we can simply remove the module from your headi can do that quite easily and without harm to you then we put the device in the transit machine and make as many copies as we like then if you wish i will put one back on you so that you can continue to talk to us yourself i blinked at her make copies of course you have seen that the transit machines have made a number of copies of you have they not this one can make copies of the device as well that was when the linguists woke up to the fact that there was a lot that i hadnt been putting into english and demanded to know what was going on i lied to them i said knowing it was going to screw up their recorded comparisons that she had been telling me at length that beert had to absolutely had to have better food and then i told pirraghiz that we would have to continue that discussion at some later time because right then they wanted us to get on with our work i didnt forget about what she said i just put it aside to ripen at the back of my mind because it definitely sounded like something i would like to do sometime some other time than now rosaleen hadnt been around the last couple of times id been translating mrrranthoghrows explanations of his drawings i had wondered if at last she was following doctors orders to take a little time off for rest she wasnt next time i went to the research lab the docs were late in arriving but rosaleen was there already sitting straight and perky in her wheelchair as she studied some fragment of a scarecrow gadget under a crystal hood she looked up and smiled at me oh she said when i asked about her absence it is just some personal business of my own ive been visiting the observatory to ask some questions and oh yes dan before i forget just as i was leaving patrice gave me something to give you to my surprise she reached up and pulled my head down to plant a kiss on my cheek it was more grandmotherly than sensual but i found that i appreciated the thought hum i said pleased and a little embarrassed thanks then i cleared my throat and got back to the subject what kind of questions i asked she looked a little embarrassed too it is simply a notion of mine perhaps it is no more than an old womans foolishness but still she paused to look around for the docs they still werent in sight if you are interested dan since we have a moment let me show you something she spun her chair around and rolled briskly to another workbench under a different sort of crystal hood were two objects one the shape and almost the size of a doughnut the other looking like a miniature dark brown peppercorn the big one rosaleen said we took from the wreckage of starlabs matter transporter the other from a bug look here she leaned forward and lifted the hood taking out the bigger gadget at the same time she rummaged in her pockets and found a magnifying glass and handed them both to me the doughnut was faintly warm and it made my fingertips tingle without the glass it looked faintly spongy with pits on its surface magnified a little the pits turned out also to be pitted it is a fractal object rosaleen told me do you know what that is it means that no matter how much we magnify it we see the same surface structure repeated over and over as far as we can do so that is i hefted it for a moment then put it back on the bench i didnt like the feel of the thing and you dont know what its for rosaleen looked surprised oh did i not tell you they are the power source for their scarecrow machines like batteries she sighed i thought that at first but meowmrrranthoghrowsays they are not or if they are they are batteries of a kind which never needs to be recharged then i thought they might be receivers for some sort of broadcast power but that means there would have to be some sort of transmitter somewhere mrrranthoghrow saysif i understand himthere is not then what she shook her head moodily that is what i have been asking the quantum people at the observatory you see there is this thing called vacuum energy about which i know little more than the name when i ask kit papathanassiou he tells me that yes it is all about us everywhere all the time virtual particles spring into being and disappear vast quantities of them we cannot detect them but quantum theory says they are there they are gone almost as soon as they occurusuallybut some scientists think they do not always disappear they even think that it is such a vacuum fluctuation that caused the big bang long ago and thus created our whole universe i never heard of any of that i admitted no i had heard not much more but when i ask papathanassiou he says certainly this vacuum energy exists the theory is quite complete in this respect but it cannot be tapped for any useful purpose he is very positive about that yet these little things do tap into something and i wish i knew what that was thoughtfully she replaced the cover over the objects then looked up ah here come our docs so we got started late but we made up for lost time questions pouring out of the techs pirraghiz struggling valiantly to make sense of the answers from mrrranthoghrow and wrahrrgherfoozh me translating both ways i didnt have much time to think about rosaleens worries but they did stick in my mind and there was something else that was bothering me too when we had finished the session and i saw hildas great white box rolling toward us to take me to my next date i asked rosaleen about it isnt that sort of well low priority my interest in how the scarecrows get their power but it is of great potential dan i waved a hand at her in the future sure but right now the scarecrows are maybe going to kill us all and shouldnt we be concentrating on doing something about that i dont just mean you rosaleen its everybody they dont seem to be worried she looked a touch offended but then she put her hand on my arm and smiled you are right dan have you ever read the story by mr edgar allan poe called the masque of the red death it is about the time of one of the great old plagues all over the city people are dying but in this one place there is a ball and the people there are dancing and drinking and pretending nothing is amissalthough it is only a matter of time before the plague will come to them and they too will die it is denial dan what you cannot face you deny perhaps it is better to do that than simply to dissipate your energies in useless worrying well i said obstinately i do worry and hilda rolling up just in time to catch the end of the conversation said irritably you sure as hell do danno and you make me nervous how about if you quit worrying and get on with your job well she was right too but that didnt stop me from worrying the human race was experiencing some sort of reprieve sure but i didnt think it could last and of course it didnt chapter fortynine actually it was that same night that things began to go sour when i got through with the debriefing hilda was waiting for me as usual but she didnt hustle me off at once listen danno she said sounding either embarrassed or annoyed i couldnt tell which do you think you can take yourself to dinner without me well sure i said startled does that mean you trust me to go off on my own it means im a little tired tonight danno she said sounding irritable no argument just go do it and listen i might be going to bed early tonight so ill see you in the morning i guess i was in my prisoner state of mind again and any break in the routine made me uneasy but when i got to their apartment pat and dan m were unsurprised actually dan m said she called me a while ago asked me to escort you to the rest of your dates if she wasnt up to it shes about ready for dialysis again pat told me it was the first id heard of dialysis hilda had never said a word so shes sick i asked trying to imagine hilda morrisey allowing herself to be sick pat looked reproving shes always sick dan that tepp woman did a good job on her do you have any idea what she has to go through every night i didnt so pat explained it to me while we were waiting for our dinners to arrive it pretty nearly spoiled my appetite i knew that this religious fanatic named tepp had killed a doc and shot hilda before she offed herself as well i didnt know quite how shot up hilda actually was there wasnt much left of some of her organsthus the dialysis every couple of weeks and even less of her whole autonomous metabolism every night dan said when she rolled herself into her private little clinic the medics extracted what was left of her body from the lifesupport boxas gently as they could but never without pain then they did all the undignified things that had to be done for a body that had lost the skills of doing them for itself check the foley catheter empty the urine bags roll her over for the daily high coionic patiently massage every last muscle and tendon kneading hard to keep them from wasting away entirely bathe her feed her the extra nutrients that werent included in her permanent glucose drip lift her onto the aircushion bed that hissed and grumbled at her all night long but saved her vulnerably fragile skin from bedsores and yes brush her teeth for her too it sounded like a hell of a life but dan said better than no life at all at least she can work then he grinned at me lets talk about something else pat did you tell him the news pat looked coy oh she said well its just that pat five is going stircrazy stuck in the house with the three babies she wants to get back to work in the observatory so theyre setting up a little nursery therehad to kick pete schneyman out of his office to make the space and hes really mad about it too yes i said with only moderate interest but then she said so that means patrice might have a little free time shes talking about coming down here again for a visit i stopped eating with a forkful of lukewarm bureau mashed potatoes on the way to my mouth thatwould be nice i said pat was grinning at me just nice who do you think shes coming to see dan and listen dan m said sternly dont blow it this time take my word for it this is what you want when a dan dannerman and a pat adcock get together its a match made in heaven well i didnt doubt that i didnt even mind this other me telling me so either i dont mean that there were not some residual maleprimate flashes of jealousy still floating around in my head how could there not be jealousy is in the genes no previous male primate had ever had to deal with this particular sort of situation before my genes werent up to the subtleties they were still loudly complaining that this man had taken this woman away from me and what was i going to do about it settle for instance for second best it was an unworthy thought patrice wasnt secondbest anything i knew that but my genes werent sure and i was too busy refereeing the debate between reason and instinct that was going on in my mind to be very good company at the rest of the meal and then the news came that took my mind off the pointless interior debate dan m stretched and yawned pushed aside the rest of his uneaten soggy apple pie glanced at his watch and said well about time to hit the road for your nineteenthirty dan but as we were standing up there was a call for him on his private screen he took it in the other room and when he came back he wasnt cheerful anymore shit he said theres been a leak lets see if i can call it up pat said what do you mean a leak but he waved her off while he tinkered with the wall screen it took him only a moment before he got a bare frame with the legend national bureau of investigation excerpt from maxwell at night program recorded at local time the legend disappeared and we were looking at the face of the tv newscaster known as robin maxwell i knew who the man was everybody in the bureau did maxwell had been on the bureaus watch list for a long time because he seemed to have contacts in some dubious places it looked like he had found himself a new contact now the spooks are at it again he was telling his audience you know what theyve got at the nbi now theyve squirreled away a scarecrow submarine and a live horch would you believe it take a look the face disappeared and we saw a picture of the sub with beert standing on top of it they dont want you to know about it but hey thats what maxwells for telling you the things the big guys dont want told he kept on talking but there wasnt any point in listening anymore the thing that mattered had been said and said on broadcast television which the scarecrows were no doubt monitoring so the secret was out chapter fifty i never did get to my all camp smolleys schedules were disrupted for sure because inside of an hour there were a hundred reporters battering at the gates of camp smolley demanding to know everything there was to know about this scarecrow submarine and actual living horch that we were hiding from them and why hadnt they been told about them before the reporters didnt get in of course they didnt even get any answers what they got was daisy fennell sent out to face them down and tell them that a there was no truth at all to the rumor b those alleged pictures were obviously morphed fakes and c if any of maxwells story had been true it would be an act of treason to the human race to report it because the scarecrows would hear while inside the camp the deputy director was raging through the hallways demanding that every living soul in the installation take a pet liedetector test to find the criminal who had broken security whether any of the reporters believed fennell i couldnt guess the funny thing was that part of what she said was true the photos maxwell showed werent photos they were morphs probably made from descriptions he got from someone who had seen beert and the sub but hadnt taken their pictures beert looked more like the hideous cartoon of a horch the scarecrows had showed us than his living self and the alleged photo of the submarine got the handling machinery at its bow all wrong it made a nice little nowin situation for the bureau they could easily prove maxwells pictures were fakes but only by admitting that the sense of his story was true so the media carried daisy fennells denials but that didnt solve the problem wrong as it was in detail maxwells pictures clearly showed what the scarecrows would instantly recognize as their missing sub the question on everybodys mind was what were they going to do about it as far as anybody could tell nothing at least not right away pirraghiz reported no special traffic to or among the scarecrow submarine fleet all the same there was a lot of worrying going on around camp smelly even hilda was snappish and the deputy director was hemorrhaging wrath blame and worry all over the installation he had his own way of dealing with worry and it took the form of starting a one hundred percent interrogation of everybody in sight thirsty for the blood of the despicable traitor who had broken security by interrogation i dont just mean questioning he had four petscan machines flown in from arlington for liedetector tests i didnt expect much from that position emission tomography is pretty good at sorting out facts from fantasy because those two files seem to be stored in different parts of the brain but it takes three or four hours to test a single subject marcus had not only the couple hundred people at camp smolley to test but all the ones at hampton roads as well the good part of that was that it kept him out of my hair and then even hilda left me alone when i finished my breakfast it was dan m who was waiting for me outside my room im your new shepherd dan he told me wryly hope thats all right with you hilda couldnt put her dialysis off any longer so shes out of commission for the rest of the day fine i said more or less meaning it i still wasnt entirely easy in the company of this other myself but as the day went on it got better he wasnt just someone to talk to he was that nearly ideal person for a conversation who was nearly ideal because he had the advantage of thinking exactly the way i did as we moved from one appointment to another we chatted about what was going on around us and if nothing new came out of any of the chat at least it was useful to be able to talk but then the world obtruded itself on us we were just entering the chamber where the techs waited when every screen in the area turned itself on at once and when we saw what was on all those screens it took our minds right off the planned questions the scarecrows were talking to us again chapter fiftyone at least the scarecrows were no longer going to the trouble of faking the face of a human being to deliver their little homilies the creature displayed on the screen was unquestionably a dopey he was squatting comfortably on a goldcolored cushion his little hands busy in his belly bag behind his head was a pretty background landscape distant hills and fleecy white clouds in a blue blue and very earthly sky all faked no doubt the dopey was doing his best to look amiable and trustworthy not an easy job for a dopey when he spoke his voice had the cajoling quality of a latenight goldenoldie disk jockey you know who i am he said the little cat eyes gleaming his fan spread in glorious iridescence i have spoken to you before bearing the generous messages of our beloved leaders who know what is best for all of us and whose patience is greatbut not without limit his plume darkened and his voice became sorrowful but you are a willful species he scolded you have betrayed the trust of the beloved leaders you have wickedly stolen a vehicle which is their property you have begun the construction of armed spacecraft and you have done even worse you have brought to your planet a representative of the despicable horch the beloved leaders cannot permit this to go on therefore they command you to take two steps within the next four days you must broadcast an invitation for representatives of the beloved leaders to come to your planet and as a token of good faith you must rid yourself of this evil monster the horch kill him do so in a public place broadcast his execution and when he is dead amputate all of his limbs and head let it be seen that this is done so there can be no question of the sort of trickery you have shown yourself capable of he raised himself on his little legs and peered sternly into the camera four days he said sternly if you have not complied by that time at that hour you and your entire race will die he stood silent for a moment then sank back on his cushion the colors of his peacock tail brightened into soft pastels and his tone became wheedling you must understand he said that the beloved leaders seek no personal gain from you it is for your own goodindeed if you force them to put an end to your lives even that is for your good since it will speed your way to the eschaton the beloved leaders know that in your present primitive state this is frightening to you for it is what you call death but death is only an incident it will come sooner or later to each of youthe temporary death which all organisms experience it is not to be feared it is only the way which we must all pass in order to reach that great eternity of the eschaton yet the beloved leaders do not wish to take this step unless you force them to it it would be tragic if your entire species went prematurely to the eschaton you are a young race you have not attained full development you cannot ever achieve that on your own that can only happen to you under the wise and benevolent guidance of the beloved leaders that generous proposal is still open to you but you must act now destroy that vile horch invite our people to come to you accept the great gift that is offered you remember four days and if you have not done as instructed at the very moment of the end of that time you and all your species will immediately perish and the dopey curled his lipless little mouth into what he might have thought of as a friendly smile and his image faded from the screen next to me dan m was wearing the strangest expression id ever seen on his face part anger a lot confusion mostly he looked as though he were either going to laugh or cry but dan he complained how the pats guarantee that theres absolutely nothing in orbit that can get here in four days do you think hes bluffing i was staring at the blank screen hardly hearing him no i said i think its worse than that i think maybe weve been worrying about the wrong thing id better talk to hilda right away chapter fiftyt w o when i got to hildas room she was there all right but the medics didnt want to let me in she was sleeping the doctor in charge told me we woke her up after we saw the message from the scarecrows shes watching a replay now but she doesnt want any visitors while shes undergoing dialysis i didnt argue with the man i just pushed him out of the way as i opened her door i called hilda sorry to break in on you but and then i stopped because i saw why hilda morrisey didnt want any visitors i had never seen hilda like that before it was bad enough trying to get used to her whiteenameled box this was worse she was out of her steelenamel shell but she still didnt look anything like the hilda i used to know she was lying flat on an airbed with tubes going into her in a dozen places and a sort of steel corset surrounding her upper body the thing pulsed rhythmically because it was doing hildas breathing for her apart from that all she was wearing was one of those inadequate hospital shifts and she looked smaller older and more defenseless than i had ever imagined her before the sheet that had been thrown over her didnt hide the fact that there wasnt much left of hilda morrisey but she spoke right up as soon as she saw me it isnt going to be a comet is it danno she demanded its something to do with the subs isnt it she had put her finger right on it it was what i had picked up on as soon as i heard the dopey speak the fact that hilda was ahead of me again didnt surprise me she often was which was what made her bearable as a boss her voice did surprise me though it was the voice of the authentic hilda morrisey i guess most of the toxins must have been dialyzed out of her blood by then she still looked terrible but not pathetic anymore i said i think so yes but i want to get something settled first i hesitated then got to the point we arent going to kill beert for them hilda no matter what i wont let that happen and thats definite she gave me a hilda morrisey stare are you giving me orders danno im telling you that we cant afford to he can help us figure out just what the scarecrows are up to and i added well need that robot of his it has a lot of information beert doesnt so get it flown in from arlington right away will you she made a face christ marcus will have a fit all right ill give that order and then ill tell marcus about it i didnt want to let it go at that so i insisted and youll tell him not to get any ideas about stalling the scarecrows by wasting beert in front of the cameras she gave me an opaque look not right away anyway now get the hell out of here so they can take all this crap off me then it got crazy while hilda was getting a team together i took a quick run to the sub there was only one doc on listening duty and it was foozh he was jabbering at the duty guard as i came through the hatch and mewed and whined at me twice as fast as soon as he saw me of course i couldnt understand a word but i could hear the meows and growls that were coming from the speaker lots of them they were busy out there and when pirraghiz and mrranthoghrow got there she began translating at once the subs were doing something all right they werent traveling very far they were pausing at discrete points along the various continental shelves then moving no more than a kilometer or two and pausing again pirraghiz said it sounded like they were depositing things on the sea bottom what things she had no idea the orders from the scout ship never said for what purpose she didnt know that either but i had no doubt that it was bad news an hour later we had a kind of a task force gatheredme and been and his christmas tree plus eight or nine bureau specialists hilda was there back in her box and so was the deputy director he had taken time out from his witch hunt to bring the robot in personand also to let me know that this was all my fault because if i had let him hide beert away in arlington the way he wanted to nobody would have known he was there he was wrong about that of coursewhoever leaked the story would have known about the sub anyway with or without beert i didnt argue i spoke to beert ignoring everybody else something the greatmother said has been nagging at me something about the others killing off rebellious races by poison gas do you remember what it was of course dan he said promptly it is part of our history what do you wish to know what kind of gas how do they get it to the planet he waggled his neck at me it isnt necessary to do that dan on most planets like your own such poisons are already there in the oceans they need only to be released and when i translated all that the yelling began there was no poison gas in the oceans the experts insisted there certainly was beert said stoutly because the greatmother of the greatmother had said so all right snapped the experts what poison are you talking about naturally beerts words meant nothing when he answered nor did the robots when asked but the robot had a better way of communicating it drew pictures for us a big dot with a little dot near it a cluster of a dozen big dots some filled in some just circles with six little dots near it it was the bureaus chemicalwarfare specialist who figured it out theyre diagrams of elements hydrogen and carbon and when the robot said there were four of the second diagram for every one of the first in this poison the chemist blinked and smote her forehead with her hand and said of course it was the first time i had heard the word methane part eleven methane chapter fiftythree all right i admit it i should have thought of it before call it fatigue call it too much going onno just call it that i screwed up thats certainly what hilda told me it was what the deputy director told me too but he didnt waste any time two hours later he and hilda and i pumped up with the bureaus wakeup pills were watching the sun rise on the landing pad where an oceanologist was tumbling off a vtol from new jersey his name was samuel schiel and he came from the lamontdoherty institutewell actually he came from his bed because the deputy directors summons had come in the middle of the night and he barely had time to catch his breath before marcus pell had whisked him into a conference room and the questioning had begun pell didnt even sit down he stood behind the big chair at the head of the table and turned on the man you whats your name schiel is this methane thing possible schiel was unfazed he took a seat halfway down the long table next to me across from hilda looking around the room with interest possible he repeated ruminatively yes in principle mr pell methane is a very common compound its the first member of the alkane hydrocarbons a very simple molecule and theres a great deal of it around in the form of clathrates at least ten to the fifteenth cubic meterspardon oh he moved his lips for a moment doing arithmetic at least ten thousand million million cubic meters of the stuff that is probably more much of its locked up in permafrost in asia and north america but theres a tremendous amount on the sea bottoms if youd care to looki asked my staff to transmit a map of the main deposits to me on the plane he did something to the control for the screens at each place while we were looking at them he investigated the coffee jug at his place found it was full poured himself a cup and waited for us to see what he was talking about i swallowed when i saw where the main deposits were some of the biggest along the atlantic coast of the americas along the pacific shore of panama the bering straiti knew those areas well thats exactly where the subs are concentrating i said pell gave me a shutup look he had obviously figured that out for himself how come you know all this he demanded looking at schiel schiel put down his coffee cup why the methane beds have been investigated quite thoroughly there was some hope of tapping them as a replacement for petroleum resources methane is a very good cleanburning fuel but some of the best deposits are a kilometer deep or more and theyre not easy to exploit perhaps i should explain their physical nature pell sighed reconciling himself to being lectured at by an expert but seeing no way out of it perhaps you goddam should he grumbled schiel nodded briskly and went on the methane content of the clathrates is hydrated he said that means that each methane molecule is surrounded by a sort of cage of water molecules in the form of ice under pressure if the temperature rises or the pressure decreases the clathrate disintegrates when samples are trawled up from the sea bottom they begin to bubble and sizzle and fall apart even before they reach the surface often quite explosively worse there is some evidence that any attempt to exploit these resources for fuel may be quite dangerous you see under the clathrate beds there are trapped bodies of gaseous methane when the crust is broken through the methane gas can escape in great volume mr pell in which case it appears capable of turning the ocean itself into a sort of froth which is no longer dense enough to float a vessel a soviet drilling ship which was mysteriously lost many years ago is thought to have sunk when that happened and there have been conjectures that such events off the coast of the carolinas may have been responsible for some of the alleged disappearances in the socalled bermuda triangle he looked around the room is that what you wanted to know mr pell the deputy director was frowning at the map he stabbed at the carolina coast those submarines he said could they be used to blow a hole in this clathrate cap thing schiel shrugged i know nothing of the scarecrow submarines he said but if they could plant some very large mines yes i think so that might not be necessary though if they simply disturbed the clathrates sufficiently they could start a release which might then sufficiently lower the pressure to cause a greater release entraining more and more clathrates as they rise to the surface once started it could be a runaway effect increasing exponentially as long as the methane held out pell thought that over that would be a pain in the ass he said at last but it doesnt sound fatal all right they can turn some coastal waters into club soda for a while we might lose some shipping but so what it wouldnt destroy the world oh mr pell schiel said forgivingly but it quite well might once a largescale release beganwell similar events have already happened here on earth you know for example it is believed that one such might have ended the ice age the deputy director blinked at him what schiel nodded that was twentytwo thousand years ago he said geologists have determined that there was a huge landslip in the western mediterranean at that time that was when the ice age was in full force worldwide ocean levels were the lowest ever the amount of ice the highest this caused some sea bottom to be exposed in the mediterranean basin around sardinia there were deposits of icy methanecontaining hydrates there as there are in many shallow seas when the sea level dropped the pressure on them fell as i discussed they began to release their methane the methane lubricated the slide the slide released more methanewe think about half a billion tons altogether nearly doubling the amount of methane in the atmosphere at the time and the world warmed up and the ice age ended methane is dangerous stuff you see and that was just one local release actually he said sounding almost pleased to be able to tell us about it there is some evidence that one of the great extinctions of the geologic past took place as the result of a larger event it was when all the present continents were joined together in one great land mass called gondwanaland screw gondwanaland pell snarled what happened why as you may know methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas there would have been widescale warming warming pell looked almost reassured we could stand some warming couldnt we but schiel was shaking his head we wouldnt live long enough to see it i dont think ive made clear just how much methane were talking about mr pell released it could form a layer of gas thirty meters deep covering the entire world because it is denser than either oxygen or nitrogen it would tend to concentrate near the surface we cant breathe methane pells expression was icy now and the scarecrow subs could make this happen schiel looked stubborn given the application of enough heat or physical intervention on a wide enough scale given the likelihood that it could become a selfsustaining reaction yes or no damn it well yes the scientist said the word hung there for a while then the deputy director stirred himself will you excuse us for a moment mr schiel if youll just wait outside he drummed his finger until the scientist was gone taking his coffee with him all right he said then what are our options hilda she spoke right up we only have one immediate option marcus its out of our hands now we have to tell the president negative he said crisply you dont seem to understand weve screwed up were the ones whore supposed to provide intelligence ahead of time and we didnt do it im not telling the president anything until i can tell him what we can do to fix it were going to sit right here until we have a plan he gave me a look you dannerman you know what the subs are like whats wrong with sending out antisubmarine ships with depth charges to take every one of them out he took me by surprise and i gave him a kneejerk response no those things are full of innocent people its the scarecrows on the scout ship that make them run the subs he overrode me screw the innocent freaks im not going to jeopardize the worlds safety for a bunch of space weirdos hilda get me the combined chiefs right now conference call wake them up if you have to hey i said wait a minute marcus pell was as tired as i was and probably even more frazzled it was not a good time to be getting in his hair staring at me in a way that promised no kindness he took a deep breath before he spoke i understand your concern for these animals on the subs i dont want to hear about it again then listen to some common sense i said it cant be done you cant locate the subs except in general terms from what the board in our sub shows and there are twentyfive of them if youre lucky enough to hit one what do you think the other twentyfour will be doing ah he said i see he thought for a moment then you successfully invaded one sub could we use that transit machine thing to do the same with the others hilda answered for me same problem marcus there are twentyfive of them if we were real lucky we might get two or three before the others fired off their whatever it is they fire no marcus we cant take them out one at a time we have to go after the scout ship the deputy director suddenly came to life hell yes he cried excited for the first time that could work a couple of those armed spacecraft are pretty close to ready we send them off to the scout ship blow it out of space marcus hilda said when the scarecrows see those ships coming at them what do you think they would do oh he said hell then we send a commando through that transit machine same as you did for the sub tough men heavily armed they come out of that thing shooting when you strike at the snakes head you dont have to worry about the rest of the animal right dannerman i hated to pour cold water on him but i didnt have a choice i dont think it would work i said when we hit the one sub we had four horch fighting machines and we were only up against two scarecrow warriors and a couple of docsand even so they put up a hell of a fight id guess thered be more in the scout ship and theyd probably be watching the transit machines pretty closely expecting us to attack more likely expecting the horch but itd come out to the same thing hilda spoke up then there is one alternative she said instead of sending them a raiding party what would happen if we send a bomb the deputy director was frowning but that leaves all the subs still in place wouldnt they just push their buttons and start the methane release he was looking at me maybe not i said cautiously if the scout ship was destroyed the crews wouldnt be controlled anymoreexcept for the dopeys but we could get pirraghiz on the horn to talk to them all and theyd deal with their dopeys the others all hate the scarecrows too you know so thats it hilda said we bomb the scout ship i found myself instinctively arguing against that one too i dont think so hilda we dont know how big the scout ship is or how well bulkheaded and theres a limit to the amount of mass the transit machine can handle at one time a few hundred kilograms maybe and i stopped hilda wasnt listening to me as far as i could tell her eyes were on the deputy director who was looking at her with a considering expression i hadnt seen before you arent thinking of chemical explosives are you brigadier morrisey he said that startled me come on hilda i said whatre you talking about nukes but theyve been outlawed all over the world ever since some of the terrorists got their hands on a couple she said reasonably shut up danno she waited for a moment to see if the deputy director was going to say anything else when he didnt she went on ive been hearing these rumors for years marcus latrine gossip about how some nations have been cheating on the nuclear disarmament treaties maybe stashed away a few little backpacksized ones just in case have you heard those stories too he stared at her tightfaced then he sighed shit he said you dont have any idea how much trouble this is going to make more trouble than being exterminated marcus she asked politely he passed a hand over his face all right he said let me go talk to the president chapter fiftyfour things went fast then i dont know who the president gave orders to or what the orders were but by the time i was back in the sub telling pirraghiz what she would have to do about talking to the other sub crews the word came a special jet from some installation in amarillo texas would be arriving in two hours with the materiel that was requisitioned nothing more specific than that but i knew what that materiel was going to be while the docs were left to rerig the subs comm systems so pirraghiz would be able to talk to the crews when the time came hilda and i went into beerts room he was making himself as comfortable as possible on the cot that had never been designed for horch anatomy he lifted his head languidly toward me hello dan he said his voice mournful i was sleeping when i came back here i found myself thinking about our friend the wet one whom we sent to try to liberate his peopleor more likely to his death do you suppose they have killed him yet it was a good question it reminded me a little guiltily that i hadnt given the amphibian a thought since we got back to earth had never even learned his name but when i was translating what beert had said for hilda she broke in screw your noble hippopotamus friend danno tell the horch what were going to do so i did we need your help i finished also your robot to operate the transit machine and find the right channels he waved his neck around thoughtfully for a moment do i have a choice about helping you he asked i shrugged do you want one he considered that then he said oh perhaps not of all the things i have done for you that the greatmother might not approve i think blowing up a ship of the others would be about the least very well let us get the robot and i will instruct him in what you want done the little scarecrow submarine was more crowded than it had ever been intended to be and it still stank i had forgotten about the persistent scorchedfish smell of the sub for the two surprisingly elderly men from amarillo sweating in their white laboratory coats it was something they had never experienced before they didnt like it they muttered to each other as they took the hatch plates off the requisitioned materiel and began to set their fuses there were four of the chromeplated beachballs and i only hoped that the stink wasnt making the men careless in their settings marcus pell insisted on being present though he stayed by my side as far away from the nukes as we could get it wasnt very far and of course that kind of distance wouldnt have helped a bit if they had accidentally triggered one of the damn things at the transit machine beerts christmas tree was methodically sorting out channels to the scout ship with foozh talking to it and pirraghiz translating what are they saying pell demanded his collar was loose and he looked nervous the robot says there are evidently five transit machines on the scout ship hell pell groaned we only have four bombs i didnt respond to that if four nukes couldnt do the job we were out of luck anyway beert drifted over his neck pointed toward the bomb technicians why are those persons so old he asked i told him ive been wondering the same thing i guess there havent been any additions to the nuclear weapons staff in a while which made the deputy director demand a translation of that too then the older of the techs stood up were ready give us the word when you want to start the operation youre sure these things will still work pell barked the man shrugged sure as we can be he said everything checks optimal how about you deputy director are you sure this machine will get them out of here right away because weve got sixtysecond timers on them itll take about half that to activate the fuse pop the hatch back and set the first bomb in the machine if theyre still here thirty seconds later we arent going to know it pell swallowed and turned inquiringly to me ask that thing he ordered pointing to beert there wasnt any point in asking beert again what he had already told us ten times so i just observed to him that it was crowded in here and when he agreed i reported to pell he guarantees it the man from amarillo sighed he glanced at his partner then said all right well start arming the first device in the event the men from amarillo didnt take any thirty seconds i guess they were worried about the time pressure anyway they closed up the first beachball pretty quickly and the two of them together rolled it on its little wheeled pallet over to the transit machine by the time the door was closed and the doc activated the transmission less than twenty seconds had passed and when the doc opened the door again the chamber was empty so far so good reset for the second machine i ordered the robot it didnt move all it did was extend a couple of twiglets questioningly toward beert who sighed you will obey this person he ordered and it did when it reported the setting was complete i told the technicians to ready the second bomb which went as expeditiously as the first but when it came to getting ready for the third the christmas tree fiddled for a while then spoke up no additional transit machines are in operation at the target it appears destruction is complete thank you i said absently thinking beert could not have known what i was thinking about but it was clear that he knew something was going on in my head what is it dan he asked worriedly just as pell ran out of patience what the hell dannerman are we going to send the third bomb or not i gave pell a shake of the head and turned to pirraghiz get on the horn to the subs i ordered tell them to take their dopeys into custody and then as she excitedly began meowing into the microphone i faced beert do you want to go home i asked that shook him up his head darted to within centimeters of my face his jaw dropped dan he whispered pleadingly what are you saying i couldnt meet his eyes just answer the question i said his long neck was trembling with excitement go home dan my belly yearns for it would you allow this marcus pell was turning from pirraghiz to me his expression angry whats she jabbering about whats going on he demanded i ignored pell speaking to the christmas tree can you transmit djabeertapritch to the machines in the nest of the eight plus threes and when it confirmed that it could i ordered set the machine up for transmission and then at last i turned to the nearly apoplectic deputy director i just wanted to make absolutely sure i said apologetically the far shore of time the jobs done the survey ship is destroyed theres nothing left to transmit to he made me repeat it two or three times alternately blinking at me and at pirraghiz as she meowed urgently into the shiptoship microphone i jerked a thumb at the two remaining bombs dont you think you should get the hoists back so we can get these things out of here i suggested that took him by surprise right he said as glad as i thought he would be of the excuse to get away from them and when he was out of the hatch to find the hoist operators i said goodby beert dont linger if he comes back hell try to stop you horch dont cry but beerts hard little nose was running as he wrapped those reptilian arms around me for a moment then leaped into the chamber the men from amarillo were goggling at what was going on but they didnt have any authority to prevent it i had one other thing to say to beert i held the door from closing for a moment making him dart his head at me inquiringly tell them for me beert i said tell them we will fight the others in every way we can we wont let them conquer us but if we have to we will fight the horch as well tell them that i will tell them dan he said as i closed the door and when it opened again the chamber was empty part twelve victory chapter fiftyfive by the time beert was gone the deputy director was already scrambling back down the ladder shouting my name in a very unfriendly way i didnt look at him for that matter i didnt stop to rejoice or even take a deep breath i had more important things to take care of first priority was giving pirraghiz the orders to pass on to the sub crews tell them all to turn off their transit machines and keep them off make sure they do that then i added as an afterthought tell them all to head out to deep water and stay there i didnt want any of them where somebody could try a depth bomb when i was sure she was passing the word on i turned back to die deputy director interrupting his tirade im sorry marcus i said reasonably politely but im too busy to talk to you now that was nowhere near the kind of deference he was used to and it made him yell even louder the hell you say youve got a lot of explaining to do dannerman i sighed and put it less politely shut the hell up i ordered amazingly he did or else had a heart attack he turned a peculiar color and sat down heavily on die nearest flat surface whatever he was doing i let him do it and went back to pirraghiz have they all done what i said i demanded she raised one of her lesser arms to fend the question off while she was meowing into the microphone and listening to the yowls that came back then at last she turned that great pale face toward me and said they are doing it dannerman but not without much trouble and fighting doing it isnt good enough make sure it really gets done by every last one yes dannerman she sighed and began polling the subs one by one when it occurred to me to turn around again pell wasnt there anymore he had evidently gone out of the sub againprobably i thought to line up a firing squad for me at that moment i didnt take much interest in what pell might be up to i was tired and cranky and not all that sure in my mind that i had done the right thing by letting beert go but it was done whatever the consequences might be i had no way to deflect them of those consequences there turned out to be plenty though it took me a while to find out what they all were the deputy director didnt come back that day but lieutenant colonel makalanos did he gave me another of those unfriendly looks but he didnt say anything he just sat down silently watching my every move and occasionally stealing glances at the news screen he had brought with him i wasnt ready to talk to him so i did my best to pretend he wasnt there it wasnt that hard there was plenty of backandforth talk with the subs to keep me busy they had followed my orders every one of them had turned off its transit machine and they were all slipping quietly away from the shallow coastal waters none reported any human attempt to bother them it was time to start asking them questions i didat length and the answers came back the same way after nearly an hour of that i sighed and turned around to face makalanos all right i said id better tell you what they say the subs were doing so you can pass it on to the deputy director he leaned back and scratched his chin i was hoping you might he said i let that go the freed crews the docs and the warriors are all in control now there was a lot of fighting in the sixteen plus eight and onei mean in sub twentyfivetheir dopey tried to activate the methane release manually they had to kill him four or five of the other dopeys got killed too but only one warrior diedhis dopey happened to have a weapon at the wrong time so that was a close one and i added we were right about the methane i think although none of the controlled crews were ever told what was going on and the dopeys the ones that survived arent talking starting a couple of days ago the crews began receiving objects through their transit machines they were tapered metal cylinders that theyd never seen before and their orders were to push the things out through the disposal hatch the crews werent told what the objects were supposed to do dr schiels idea was that they might use incendiaries or maybe just high explosives to blow up and release the trapped methane it looks like he was right i would guess i said striking off on my own that the bombs were meant to be triggered from the scout ship but i dont think they were all in place yet the sub crews were still busy emplacing the things when we blew the main ship up i stopped there makalanos was staring at me jesus he said and theyre still out there those live bombs it was a dumb question but it was one i hadnt thought of shit i said i guess somebodys going to have to pick them up and disarm them before were through anyway get the word out the d ds going to want to know all this oh he said gesturing to one of the cameras the words out all right though whether anyone is paying attention right now i dont know theyve got other things on their minds and he turned his news screen around so i could see what was on it chapter fiftysix things werent going exactly the way i had expected i had always understood that when you won a war it was a big event so big that you stopped everything else to celebrate it extensively with dancing in the streets bands playing maybe a tickertape parade down broadway for the returning heroes with everybody laughing and drinking and hugging the handiest stranger there was no trace of any of that when i looked at the screen what i saw was a freeforall scramble for loot the president had had nearly two hundred ambassadors all trying to make urgent diplomatic representations at onceplus every major executive in his own administration plus congress plus every news medium and just about every single individual in the world who happened to know the telephone number of the white house that was bad news for the deputy directors probable desire to have me shot he would need the presidents permission for that and the president looked to be a lot too busy to give my personal future much of a thought see that was the other thing that was different about winning this war as i understand it the way it was usually done was that the victors took what they wanted that had formerly belonged to the losersit was what they called the spoils of warand everybody was happy this time it couldnt work out that way the victors were everybody in the human race but there were spoils of war all right mostly comprising those twentyfive freeranging scarecrow submarines each one of those subs was packed with so much priceless scarecrow technology that every last nation on earth was demanding to have one for its very own and there just werent anywhere near enough of the things to go around it was pirraghiz who shook me loose from the news screen are you all right dannerman she asked worriedly touching my forehead with one lesser arm like any human mother you appear to be near clinical exhaustion im fine i said although it wasnt true she peered incuriously at the screen but didnt ask me what was going on and i didnt volunteer whats happening with the subs she was looking worried the submarines are quite intact but there is a problem she said the crews no longer have functioning transit machines i was too tired to take her meaning right away damn straight they dont theyre going to keep them that way too she gave me one of those sixarmed shrugs that is the problem she said the crews will be getting hungry well i couldnt have thought of everything it simply had not occurred to me that the transit machines were what kept the sub crews supplied with food and water i swore a little bit and then said reluctantly i guess we could make more food for them with the machine here but maybe were going to have to let them surrender themselves so we can get it to them perhaps not dannerman she offered wrranthoghrow says it is possible for the crews to rework the machines so that there can be no incoming but they can be used to make copies from stored data is that all right if hes sure i said reluctantly she looked at me with reproof of course he is sure i will tell him to give the order and all the time she was talking she had begun touching me all over in the way i had become used to while i was recovering in the compound you require much more rest she informed me motherly and stern you cannot continue with this work without sleep indefinitely is it now an appropriate time to copy your translation module so that one may be inserted in some of your conspecifics i blinked at her i hadnt been thinking about that possibility when she brought it back to my mind it seemed like the best idea id ever heard sharing the translation work with two or three of the linguists would delight them and let me get a little time offnot to mention a little time to think about such personal matters as what i wanted to do about patrice on the other hand on the other hand i had got pretty used to being the most important man in the world i temporized well see about that when we get all this straightened out how long will it take the crews to rejigger their machines when she told me it seemed a reasonable time so we began checking the subs one by one to make sure they could handle the job and while we were doing that i felt colonel makalanos tap me on the shoulder its brigadier morrisey he said shes outside the sub and she wants to talk to you right away i thought about telling hilda what i had told the deputy director still getting out of the sub for a few minutes sounded pretty good to me and besides hilda wasnt the deputy director she was always thorny and sometimes she was just damned brutal but she was my friend so i climbed the ladder up to the hatch and clambered down the one on the other side breathing deeply of the cleaner air hilda was waiting for me at the foot of the ladder well hilda i said whats it going to be are you going to discipline me her box stirred slightly on its wheels she said not me no the president might though he wants to see you that wasnt good news i stared at her vision plate that didnt look back have a heart hilda i cant leave here to go traipsing of to the white house who said white house the presidents got the idea that youre a vip danno important enough for him to come to you right now his plane should be about touching down on the landing strip pop another wakeup pill and get over there hell be waiting for you chapter fiftyseven the president hadnt tried to bring his big air force one to camp smolley he had come in his vtol which was still an incongruously big ship to be perched on the camps little landing strip it was snow white with the lettering the united states of america luminously emblazoned on its side at the planes ramp an army of american marines were guarding the vtol under the eyes of an army of blueberet united nations troops that was as far as hilda was going to go she stood motionless at the foot of die ramp while a couple of marine officers bodysearched me their hands in all my pockets their sniffers all over my body poking into every fold of my clothes at least they didnt bother with body cavities before they allowed me to enter hurry up the female colonel ordered me as she led the way to the presidents cabin the president doesnt have much time apparently he didnt he didnt keep me waiting when the colonel shoved me into his office the president was sitting at his desk looking up from his array of miniscreens to regard me there was no one else in the room just the president and me though i had no doubt there were eyes and recording gadgets in the wallsand maybe even behind some panel a marine sharpshooter with his weapon aimed at my heart just in case when the president had finished looking me over he said sit down talk to me so i did i had never been alone with the president before he looked a lot older than his pictures suntanned face mop of curly white hair the powerful shoulders of the harvard oarsman he had once been he was a lot better listener than i had expected he didnt interrupt he didnt speak at all a couple of times when he wasnt quite catching everything i had to say he cocked one of those bushy white eyebrows at me which i interpreted as a request to clarify so i clarified when i got to the part about letting beert go home he didnt start throwing the book at me he looked if anything amused he didnt speak then either or even push any buttons that i saw but a moment later the office door opened and a pair of goodlooking girls in marine uniform pushed in a dolly with white linen a silver coffeepot and two cups help yourself agent dannerman the president said speaking at last so you took it upon yourself to order the scarecrow subs away from the coast there didnt seem to be any point in trying to explain my reasons so i just said yes sir he nodded maybe that was the smart thing to do or he corrected himself the wise thing anyway its not hard to be smart in politics its a lot tougher to be wise of course that doesnt solve the longrange problem of what to do with the aliens on board no sir the president sipped his coffee meditatively for a moment and then he sighed and began to talk ever since you got here agent james daniel dannerman number three he said your friend marcus pell has been on my ass he likes you even less now he says letting a known enemy of america go freehes talking about your horch friendis something pretty close to his word treason that made me start to open my mouth but he gave me the kind of look that made me close it again see he said i dont agree with him ill tell you what i think i think you were protecting a friend and youve way exceeded your authority to do it dont say yes or no to that dannerman its not an accusation its what i might be doing myself if i were in your shoes and anyway its done so we just have to live with it but it does make a problem he paused long enough to refill his coffee cup motioning me to do the same to mine he didnt seem to be in nearly as much of a hurry as i had thought and then he began to get reminiscent i dont know if you paid any attention to my election he said sixtyseven percent of the voters evidently didnt because they didnt bother to go to the polls at all i won with fiftyfour percent of the thirtythree percent who voted that wasnt much of a mandate actuallythough thats not what i say to the congress i campaigned on two main issues stop inflation stop terrorism so im batting five hundred right about now i havent been able to do a thing about the inflation rate but terrorism is down all over the world did i do that no it happened on my watch so i take the credit but what did it was the scarecrows it has now become pretty clear to most people that someday were all going to find ourselves in a shooting war worse than any weve ever known before and if we dont hang together like the fellow says were sure to hang separately so for the first time in the history of the world the human race is starting to act as though there are more important things than what some part of us wants to do to some other part im not talking about the various nations theyve all got their own superpatriotsi wont name any names but you can probably think of a couple right hereand theyre all getting grabby but we can deal with that as long as the terrorists dont screw everything up they arent doing that dannerman the ira the tamil tigers the militants in our own country the sons of palestine even the lennilenape ghost dancers theyve all been turning in their weapons caches and even the ones that havent gone that far are mostly laying low for that matter the floridians are beginning to talk as though they were part of the united states again i can see it happening myself do you know that nobodys tried to assassinate me for nearly three months and its not just here why a couple of sundays ago the president of the russian republic took his grandchildren for a walk in gorky park without a single bodyguard and nobody roughed them up i like that it makes my job a lot easier and i dont want it to stop he finished his coffee looking into space for a moment as though he were coming to an important decision as a matter of fact he was so two things he said as long as youre exceeding your authority exceed it one more time dont let any of those subs contact any human forces until and how i tell you i dont want them landing anywhere until weve sorted this out a little better all right i said yes sir at that point i would have said yes sir to just about anything the man said good he said the other thing doesnt affect you directly but i think you ought to know today im going to push all the chips into the middle of the table ive asked our un ambassador to call an emergency session of the general assembly and im heading up there as soon as ive finished with you im going to admit that to attack the scarecrow ship we used a few nukes that wed stashed awaywell i dont have much choice about admitting that pell wanted me to claim wed used only conventional chemical bombs but the astronomers have already detected gamma radiation from where the scarecrow ship used to be so thats that and im going to tell the general assembly exactly how many nukes we still have and exactly where theyre hidden and im going to invite un troops to come in to safeguard them and im going to release every last bit of data we have on the scarecrows and the horch including all your translations and all the secret work weve done at the nbi place in arlington and im going to tell them that using my powers as president i am pledging to accept whatever decisions the un makes as to where the submarines at sea should go and what should be done with them and then im going to come back here and face up to the congress god knows what theyll do to me but thats not your problem is it so you go back to work agent dannerman number three andnow what is something bothering you i said sort of i mean yes definitely i was hoping to get out of this job pretty soon the president looked surprised he opened his mouth to speak to me but someone somewhere cleared his throat so instead the president said testily to the air what is it hewitt the air sounded apologetic its your appointment with the ambassador sir if you want to meet with him before you go to the general assembly were cutting it pretty close well cut it a little closer call him to say well be late then to me what did you have in mind so i told him about my hope of fitting some others with language implants and what pirraghiz had said about my needing more rest not to mention my wanting to get on with some of my personal concerns and thenbecause he seemed to own the most sympathetic ear i was likely to have for a whilei went on to tell him what some of those personal concerns were such as patrice adcock when i ran down he took another meditative sip of coffee and then he looked up at me and grinned i love solving other peoples problems he said because theyre always so easy youve got yourself tangled up in a problem that doesnt exist agent dannerman ive met your patrice you know briefing me on threat watch now and then seems like a very nice woman to me why do you think she isnt the real one i frowned because shes a copy naturally naturally she is he agreed but so are you arent you and how real do you think you are shit man marry the girl if shell have you only he said apologetically dont count on any long honeymoons because ive got to say no to making any more translators just now see youre all ive got i cant say i didnt hear the last part of what he said it was on a sort of delay circuit though shunted aside while i considered what he had said about me and patrice as the man said other peoples problems were the easiest to solve especially whenas he saidthe problem didnt exist but was only something i had put into my own head then i woke up to his last remarks i said what he was patient with me the thing is as long as youre the one and only person who can talk to these ah persons from other planets everybody has to be reasonable ill make damn sure this job is made as easy as possible for you dannerman i give you my word but until further notice im afraid youre stuck if thats all right with you he added just as though i had a choice i said glumly i guess he grinned and stood up shaking my hand to show that the interview was over he didnt let go of it right away though he said i know what youre thinking dannerman youre saying to yourself gripes i just got these guys out of the worst trouble theyve ever been in so doesnt that settle it only it doesnt dan it never does you solve one problem and another one comes up and starts biting you on the ass before you have a chance to catch your breath welcome to the real world where the only final solutions come when you die and he added dexterously turning me toward the door as he let go of my hand if these people are right maybe not even then
