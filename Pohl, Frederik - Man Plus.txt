one an astronaut and his world it is necessary to tell you about roger torraway one human being does not seem particularly important when there are eight billion alive not more important than for example a single microchip in a memory store but a single chip can be decisive when it carries an essential bit and torraway was important in just that way he was a goodlooking man as people go famous too or had been there had been a time when roger torraway hung in the sky for two months and three weeks along with five other astronauts they were all dirty horny and mostly bored that wasnt what made him famous that was just people in the news stuff fit for two sentences on the seven oclock wrapup on a dull night but he did get famous in bechuanaland and baluchistan and buffalo people knew his name time gave him its cover he didnt have it all to himself he had to share it with the rest of his team in the orbiting lab because they were the ones who got lucky and rescued the soviet bunch that came back to earth with no steering jets so they were all famous men overnight torraway was twentyeight years old when that happened and had just married a greeneyed blackhaired teacher of ceramic sculpture dorrie on earth was what made him yearn and rog in orbit was what made dorrie a celebrity herself which she loved it took something special to make an astronauts wife newsworthy there were so many of them they looked so much alike the newspersons used to think that nasa picked the astronauts wives out of the entries in miss georgia contests they all had that look as though as soon as they changed out of their bathing suits they would show you some batontwirling or would recite the female of the species dorrie torraway was a little too intelligentlooking for that although she was also definitely pretty enough for that she was the only one of the astronaut wives to get major space in both ladies home journal and ms rog was all for the nonfamily he was all for everything dorrie wanted because he was for dorrie very much in that respect he was a little less like his fellows who had mostly discovered fine female fringe benefits from the space program in other ways he was just like them bright healthy smart personable technically trained the newspersons thought for a while that the astronauts themselves also came from an assembly line somewhere they were available in a range of twenty centimeters in height and about a dozen years in age and came in a choice of four shades of skin color from milk chocolate to viking their hobbies were chess swimming hunting flying skydiving fishing and golf they mingled easily with senators and ambassadors when they retired from the space program they found jobs with aerospace companies or with lost causes needing a new publicity image these jobs paid very well astronauts were valuable products they were not only prized by the publicity media and the man in the street we valued them very highly too what the astronauts represented was a dream the dream was priceless to the man in the street especially if it was a dank stinking calcutta street where families slept on the sidewalk and roused themselves at dawn to queue for the one free bowl of food it was a gritty grimy world and space gave it a little bit of beauty and excitement not much but better than none at all the astronauts formed a tight little community all around tonka oklahoma like baseball families when each man flew his first mission he joined the major leagues from then on they were rivals and teammates they fought one another to get into the lineup and coached one another from the baselines it was the dichotomy of the professional athlete no aging knuckleballer sitting on the bench and staring at the latest riflearmed kid felt more sick and angry envy than the backup man to a planetary landing felt when he watched his number one suit up rog and dorrie fit nicely into that community they made friends easily they were just oddball enough to be distinctive not odd enough to worry anyone if dorrie didnt want to have children herself she was nice to the children of the other wives when vic samuelson was out of radio contact for five days on the far side of the sun and verna samuelson came taken down with early labor pains dorrie took vernas three infants into her own home none of them was over five years old two of them were still in diapers and she changed them uncomplainingly while other wives took care of vernas house and verna took care of giving birth to her fourth in the nasa hospital at the christmas parties rog and dorrie never got the drunkest nor were they ever the first to leave they were a nice couple they lived in a nice world in that they were they knew lucky the rest of the world wasnt all that nice the little wars chased themselves all over asia and africa and latin america western europe was sometimes strangled by strikes and often crippled by shortages and when winter came it usually shivered people were hungry and a lot of them were angry and there were very few cities a person would want to walk in alone at night but tonka kept itself unpermissive and pretty safe and astronauts visited mercury and mars as well as the moon swam into the halos of comets and hung in orbit around gas giants torraway himself had flown five major missions first he flew in one of the shuttle flights to replenish spacelab back in the early days after the freeze when the space program was just getting on its feet again then he spent eightyone days in the secondgeneration space station this was his big moment the one that got him the cover of time the russkis had fired off a manned mission to mercury and it had got there all right and landed all right and taken off for the return trip all right but nothing after that was all right the russians had always had trouble with their stabilizing thrusters several of the early cosmonauts had set themselves spinning had not been able to stop and had vomited helplessly all over the insides of their spacecrafts this time they had trouble again and used up their attitudecorrection reserves so they managed to get themselves into a wideassed elliptical orbit around earth but they had no way to get out of it safely or to stay in it safely either their control was only approximate by then and the periterran point was low enough inside the ionosphere of earths atmosphere to heat them up pretty badly but roger and the other five americans were sitting there in a spacecraft designed for tug duty with fuel hoarded for half a dozen more missions that wasnt any too much but they made it do they matched course and velocity with the avrora dva linked up and got the cosmonauts out what a spectacle of freefall bear hugs and bristly kisses back in the space tug with what the russians had grabbed up to bring with them they had a party currant juice toasting tang pвtй traded for cheeseburgers and two orbits later the avrora meteored in like a bright exhalation in the evening said yuli bronin the cosmonaut who had gone to oxford and kissed his rescuers again when they got back down to earth belted in two to a hammock closer than lovers they were all heroes and they were all adored even roger even by dorrie but that was long ago since then roger torraway had done two circumlunar flights tending ship while the radiotelescope crews conducted their orbital tests on the big new hundredkilometer radio mirror on the farside and finally he was on the aborted mars lander another time when they were lucky to get everyone back on earth in one piece but by then the glamour was gone once more it had just been bad luck and mechanical failures nothing dramatic so most of rogers work since then had been well diplomatic he played golf with senators on the space committee and commuted to the eurospace installations in zurich and munich and trieste he had a modest sale with his memoirs he served as backup on an occasional mission as the space program declined rapidly from national priority to contingencyplanning exercises he had less and less that mattered to do still he was backing up a mission now although he didnt talk about it when he was wooing political support for the agency he wasnt allowed to this new manned mission which looked as though it would actually be approved sooner or later was the first one in the space program that had been classified top secret we expected a great deal from roger torraway although he was not much different from any of the other astronauts a little overtrained a lot underemployed a good deal discontented with what was happening in their jobs but very much unwilling to trade them for any others as long as there was still a chance to be great again they were all like that even the one that was a monster two what the president wanted the man who was a monster was on torraways mind a lot roger had a special interest he was sitting in the copilots seat at twentyfour thousand meters over kansas watching a blip on the idf radar slide smoothly off the screen shit said the pilot the blip was a soviet concordski iii their cb had been racing it ever since they had picked it up over the garrison dam reservoir torraway grinned and throttled back another tiny increment with the boost in relative speed the concordski blip picked up a momentum we were losing him the pilot said glumly where do you reckon hes going venezuela maybe he better be said torraway considering how much fuel the both of you were burning up yeah well said the pilot not at all embarrassed at the fact that he had been well over the international treaty limit of mach whats happening at tulsa usually they let us come straight in with a vip like you probably some bigger vip landing now said roger it wasnt a guess because he knew who the vip was and they didnt come any bigger than the president of the united states you fly this thing pretty good offered the pilot generously want to land it i mean when they let us do that thing thanks no id better go back and sort out my junk but he stayed in the seat looking down they had begun the descent and the patchy field of l cumulus was just below them they could feel the bumps from the updrafts over the clouds torraway took his hands off the controls as the pilot took over they would be passing over tonka pretty soon off to the right he wondered how the monster was getting along the pilot was still feeling generous you dont do much flying any more do you only when somebody like you lets me no sweat what do you do anyway if you dont mind my asking i mean besides viping it around torraway had an answer all ready for that administration he said he always said that when people asked what he did sometimes the people who asked had proper security clearance not only with the government but with the private radar in his own mind that told him to trust one person and not another then he said i make monsters if what they said next indicated that they too were in the know he might go a sentence or two farther there was no secret about the exomedicine project everyone knew that what they did in tonka was prepare astronauts to live on mars what was secret was how they did it the monster if torraway had said too much he would have jeopardized both his freedom and his job and roger liked his job it supported his pretty wife in her pottery shop it gave him the feeling of doing something that people would remember and it took him to interesting places back when he was an active astronaut he had been to even more interesting places but they were out in space and kind of lonely he liked better the places he went to in private jets with flattering diplomats and impressionable cocktailparty women to greet him when he got there of course there was the monster to think about but he didnt really worry about that much they came in over the cimarron river or the crooked red gully that would be the river when it rained again bent the jet flow to almost straight down cut back on the power and eased gently in thanks roger said to the pilot and went back to collect his gear from the vip cabin this time it had been beirut rome seville and saskatoon before he got back to oklahoma each place hotter than the place before because they were expected at the ceremonial briefing for the president dorrie met him at the airport motel he changed swiftly into the clothes she had brought him he was glad to be home glad to be getting back to making monsters and glad to be back with his wife while he was getting out of the shower he had a swift and powerful erotic impulse he had a clock inside his head that kept track of what pieces of time were available so he did not need to check his watch there was time it would not matter if they were a few minutes late but dorrie wasnt in the chair where he had left her the tv was going her cigarette was burning out in the ashtray but she was gone roger sat on the edge of the bed with a towel wrapped around him until the clock in his head said there was not enough time left to matter then he began to dress he was tying his tie when dorrie rapped on the door sorry she said when he opened for her i couldnt find the coke machine one for you and one for me dorrie was almost as tall as roger brunette by choice greeneyed by nature she took a brush from her bag and touched up the back and sleeves of his jacket then touched coke cans with him and drank wed better go she said you look gorgeous you look screwable he said putting his hand on her shoulder i just put lipstick on she said turning her lips away and allowing him to kiss her cheek but im glad to see the seсoritas didnt use you all up he chuckled goodhumoredly it was their joke that he slept with a different girl in every city he liked the joke it wasnt true his couple of generally unsatisfactory experiments at adultery had been more shabby and troublesome than rewarding but he liked thinking of himself as the sort of man whose wife had to worry about the attentions of other women lets not keep the president waiting he said ill check out while you get the car they did not in fact keep the president waiting they had more than two hours to get through before they even saw him roger was familiar with the general process of being screened since it had happened to him before it wasnt just the president of the united states who was taking percent overlap precautions against assassins these days roger had been a whole day getting to see the pope and even so there had been a swiss guard holding a biretta standing right behind him every minute he was in the papal chamber half of the top brass of the lab was here for the briefing the senior lounge had been cleaned and polished for the occasion and did not look like its familiar coffeedrinking self even the blackboards and the paper napkins that were used for scratch paper were tucked away out of sight folding screens had been set up in the corners and the shades of the nearest windows discreetly pulled down that was for the physical search roger knew after that they would have their interviews with the psychiatrists then if everyone passed if no lethal hypodermic turned up in a hatpin or murderous obsession turned up in a head they would all go to the auditorium and there the president would join them four secret service men participated in the process of searching frisking magnetometering and identifying the male guests though only two of the men physically took part the other two just stood there presumably ready to draw and fire at need female secret service personnel searched the wives and kathleen doughty the women were searched behind one of the shoulderhigh screens but roger could read from the expressions on his wifes face the progress of the patting probing hands dorrie did not like being touched by strangers there were times when she did not like being touched at all but above all not by strangers when rogers own turn came he understood some of the cold anger he had seen on his wifes face they were being unusually thorough his armpits were investigated his belt was loosened and the cleft of his buttocks probed his testicles were palpated everything in his pockets came out the handkerchief at his breast was shaken open and swiftly refolded neater than before his belt buckle and watchband were studied through a loupe everyone had the same treatment even the director who gazed around the room with goodnatured resignation while fingers combed the kinky hair under his arms the only exception was don kayman who had worn his cassock in view of the formality of the occasion and after some whispered discussion was escorted into another room to take it off sorry father said the guard but you know how it is don shrugged left with the man and came back looking annoyed roger was beginning to feel annoyed too it would have been sensible he thought for them to have passed some of the people on to the shrinks as soon as they had had their search completed after all these were highpowered types and their time was worth money but the secret service had its own system and operated by stages it was not until everyone had been searched that the first group of three was conducted to the typist rooms evacuated specially to make room for the interviews rogers shrink was black by courtesy actually a sort of coffeecream color by complexion they sat in facing straightbacked chairs with eighteen inches between their knees the psychiatrist said ill make this as short and painless as i can are your parents both alive no actually neither of them is my father died two years ago my mother when i was in college what sort of work did your father do rented fishing boats in florida with half his mind roger described the old mans key largo boat livery while with the other half he maintained his twentyfourhouraday surveillance of himself was he showing enough annoyance at being questioned like this not too much was he relaxed enough more relaxed than enough ive seen your wife said the psychiatrist a very sexylooking woman do you mind my saying that not at all said roger bristling some white people would not like to hear that from me how do you feel about it i know shes sexy roger snapped thats what made me want to marry her would you mind if i went a step further and asked how the screwing is no of course not well hell yes i mind said roger savagely its about like anybody elses i guess after being married a few years the psychiatrist leaned back looking thoughtfully at roger he said in your case dr torraway this interview is pretty much a formality youve had quarterly checks for the last seven years and profiled well within the normal range every time theres nothing violent or unstable in your history let me just ask you if you feel uneasy about meeting the president a little awed maybe said roger shifting gears thats natural enough did you vote for dash sure wait the hell a minute thats none of your business right dr torraway you can go back to the briefing room now they didnt actually let him go back in the same room but in one of the smaller conference chambers kathleen doughty joined him almost at once they had worked together for two and a half years but she was still formal looks like weve passed mr dr colonel torraway sir she said her eyes focused as usual on a point over his left shoulder the cigarette held between her face and him ah good a little libation she said and reached out past him a livened waiter no roger reminded himself a secret service man wearing a waiters uniform was standing there with a tray of drinks roger took a whiskey and soda the big prosthesiologist accepted a small glass of dry sherry be sure you drink it all she whispered to his shoulder they put something in it i think something what to calm you down if you dont drink it all they put an armed guard behind you to humor her roger drank his whiskey straight down but he wondered how someone with her delusions and fears had passed the psychiatric clearance so readily his five minutes with the shrink had reinforced his selfobserving stance and he was busily analyzing with one part of his mind why did he feel uneasy in this womans presence not just because she was wiggy in her mannerisms he wondered if the trouble was that she admired his courage so much he had tried to explain to her that being an astronaut no longer took much courage no more than flying a transport probably less than driving a cab of course as a backup for man plus there was a very real danger but only if the men ahead of him in line all dropped out and that was not a chance to cause much worry nevertheless she went on regarding him with that intensity that in some lights seemed to be admiration and in others pity with the other part of his mind as always he was alert for his wife when she finally came in she was angry and for her disheveled the hair she had spent an hour putting up was now down it hung waistlength a fine frothy fall of black that made her look like a tenniel drawing of alice if tenniel had been working for playboy at the time roger hurried over to soothe her a job which took so much of his attention that he was caught offguard when he felt a sudden stir and heard someone say not very loud or formally ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states fitzjames deshatine came grinning and nodding into the room looking exactly like himself on television only shorten without prompting the lab people sorted themselves into a semicircle and the president went around it shaking every hand with the project director at his side making the introductions deshatine had been beautifully briefed he had the politicians trick of catching every name and making some sort of personal response to kathleen doughty it was glad to see some irish in this crew dr doughty to roger it was we met once before colonel torraway after that fine job with the russians lets see that must be seven years ago when i was chairman of the senate committee perhaps you remember certainly roger remembered and was flattered and knew he was being flattered that the president remembered to dorrie it was good heavens mrs torraway how come a pretty girl like you wastes herself on one of these scientific johnnies roger stiffened a little when he heard that it was not so much that it was downputting to him it was the kind of empty compliment dorrie always disdained but she was not disdaining it coming from the president of the united states it brought a sparkle to her eyes what a beautiful man she whispered following his progress as he made the circle when he had finished going around the semicircle he hopped to the little platform and said well friends i came here to look and listen not to talk but i do want to thank every one of you for putting up with the nonsense they make you go through to have me around im sorry about that it isnt my idea they just tell me its necessary as long as there are so many wacks around and as long as the enemies of the free world are what they are and were the kind of open trusting people we are he grinned directly at dorrie tell me did they make you soak your fingernails before they let you in dorrie laughed musically startling hen husband they certainly did mr president just like my manicurist she called sorry about that they say thats to make sure that you dont have any secret biochemical poisons to scratch me with when we shake hands well you got to do what the man says i guess anyway he chuckled if you think its a nuisance for you pretty ladies you should see how my old cat acts when they do it to her good thing she didnt really have poison on her claws last time they did it she scored on three secret service men my nephew and two of her own kittens before she was through he laughed and roger was a little surprised to find that he and donrie and the rest were joining in anyway said the president coming to the point im grateful for your courtesy and i am one thousand times more grateful for the way youre pushing the man plus project through i dont have to tell you what it means to the free world theres mars out there the only piece of real estate around thats worth having apart from the one were all standing on right now by the end of this decade its going to belong to somebody there are only two choices it will belong to them or it will belong to us and i want it to be us you people are the ones that are going to make sure that happens because youre going to give us the man plus that will live on mars i want to thank you deeply and sincerely from the bottom of my heart in the name of every living human being in the free world democratic lands for making this dream possible and now he said smothering an attempt at a round of polite applause i think its time i stopped talking and started listening i want to see whats happening with our man plus general scanyon its all yours right mr president vern scanyon was director of the laboratory division of the grissom memorial institute of space medicine he was also a retired twostar general and acted it he checked his watch glanced at his executive assistant for confirmation and said we have a few minutes before commander hartnett finishes his warmup tests suppose we look in on him on the closed circuit for a minute then ill try to tell you whats going to happen today the room darkened a tv projection screen lighted up behind the platform there was a scrape as one of the waiters moved a chair for the president to sit in he muttered something the chair was moved back and the president nodded shadowy in the flicker from the projection screen and looked up the screen showed a man he did not look like a man his name was will hartnett he was an astronaut a democrat a methodist a husband a father an amateur tympanist a beautifully smooth ballroom dancer but to the eye he was none of those things to the eye he was a monster he did not look human at all his eyes were glowing redfaceted globes his nostrils flared in flesh folds like the snout of a starnosed mole his skin was artificial its color was normal heavy sun tan but its texture was that of a rhinoceross hide nothing that could be seen about him was of the appearance he had been born with eyes ears lungs nose mouth circulatory system perceptual centers heart skin all had been replaced or augmented the changes that were visible were only the icebergs tip what had been done inside him was far more complex and far more important he had been rebuilt for the single purpose of fitting him to stay alive without external artificial aids on the surface of the planet mars he was a cyborg a cybernetic organism he was part man and part machine the two disparate sections fused together so that even will hartnett looking at himself in the mirror on the occasions when he was permitted to see a mirror did not know what of him was him and what had been added in spite of the fact that nearly everyone in the room had actually played a part in creating the cyborg in spite of the familiarity all of them had had with his photos tv image and his person itself there was a muffled gasp as the tv camera caught him he was doing endless effortless pushups the view was from a yard or so from the top of his strangely formed head and as hartnett locked himself up on his arms his eyes came level with the camera glinting from the facets that gave him multiple scanning of the environment he looked very strange roger remembering the old movies of his childhood hours before the tv thought that his good old buddy looked a lot weirder than any animated carrot or magnified beetle on the horror shows hartnett had been born in danbury connecticut every visible artifact he wore had been manufactured in california oklahoma alabama or new york but none of it looked human or even terrestrial he looked martian in the sense that form follows function martian he was he was shaped for mars in a sense too he was there already grissom labs had the finest marsnormal tanks in the world and hartnetts pushups were on iron oxide sands in a pressure chamber where the weight of gas had been dropped to ten millibars only percent of the thrust on the outside of the double glass walls the temperature of the sparse gas molecules around him was held at fortyfive degrees below zero celsius batteries of highultraviolet lamps flooded the scene with the exact spectrum of sunlight on a martian winter day if the place where hartnett was was not truly mars it was close enough to fool even a martian if there had ever been such things as martians in every respect but one in all but that one respect a ras thavas or a wellsian mollusk might have emerged from sleep looked about him and decided that he was indeed on mars on a late fall day in the middle latitudes shortly after sunrise the one anomaly simply could not be helped he was subject to standard earth gravity instead of the fractional attraction that would be proper for the surface of mars the engineers had gone so far as to calculate the cost of flying the entire marsnormal tank in a jet conversion dropping it along a calculated parabola to simulate at least for ten or twenty minutes at a time the proper martian weights they had decided against it on the grounds of cost and pondering they had estimated allowed for and finally dismissed the effects of the one anomaly the one thing no one feared might go wrong with hartnetts new body was that it might be too weak for any stresses that might be placed on it he was already lifting fivehundredpound weights when he really reached mars he would be able to carry more than half a ton in a sense hartnett on earth was more hideous than he would be on mars because his telemetry equipment was as monstrous as himself pulse temperature and skin resistance sensor pads clung to his shoulders and head probes reached under the tough artificial skin to measure his internal flows and resistances transmitter antennae fanned out like a peasants broom from his backpack everything that was going on in his system was being continually measured encoded and transmitted to the meterpersecond broadband recording tapes the president was whispering something roger torraway found himself leaning forward to catch the end of it he hear what we say in here not until i cycle us through his communications net said general scanyon uhhuh said the president slowly but whatever it had been that he intended to say if the cyborg couldnt hear him he didnt say it roger felt a twinge of sympathy he himself still had to select what he said when the cyborg could hear and censored what he said even when old hartnett wasnt around it was simply not right that anything that had drunk a beer and fathered a child should be so ugly all the words that were relevant were invidious the cyborg appeared willing to keep up his metronome exercising forever but someone who had been counting cadence one and two one and two came to a halt and the cyborg stopped too he stood up methodically and rather slowly as though it were a new dance step he was practicing with a reflex action that no longer had a function he rubbed the back of a thickskinned hand against his plasticsmooth and browless forehead in the darkness roger torraway shifted position so that he could see better past the famous craggy profile of the president even in outline roger could see that the president was frowning slightly roger put his arm around his wifes waist and thought about what it must be like to be the president of three hundred million americans in a touchy and treacherous world the power that flowed through the man in the darkness ahead of him could throw fusion bombs into every hidden corner of the world in ninety minutes time it was power of war power of punishment power of money presidential power had brought the man plus project into being in the first place congress had never debated the funding knew only in the most general terms what was going on the enabling act had been called a bill to provide supplementary space exploration facilities at presidential discretion general scanyon said mr president commander hartnett would be glad to show you some of the capacities of his prostheses weightlifting high jump whatever you like oh hes worked hard enough for one day smiled the president right then well go ahead sir he spoke softly into the communicator microphone and then turned back to the president todays test is to disassemble and repair a short in the corn unit under field conditions well estimate seven minutes for the job a panel of our own shop repairmen operating with all their tools in their own workshops averaged about five minutes so if commander hartnett makes it in the optimal time that is pretty good evidence of close motor control yes i see that said the president whats he doing now just waiting sir were going to cycle him up to one hundred and fifty millibars so he can hear and talk a little more easily the president said acutely i thought you had equipment to talk to him in total vacuum well ah yes sir we do weve had a little trouble with that at present our basic communication facility at marsnormal conditions is visual but we expect to have the voice system functioning shortly yes i hope so said the president at the level of the tank thirty meters into the ground under the room they were in a graduate student functioning as a lab assistant responded to a cue and opened a valve not to the external atmosphere but to the tanks of marsnormal gas that were mixed and ready in the pressure sink gradually the pressure built up to a thin deepening whistle the adding on of pressure to the millibar level did not benefit hartnetts functioning in any way his redesigned body ignored most environmental factors it could equally well tolerate arctic winds total vacuum or a muggy day at the earths equator with the air at millibars and soggy with damp one was as comfortable to him as another or as uncomfortable for hartnett had reported that his new body ached tweaked and chafed they could just as easily have opened the valves and let the ambient air rush in but then it would all have had to be pumped out again for the next test at last the whistle stopped and they heard the cyborgs voice it was dollshrill thanksss hold eet dere weel you the low pressure played tricks with his diction especially as he no longer had a proper trachea and larynx to work with after a month as a cyborg speaking was becoming strange to him for he was getting out of the habit of breathing anyway from behind roger the labs expert in vision systems said glumly they know those eyes arent made to stand sudden pressure changes serve them right if one of them cracks on them roger winced with the fantasied pain of a faceted crystalline eyeball splintering in his socket his wife laughed have a seat brad she said pulling away from rogers arm absently roger made room staring up at the screen the cadencecounting voice was saying on the tick five four three two one start sequence the cyborg squatted clumsily over the entry plate of a blackfinished metal canister without haste he slid a bladethin screwdriver into a nearly invisible slot made a precise quarter turn repeated the movement again in another place and lifted off the plate the thick fingers sorted carefully through the multicolored spaghetti of the internal wiring found a charred redandwhitecandystriped strand detached it shortened it to remove the burned insulation stripped it down by simply pinching it through the nails and held it to a terminal the longest part of the operation was waiting for the fluxing iron to heat that took more than a minute then the new joint was brazed the spaghetti stuffed back inside the plate replaced and the cyborg stood up six minutes eleven and twofifths seconds reported the counting voice the project director led a round of applause he then stood up and delivered a short address he told the president that the purpose of the man plus project was to so modify a human body that it could survive on the surface of mars as readily and safely as a normal man could walk across a kansas wheat field he reviewed the manned space program from suborbital flight through space station and deep probe he listed some of the significant data about mars land area actually greater than earths in spite of its smaller diameter because there were no seas to waste surface temperature range suitable for life suitably modified to be sure potential wealth incalculable the president listened attentively although to be sure he knew every word then he said thanks general scanyon just let me say one thing he climbed nimbly up to the platform and smiled thoughtfully down at the scientists when i was a boy he began the world was simpler the big problem was how to help the emerging free nations of earth enter the community of civilized countries those were the iron curtain days it was them on their side locked in quarantined and all the rest of us on ours well he went on things have changed the free world has had bad times once you get off our own north american continent what have you got collectivist dictatorships everywhere you look bar one or two holdouts like sweden and israel im not here to rake up ancient history whats done is done and theres no point blaming anybody everybody knows who lost china and gave cuba to the other side we know what administration let england and pakistan fall we dont have to talk about those things were just looking toward the future and i tell you ladies and gentlemen he said earnestly the future of the free human race lies with you maybe weve had some setbacks here on our own planet thats over and done with we can look out into space we look and what do we see we see another earth the planet mars as the distinguished director of your project general scanyon just said its a bigger planet than the one we were born on in the ways that are important and it can be ours thats where the future of freedom is and its up to you to give it to us i know you will im counting on every one of you he looked thoughtfully around the room meeting every eye the old dash charisma was making itself felt all over the room then he smiled suddenly said thank you and was gone in a wave of secret service men three man becoming martian time was when the planet mars looked like another earth the astronomer schiaparelli peering through his milanese telescope at the celebrated conjunction of saw what he thought were channels announced them as canali and had them understood as canals by half the literate population of earth including nearly all the astronomers who promptly turned their telescopes in the same direction and discovered more canals then they must have been dug for a purpose what purpose to hold water there was no other explanation that saved the facts the logic of the syllogism was compelling and by the turn of the century there was hardly a doubter in the world it was accepted as lore that mars held an older wiser culture than our own if only we could somehow speak to them what marvels we would learn percival lowell mused over a sketching pad and came up with a first attempt draw great euclidean shapes on the sahara desert he said line them with brushwood or dig them as trenches and fill them with oil then on some moonless night when mars is high in the african heavens set them afire those alien martian eyes that he took to be fixed firmly to their alien martian telescopes would see they would recognize the squares and triangles they would understand that communication was intended and out of their older wisdom they would find a way to respond not everybody believed quite as much quite so firmly as lowell some said that mars was too small and too cold ever to harbor a hugely intelligent race dig canals oh yes that was a simple enough peasant skill and a race that was dying of thirst could well manage to scratch out ditches even enormous ditches visible across interplanetary space to keep itself alive but beyond that the environment was simply too harsh a race living there would be like the eskimos forever trapped on the threshold of civilization because the world outside their ice huts was too hostile to grant them leisure to learn abstractions no doubt when our telescopes were able to resolve the individual martian face we would see only a brutish mask stolid and stunned brother to the ox able to move soil and to plant crops yes but not to aspire to a life of the mind but wise or brutal martians were there or so thought the best opinion of the times then better telescopes were built and better ways were found to understand what they disclosed to the lens and the mirror was added the spectroscope and the camera in the eyes and understanding of astronomers mars swam a little closer every day at every step as the image of the planet itself grew more sharp and clear the vision of its putative inhabitants became more cloudy and less real there was too little air there was too little water it was too cold the canals broke up under better resolution into irregular blotches of surface markings the cities that should have marked their junctions were not there by the time of the first mariner flybys the martian race which had never lived except in the imagination of human beings was irrevocably dead it still seemed that life of a sort could exist perhaps lowly plants even a rude sort of amphibian but nothing like a man on the surface of mars an airbreathing waterbased creature like a human being could not survive for a quarter of an hour it would be the lack of air that would kill him most quickly his death would not be from simple strangulation he would not live long enough for that to happen in the millibar pressure of the surface of mars his blood would boil away and he would die in agony of something like the bends if he somehow survived that then he would die of lack of air to breathe if he survived both of those given air in a backpack and a face mask fed with a mixture of gases that did not contain nitrogen at some intermediate pressure level between earth and marsnormal he would still die he would die from exposure to unshielded solar radiation he would die from the extremes of martian temperature at its best a warmish spring day at its coldest worse than antarctic polar night he would die from thirst and if he could somehow survive all of those he would die more slowly but surely from hunger since there was nowhere on the surface of mars one morsel that a human being could eat but there is another kind of argument that contradicts the conclusions drawn from objective facts man is not bound by objective facts if they inconvenience him he changes them or makes an end run around them man cannot survive on mars however man cannot survive in the antarctic either but he does man survives in places where he ought to die by bringing a kinder environment with him he carries what he needs his first invention along those lines was clothing his second storable food like dried meat and parched grain his third fire his most recent the whole series of devices and systems that gave him access to the sea bottoms and to space the first alien planet men walked on was the moon it was even more hostile than mars in that the vital supplies of which mars had very little air water and food did not on the moon exist at all yet as early as the s men visited the moon carrying with them air and water and everything else they needed in lifesupport systems mounted on their spacesuits or built into their landing modules from there it was no trick to build the systems bigger it was not easy because of the magnitudes involved but it was straightforward scaling up to the point of semipermanent and not far from selfsustaining closedcycle colonies the first problem of support was purely logistic for each man you needed tons of supplies for each pound of cargo blasted into space you spent a million dollars worth of fuel and hardware but it could be done mars is orders of magnitude more remote the moon circles the earth only a quarter of a million miles out at its very closest a few times in a century mars is more than a hundred times as far mars is not only distant from the earth it is farther than earth from the sun whereas the moon receives as much energy per square inch as the earth does mars by the law of inverse squares gets only half as much from some point on earth a rocket can be sent to the moon at any hour of any day but mars and earth do not circle each other both circle the sun and as they do so at different speeds they are sometimes not very close and sometimes very far it is only when they are at minimal travel distances that a rocket can efficiently be sent from one to another and those times occur only once in every period of two years for one month and some weeks even the factors in marss makeup which make it more like the earth work against maintaining a colony there it is bigger than the moon and thus its gravity is more like earths but because it is bigger and pulls harder a rocket needs more fuel to land on it and more fuel to take off again what it all comes down to is that a colony on the moon can be supported from earth a colony on mars cannot at least a colony of human beings cannot but what if one reshapes a human being suppose one takes the standard human frame and alters some of the optional equipment theres nothing to breathe on mars so take the lungs out of the human frame replace them with microminiaturized oxygen regeneration catcracking systems one needs power for that but power flows down from the distant sun the blood in the standard human frame would boil all right eliminate the blood at least from the extremities and the surface areas build arms and legs that are served by motors instead of muscles and reserve the blood supply only for the warm protected brain a normal human body needs food but if the major musculature is replaced by machines the food requirement drops it is only the brain that must be fed every minute of every day and fortunately in terms of energy requirements the brain is the least demanding of human accessories a slice of toast a day will keep it fed water it is no longer necessary except for engineering losses like adding hydraulic fluid to a cars braking system every few thousand miles once the body has become a closed system no water needs to be flushed through it in the cycle of drink circulate excrete or perspire radiation a twoedged problem at unpredictable times there are solar flares and then even on mars there is too much of it for health the body must therefore be clothed with an artificial skin the rest of the time there is only the normal visible and ultraviolet light from the sun it is not enough to maintain heat and not quite enough even for good vision so more surface must be provided to gather energy hence the great bateared receptors on the cyborg and to make vision as good as it can be made the eyes are replaced with mechanical structures if one does all these things to a human being what is left is no longer precisely a human being it is a man plus large elements of hardware the man has become a cybernetic organism a cyborg the first man to be made into a cyborg was probably willy hartnett there was some doubt there were persistent rumors of a chicom experiment that had succeeded for a while and then failed but it was pretty clear that hartnett was at least the only one alive at this particular moment he had been born in the regular human way and had worn the regular human shape for thirtyseven years it was only in the last eighteen months that he had begun to change at first the changes were minor and temporary his heart was not removed it was only bypassed now and then by a swift softplastic impeller that he wore for a week at a time strapped on a shoulder his eyes were not removed either then they were only sealed closed with a sort of gummy blindfold while he practiced recognizing the perplexing shapes of the world as they were revealed to him through a shrilly buzzing electronic camera that was surgically linked to his optic nerve one by one the separate systems that would make him a martian were tested it was only when each component had been tested and adjusted and found satisfactory that the first permanent changes had been made they were not really permanent that was a promise that hartnett clung to the surgeons had made it to hartnett and hartnett had made it to his wife all the changes could be reversed and would be when the mission was over and he was safely back they would remove the hardware and replace it with soft human tissues again and he would be returned to purely human shape it would not he understood be exactly the shape he had started out with they could not preserve his own organs and tissues they could only replace them with equivalents organ transplants and plastic surgery would do all they could to make him look like himself again but there was small chance he would ever again be able to travel on his old passport photo he did not greatly mind that he had never considered himself a handsome man he was content to know that he would have human eyes again not his own of course but the doctors had promised they would be blue and that lids and lashes would cover them again and with any luck at all they thought the eyes could even weep his heart would again be a lump of muscle the size of a fist it would pump red human blood to all the ends of limb and body his lung muscles would take air into his chest and there natural human alveoli would absorb oxygen and release co the great photoreceptor batears would be dismantled and gone the skin that had been so painfully constructed and fitted to him would be equally painfully flayed off again and replaced with human skin that sweated and grew hair hartnetts wife had exacted one promise from him she had made him swear that as long as he wore the halloween mask of the cyborg he would keep out of the sight of his children fortunately the children were little enough to be biddable and teachers friends neighbors parents of schoolmates and all had been made cooperative by hints of stories of jungle rot and skin ailments they had been curious but the story had worked and no one had urged terrys father to come to a pta meeting or brendas husband to join her at their backyard barbecue brenda hartnett herself had tried not to see her husband but in the long run curiosity drove out fear she had herself smuggled into the tank room one day while willy was practicing a coordination test riding a bicycle around the reddish sands with a basin of water balanced on the handlebars don kayman had stayed with her fully expecting her to faint or scream or perhaps be sick to her stomach she did none of those things surprising herself as much as the priest the cyborg looked too much like a japanese horror film to be taken seriously it was only that night that she really related the bateared crystaleyed creature on the bike with the father of her children the next day she went to the projects medical director and told him that willy must be getting starved for screwing by then and she didnt see why she couldnt accommodate him the doctor had to explain to her what willy had not been able to bring himself to say that in the present state of the art those functions had had to be regarded as superfluous and therefore had been temporarily uh disconnected meanwhile the cyborg toiled away at his tests and awaited each next installment of pain his world was in three parts the first part was a suite of rooms kept at a pressure equivalent to about feet of altitude so that the project staff could go in and out with only mild inconvenience when they had to this was where he slept when he could and ate what little he was given he was always hungry always theyd tried but they hadnt been able to disconnect the cravings of his senses the second part was the marsnormal tank in which he did his gymnastics and performed his tests so that the architects of his new body could observe their creation at work and the third part was a lowpressure chamber on wheels that rolled him from his private suite to his public test arena or wherever else he rarely had any occasion to go the marsnormal tank was like a zoo cage in which he was always on display the rolling tank offered him nothing but waiting to be moved into something else it was only the little tworoom suite that was officially his home that gave him any comfort at all there he had his tv set his stereo his telephone his books sometimes one of the graduate students or a fellow astronaut would visit with him there playing chess or trying to talk a conversation while their chests labored and lungs pumped fruitlessly at the foot pressure these visits he looked forward to and tried to prolong when no one was with him he was on his own resources infrequently he read sometimes he sat before the tv regardless of what was being shown on it most often he rested that was how he described it to his overseers by which he meant sitting or lying with his vision system in standby it was like having ones eyes closed but remaining awake a bright enough light would register on his senses as it will even through a sleepers closed lids a sound would penetrate at once in those times his brain raced conjuring up thoughts of sex food jealousy sex anger children nostalgia love until he pleaded for relief and was given a course in selfhypnosis which let him wash his mind empty after that in rest mode he did almost nothing that was conscious while his nervous system groomed and prepared itself for the next sensations of pain and his brain counted the seconds until his flight would be over and his normal human body given back to him there were a lot of those seconds he had multiplied them out often enough seven months in orbit to mars seven months coming back a few weeks at both ends getting ready for the launch and then debriefing before they would start the process of restoring him to his own body a few months no one would tell him exactly how many while the surgery took place and the replaced parts healed the number of seconds close as he could guess it was some fortyfive million give or take as much as ten million he felt each one of them arrive and linger and reluctantly slip past the psychologists had tried to avoid all this by planning every moment for him he refused the plans they tried to understand him with devious tests and patternscanning he let them pry but inside himself he kept a citadel of privacy that he would not let them invade hartnett had never thought of himself as an introspective man he knew that he was a mile wide and an inch deep and that he led an unexamined life he liked it that way but now that he had nothing left but the interior of his mind that was his own he guarded that he wished sometimes that he did know how to examine his life he wished he could understand his reasons for doing what he did why had he volunteered for the mission sometimes he tried to remember and then decided he had never known was it because the free world needed martian living space because he wanted the glamour of being the first martian for the money for the scholarships and favors it would mean for the kids to make brenda love him it probably was in among those reasons somewhere but he couldnt remember if he had ever known in any case he was committed the thing he was sure of was that he had no way to back out now he would let them do whatever savage sadistic torturing they wanted of his body he would board the spaceship that would take him to mars he would endure the seven endless months in orbit he would go down to the surface explore stake claims take samples photograph test he would rise up again from the martian surface and live somehow through the sevenmonth return and he would give them all the information they wanted he would accept the medals and the applause and the lecture tours and the television interviews and the contracts for books and then he would present himself to the surgeons to be put back the way he was supposed to be all of those things he had made his mind up to and he was sure he would carry them out there was only one question in his mind to which he had not yet worked out an answer it had to do with a contingency he was not prepared to meet when he first volunteered for the program they had told him very openly and honestly that the medical problems were complex and not fully understood they would have to learn how to deal with some of them on him it was possible that some of the answers would be hard to find or wrong it was possible that returning him to his own shape would be well difficult they told him that very clearly at the very beginning and then they never said it again but he remembered the problem he had not resolved was what he would do if for any reason when the whole mission was over they could not put him back together right away what he couldnt decide was whether he would then simply kill himself or at the same time kill as many as possible of his friends superiors and colleagues as well four group of probable pallbearers roger torraway col usaf ba ma dsc at the time he woke up in the morning the night shift finished benchrunning the cyborgs photoreceptors there had been an unidentified voltage drop caught on the monitors when they were last in use on the cyborg but nothing showed in the bench test and nothing had been visible when they were stripped they were certified serviceable roger had slept badly it was a terrible responsibility being custodian of mankinds last forlorn hope for freedom and decency when he woke up it was with that thought in mind there was a part of roger torraway it showed itself most commonly in dreams that was about nine years old it took all the things the president said at face value although roger himself doubling as diplomat and missionhead world traveler familiar of a dozen capitals really did not think in his conscious mind that the free world existed he dressed his mind in the familiar occupation of resolving a dichotomy lets assume dash is on the level and occupying mars means salvation for humanity he thought can we cut it he thought of willy hartnett goodlooking amiable good with his hands but also a little bit of a lightweight when you came to look at him honestly likely to take a drink too many at the club on a saturday night not to be trusted in the kitchen with another mans wife at a party he was not a hero by any measure roger could find but who was he cast his mind down the list of backups to the cyborg number one vic freibart currently off on a ceremonial tour with the vice president and temporarily removed from the order of succession number two carl mazzini on sick leave while the leg he had broken at mount snow healed up number three him there was no valley forge quality in any of them he made his breakfast without waking dorrie got the car out and left it puffing on its skirts while he picked up the morning paper threw it into the garage and closed the door his nextdoor neighbor walking toward his car pool hailed him see the news this morning i see dash was in town last night some highlevel conference roger said automatically no i havent put on the tv this morning but i did see dash he thought and i could take the wind out of your sails it annoyed him not to be able to say it security was a confounded nuisance half of his recent trouble with dorrie he was sure came from the fact that in the neighborhood wives morning block conference and coffee binge she was allowed to mention her husband only as a formerly active astronaut now in administrative work even his trips abroad had to be played down out of town business trip anything but well my husband is meeting with the chiefs of staff of the basutoland air force this week she had resisted she still resisted or at least complained to roger about it often enough but as far as he knew she had not broken security since at least three of the wives were known to report to the lab intelligence officer he undoubtedly would have known as roger got into the car he remembered that he had not kissed dorrie goodbye he told himself that it did not matter she would not wake up and therefore would not know if by any chance she did wake up she would complain at being wakened but he did not like to give up a ritual while he thought about it however he was automatically putting the car into drive and keying his code number for the lab the car began to move he sighed snapped on the tv and watched the today show all the way to work fr donnelly s kayman ab ma phd sj as he began celebrating the mass in the lady chapel of st judes three miles away on the other side of tonka the cyborg was greedily swallowing the one meal he would get that day chewing was difficult because lack of practice had made his gums sore and the saliva didnt seem to flow as freely as it should any more but the cyborg ate with enthusiasm not even thinking about the test program for the day and when he had finished he gazed sadly at the empty plate don kayman was thirtyone years old and the worlds most authoritative areologist at least in the free world he was also a jesuit priest he did not think of himself as being one thing first and the other with what part of him was left over his work was areology his person was the priesthood meticulously and with joy he elevated the host drank the wine said the final redempit glanced at his watch and whistled he was running late he shed his robes in record time he aimed a slap at the chicano altar boy who grinned and opened the door for him they liked each other kayman even thought that the boy might himself become both priest and scientist one day now in sports shirt and slacks kayman jumped into his convertible it was a classic wheels instead of hoverskirts it could even be driven off the guided highways but where was there to go off the highways he dialed the laboratories switched on the main batteries and opened his newspaper without attention the little car nosed into the freeway found a gap in the traffic leaped to fill it and bore him at eighty miles an hour to his job the news in the newspaper was as usual mostly bad in paris the mfp had issued another blast at the chandrigar peace talks israel had refused to vacate cairo and damascus new york citys martial law now in its fifteenth month had failed to prevent the ambush of a tenth mountain division convoy trying to sneak across the bronxwhitestone bridge to the relief of the garrison in shea stadium fifteen soldiers were dead and the convoy had returned to the bronx kayman dropped the paper sadly he tilted the rearview mirror back raised the side windows to deflect some of the wind and began to brush his shoulderlength hair twentyfive strokes on each side it was almost as much a ritual with him as the mass he would brush it again that day because he had a lunch date with sister clotilda she was already half convinced that she wanted to apply for relief from certain of her vows and kayman wanted to resume the discussion with her as soon and as often and as long as suitable because he had less distance to travel kayman arrived at the laboratories just behind roger torraway they got out together turned their cars over to the parking system and went up to the briefing room in the same elevator deputy director t gamble de bell as he prepared to juice up key personnel at the morning briefing the cyborg was thirty meters away spreadeagled face down and nude on mars he would eat only lowresidue food and not much of that on earth it was thought necessary to keep his eliminatory system at least minimally functional in spite of the difficulties the changes in skin and metabolism produced hartnett was glad for the food but hated the enemas the project director was a general the science chief was a distinguished biophysicist who had worked with wilkins and pauling twenty years back he had stopped doing science and started doing figureheading because that was where the rewards were neither had much to do with the work of the labs themselves only with liaison between the operating people and those shadowy outside figures who worked the money switch for the nittygritty of daily routine it was the deputy director who did the work this early in the morning he already had a sheaf of notes and reports and he had read them scramble the picture he ordered from the lectern not looking up on the monitor above him willy hartnetts grotesque profile broke up into a jackstraw bundle of lines then turned into snow then rebuilt itself into its proper features the picture was no longer in color the scan was coarser now and the image less steady but it was now securitysafe and in portraying hartnett the quality of the picture made after all very little difference all right said the deputy director harshly you heard dash last night he didnt come here to get your votes he wants action so do i i dont want any more screwups like the photoreceptor crap he turned a page morning progress report he read commander hartnett is functioning well in all systems with three exceptions first the artificial heart does not respond well to prolonged exercise at low temperatures second the cav system receives poorly in frequencies higher than medium blue im disappointed in that one brad he interpolated looking up at alexander bradley the expert in the perceptual systems of the eye you know were locked into uv capability on that third communications links we had to admit to that one in front of the president last night he didnt like it and i didnt like it that throat mike doesnt work effectively we dont have voice link at marsnormal pressure and if we dont come up with a solve well have to go back to plain visual systems eighteen months down the drain he glanced around the room and settled on the heart man all right what about the circulation its the heat buildup fineman said defensively the heart is functioning perfectly you want me to design it for ridiculous conditions i could but it would be eight feet high fix up the thermal balance the skin closes up at low temperatures and wont transmit naturally the oxygen level in the blood drops and naturally the heart speeds up thats what its supposed to do what do you want otherwise hell go into syncope maybe shortchange the brain on then whatve you got from high on the wall of the room the cyborgs face looked on impassively he had changed position roger torraway not very interested in a discussion that did not in any way involve his specialty was gazing at the cyborg thoughtfully he wondered what old willy thought hearing himself talked about that way roger had gone to the trouble of requisitioning the private psychological studies on hartnett because of curiosity on that point but they hadnt been very informative roger was pretty sure he knew why all of them had been so tested and retested that they had acquired considerable skill in answering test questions the way the examiners wanted them answered by now nearly everyone in the labs must have come to do that either by design or simply as a trainedin reflex they would make marvelous poker players he thought smiling he remembered poker games with willy covertly he winked at the cyborg and gave him a thumbsup hartnett did not respond it was impossible to tell from those faceted ruby eyes what he saw we cant change the skin again the integuments man was arguing theres already a weight penalty if we put in any more sensoractors hell feel like hes wearing a wetsuit all the time surprisingly a rumble from the monitor the cyborg spoke what theee hell do you think it feeeelsss layk now a beat of silence as everyone in the room remembered it was a living person they were talking about then the skin man insisted all the more reason wed like to fine it down simplify it get some of the weight off not complicate it the deputy director raised his hand you two get together he ordered the opponents dont tell me what you cant do im telling you what we have to do now you brad what about that vision cutoff alex bradley said cheerily under control i can fix but listen will im sorry but it means another implant i see whats wrong its in the retinal mediation system its filtering the extra frequencies the systems all right but then make it work said the deputy director glancing at the clock how about the communications foulup talk to respiration said the hardware man if they give us a little more retained air hartnett can get some voice the electronics systems are fine theres just nothing for them to carry impossible shouted the lung man youve only left us five hundred ccs of space now he uses that in ten minutes ive gone over the drill with him a hundred times to practice conserving it cant he just whisper asked the deputy director then as the communications man began hauling out frequencyresponse curves he added work it out will you all the rest of you looks good but dont let up he closed the notes into their plastic folder and handed it to his assistant thats that he said now let me get to the important part he waited for them to settle down the reason the president was here last night is that a launch target has been approved friends we are now on real time when cried a voice the deputy went on asap weve got to complete this job and by that friends i mean complete it get hartnett up to optimum performance so that he can actually live on mars no back to the workshops if something goes wrong in time for the launch window next month launch time is set for oh eight hundred hours on twelve november that gives us fortythree days twentytwo hours and some odd minutes no more there was a seconds pause then a rush of voices even the cyborgs expression visibly changed though no one could have said in what direction the deputy director continued thats only part of it the date is fixed it cant be changed we have to meet it now i want to tell you why lights please the chamber lights dimmed down and the deputys deputy without waiting for a signal projected a slide on the end wall of the room where all could see it even the cyborg in his distant cell it displayed a crosshatched chart with a broad black line growing diagonally upward toward a red bar in bright orange letters at the top it was marked most secret eyes only let me explain what youre looking at said the deputy director the black diagonal is a composite of twentytwo trends and indices ranging from the international credit balance to the incidence of harassment of american tourists by government officials abroad the measure is of probability of war the red bar at the top is marked oh which i can tell you stands for outbreak of hostilities it is not certainty but the statistics people tell us that when the upper limit is reached there is a pointnine probability of war within six hours and as you can see we are moving toward it the noise had stopped the room was cryptstill finally one voice inquired whats the time scale the back data covers thirtyfive years said the deputy director there was some easing at least the white space at the top would have to be some months not minutes then kathleen doughty asked does it say anywhere in there who it is were going to be at war with the deputy director hesitated then said carefully no that is not included in the chart but i think we can all form our own guesses i dont mind giving you mine if youve been reading the papers you know that the chicoms have been talking about the wonders of increased food production they could bring the world by applying sinkiang province farming techniques to the australian outback well no matter what that quisling bunch in canberra are willing to agree to i feel pretty sure that this administration is not going to let the chinks move in not if they want to keep my vote anyway after a moment he added thats just personal opinion off the record do not include it in the minutes of this meeting i dont know any official answer and i wouldnt tell you if i did all i know is what you know now the trendline forecasts look pretty sour now they show nuclear escalation probabilities peaking pretty fast weve got a date for it the curve continued shows the pointnine probability in less than seven years which means he added that if we dont have a viable mars colony by then we may not live to have it ever alexander bradley bsc ee md dsc lt col usmcr while bradley was leaving the conference and changing from the expression of concern he had worn for the briefing to the more natural openfaced jollity he showed the world the cyborg was downpressuring for the marsnormal tank his monitors were somewhat concerned although they could not read emotion from his face they could from his heart breath and vital signs as telemetered constantly to them and it appeared to them that he was in some sort of uptight state they proposed delaying the test but he refused angrily dont you know theresss a war on almosssst he demanded in shrill tones and would not answer when they spoke to him again they decided to continue with the tests but to recheck his psych profile as soon as they were completed when alexander bradley was ten years old he lost his father and his left eye the sunday after thanksgiving the family was driving back from church it had turned cold the morning dew had frozen impalpably thin and slick in a film on the road brads father was driving with great care but there were cars in front of him cars behind him cars in the other half of the twolane road going in the other direction he was constrained to keep to a certain speed and he was short in his answers when the rest of the family said anything to him he was concerned but he was not concerned enough when the disaster came he could do nothing to avert it to brad sitting beside his father in the front seat it looked as though a station wagon coming toward them a hundred yards away turned out slowly and calmly as though it were making a left turn but there was no road there for it to turn into brads father stepped on the brake and held it their car slowed and slid and for some seconds the boy sat watching the other car sliding sidewise toward them themselves skidding gently and inevitably toward it it was stately and deliberate and inevitable no one said anything not brad not his father not brads mother in the back seat no one did anything except to hold their rigid poses as though they were actors in a national traffic council tableau the father sat silent and erect at the wheel staring concentratedly at the other car the driver of the other vehicle looked wideeyed and inquiringly toward them over his shoulder neither moved until they hit even on the ice the friction was slowing them and they could not have been moving at a combined velocity of much more than twentyfive miles an hour it was enough both drivers were killed brads father impaled the other man decapitated brad and his mother though they were wearing their safety belts suffered fractures cuts and bruises as well as internal injuries and she lost the flexure of her left wrist forever while her son lost his eye twentythree years later brad still dreamed about it as though it had just happened in his sleep it scared him witless and he awakened sweaty and crying and gasping for breath it was not all loss he had discovered that considerable advantages had been bought at the cost of an eye item there was the insurance on the life of his father and on the maiming of everyone concerned item the injury had kept him out of the army and had permitted him to join the marine corps in an essentially civilian capacity when he wanted field experience in his specialty item it had given him an acceptable excuse for avoiding the stupider risks and more tiresome obligations of adolescence he never had to prove his courage in violent sports and always was excused from whatever parts of gym he most detested biggest item of all it gave him an education under the aid to handicapped children provisions of his states welfare system it had paid his way through school college and graduate school it had given him four degrees and turned him into one of the worlds greatest experts on the perceptual systems of the eye on balance it was a favorable transaction even adding in the negative factor of a mother who had spent the remaining ten years of her life in some pain and a good deal of shortness of temper it was worthwhile brad had wound up on the man plus project because he was the best they could get he had chosen to work for the marine corps because nowhere better could one find experimental subjects prepared by shell claymore and bolo than in the field hospitals of tanzania borneo and ceylon that work had been noted in high echelons of the military they had not accepted brad they had drafted him what he was not sure of was that man plus was the best he could get other recruits had been dragged into the space program by glamour or appeals to duty it wasnt at all like that with bradley as soon as he had grasped what the man from washington was driving at the implications and opportunities spread out before him it was a new track it meant abandoning some plans deferring others but he could see where it would lead say three years helping to develop the optic systems of the cyborg a world reputation coming out of it then he could quit the program and enter the limitless lush pastures of private practice one hundred and eight americans per hundred thousand had essentially total loss of function in one or both eyes it added up to better than three hundred thousand prospective patients every one of whom would want the best man in the field to treat him working on the man plus program would stamp him the best man in his field at once he could have a clinic of his own before he was forty not big just big enough to be supervised personally in every detail by him and run by a staff of juniors trained by him and working under his direction it would run to oh maybe five or six hundred patients a year a fraction of percent of the prospects which fraction of percent would he accept at least half of them would come from those most solvent and most willing to pay also of course charity cases at least a hundred of them a year everything free even their bedside phones while the several hundred who could pay would pay a lot the bradley clinic would be a model for medical services all over the world and it would make him one hell of a lot of money it was not bradleys fault that the three years had extended themselves past five it wasnt even his part of the program that caused the delays or not most of them anyway in any event he was still young he would leave the program with thirty good working years ahead of him unless he chose to retire earlier perhaps keeping a consultancy and a stock arrangement at the bradley clinic and there were other advantages to working in the space program in that so many of his associates had married such attractive women bradley had no interest in getting married but he very much liked having wives back in the sevenroom laboratory suite where he ruled brad kicked ass on enough of his subordinates to insure that the new retinal mediation link would be ready for transplant within the week and glanced at his watch it was not yet eleven he dialed roger torraway on the intercom and got him after a delay how about lunch rog i want to go over this new implant with you oh too bad brad i wish i could but im going to be in the tank with will hartnett for at least the next three hours maybe tomorrow talk to you then said brad cheerfully and hung up he was not surprised he had already checked torraways schedule but he was pleased he told his secretary that he would be leaving for an outside conference and then lunch and would be back after two then ordered his car he fed it the coordinates for the corner of the block where roger torraway lived where dorrie torraway lived five monster becoming mortal again as brad left whistling his car radio was full of news of the world the tenth mountain division had recoiled back to a fortified area in riverdale a typhoon had wrecked the rice crop in southeast asia president deshatine had ordered the us delegation to walk out of the united nations debate on sharing scarce resources there was much news that was not on the soundonly radio because the newscasters either didnt know about it or didnt think it was important for example not one word was said about two chinese gentlemen on a mission in australia or about the results of certain secret popularity polls the president kept locked in his safe or about the tests being run on willy hartnett so brad didnt hear about any of these things if he had and had understood their importance he would have cared he was not an uncaring man he was not an evil one either he was just not a particularly good one sometimes that question came up for instance when it was time to get rid of a girl or drop a friend who had been helpful on the way up sometimes there were recriminations then brad would smile and shrug and point out that it wasnt a fair world lancelot didnt win all the tournaments sometimes the evil black knight dumped him on the ground bobby fischer wasnt the most lovable chess player in the world merely the best and so on and so brad would confess that he was not a model man by social standards indeed he wasnt something had gone wrong in his childhood the bump of ego on his skull had swollen large so he saw the whole world in terms of what it could give him war with china well lets see calculated brad theres sure to be a lot of surgery perhaps ill get to head my own hospital a world depression his money was in farmland people would always eat he was not admirable all the same he was the best person alive to do what the cyborg needed namely to provide willy hartnett with mediation between stimulus and interpretation which is a way of saying that somewhere between the external object the cyborg saw and the conclusions the cyborgs brain drew from it there had to be a stage where unnecessary information was filtered out otherwise the cyborg would simply go mad to understand why this is so consider the frog think of a frog as a functional machine designed to produce baby frogs this is the darwinian view and is really what evolution is all about in order to succeed the frog has to stay alive long enough to grow up and get pregnant or get some female frog pregnant that means it has to do two things it has to eat and it has to avoid being eaten as vertebrates go the frog is a dull and simple kind of creature it has a brain but not a big one or a very sophisticated one theres not much excess capacity in the frog brain to play around with so that one doesnt want to waste any of it on nonessentials evolution is always economical male frogs do not write poems or torture themselves with fears that their female frogs may be unfaithful nor do they want to think about things which do not directly concern staying alive the frogs eye is simple too in human eyes there are complexities frogs know not suppose a human comes into a room containing a table which bears an order of steak and french fries even if he cannot hear cannot taste and has lost the power of smell he is drawn to the food his eye turns to the steak there is a spot on the eye called the fovea the part of the eye with which a person sees best and it is that spot that directs itself toward the target the frog doesnt do that one part of its eye is as good as another or as bad because the interesting thing about a frogseye view of what fot a frog is the equivalent of a steak namely a bug big enough to be worth swallowing but small enough not to try to swallow back is that the frog is blind to food unless the food behaves like food surround the frog with the most nutritious chopped insect pate you can devise it will starve to death unless a ladybug wanders by if one thinks about how a frog eats this strange behavior begins to make sense the frog fits a very neat ecological niche in a state of nature no one fills that niche with minced food the frog eats insects so insects are what he sees if something passes through his field of vision which is the right size for an insect and moves at the proper speed for an insect the frog does not debate whether he is hungry or not or which insects taste best he eats it then he goes back to waiting for the next one in the laboratory this is an antisurvival trait you can trick a frog with a piece of cloth a bit of wood on a string anything that moves properly and is the right size he will eat them and starve but in nature there are no such tricks in nature only bugs move like bugs and every bug is frog dinner this principle is not difficult to understand say this to a naпve friend and he will say oh yes i see the frog just ignores anything that doesnt look like a bug wrong the frog doesnt do anything of the kind he does not ignore nonbug objects he simply never sees them in the first place tap a frogs optic nerve and drag a marble slowly past too big too slow and no instrument can pick up a nerve impulse there is none the eye does not bother to see what the frog does not want to know about but swing a dead fly past and your meter dials flick over the nerve transmits a message the frogs tongue licks out and grabs and so we come to the cyborg what bradley had done was to provide a mediation stage between the ruby complex eyes and the aching human brain of willy hartnett which filtered interpreted and generally prepackaged all of the cyborgs visual inputs the eye saw everything even in the uv part of the spectrum even in the infrared the brain could not deal with so vast a flow of inputs bradleys mediation stage edited out the unimportant bits the stage was a triumph of design because bradley was indeed extremely good at the one thing he was good at but he was not there to install it and so because brad had a date and also because the president of the united states had to go to the bathroom and two chinese named sing and sun wanted to try a pizza the history of the world changed jerry weidner who was brads principal assistant supervised the slow laborious process of resetting the cyborgs vision systems it was a fussy niggling sort ofjob like nearly all of the things that had to be done to willy hartnett it was attended with maximum discomfort for him the sensitive nerves of the eyelid had long since been dissected out otherwise they would have been shrieking pain at him day and night but he could feel what was happening if not as pain then as a psychically disturbing knowledge that somebody was sliding edged instruments around in a very touchy part of his anatomy his actual vision was kept on standby mode so he saw only dim moving shadows it was enough he hated it he lay there for an hour or more while weidner and the others tinkered with changes in potentials noted readings talked to each other in the numbers that are the language of technologists when they were finally satisfied with the field strength of his perceptual system and allowed him to stand without warning he almost toppled sheesssst he snarled dizzzzy again worried and resigned weidner said all right we better ask for vertigo checks so there was another thirtyminute delay while the balance teams checked his reflexes until he burst out chrisssst cut it out i can ssstand on one foot for the nexssst twenty hours ssso what doesss it prove but they kept him on one foot anyhow measuring how close he could get his fingertips to touching with his vision in standby mode the balance teams then declared themselves satisfied but jerry weidner was not the dizziness had happened before and it had never been satisfactorily tracked down either to the builtin mechanical horizon or to the crude natural stirrupandanvil bones in his ear weidner did not know that it stemmed from the mediation system that was his own special responsibility but he didnt know that it did not either he wished brad would get the hell back from his long lunch at that time halfway around the world there were these two chinese named sing and sun they were not characters in a dirty joke those were their names sings greatgrandfather had died at the mouth of a russian cannon after the failure of the righteous harmony fists to expel the white devils from china his father had conceived him on the long march and died before he was born in combat against the soldiers of a war lord allied to chiang kaishek sing himself was nearly ninety years old he had shaken the hand of comrade mao had diverted the yellow river for maos successors and was now supervising the greatest hydraulic engineering project of his career in an australian town called fitzroy crossing it was his first prolonged trip outside the territory of new peoples asia he had three ambitions for it to see an uncensored pornographic film to drink a bottle of scotch that came from scotland rather than the peoples province of honshu and to taste a pizza with his colleague sun he had made a good start on the scotch had found out where to accomplish the viewing of the film and was now desirous of tasting the pizza sun was much younger not yet forty and in spite of everything suffering from respect for his associates age there was also the fact that sun was several echelons lower in social status than the older man although he was obviously a coming man in the technoindustrial wing of the party sun had just returned from a year of leading a mapping team through all of the great sandy desert it was not only sand it was soil good arable productive soil lacking only a few trace elements and water what sun had mapped had been the soil chemistry of a million square miles when suns soil map and sings great uphill aqueduct with its fourteen great batteries of nucleardriven pumps came together they would equal a new kind of life for those million miles of desert chemical supplements sundistilled water from the distant seacoast ten crops a year with which to feed a hundred million ethnically chinese new australians the project had been carefully studied and contained only one flaw the old new australians descendants of the populating drives of the post world war ii period did not want new new australians coming in to farm that land they wanted it for themselves as sun and sing entered dannys pizza hut on fitzroy crossings main street two old new australians one named koschanko and one named gradechek were just leaving the bar and unfortunately recognized sing from his newspaper pictures words passed the chinese recognized the smell of stale beer and took the truculence to be only drink they tried to pass and koschanko and gradechek pushed them out of the street door bellicosity began swinging and the ninetyyearold skull of sing hsichin split itself open against a curbstone at this point sun drew a pistol he was not authorized to be carrying and shot the two assailants dead it was only a drunken brawl the police of fitzroy crossing had handled thousands of more dramatic crimes and could have handled this one if they had been allowed to but it did not stop there because one of the barmaids was herself a new new australian of honanese extraction recognized sun discovered who sing was picked up the phone and called the new china news agency bureau in lagrange mission down on the coast to say that one of chinas most famous scientists had been brutally murdered within ten minutes the satellite network had carried a factually shaky but very colorful version of the story all over the world before an hour was out the new peoples asian mission to canberra had requested an appointment with the foreign minister to deliver its protest spontaneous demonstrations were in full blast in shanghai saigon hiroshima and a dozen other npa cities and half a dozen observation satellites were being nudged out of their orbits to pass over northwest australia and the sunda islands seas two miles outside the harbor of melbourne a great gray shape swam to the surface of the sea and floated there offering no signals and responding to none for more than twenty minutes then it declared itself the npa nuclear submarine the east is red on a routine diplomatic visit to a friendly port the news was received in time to cancel the raaf air strike that had been ordered against the unknown intruder but only just under pueblo colorado the president of the united states was interrupted in his afterlunch nap he was sitting on the edge of his bed distastefully sipping a cup of black coffee when the dod liaison aide came in with a sitrep and the news that a condition red alert had been declared in accordance with the prepared responses long since programmed into the north american defense command net he already had the satellite reports and an onthescene account from a military mission to fitzroy crossing he knew about the appearance of the submarine the east is red but did not yet know that the air strike had been called off summarizing the information he said to the president so its go or nogo sir nadcom recommends a launch with abort options in fifty minutes the president snarled i dont feel good what the hell did they put in that soup dash was not in a mood to think about china just at that moment he had been dreaming about a private poll which showed his popularity down to percent including both the excellent and satisfactory ratings with percent calling his administration poor or very unsatisfactory it had not been a dream that was what the mornings political briefing had shown him he pushed the coffee cup away and glumly contemplated the decision he alone in all the world was now required to make to launch missiles against the major cities of new peoples asia was in theory a reversible choice they could be aborted at any time before reentry defused falling harmlessly into the sea but in practice the npa posts would detect the launch and who knew what those crazy chinese bastards would do his belly felt as though he were in the last minutes of pregnancy and there seemed to be a good chance that he would throw up his number one secretary said chidingly dr stassen did advise you not to eat any more cabbage sir perhaps we should instruct the chef not to make that soup any more the president said i dont want lectures right now all right look well hold at the present state of readiness until further orders from me no launch no retaliation understood yes sir said the dod man regretfully sir i have several specific queries from nadcom from the man plus project from the admiral commanding swepac you heard me no retaliation everything else keep going his number one secretary clarified the point for him our official position he said is this affair in australia is a domestic matter and not a national concern for the united states our action stance does not change we keep all systems go but take no action is that right mr president right said dash thickly now if you can get along without me for ten minutes i got to go to the john brad did think of phoning in to see how the recalibration was going but he really liked showering with a girl with all the fun involved in soaping each other and the cherostrip bathroom armorarium included bath oil beads bubbles and marvelous thick towels it was three oclock before he decided to think about going back to work by that time it was pretty much too late weidner had tried to get permission to postpone testing from the deputy director who wouldnt do it on his own authority but bucked it to washington who queried the presidents office and received the reply no you cannot positively cannot repeat not postpone this or any other test the man giving the reply was the presidents number one secretary who was looking at the risk of war projection on the wall of the presidents most private study while he spoke even as he was talking the broad black bar was bending itself still more steeply up toward the red line so they went ahead with the test weidner tightlipped and frowning it went well enough until it began to go very badly indeed roger torraways mind was far away until he heard the cyborg call him he locked in and stood in skin suit and breathing mask on the ruddy sands whats the matter willy he demanded the great ruby eyes turned toward him i i cant ssssee you roger the cyborg shrilled i i and he toppled and fell it was as quick as that roger did not even move toward him until he felt a great thundering hammer of air beat in on him sending him stumbling toward the recumbent monster form from the foot equivalent outside the marsnormal chamber don kayman came desperately running in he had not waited to lock he had thrown both doors open he was no longer a scientist he was a priest he dropped to his knees beside the contorted form of what had been willy hartnett roger stared while don kayman touched the ruby eyes traced a cross on the synthetic flesh whispering what roger could not hear he did not want to hear he knew what was happening the first candidate for cyborg was now receiving extreme unction in front of his eyes the lead backup was yic freibart taken off the list by presidential order the number two alternate was carl mazzini ruled out because of his broken leg the third alternate and the new champion was him six mortal in mortal fear it is not an easy thing for a fleshandblood human being to come to terms with the knowledge that some of his flesh is going to be ripped from him and replaced with steel copper silver plastic aluminum and glass we could see that torraway was not behaving very rationally he went blundering down the hall away from the marsnormal tank in great urgency as though he had a most pressing errand he had no errand except to get away the hall seemed like a trap to him he felt he could not stand to have one person come up to him and say he was sorry about willy hartnett or acknowledge torraways own new status he passed a mens room stopped looked around no one was watching him and entered to stand at the urinal eyes glazed fixed to the shiny chrome when the door pushed open torraway made a great show of zipping and flushing but it was only a boy from the typing poo who looked at him incuriously and headed for a booth outside the mens room the deputy director caught him goddamn lousy thing he said i guess you know youre i know said torraway pleased that his voice was so calm were going to have to find out what happened fast im having a meeting in my office in ninety minutes well have the first autopsy reports i want you there roger nodded glanced at his wrist watch and turned smartly away the important thing he thought was to keep moving as though he were too busy to interrupt unfortunately he couldnt think of a single thing he had to do or even that he could pretend to be doing to keep conversation away no he recognized not conversation it was thought he wanted to keep away thinking about himself he wasnt afraid he wasnt furious at fate he just wasnt prepared to look into the personal consequences of willy hartnetts death not right at that moment he looked up someone had been calling his name it was jon freeling brads surgical assistant in perceptual systems looking for brad why no said torraway glad to be talking about something other than willys death or his own future i dont know where he is went to lunch i think two hours ago his tails going to be in a crack if i cant find him before the dds meeting im not sure i can field all the questions and i cant go looking for him theyre bringing the cyborg into my lab now and ive got to ill find him for you torraway said hastily ill call him at home tried it no dice and he didnt leave a number where he could be reached torraway winked suddenly feeling relieved delighted to have a challenge he could respond to you know brad he said you have to remember theres a lot of tomcat in that boy ill find him and he took the elevator to the administrative floor turned two corners and rapped on the door marked administrative statistics the function of the people inside that door had very little to do with statistics the door didnt open at once instead a spyhole opened and a blue eye looked out at him im colonel torraway and its an emergency one moment said a girls voice there was a sound of clattering and scraping and then the door unlocked and she let torraway in there were four other people in the room all of them in civilian clothes and looking rather undistinguished as they were meant to do each had an oldfashioned rolltop desk of a kind one did not usually expect to see in a modern spaceagency office the tops could be pulled down to conceal what was on the desks at a moments notice they were down now its dr alexander bradley roger said hes needed urgently in about an hour and his department cant find him commander hartnett is dead and the girl said we know about commander hartnett do you want us to find dr bradley for you no ill do it but i expect you can tell me where to start looking i know you keep tabs on all of us extracurricular activities and all he did not actually wink at her too but he heard the sound of a wink in his voice the girl looked at him steadily for a moment hes probably at hold it called the man at the desk behind her his voice surprisingly angry she shook her head overruling him without looking at him try the cherostrip hover hotel she said he usually uses the name of beckwith id suggest you telephone maybe it would be better if we did it for you at that oh no said torraway easily resolute to keep this chore for himself its important i talk to him myself the young man said strongly dr torraway i really suggest you let us handle but he was already backing out of the door nodding not listening any more he had made up his mind not to bother telephoning but to drive to the motel it was a valid reason to get out of the lab while he collected his thoughts outside the aircontrolled laboratory buildings tonka had been getting hotter and hotter the sun penetrated even the tinted windshield filling torraways car with heat that defied the cooling system he drove inexpertly on manual taking the curves so sloppily that the guidance wheels skidded the motel was fifteen stories tall and solid glass it seemed to aim the sunlight directly at him like archimedess warriors defending syracuse he was glad to get out in the underground parking lot and take the moving stairs up to the lobby the lobby itself was as tall as the building completely enclosed with the rooms racked around it and flying bridges and galleries crisscrossing overhead the clerk had never heard of dr alexander bradley try beckwith suggested torraway offering a bill he sometimes has trouble remembering his name but it was no use the clerk either couldnt place brad or wouldnt roger drove out of the parking space paused in the beat of the sunshine and considered what to do next he stared unseeing into the reflecting pool that doubled as the motels airconditioning heat sink probably he should try phoning brad at his apartment he thought should have done it while he was in the lobby he didnt much want to turn around and go back in or call from the car for that matter the car phone was broadcast radio and the conversation would be better private he could go home and call from there he planned it was not more than a fiveminute run at which point it first registered on roger that he really ought to tell his wife what had happened it was not a duty he looked forward to telling dorrie unfortunately implied spelling it all out to himself but roger had a good attitude toward inevitable things even if unpleasant and keeping his mind in neutral he turned the car toward home and dorrie unfortunately dorrie wasnt there he called to her in the hallway peered into the dining room looked at the swimming pool in the back checked both bathrooms no dorrie out shopping no doubt it was annoying but it couldnt be helped and he was just about to leave a note for her staring out the window while he tried to think how to phrase the note when he saw her driving up in her micromidget twoseater he had the door open for her before she got to it he expected she would be surprised he had not expected that she would just stand there her pretty eyebrows raised and motionless her expression showing no movement at all she looked like a snapshot of herself frozen in the middle of a step he said i wanted to talk to you about something i just came from the cherostrip because brad is involved too but she came to life and said politely let me come in and sit down there was still no expression on her face as she paused in the hallway to look at herself in the mirror she smoothed some blemish on her cheek fluffed her hair went into the living room and sat down without taking off her hat its awfully warm out today isnt it she observed roger sat down too trying to collect his thoughts it was important not to frighten her once he had watched a television program about how to break bad news some shrink with a need for more patients and a fear of being labeled unethical keeping him from hiring a man with a sandwich board going on the talk shows in the hope of catching a few live ones for his waiting room never be blunt he said give the person a chance to prepare himself tell it a little at a time at that period roger had thought it was comic he remembered telling dorrie about it honey have you got your charge card well youll need it for the black dress the black dress for the funeral the funeral we have to go to and youll want to look nice because of who it is well after all she was a pretty old lady and you know she didnt drive very well the policemen said she didnt suffer after she creamed the truck your fathers bearing up very well they had both laughed about it please go ahead dorrie said invitingly taking a cigarette out of the box on the coffee table as she lit it roger saw the butane flame quiver and realized with astonishment that her hand was shaking he was both surprised and a little pleased evidently she was bracing herself for some kind of bad news she had always been very perceptive he thought admiringly and now that she was ready he plunged in its willy hartnett dear he said kindly something went wrong this morning and he paused waiting for her to catch up to him she did not look concerned as much as puzzled hes dead said torraway shortly and stopped to let it sink in she nodded thoughtfully it wasnt penetrating roger thought regretfully she didnt understand she had liked willy but she was not crying or screaming or showing any emotion at all he finished the thought giving up on tact and of course that means that im next in line he said trying to speak slowly the others are out of it you remember i told you so im the one theyll want to uh prepare for the mars mission the look on her face perplexed him it was fragile and apprehensive almost as though she had been expecting something worse and still was not sure it was not coming he said impatiently dont you understand what im saying dear why yes thats well its a little hard to take in he nodded satisfied and she went on but im confused didnt you start by saying something about brad and the cherostrip oh im sorry i know i threw a lot at you at once yes i said i had just been at the motel looking for brad you see it looks like its the perceptual systems that went wrong and killed willy well thats brads baby and today of all days he took a long lunch to well i dont have to tell you about brad hes probably shacked up somewhere with one of the nurses but its going to look bad if he isnt there for the meeting he stopped to look at his watch wow ive got to get back myself but i did want to break this to you in person thank you honey she said absently pursuing a thought wouldnt it have been better to phone him who brad of course oh oh sure except it was sort of private i didnt want anyone listening in and besides i didnt think hed be answering the phone in fact the desk clerk wouldnt admit he was ever there and i had to go to security to get a lead on where he might be he had a sudden thought he knew dorrie liked brad and he wondered for a half second if she was upset at brads immorality the thought dismissed itself and he burst out admiringly honey i have to say youre taking this beautifully most women would be in hysterics by now she shrugged and said well whats the use of making a fuss we both knew this could happen he ventured i wont look very good dorrie and you know i think the physical part of our marriage will be down the drain for a while even not counting the fact ill be away on the mission for better than a year and a half she looked thoughtful then resigned then she looked directly at him and smiled she got up to come over beside him and put her arms around him ill be proud of you she said and well have long long lives after you get back she ducked back as he reached to kiss her and said playfully none of that youve got to get back what are you going to do about brad well i could go back to the motel she said decisively dont do it roger let him look out for himself if hes up to something he shouldnt be thats his problem i want you to get back to the meeting and oh say thats right im going out again ill be passing quite near the motel if i see brads car in the lot ill put a note on it that didnt even occur to me he said admiringly so dont worry i dont want you thinking about brad with all thats coming up we have to be thinking of you jonathan freeling md facs aasm jonny freeling had been in aerospace medicine long enough to have lost the habit of dealing with cadavers particularly he was unused to cutting up the bodies of friends astronauts didnt usually leave their bodies behind when they died anyway if they died in line of duty it was unlikely there would be any pm the ones that were lost in space stayed there the ones that died nearer home were usually boiled to gas in the flame of hydrogen and oxygen in neither case was there anything to put on a table it was hard to realize that this object he was dissecting was willy hartnett it wasnt as much like an autopsy as like say fieldstripping a carbine he had helped put these parts together these platinum electrodes here these microminiaturized chips in their black box there now it was time to take them apart again except that there was blood in spite of everything willy had died with a lot of wet seeping human blood still in him freeze and section he said serving up a gobbet on a glass slide to his generalduty nurse who accepted it with a nod that was clara bly her pretty black face reflected sadness although one could not tell freeling reflected lifting out a dripping metal strand that was part of the vision circuits how much of the sadness was over the death of the cyborg and how much over her interrupted goingaway party she was leaving to get married the next day the recovery room just behind that door was still festooned with crepe and paper flowers for her party they had asked freeling if they should clear it away for the autopsy but of course there was no need to no one would be recovering in that recovery room he looked up at his surgical assistant standing where the anesthesiologist would have been in a normal operation and barked any word from brad hes in the building she said then why doesnt he get his ass down here is what freeling thought but he didnt say it only nodded at least he was back whatever grief was coming because of this freeling wouldnt have to carry it alone but the more he probed and fished the more he found himself baffled where was the grief what had killed hartnett the electronic components didnt seem to be wrong every time he removed one it was rushed off to the instrumentation people who workbenched in on the spot no problems nor did the gross physical structure of the brain give any immediate explanation was it possible that the cyborg had died of nothing at all freeling leaned back conscious of sweat under the hot lights instinctively waiting for his scrub nurse to wipe it off she wasnt there and he remembered and wiped his forehead on his sleeve he went in again carefully separating and removing the optical nerve system what there was of it the major sections had gone with the eyes themselves replaced by electronics then he saw it first blood seeping under the corpus callosum then as he gently lifted and probed the graywhite slippery sheath of an artery with a bulge that had burst blown a cardiovascular accident a stroke freeling left it there the rest could be done later or not at all maybe it would be as well to leave what was left of willy hartnett as close to intact as it was and it was time for the meeting the conference room doubled as the hospital library which meant that when a meeting was going on lookup research stopped there were cushioned seats for fourteen people at the long table and they were all filled with the overflow on folding chairs squeezed in where they could two seats were empty they were for brad and jon freeling off on a lastminute run to the lab for final results on some slides they said actually so that freeling could brief his boss on what had happened while he was out to lunch everybody else was there don kayman and vic samuelson telly ramez the chief shrink all of the cardiovascular people muttering among themselves the top brass from the administrative sectors and the two stars one of the stars was roger torraway uneasily sitting near the head of the table and listening with a fixed smile to other peoples conversations the other was jed griffin the presidents main man for breaking logjams his title was only chief administrative assistant to the president but even the deputy director treated him like the pope we can start any time mr griffin urged the deputy director griffins face spasmed a smile and he shook his head not until those other fellows get here he said when brad and freeling arrived all conversation stopped as though a plug had been pulled now we can begin snapped jed griffin and the worry to his tone was evident to everyone in the room every person of whom shared it we were worried too of course griffin did not want to carry his worry alone and promptly shared it with everyone in the room you dont know he said how close this whole project is to being terminated not next year or next month not phased out not cut down through roger torraway took his eyes off brad and fixed them on griffin through repeated griffin washed out he seemed to take satisfaction in saying it torraway thought and the only thing that saved it said griffin was these he tapped the oval table with a folded wad of greentinted computer printouts the american public wants the project to continue torraway felt a clutching touch at his heart and it was only in that moment that he realized how swift and urgent the feeling of hope that had preceded it had been for a moment it had sounded like a reprieve the deputy director cleared his throat i had understood he said that the polls showed a considerable ah apathy about what we were doing preliminary results yes griffin nodded but when you add them all up and put them through the computer it comes out to a strong nationwide support its real enough significant to two sigmas as i believe you people say the people want an american to live on mars however he added that was before this latest fiasco god knows what that would do if it got out the administration doesnt need a dead end something to apologize for it needs a success i cant tell you how much depends on it the deputy director turned to freeling dr freeling he said freeling stood up willy hartnett died of a stroke he said the full pm report is being typed up but thats what it comes to theres no evidence of systemic deterioration at his age and condition i wouldnt have expected it so it was trauma too much strain for the blood vessels in his brain to stand he gazed at his fingertips reflectively what comes next is conjecture he said but its the best i can do im going to ask for consultations from ripplinger at the yale medical school and anford the hell you are snapped griffin i beg your pardon freeling was caught off balance no consultations not without fullscale security clearance first this is urgenttop dr freeling oh well then ill have to take the responsibility myself the cause of the trauma was too many inputs he was overloaded he couldnt handle it i never heard of anything like that causing a stroke griffin complained it takes a good deal of stress but it happens and here were into new kinds of stress mr griffin its like well heres an analogy if you had a child who was born with congenital cataracts you would take him to a doctor and the doctor would remove them only you would have to do it before he reached the age of puberty before he stopped growing internally as well as externally you see if you dont do it by then its better if you leave him blind kids who have such cataracts removed after the age of thirteen or fourteen have as a matter of historical record an interesting phenomenon in common they commit suicide before theyre twenty torraway was trying to follow the conversation but not quite succeeding he was relieved when the deputy director intervened i dont think i see what that has to do with will hartnett jon there too it is a matter of too many inputs in the case of the kids after the cataract operation what appears to happen is disorientation they get new inputs that they have not grown a system to handle if there is sight from birth onward the visual cortex develops systems to handle mediate and interpret it if not there are no developed systems and it is too late to grow them i think willys trouble was that we gave him inputs that he had no mechanism available to handle it was too late for him to grow one all the incoming data swamped him the strain broke a blood vessel and he went on i think that will happen to roger here too if we do the same thing with him griffin turned a brief assessing look at roger torraway torraway cleared his throat but said nothing there did not seem to be anything for him to say griffin said what are you telling me freeling the doctor shook his head only what ive said i tell you whats wrong its up to somebody else to tell you how to fix it i dont think you can fix it i mean not medically youve got a brain willys or rogers it has grown up as a radio receiver now youre putting tv pictures into it it doesnt know how to deal with them all this time brad had been scribbling looking up from time to time with an expression of interest he looked down again at his note pad wrote something regarded it thoughtfully wrote again while the attention of everyone in the room turned to him at last the deputy director said brad it sounds as though the balls in your court brad looked up and smiled thats what im working on he said do you agree with dr freeling no question about it hes right we cant feed raw inputs into a nervous system that hasnt got equipment to mediate and translate them those mechanisms dont exist in the brain not in anybodys brain unless we want to take a child at birth and rebuild him then so that the brain can develop what it needs are you proposing that we wait for a new generation of astronauts griffin demanded no im proposing we build mediating circuits into roger not just sensory inputs filters translators ways of interpreting the inputs the sight from different wavelengths of the spectrum the kinesthetic sense from the new muscles everything look he said let me go back a little bit do any of you know about mcculloch and lettvin and the frogs eye he glanced around the room sure jonny you do and one or two of the others id better review a little of it the frogs perceptual system not just the eye all of the vision parts of it filters out what isnt important if a bug passes in front of the frogs eye the eye perceives it the nerves transmit the information the brain responds to it and the frog eats the bug if say a little leaf drops in front of the frog he doesnt eat it he doesnt decide not to eat it he doesnt see it the image forms in the eye all right but the information is dropped out before it reaches the brain the brain never becomes aware of what the eye has seen because it doesnt need to it simply is not relevant to a frog to know whether or not a leaf is in front of it roger was following the conversation with great interest but somewhat less comprehension wait a minute he said im more complicated i mean a man is a lot more complicated than a frog how can you tell what i need to see survival things rog weve got a lot of data from willy i think we can do it thanks i wish you were a little more sure oh im sure enough said brad grinning this didnt catch me entirely by surprise torraway said his throat halfclosed and his voice thin you mean you let willy go ahead and no roger come on willy was my friend too i thought there was enough of a safety factor to at least keep him alive i was wrong and im at least as sorry as you are roger but we all knew there was a risk that the systems wouldnt work right that wed have to do more that said griffin heavily was not made very clear in your progress reports the deputy director started to speak but griffin shook his head well come to that another time what are you saying now bradley youre going to filter out some of the information not just filter it out mediate it translate it into a form roger can handle what about torraways point that a man is more complicated than a frog have you ever done this with human beings surprisingly brad grinned he was ready for that one as a matter of fact yes about six years ago before i came here i was still a graduate student we took four volunteers and we conditioned them to a pavlovian response we flashed a bright light in their eyes and simultaneously rang an electric doorbell that pulsed at thirty beats a second well of course when you get a bright light in your eyes your pupils contract it isnt under conscious control you cant fake it it is a response to light nothing else just an evolutionary capacity to protect the eye from direct sunlight that sort of response involving the autonomic nervous system is hard to condition into human beings but we managed it when it takes it sets pretty firmly after i think it was after three hundred trials apiece we had the response fixed all you had to do was ring the bell and the subjects pupils would shrink down to dots you follow me so far i remember enough from college to know about pavlovian reflexes standard stuff said griffin well the next part wasnt standard we tapped into the auditory nerve and we could measure the actual signal going to the brain dingaling thirty beats per second we could read it on the oscilloscope so then we changed the bell we got one that rang at twentyfour beats a second care to guess what happened there was no response brad smiled the oscilloscope still showed thirty beats a second the brain was hearing something that wasnt really happening so you see it isnt just frogs that do this sort of mediation human beings perceive the world in predigested ways the sensory inputs themselves edit and rearrange the information so what i want to do with you roger he said genially is give you a little help in interpretation we cant do much with your brain good or bad were stuck with it its a mass of gray jelly with a capacitylimiting structure and we cant keep pouring sensory information into it the only place we have to work is at the interface before it hits the brain griffin slapped his open palm on the table can we make the window date he growled i can but try sir said brad genially you can but get your ass in a crack if we buy this and it doesnt work boy the geniality faded from brads face what do you want me to say i want you to tell me the odds griffin barked brad hesitated no worse than even money he said at last then said griffin smiling at last let it be so even money thought roger on the way back to his own office is not a bad bet of course it depends on the stakes he slowed down to let brad catch up with him brad he said youre pretty sure of what you were saying brad slapped him gently on the back more sure than i said to tell you the truth i just didnt want to stick my neck out for old griffin and listen roger thanks for what for trying to warn me today i appreciate it youre welcome said roger he stood there for a moment watching brad retreating back and wondering how brad knew about something he had told only to his wife we could have told him as in fact we could have told him many many things including why the polls showed what they showed but no one really needed to tell him he could have told himself if he had allowed himself to know seven mortal becoming monster don kayman was a complex man who never let go of a problem it was why we wanted him on the project as areologist but it extended to the religious part of his life too a religious problem was bothering him in the corner of his mind it did not keep him from whistling to himself as he shaved carefully around his dizzy gillespie beard and brushed his hair into a neat pageboy in front of his mirror it bothered him though he stared into the mirror trying to isolate what it was that was troubling him after a moment he realized that one thing at least was his tshirt it was wrong he took it off and replaced it with a doubleknit fourcolored turtleneck that had enough of the look of a clerical collar to appeal to his sense of humor the interhouse phone buzzed donnie are you nearly ready coming in a minute he said looking around what else his sports jacket was over a chair by the door his shoes were shined his fly was zipped im getting absentminded he told himself what was bothering him was something about roger torraway for whom at that moment he felt very sorry he shrugged picked up his jacket swung it over his shoulder went down the hall and knocked on the door of sister clotildas nunnery morning father said the novice who let him in take a seat ill get her for you thanks jess as she disappeared down the hall kayman watched her appreciatively the tightfitting pantssuit habit did a lot for her figure and kayman let himself enjoy the faint antique feeling of wickedness it gave him it was a gentle enough vice like eating roast beef on friday he remembered his parents doggedly chewing the frozen deepfried scallops every friday night even after the dispensation had become general it was not that they felt it was sinful to eat meat it was simply that their digestive systems had become so geared to fish on friday that they didnt know how to change kaymans feelings about sex were closely related to that when the celibacy rule had been lifted it had not taken away the genetic recollection of two thousand years of a priesthood that had pretended it didnt know what its sexual equipment was for sister clotilda came briskly into the room kissed his freshly shaved cheek and took his arm you smell good she said want to get a cup of coffee somewhere he asked guiding her out the door i dont think so donnie lets get it over with the autumn sun was a blast hot air up out of texas shall we put the top down she shook her head your hair will blow all over anyway its too hot she twisted in the seat belt to look at him whats the matter he shrugged starting the car and guiding it into the automatic lanes i im not sure i feel as if i have something i forgot to confess clotilda nodded appraisingly me oh no tillie its im not sure what he took her hand absentmindedly staring out the side window as they passed over a throughway he could see the great white cube of the project building off on the horizon it wasnt his interest in sister clotilda that was bothering him he was pretty sure of that although he liked the little tingle of mild wickedness he was not in any sense willing to flout the laws of his church and his god maybe he thought he might hire a good lawyer and fight but not break a law he considered his pursuit of sister clotilda daring enough and what came of that would depend on what her order allowed when and if he ever got around to asking her to apply for a dispensation he had no interest in the wilder splinter groups like the clerical communes or the revived catharists roger torraway she guessed i wouldnt be surprised he said theres something about tampering with his senses that bothers me his perceptions of the world sister clotilda squeezed his hand as a psychiatric social worker she was cleared to know what was happening at the project and she knew don kayman the senses are liars donnie thats scripture oh sure but does brad have any right to say how rogers senses lie clotilda lit a cigarette and let him think it out it wasnt until they were near the shopping mall that she said next turnoff isnt it right he said taking the wheel and turning the car back to manual he slid into a parking space still preoccupied with roger torraway there was the immediate problem of rogers wife that was trouble enough but beyond that there was the bigger problem how could roger deal with the greatest of personal questions what is right and what is wrong if the information he had to base a decision on was filtered through brads mediation circuits the sign over the shop window said pretty fancies it was a small shop by the standard of the mall which had a two guys with a quarter of a million feet of floor space and a supermarket almost as big but it was big enough to be expensive with rent utilities insurance payroll for three salespeople two of them parttime and a generous managerial salary for dorrie it meant a net loss every month of nearly two thousand dollars roger paid it gladly although some of our accountancy functions had pointed out to him that it would have been cheaper to give dorrie the two thousand a month as an allowance dorrie was stacking chinaware on a counter marked clearance sale half price she nodded to the visitors politely enough hello don nice to see you sister clotilda want to buy some red teacups cheap they look nice said clotilda oh they are but dont buy them for the nunnery the fda just ordered them off the market the glaze is supposed to be poison provided you drink at least forty cups of tea out of one of them every day of your life for twenty years oh thats too bad but youre selling them the order isnt effective for thirty days dorrie explained and flashed a grin i guess i shouldnt have told that to a priest and a nun right but honestly weve been selling this glaze for years and i never heard of anyone dying would you like to have a cup of coffee with us kayman asked in other cups of course dorrie sighed straightened a cup into line and said no we might as well just talk come on back to my office she led the way and said over her shoulder i know why youre here anyway oh said kayman you want me to go visit roger right kayman sat down in a wide armchair facing her desk why dont you dorrie cripes don whats the use hes out cold he wouldnt know whether i was there or not hes heavily sedated yes but he has periods of consciousness did he ask for me he asked after you what do you want him to do beg dorrie shrugged fiddling with a ceramic chess piece did you ever think of minding your own business don she asked he did not take offense thats what im doing rogers our one indispensable man right now do you know whats happening to him hes been on the table twentyeight times already thirteen days he doesnt have any eyes any more or lungs heart ears nose he doesnt even have any skin its all gone a few square inches at a time replaced with synthetics flaying alive men have become saints for that and now weve got a man who cant even have his own wife oh shit don dorrie flared you dont know what youre talking about roger asked me not to come and see him after the surgery started he thought i wouldnt be able to he just didnt want me to see him like that my impression of you the priest said thinly is that youre made of pretty durable stuff dorrie would you be able to stand it dorrie grimaced for a moment her pretty face did not look pretty at all it isnt a question of what i can stand she said don look do you know what its like being married to a man like roger why pretty fine i would guess said kayman startled hes a good man he is yes i know that at least as well as you do don kayman and hes head over heels in love with me there was a pause i dont think i understand what youre saying sister clotilda ventured are you displeased by that dorrie looked at the nun consideringly displeased thats one way to put it she set down the chess piece and leaned across the desk thats every girls dream right to find a genuine hero handsome and smart and famous and pretty nearly rich and have him so crazily in love with her that he cant see anything wrong thats why i married roger i couldnt believe i was that lucky her voice went up a half tone in pitch i dont think you know what its like to have someone head over heels in love with you whats the good of a man whos upside down sometimes when were in bed together im trying to get to sleep and i can hear him being awake next to me not moving not getting up to go to the bathroom just so fucking considerate do you know that when were traveling together roger never goes to the bathroom until he thinks im asleep or when im somewhere else he shaves the minute he gets up he doesnt want me to see him with his hair messed up he shaves his armpits uses deodorants three times a day he he treats me like i was the virgin mary don hes fatuous and its been that way for nine years she looked beseechingly at the priest and the nun who were silent a little illatease and then dorrie said you come along and tell me i ought to go see him when theyre turning him into something ghastly and ludicrous you and everybody else kathleen doughty dropped in last night she had a skin full shed been drinking and brooding and she decided to come over and tell me out of her bourbon wisdom that i was making roger unhappy well shes right youre all right im making him unhappy where youre wrong is thinking that my going to see him would make him happy oh hell the phone rang dorrie picked it up then glanced at kayman and sister clotilda the expression on her face which had been almost pleading condensed into something like the porcelain figures on the table beside her desk excuse me she said folding up the soft plastic petals around the mouthpiece that converted it into a hushphone and turning away from them in her chair she talked inaudibly for a moment then hung up and turned back to them kayman said youve given me something to think about dorrie but still she smiled a porcelain smile but still you want to tell me how to run my life well you cant youve said your piece both of you i thank you for coming ill thank you now to go theres nothing more to be said inside the great white cube of the project building roger lay spreadeagled on a fluidized bed he had been thirteen days like that most of the time either unconscious or unable to tell whether he was conscious or not he dreamed we could tell when he was dreaming from the rapid eye movements at first later from the twitches of the muscle endings after the eyes were gone some of his dreams were reality but he could not distinguish between them we kept very close tabs on roger torraway every second of that time there was hardly a flexure of a muscle or a flash of a synapse that did not kick over some monitor and faithfully we integrated the data and kept continuous surveillance of his vital functions it was only the beginning what had been done to roger in the first thirteen days of surgery was not much more than had been done to willy hartnett and that was not enough when all that was done the prosthetic and surgical teams began doing things that had never been done to any human being before his entire nervous system was revised and all the major pathways connected with coupling devices that led to the big computer downstairs that was an allpurpose ibm it took up half a room and still did not have enough capacity to do all the jobs demanded of it it was only an interim hookup two thousand miles away in upstate new york the ibm factory was putting together a specialpurpose computer that would fit into a backpack designing that was the most difficult part of the project we kept revising the circuits even while they were being fitted together on the workbenches it could not weigh more than eighty pounds earth weight its greatest dimension could not be more than nineteen inches and it had to work from dc batteries which were kept continually recharged by solar panels the solar panels were a problem at first but we solved that one rather elegantly they required an absolute minimum surface area of nearly thirty square feet the surface area of rogers body even after it had been revised with various attachments wasnt large enough wouldnt have been even if all of it could have been accepting marss fairly feeble sunlight at once the way we solved the problem was to design two great gossamer fairy wings hes going to look like oberon brad said gleefully when he saw the drawings or like a bat grumbled kathleen doughty they did resemble bat wings especially as they were jetblack they would be no good for flying even in a decently thick atmosphere if mars had had one they were thin film with little structural strength but they werent meant for flying or for any kind of loadbearing they were only meant to preen themselves out automatically oriented to accept as much radiation as the sun could provide as an afterthought the design was changed to include a certain amount of control on rogers part so he could use the wings as a tightrope walker uses his pole to balance all in all they were an immense improvement over the ears we had put on willy hartnett the solar wings were designed and fabricated in eight days by the time rogers shoulders were ready to accept them they were ready to attach the skin was almost a stock item by now so much had been used on willy hartnett both as original equipment and as replacements for damage or for design changes as the project went along that new grafts were loomed to rogers shape as rapidly as the surgeons flayed away the integument he was born with from time to time he would rouse himself and look at his surroundings with what seemed recognition and intelligence it was hard to be sure his visitors he had a constant stream of them sometimes spoke to him sometimes came to regard him as a laboratory specimen to be discussed and manipulated with no more persontoperson concern than they would give a titration flask vern scanyon was in almost every day staring at the developing creation with growing repugnance he looks like hell he grumbled the taxpayers would love this watch it general snarled kathleen doughty interposing her huge body between the director and the subject how do you know he cant hear you scanyon shrugged and left to report to the presidents office don kayman came in as he was going thanks mother to all the world he said gravely i appreciate your concern for my friend roger yeah she said irritably its not sentiment the poor sods got to have some selfconfidence hes going to need it you know how many amputees and paraplegics ive worked with and do you know how many of them were certified basket cases that would never walk or move any muscle or even go to the toilet by themselves its will power that does it don and for that you need to believe in yourself kayman frowned rogers state of mind was still very much in his thoughts are you arguing with me kathleen said sharply misreading the frown not in the least i mean be reasonable kathleen am i the man to question the transcendence of the spiritual over the physical im just grateful youre a good person kathleen oh crap she grumbled around the cigarette in her mouth thats what they pay me for and besides she said i take it you havent been in your office yet today theres a buckup note for all of us from his starship the general so we wont forget how important what were doing is and a little hint that if we blow our launch date were for the concentration camps as if we needed reminding sighed father kayman looking at rogers grotesque and unmoving figure scanyons a good man but he tends to think whatever he does is at the very center of the universe only this time he might be right it was at least a colorable claim to us there was not much question about it the most important link in all the complex interrelationships of mind and matter that an earlier generation of scientists had called gaia was right there floating on its fluidized bed looking like the star of a japanese horror flick without roger torraway the mars launch could not take off on time billions of people might question the importance of that we did not there was roger at the hub of everything around him in the bulk of the project building there were all the ancillary and associated efforts that were going into making him what he had to be in the surgery room next door freeling weidner and bradley tinkered new parts into him down in the marsnormal tank where willy hartnett had died those parts were benchtested in the martian environment to failure sometimes failure time was appallingly short then they were redesigned if possible or backed up or sometimes used anyway with crossed fingers and prayers the universe expanded away from roger like the shells of an onion still farther in the building was the giant clicking and whirring as it accreted new segments of programming to match the mediation facilities being built into roger hour by hour outside the building was the community of tonka which lived or died by the health of the project its principal employer and major reason for being all around tonka was the rest of oklahoma and spreading out in all directions the other fiftyfour states and around them the troubled angry world that was busy snapping arrogant notes from one of its capitals to another on the policy level and clawing for subsistence in each of its myriad personal lives the project people had come to close themselves off from most of that world they didnt watch the television news when they could avoid it preferred not to read anything but the sports sections of the newspapers in high gear they did not have a great deal of time but that wasnt the reason the reason was that they simply did not want to know the world was going mad and the isolated strangeness in the great white cube of the project building seemed sane and real to them while the rioting in new york the tacnuke fighting around the arabian gulf and the mass starvation in what used to be called the emerging nations seemed irrelevant fantasy they were fantasy at least they did not matter to the future of our race and so roger continued to change and survive kayman spent more and more time with him every minute he could spare from supervising the marsnormal tank he watched with affection as kathleen doughty stumped around the room dropping cigarette ashes on everything but roger but he was still troubled he had to accept rogers need for mediation circuits to interpret the excess of inputs but he had no answer for the great question if roger could not know what he was seeing how could he see truth eight through deceitful eyes the weather had changed quickly and for good we had seen the shift coming as a wedge of polar air pushed down out of alberta as far as the texas panhandle wind warnings had grounded the hovercars those of the project personnel who didnt have wheeled vehicles were forced to come by public transportation and the parking lots were almost bare except for great ungainly knots of tumbleweed bouncing before the wind not everyone had heeded the warnings and there were the colds and flu bugs of the years first real cold snap brad was laid up weidner was ambulatory but not allowed near roger for fear of infecting him with a trivial little illness that he was in no shape to handle most of the work of doing roger was left to jonathan freeling whose health was then guarded almost as jealously as rogers own kathleen doughty indestructibly tough old lady was in rogers room every hour dropping cigarette ash and advice on the nurses treat him like a person she ordered and put some clothes on before you go home you can show off your beautiful little butt any time what you have to do now is keep from catching cold until we can spare you the nurses did not resist her they did their best even clara bly recalled from her honeymoon to fill in for the nurses on the sick list they cared as much as kathleen doughty did although it was hard to remember looking down at the grotesque creature that was still named roger torraway that he was in fact a human being as capable of yearning and depression as themselves roger was beginning to be more clearly conscious from time to time twenty hours and more each day he was out cold or in a halfdreaming analgesic daze but sometimes he recognized the people in the room with him and sometimes even spoke coherently to them then we would put him out again i wish i knew what he was feeling said clara bly to her relief nurse the other girl looked down at the mask that was all there was left of his face with the great wide eyes that had been fabricated for him maybe youre better off if you dont she said go home clara roger heard that the oscilloscope traces showed that he had by studying the telemetry we could form some notion of what was inside his mind often he was in pain that was evident but the pain was not a warning of something that needed attention or a spur to action it was simply a fact of his life he learned to expect it and to accept it when it happened he was not conscious of very much else that pertained to his own body his bodyknowledge senses had not yet come to deal with the reality of his new body he did not know when his eyes lungs heart ears nose and skin were replaced or supplemented he didnt know how to recognize the clues that might have given him information the taste of blood and vomit at the back of his throat how was he to know that that meant his lungs were gone the blackness the suppressed pain in the skull that was so unlike any other headache he had ever had how could he tell what it meant how could he distinguish between the removal of his entire optic system and the turning off of a light switch he realized dimly at one point that somewhen he had stopped smelling the familiar hospital aroma scented odor killer and disinfectant when he didnt know all he knew was that there were no smells in his environment any more he could hear with a sharpness of discrimination and a level of perception he had never experienced before he could hear every word that was said in the room in however low a whisper and most of what happened in the adjoining rooms as well he heard what people said when he was conscious enough to hear at all he understood the words he could feel the good will of kathleen doughty and jon freeling and understood the worry and anger that underlay the voices of the deputy director and the general and above all he could feel pain there were so many different kinds of pain there were all the aches of all the parts of his body there was the healing of surgery and there was the angry pulsing of tissues that had been bruised as major work was done there were the endless little twinges as freeling or the nurses jacked instrumentation into a thousand hurtful places on the surface of his body so that they could study the readings they gave and there was the deeper internal pain that sometimes seemed physical that came when he thought of dorrie sometimes when he was awake he remembered to ask if she had been there or had called he could not remember ever getting an answer and then one day he felt a searing new pain inside his head and realized it was light he was seeing again when the nurses realized that he could see them they reported to jon freeling at once who picked up the phone and called brad be right over brad said keep him in the dark till i get there it took more than an hour for brad to make the trip and when he turned up he was clearly wobbly he submitted to an antiseptic shower an oral spray and the fitting of a surgical mask and then cautiously he opened the door and entered rogers room the voice from the bed said whos there it was weak and quavering but it was rogers voice me brad he fumbled along the side of the door until he found the light knob im going to turn the lights on a little bit roger tell me when you can see me i can see you now sighed the voice at least i guess its you brad arrested his hand the hell you can he began and then he paused what do you mean you see me what do you see well whispered the voice im not sure about the face thats just a sort of glow but i can see your hands and your head theyre bright and i can make out your body and arms pretty well a lot fainter though yeah i can see your legs too but your face is funny the middle of it is just a splotch brad touched the surgical mask comprehending infrared youre seeing the heat what else can you see roger silence from the bed for a moment then well theres a sort of square of light i guess its the door frame i mostly just see the outline of it and something pretty bright over against the wall where i hear something too the telemetry monitors and i can see my own body or at least i can see the sheet over me with a sort of outline of my body on it brad stared around the room even with time for dark adaptation he could see almost nothing a polkadot pattern of illuminated dials from the monitors and a very faint seepage of light around the door behind him thats pretty good rog anything else yeah but i dont know what they are some lights low down over near you very dim i think those are the heating ducts youre doing fine boy all right now hold on im going to turn up the room lights a little bit maybe you can get along without them but i cant and neither can the nurses tell me what you feel slowly he inched the dimmer dial around an eighth of a turn a bit more the surround lights behind the moldings under the ceiling came alive weakly at first then a trifle stronger brad could see the shape on the bed now first the glitter of the spread wings that had revolved forward over the body of roger torraway then the body itself with a sheet draped over it waisthigh i see you now sighed roger in his reedy voice its a little different im seeing color now and youre not so bright brad took his hand off the knob thats good enough for now he leaned back against the wall giddily sorry he said ive got a cold or something how about you do you feel anything i mean any pain anything like that christ brad no i mean connected with vision does the light hurt your your eyes theyre about the only thing that doesnt hurt sighed roger fine im going to give you a little more light about that much okay no trouble no brad walked delicately over to the bed all right i want you to try something can you well close your eyes i mean can you turn off the vision receptors pause i dont think so well you can rog the capacity is built in youll just have to find it willy had a little trouble at first but he got it he said he just sort of fooled around and then it happened nothings happening brad pondered for a second his head was muzzy from the infection and he could feel his stamina ebbing away how about this did you ever have sinus trouble no well maybe a little bit can you remember where it hurt the shape moved uncomfortably on the bed the great eyes staring into brads i think so feel around near there brad ordered see if you can find muscles to move the muscles arent there but the nerve endings that controlled them are nothing what muscle am i looking for oh hell roger its called the rectus lateralis and what good does that do you just fool around nothing all right brad sighed never mind for now keep on trying as often as you can all right youll find how to do it thats a comfort whispered the resentful voice from the bed hey brad youre looking brighter what do you mean brighter brad snapped more bright more light from your face yeah said brad realizing he was beginning to feel giddy again i think i may be running a temperature id better get out of here this gauze its supposed to keep me from infecting you but its only reliable for fifteen minutes or so before you go whispered the voice insistently do something for me turn off the lights again for a minute brad shrugged and complied yeah he could hear the ungainly body shifting in the bed im just turning to get a better look roger reported listen brad what i wanted to ask you is how are things working out am i going to make it brad paused for reflection i think so he said honestly everythings all right so far i wouldnt crap you roger this is all frontier stuff and something could go wrong but so far it doesnt look that way thanks one other thing brad have you seen dorrie lately pause no roger not for a week or so ive been pretty sick and when i wasnt sick i was damn busy yeah say i guess you might as well leave the lights the way you had them so the nurses can find their way around brad turned up the switch again ill be in when i can practice trying to close your eyes will you and youve got a phone call me any time you want to i dont mean if anything goes wrong ill know about that if it happens dont worry i dont go to the toilet without leaving the number where i can be reached i mean if you just want to talk thanks brad so long at least the surgery was over or the worst of it anyway when roger came to realize that he felt a kind of relief that was very precious to him although there were still more unrelieved stresses in his mind than he wanted to handle clara bly cleaned him up and against direct orders brought him flowers to boost his morale youre a good kid whispered roger turning his head to look at them what do they look like to you he tried to describe it well theyre roses but theyre not red pale yellow about the same color as your bracelet thats orange she finished whipping the new sheet over his legs it billowed gently in the upthrust from the fluidized bed want the bedpan for what he grumbled he was into his third week of a lowresidue diet and his tenth day of controlled liquid intake his excretory system had become as clara put it mostly ornamental im allowed to get up anyway he said so if anything does happen i can take care of it big man clara grinned bundling up the dirty linen and leaving roger sat up and began again his investigation of the world around him he studied the roses appraisingly the great faceted eyes took in nearly an extra octave of radiation which meant half a dozen colors roger had never seen before from ir to uv but he had no names for them and the rainbow spectrum he had seen all his life had extended itself to cover them all what seemed to him dark red was he knew lowlevel heat but it was not quite true even to say that it seemed to be red it was only a different quality of light that had associations of warmth and wellbeing still there was something very strange about the roses and it was not the color he threw off the sheet and looked down at himself the new skin was poreless hairless and wrinklefree it looked more like a wetsuit than the flesh he had known all his life under it he knew was a whole new musculature powerdriven but there was no visible trace of that soon he would get up and walk all by himself he was not quite ready for that he clicked on the tv set the screen lit up with a dazzling array of dots in magenta and cyan and green it took an effort of will for roger to look at them and see three girls singing and weaving his new eyes wanted to analyze the pattern into its components he clicked stations and got a newscast new peoples asia had sent three more nuclear subs on a courtesy visit to australia president deshatines press secretary said sternly that our allies in the free world could count on us all the oklahoma football teams had lost roger clicked it off he found himself getting a headache every time he shifted position the lines seemed to slope off at an angle and there was a baffling bright glow from the back of the set after the current was off he watched for some time the cathode tubes light failing and the glow from the back darkening and dimming it was heat he realized now what was it brad had said feel around near where your sinuses are it was a strange feeling being in the first place in an unfamiliar body and then trying to locate inside it a control that no one could quite define just in order to close the eyes but brad had assured him he could do it rogers feelings toward brad were complex and one component of them was pride if brad said it could be done by anyone then it was going to be done by roger only it wasnt being done he tried every combination of muscle squeezes and will power he could think of and nothing happened a sudden recollection hit him years old a memory from the days when he and dorrie had first been married no not married not yet living together he remembered and trying to decide if they wanted to publicly join their lives that was their massageandtranscendentalmeditation period when they were exploring each other in all the ways that had ever occurred to either of them and he remembered the smell of baby oil with a dash of musk added and the way they had laughed over the directions for the second chakra take the air into your spleen and hold it then breathe out as your hands glide up on either side of your partners spine but they had never been able to figure out where the spleen was and dorrie had been very funny searching the private recesses of their bodies is it there there oh rog look youre not serious about this he felt a sudden interior pain swell giddyingly inside him and leaned back in desolation dorrie the door burst open clara bly flew in bright eyes wide in her dark pretty face roger what are you doing he took a deep slow breath before he spoke whats the matter he could hear the flatness in his own voice it had little tone left after what they had done to it all your taps are jumping i thought i dont know what i thought roger but whatever was happening it was giving you trouble sorry clara he watched as she hurried over to the monitors on the wall studying them swiftly they look a little better she said grudgingly i guess its all right but what the hell were you doing to yourself worrying he said about what where my spleen is do you know she stared at him thoughtfully for a moment before she replied its under your lower ribs on your left side about where you think your heart is a little lower down are you putting me on roger well kind of i guess i was reminiscing about something i shouldnt have clara please dont do it any more ill try but the thought of dorrie and brad was still lurking there right under the conscious of his mind he offered one thing ive been trying to close my eyes and i cant she approached and touched his shoulder in friendly sympathy youll do it hon yeah no really i was with willy around this time and he got pretty discouraged but he made it anyway she said turning ill take care of it for you for now lightsout time youve got to be fresh as a daisy in the morning he said suspiciously what for oh not more cutting thats over for a while didnt brad tell you tomorrow theyre going to hook you into the computer for all that mediation stuff youre going to be a busy boy rog so get some sleep she turned off the light and brad watched as her dark face changed into a gentle glow that he thought of as peach something occurred to him clara do me a favor she stopped with her hand on the door whats that honey i want to ask you a question so ask he hesitated wondering how to do what he wanted to do what i want to know he said working it out in his head as he went along is lets see oh yes what i want to know clara is when your husband and you are in bed making love what different ways do you use roger the brightness of her face suddenly went up half a decibel he could see the tracing of veins under the skin as hot blood flooded through her veins he said im sorry clara i guess i guess lying here i get kind of horny forget i asked you will you she was silent for a moment when she spoke her voice was a professionals no longer a friends sure roger its okay you just kind of caught me offguard its well its all right its just that you never said anything like that to me before i know sorry but he wasnt sorry or not exactly he watched the door close behind her and studied the rectangular tracing of light bleeding through from the hall outside he was careful to keep his mind as calm as he could he didnt want to start the monitors ringing alarm bells again but he wanted to think about something that was right on the borderline of the danger zone and that was how come the flush he had tricked onto clara blys face looked so much like the sudden brightness that had come onto brads when he asked if brad had been with dorrie we were fully mobilized next morning checking the circuits cutting in the standbys insuring that the automatic switchover relays were tuned to intervene at the faintest flicker of a malfunction brad came in at am weak but clearheaded and ready to work weidner and jon freeling were only minutes after him although the primary job for the day was all brads they could not stay away kathleen doughty was thereofcourse as she had been at every step not because her duty required it but because her heart did dont give my boy a bad time she growled over her cigarette hes going to need all the help he can get when i start on him next week sounding every syllable brad said kathleen i will do the goddamned best i can yeah i know you will brad she stubbed out the cigarette and immediately lit another i never had any children and i guess roger and willy sort of filled in yeah grunted brad no longer listening he was not qualified or allowed to touch the or any of the ancillary units all he could do was watch while the technicians and the programmers did their job when the third recheck had gone almost to completion without a glitch he finally left the computer room and took the elevator up three flights to rogers room at the door he paused to breathe for a moment then opened the door with a smile youre about ready to plug in boy he said feel up to it the insect eyes turned toward him rogers flat voice said i dont know what im supposed to feel what i feel is mostly scared oh theres nothing to be scared of today brad amended hastily all were going to do is test out themediation the bat wings shuddered and changed position will that kill me asked the maddeningly monotone voice oh come on roger brad was suddenly angry its only a question ticked the voice its a crappy question look i know how you feel i doubt that brad stopped and studied rogers uncommunicative face after a moment he said let me go over it again what im going to do is not kill you its keep you alive sure youre thinking of what happened to willy it isnt going to happen to you youre going to be able to handle what happens here and on mars where its important its important to me here said roger oh for christs sake when the system is all go youll only see or hear what you need understand or what you want youll have a good deal of volitional control youll be able i cant even close my eyes yet brad you will youll be able to use all of it but you wont unless we get started on it then all this stuff will filter out the unnecessary signals so you wont be confused thats what killed willy confusion pause while the brain behind the grotesque face ruminated what roger finally said was you look lousy brad sorry about that i actually dont feel too good are you sure youre up to this im sure hey roger what are you telling me do you want to put this off no well what do you want i wish i knew brad get on with it we were all ready by then the go lights had been flashing green for several minutes brad shrugged and said morosely to the duty nurse let er rip there were ten hours then of phasing in the mediation circuits one by one testing adjusting letting roger try his new senses on projected rorschach blots and maxwell color wheels for roger the day raced by his sense of time was unreliable it was no longer regulated by everymans builtin biological clocks but by his machine components they slowed his perception of time down when there was no stress situation speeded it up when needed slow down he begged watching the nurses whiz past him like bullets and then when brad beginning to shake with fatigue knocked over a tray of inks and crayons to roger the pieces seemed actually to float to the ground he had no difficulty in catching two bottles of ink and the tray itself before they touched the floor when he came to think of it after he realized that they were the pieces that might have spilled or broken he had let the wax crayons fall free in that fraction of a second of choice he had chosen to catch the objects that needed catching and let the others go without being aware of what he did brad was highly pleased youre doing great boy he said holding to the foot of the bed im going to take off now and get some sleep but ill be in to see you tomorrow after the surgery surgery what surgery oh said brad just a little touchup nothing compared to what youve already had believe me from now on he said turning to leave youre just about through being born now all you have to do is grow up practice learn to use what youve got the hard parts are all behind you how are you doing with cutting off vision when you want to brad rang out the flat voice louder in amplitude but tonally gray what the hell do you want of me im trying i know brad said conciliating see you tomorrow for the first time that day roger was left alone he experimented with his new senses he could see that they might be very useful to him in survival situations but they were also very confusing all the tiny noises of everyday life were magnified from the hall he could hear brad talking to jonny freeling and the nurses going off duty he knew that with the ears his mother had cultured for him in her womb he would not have been able to perceive even a whisper now he could make out the words at will local anesthetic but i dont want to i want him out hes got enough trauma to deal with that was freeling talking to brad the lights were more brilliant than before he tried to diminish the sensitivity of his vision but nothing happened what he really wanted he thought was a single christmastree bulb that was plenty of light these floods of luminosity were disconcerting also he observed the lights were maddeningly rhythmical he could perceive each pulse of the sixtyhertz current inside the fluorescent tubes he observed the writhing of a glowing snake of gas incandescent bulbs on the other hand were almost dark except for the bright filaments at the center which he could examine in detail there was no sense of eyestrain even when looking at the brightest of lights he heard a new voice in the corridor and sharpened his hearing to listen clara bly just coming on duty for the evening shift hows the patient dr freeling just fine he seems rested you didnt have to give him a sleeping pill last night no he was fine kind of she giggled kind of randy though he made a sort of a pass which i never expected from roger huh there was a puzzled pause well that wont be a problem any more ive got to check the readouts take care roger thought he would have to be extra nice to clara it would not be hard to do for she was his favorite among the nurses he lay back listening to the rustle of his own black wings and the rhythmic sounds from the telemetry panels he was very tired it would be nice to sleep he sprang up the lights had stopped then they were on again as soon as he became aware of it he had learned to close his eyes satisfied roger let himself sink back onto the gently flowing bed it was true enough he was learning they woke him to feed him and then to put him to sleep again for his last operation there was no anesthesia were just going to turn you off said jon freeling you wont feel a thing and indeed he didnt first he was wheeled into the surgery next door intensivecare bottles pipes drains and all he could not smell the smell of disinfectant but he knew it was there he could perceive the brightness gathered at the cusp of every metallic object the heat from the sterilizer like a sunburst against the wall and then dr freeling ordered him out and we complied we depressed his sensory inputs one by one to him it was as though the sounds grew fainter the lights dimmer the body touches more gentle we dampened the pain inputs throughout all his new skin extinguished them completely where freelings knife would cut and needle would pierce there was a complex problem there many of the pain inputs were to be maintained after he recovered he would have to have some warning system when he was free on the surface of mars something to tell him if he was being burned or torn or damaged pain was the sharpest alarm we could give him but for much of his body pain was over once we extinguished the inputs we programmed them out of his sensorium entirely roger of course knew nothing of this roger just went to sleep and woke up again when he looked up he screamed freeling leaning back and flexing his fingers jumped and dropped his mask whats the matter roger said jesus for a minute there i saw i dont know could it have been a dream but i saw you all around me looking down and you looked like a bunch of ghouls skulls skeletons grinning at me and then you were you again freeling looked at weidner and shrugged i think he said that thats just your mediation circuits at work you know translating what you see into something you can grasp immediately i dont like it roger flared well well have to talk to brad about it but honestly roger i think thats the way its supposed to be i think its like the computer took your sensations of fear and pain you know what everyone feels when he has an operation and put them together with the visual stimulus our faces the masks all that stuff interesting i wonder how much of it was in the mediation and how much was plain postoperative delusion im glad you find it interesting roger sulked but truthfully he found it interesting too when he was back in his own room he let his mind roam he could not summon the fantasy pictures at will they came when they wanted to come but they were not as fearsome as that first terrified glimpse of bare mandibles and hollow eye sockets when clara came in with a bedpan and left again after he waved it away he watched her through the closing door and the shadow of the door became a cave entrance and clara bly a cave bear growling irritably at him she was still a little annoyed he realized some subsonic cue in her face was registering in his senses and being analyzed by the buzzing downstairs and displayed as a warning but when she came back she was wearing dorries face it melted away and reclothed itself in her familiar dark skin and bright eyes not like dorrie at all but roger took it as a sign that things were all right between them again between clara and himself not he thought between dorrie and himself he gazed at the phone by his bed the vision circuits were permanently off at his request he didnt want to call someone and forget what they might see but he had not used it to call dorrie at all often enough he reached out his hand for the phone but every time he drew his hand back he didnt know what to say to her how do you ask your wife if she is sleeping with your best friend you come right out and ask her thats how his gut feelings told roger but he could not quite make himself do it he was not sure enough he could not risk that accusation he might be wrong the thing was he couldnt discuss it with his friends not any of them don kayman would have been a natural for that it was a priests function but don was so clearly so sweetly and tenderly in love with his pretty little nun that roger could not put himself in the pain of discussing pain with him and for most of his friends the trouble was that they honestly would not have seen what the trouble was open marriage was so common in tonka in most of the western world indeed that it was the rare closed couple that caused gossip to admit to jealousy was very difficult and anyway torraway told himself stoutly it was not jealousy that troubled him not exactly jealousy it was something else it was not sicilian machismo or the outrage of the property owner who finds someone trespassing in his own fertile gardens it was that dorrie should want to love only him since he only wanted to love her he became aware that he was slipping into a state of mind that would surely ring the alarm bells on the telemetry readouts he didnt want that he resolutely took his mind away from his wife he practiced closing his eyes for a time it was reassuring to be able to summon up this new skill when he wanted it he could not have described any better than willy hartnett had what it was he did but somehow he was able to reach the decision to stop receiving visual inputs and somehow the circuitry inside his head and down in the room were able to convert that decision into blackness he could even dim the light selectively he could brighten it he could he discovered filter out all but one band of wavelengths or suppress one or cause one or more of the rainbow colors to be brighter than the rest it was quite satisfying really although in time it cloyed he wished he had lunch to look forward to but there would be no lunch that day partly because he had had an operation partly because they were gradually deaccustoming him to eating over the next few weeks he would eat and drink less and less by the time he was on mars he would really need to eat only about one square meal a month he flung back the sheet and gazed idly down at the artifact that his body had become a second later he shouted a great raw scream of fear and pain the telemetry monitors all flashed blinding red in the corridor outside clara bly turned in midstep and dashed for his door back in brads bachelor apartment the warning bells went off a splitsecond later tзlling him of something urgent and serious that woke him out of an unsound fatigued sleep when clara opened the door she saw roger curled fetally on the bed groaning in misery one hand was cupping his groin between his closed legs roger whats the matter the head lifted and the insect eyes looked at her blindly roger did not stop the animal sounds that were coming from him did not speak he only lifted his hand there between his legs was nothing nothing at all of penis testicles scrotum nothing but the gleaming artificial flesh with a transparent bandage over it concealing the surgery lines it was as if nothing had ever been there of the diagnostic signs of manhood nothing the tiny little operation was over and what was left was nothing at all nine dash visits a bedside don kayman didnt like the timing but he had no choice he had to visit his tailor unfortunately his tailor was in merritt island florida at the atlantic test center he flew there worried and arrived worried not only at what had happened to roger torraway that seemed to be under control praise be to divine mercy although kayman couldnt help feeling that they had almost lost him and somebody had blundered badly in not preparing him for that last little bit of minor cosmetic surgery probably he thought charitably it was because brad had been ill but surely they had come close to blowing the whole project the other thing he was fretting about was that he could not avoid the secret feeling of sin that seemed to be a realization that internally in his heart of hearts he wished the project would be blown he had had a tearful hour with sister clotilda when the probability that he would go to mars had firmed up into the cutting of orders should they marry first no no on pragmatic practical reasons although there was not much doubt that both could ask for and receive the dispensation from rome there was also not much hope that it would come through in less than six months if only they had applied earlier but they hadnt and both of them knew that they were not willing to marry without it or even to go to bed together without the sacrament at least said clotilda toward the end attempting to smile you wont have to worry about my being unfaithful to you if i wouldnt break my vows for you i doubt id do it for any man i wasnt worried he said but now under the gleaming blue skies of florida staring up at the gantries that rose to reach for the fluffy white clouds he was worrying the army colonel who had volunteered to show him around was aware that something was troubling kayman but he had no way of diagnosing the trouble its safe enough he said probing at random i wouldnt give a thought to the lowinjection rendezvous orbit kayman tore his attention away from his interior and said i promise you i wasnt i dont even know what you mean oh well its just that were putting your bird and the two support launches into a lower orbit than usual two twenty kilometers instead of four hundred its political of course i hate it when the bureaucrats tell us what we have to do but this time it doesnt really make a difference kayman glanced at his watch he still had an hour to kill before returning for his last fitting of marssuit and spacesuit and he was not anxious to spend it fretting he judged accurately that the colonel was one of those happy folk who like to talk about nothing as much as their work and that all he need give would be an occasional grunt to keep the colonel explaining everything that could be explained he gave the grunt well father kayman said the colonel expansively were giving you a big ship you know too big to launch in one piece so were putting up three birds and youll meet in orbit two twenty by two thirtyfive optimal and i expect well be right on the money and kayman nodded without really listening he already knew the flight plan by heart it was in the orders he had been given the only open questions were who the remaining two occupants of the mars bird would be but it would only be a matter of days before that was decided one would have to be a pilot to stay in orbit while the other three crowded into the marslander and went down to the surface of the planet the fourth man should ideally be someone who could function as backup to pilot areologist and cyborg but of course no such person existed it was time to make the decision though the three human beings the three unaltered human beings he corrected himself would not have rogers capacity for surviving naked on the surface of mars they would have to have the same fittings he was going through now and then the final brushup training in procedures that all of them would need even roger and launch time was only thirtythree days away the colonel had finished with the docking and reassembly maneuvers and was getting ready to outline the daybyday calendar of events on all the long months to mars kayman said wait a minute colonel i didnt quite get that about political considerations what does that have to do with how we take off the colonel grumbled resentfully damn ecology freaks they get everybody upset these texas twin launch vehicles theyre big about twenty times the thrust of a saturn so they make a lot of exhaust it comes to something like twentyfive metric tons of water vapor a second times three birds a lot of water vapor and admittedly theres some risk that the water vapor well no lets be fair we know damn well excuse me father that what all that water vapor would do at normal orbitinjection altitudes would be to knock out the free electrons in a big patch of sky they found that way back in lets see i think it was or when they put the first spacelab up knocked the free electrons out of a volume of atmosphere that stretched from illinois to labrador when it was measured and of course thats what keeps you from getting sunburned one of the things they help filter out the solar uv skin cancer sunburn destruction of flora well theyre all real they could happen but its not our own people dash is worried about the npa thats what bugs him theyve given him an ultimatum that if your launch damages their sky they will consider it a hostile act hostile act what the hell do you call it when they parade five nuclear subs off cape may new jersey claim its oceanographic research but you dont use cruiserkiller subs for oceanography not in our navy anyway anyway the colonel said bringing himself back to his guest and smiling its okay well just put you into rendezvous orbit a little lower down out of the freeelectron layer costs more fuel winds up making more pollution the way i look at it but it keeps their precious free electrons intact not that theres any real chance theyd survive across the atlantic into africa even much less asia youve been very interesting colonel kayman said courteously i think its time for me to get back though the fitters were ready for him just slip into this for size the physicotherapist member of the team grinned slipping into the spacesuit was twenty minutes of hard work even if the whole team had been helping kayman insisted on doing it himself in the spacecraft he wouldnt have any more help than the rest of the crew who would be busy with their own affairs and in an emergency he wouldnt have any help at all he wanted to be ready for any emergency it took an hour and another ten minutes to get out of it after theyd checked all the parameters and pronounced everything fine and then there were all the other garments to try it was dark outside a warm florida autumn night before he was finished he looked at the row of vestments laid out on the worktables and grinned he pointed to the commantenna fabric that dangled from one wrist the radiation cloak for use in solarflare conditions the body garment that went under the suits themselves youve got me all fixed up thats the maniple theres the chasuble thats my alb couple more pieces and id be all ready to say mass actually he had included a complete set of vestments in his weight allotment it had seriously depleted the available reserve for books music tapes and pictures of sister clotilda but he was not prepared to discuss that with these worldly people he stretched and sighed wheres a good place to eat around here he asked a steak or maybe some of that red snapper you people talk about and then bed the air force mp who had been standing by for two hours glancing at his watch stepped forward and spoke up sorry father he said youre wanted elsewhere right now and youre due in lets see about twenty minutes due where ive got a long flight tomorrow im sorry sir my orders are to bring you to the ad building at patrick air force base i expect theyll tell you what its all about then the priest drew himself up corporal he said im not under your jurisdiction i suggest you tell me what it is you want no sir the mp agreed youre not but my orders are to bring you and with all due respect sir i will the physicotherapist touched kaymans shoulder go ahead don he said i have a feeling youre in pretty high echelons right now grumbling kayman allowed himself to be led out and put into a hoverjeep the driver was in a hurry he did not bother with the roads but aimed the vehicle out toward the surf judged his time and distance and skittered out onto the surface of the ocean between waves then he turned south and gunned it in ten seconds they were doing at least a hundred and fifty kilometers an hour even on highlift thrust with three meters of air between them and the average height of the water the rolling twisting chop from the waves corkscrewing under them had kayman swallowing saliva and looking for a throwup bag against a rather possible need in no time at all he tried to get the corporal to slow down sorry sir it was the mps favorite expression it seemed but they managed to reach the beach at patrick before kayman quite vomited and back on land the driver slowed to reasonable speeds kayman tottered out and stood in the damp lush night until two more mps radioalerted to his coming saluted and escorted him inside a white stucco building before ten minutes had elapsed he was stripped to the skin and being searched and he realized what high echelons he was indeed moving in the presidents jet touched down at patrick at hours kayman had been dozing on a beach chair with a throw rug over his legs he was shaken courteously awake and led to the boarding steps while refueling tankers were topping off the wing tanks in peculiarly eerie silence there was no conversation no banging of bronze nozzles against aluminum filler caps only the throbbing of the tank trucks pumps somebody very important was asleep kayman wished with all his heart that he was too he was conducted to a recliner chair strapped in and left and even before his wac hostess had left his side the jet was picking its way to the takeoff strip he tried to doze but while the jet was still climbing to cruise altitude the presidents valet came back and said the president will see you now sitting down and freshly shaved around his goatee president deshatine looked like a gilbert stuart painting of himself he was at ease in a leatherbacked chair unfocused eyes peering out the window of the presidential jet while he listened to some sort of tape through earphones a full coffee cup was steaming next to his elbow and an empty cup was waiting by the silver pot next to the cup was a slim box of purple leather embossed with a silver cross dash didnt keep him waiting he looked around smiled pulled off the earphones and said thank you for letting me kidnap you father kayman sit down please help yourself to coffee if youd like it thanks the valet sprang to pour and retired to stand behind don kayman kayman didnt look around he knew that the valet would be watching every muscle tremor and so he avoided sudden moves the president said ive been in so many time zones the last fortyeight hours that ive forgotten what the real world is like munich beirut rome i picked up vern scanyon in rome when i heard about the trouble with roger torraway scared the shit out of me father you almost lost him didnt you kayman said im an areologist mr president it was not my responsibility cut it out father im not assigning blame theres plenty to go around if it comes to that i want to know what happened im sure general scanyon could tell you more than i can mr president kayman said stiffly if i wanted to settle for verns version the president said patiently i wouldnt have stopped to pick you up you were there he wasnt he was off in rome at the vatican pacem in excelsis conference kayman took a hasty sip from his coffee cup well it was close i think he wasnt properly briefed for what was going to happen because there was a flu epidemic really we were short of staff brad wasnt there that has happened before the president observed kayman shrugged and did not pick up the lead they castrated him mr president what the sultans used to call a complete castration penis and all he doesnt need it because theres so little consumable going into him now that it all gets excreted anally so it was just a vulnerable spot theres no question it had to come off mr president what about the what do you call it prostatectomy was that a vulnerable spot too you really should ask one of the doctors about this mr president kayman said defensively im asking you scanyon said something about priests disease and youre a priest kayman grinned thats an old expression from the days when all priests were celibate but yes i can tell you about it we talked about it a lot in the seminary the prostate produces fluid not much a few drops a day if a man doesnt have ejaculations it mostly just passes out with the urine but if he is sexually excited theres more and it doesnt all pass out it backs up and the congestion leads to trouble so they cut out his prostate and implanted a steroid capsule mr president he wont become effeminate physically hes now a complete selfcontained eunuch and oh i mean unit the president nodded thats what they call a freudian slip kayman shrugged and if you think that way the president pressed what the hell do you think torraway thinks i know its not easy for him mr president as i understand it dash went on you arent just an areologist don youre a marriage counselor too and not doing too well right that trampy little wife of his is giving our boy a hard time dorrie has a lot of problems no dorrie has one problem same problem we all have shes screwing up our mars project and we cant afford to have that happen can you straighten her out well i dont mean make her a perfect person cut it out don i mean can you get her to put his mind at rest at least enough so he doesnt go into shock any more give him a kiss and a promise send him a valentine when hes on mars god knows torraway doesnt expect any more than that but he has a right to that much i can try said kayman helplessly and im going to have a few words with brad the president said grimly ive told you ive told you all this project has to work i dont care about somebodys cold in the head or somebody elses hot pants i want torraway on mars and i want him happy there the plane banked to change course away from the traffic around new orleans and a glint of morning sun shone up from the greasy oilslick surface of the gulf the president squinted down at it angrily let me tell you father kayman what ive been thinking ive been thinking that roger would be happier mourning over the death of his wife in a car smash than worrying about what shes doing when hes not around i dont like thinking that way but i have just so many options kayman and i have to pick the one thats least bad and now he said suddenly smiling ive got something for you from his holiness its a present take a look at it wondering kayman opened the purple box it held a rosary coiled on purple velvet inside the leather case the ave marias were ivory carved into rosebuds the big paternoster beads were chased crystal it has an interesting history the president went on it was sent back to ignatius loyola from one of his missions in japan and then it was in south america for two hundred years with the what do you call them the reductions of paraguay its a museum piece really but his holiness wanted you to have it i i dont know what to say kayman managed and it has his blessing the president leaned back and suddenly looked a great deal older pray with it father he said im not a catholic i dont know how you feel about these things but i want you to pray for dorrie torraways getting her head straightened out enough to last her husband a while and if that doesnt work youd better pray real hard for all of us back in the main cabin kayman strapped himself in his seat and willed himself asleep for the remaining hour or so of the flight to tonka exhaustion triumphed over worry and he drifted off he was not the only one worried we had not properly estimated the trauma roger torraway would receive from the loss of his genitals and we had nearly lost him the malfunction was critical it could not be risked again we had already arranged for beefedup psychiatric attendance on roger and in rochester the backpack computer was being recircuited to monitor major psychic stress and react before rogers slower human synapses could oscillate into convulsions the world situation was proceeding as predicted new york city was of course in turmoil the near east was building up pressures past the safety valves and new peoples asia was pouring out furious manifestos denouncing the squid kill in the pacific the planet was rapidly reaching critical mass our projections were that the future of the race was questionable on earth past another two years we could not allow that the mars landing had to succeed when roger came out of the haze after his seizure he did not realize how close he had come to dying he only realized that he had been wounded in all of his most sensitive parts the feeling was desolation wipedout hopeless desolation he not only had lost dorrie he had lost his manhood the pain was too extreme to be relieved by crying even if he had been able to cry it was the agony of the dentists chair without ahesthesia so acute that it no longer felt like a warning but became merely a fact of the environment something to be experienced and endured the door opened and a new nurse came in hi i see youre awake she came over and laid warm fingers on his forehead im sulie carpenter she said its susan lee really but sulies what they call me she withdrew her hand and smiled youd think id know better than feeling for fever wouldnt you i already know what it is from the monitors but i guess im an oldfashioned girl torraway hardly heard her he was preoccupied with seeing her was it a trick of his mediation circuits tall greeneyed darkhaired she looked so very much like dorrie that he tried changing the field of vision of his great insect eyes zooming down on the pores in her slightly freckled skin altering the color values decreasing the sensitivity so that she seemed to fade into a twilight no matter she still looked like dorrie she moved to scan the duplicate monitors at the side of the room youre doing real well colonel torraway she called over her shoulder im going to bring you your lunch in a little while anything you want now he roused himself and sat up nothing i can have he said bitterly oh no colonel her eyes showed shock i mean well excuse me i dont have any right to talk to you like that but dear lord colonel if theres anybody in this world who can have anything he wants youre it i wish i felt that way he grumbled but he was watching her closely and curiously he did feel something something he could not identify but something which was not the pain that had overwhelmed him only moments before sulie carpenter glanced at her watch and then pulled up a chair you sound low colonel she said sympathetically i guess all this is pretty hard to take he looked away from her up to where the great black wings were rippling slowly over his head he said it has its bad parts believe me but i knew what i was getting into sulie nodded she said i had a bad time when my my boyfriend died of course thats nothing like what youre doing but in a way maybe it was worse you know it was so pointless one day we were fine and talking about getting married the next day he came back from the doctors and those headaches hed been having turned out to be she took a deep breath brain tumor malignant he was dead three months later and i just couldnt handle it i had to get away from oakland i applied to be transferred here never thought id get it but i guess theyre still shorthanded from the flu im sorry roger said quickly she smiled its all right she said its just that there was a big empty place in my life and im really grateful ive got something to fill it here she glanced again at her watch and jumped up the floor nursell be on my back she said now listen really is there anything i can get for you book music youve got the world at your command you know including me not a thing roger said honestly thanks anyway how come you picked coming here she looked at him thoughtfully the corners of her lips curving very faintly well she said i knew something about the program here ive been in aerospace medicine for ten years in california and i knew who you were colonel torraway knew i used to have your picture on my wall when you were rescuing those russians you wouldnt believe the active role you played in some of my fantasies colonel torraway sir she grinned and turned away stopping at the door do me a favor will you roger was surprised sure what well id like a more recent picture you know what security is like here if i sneak in a camera can i take a quick snapshot of you now just so i can have something to show my grandchildren if i ever have any roger protested theyll kill you if they catch you sulie she winked ill take my chances its worth it thanks after she had gone roger made an effort to go back to thinking about his castration and his cuckolding but for some reason they seemed less overwhelming nor did he have a great deal of time sulie came in with a lowresidue lunch a smile and a promise to be back the following morning clara bly gave him an enema and then he lay wondering while three identical fairmustached men came in and went over every inch of floor wall and furniture with metal detectors and electronic mops they were total strangers and they stayed in the room on newbrought chairs silent and watching while brad came in brad was looking not merely ill but seriously worried hi roger he said jesus you scared us its my fault i should have been on tap but this damn flu bug i survived roger said studying brads rather ordinary face and wondering just why he wasnt feeling outrage and resentment were going to have to keep you pretty busy now brad began dragging up a chair weve phased out some of your mediation circuits for the moment when theyre full in again were going to have to limit your sensory inputs let you work up to handling a total environment a little at a time and kathleens jumping to get you started on retraining you know learning how to use your muscles and all that he glanced over at the three silent watchers his expression roger thought was suddenly full of fear i guess im ready roger said oh sure i know you are said brad surprised havent they been giving you updates on your readouts youre functioning like a seventeenjewel watch roger all the surgery is over now youve got everything you need he sat back studying roger if i do say so he grinned youre a work of art roger and im the artist i just wish i could see you on mars thats where you belong boy one of the watchers cleared his throat its getting toward that time dr bradley he said the worried look returned to brads face coming right away take care rog ill be back to see you later he left and the three government agents followed him as clara bly came in and fussed around the room a mystery was suddenly clear dash is coming to see me roger guessed smart sniffed clara well i guess its all right for you to know it wasnt all right for me to know they think its a secret but what kind of secret is it when they turn the whole hospital upside down theyve had those guys all over the place since before i came on duty when will he get here roger asked thats the part that is a secret from me anyway but it did not stay a secret very long within the hour to an unheard but strongly felt hail to the chief the president of the united states came into the room with him was the same valet he had had on the presidential jet but this time he was obviously not a valet only a bodyguard marvelous to see you again said the president holding out his hand he had never seen the revised and edited version of the astronaut before and certainly the dully gleaming flesh the great faceted eyes the hovering wings must have looked strange but what showed in the presidents welldisciplined face was only friendship and pleasure i stopped off a little while ago to say hello to your good wife dorrie i hope shes forgiven me for messing up her fingernail polish last month i forgot to ask but how are you feeling how roger was feeling was once again amazed at the thoroughness of the presidents briefing but what he said was fine mr president the president inclined his head toward the bodyguard without looking at him john have you got that little package for colonel torraway its something dorrie asked me to bring over to you you can open it when weve gone the bodyguard placed a whitepaper package on rogers bedside table and slid a chair over for the president in almost the same motion just as the president was preparing to sit down roger said the president sharpening the creases in his bermudas i know i can be honest with you youre all weve got now and we need you the indices are looking worse every day the asians are spoiling for trouble and i dont know how long i can keep from giving it to them we have to get you to mars and you have to function when you get there i cant overestimate the importance of it roger said i think i understand that sir well in a way i guess you do but do you understand it in your gut do you really feel deep down that youre that one man maybe two in a generation who somehow or other gets himself in a position thats so important to the whole human race that even inside his own mind what happens to him doesnt measure up in importance thats where you are roger i know the president went on sorrowfully that theyve taken some mighty sacrificial liberties with your person didnt give you a chance to say yes no or maybe didnt even tell you its a pisspoor way to treat any human being let alone somebody who means as much as you do and somebody who deserves as well as you do too ive kicked a bunch of asses around here about that ill be glad to kick a lot more if you want it done tell me any time its better if i do it than you with those steel muscles theyve given you you might damage a few of those pretty behinds on the nurses past the point of repair do you mind if i smoke what oh hell no mr president thanks the valet had an open cigarette case in one hand and a glowing lighter in the other as soon as the president stretched out his hand he took a deep draw and leaned back roger he said let me tell you my fantasy about what i think is in your mind youre thinking heres old dash politician to the end full of bulishit and promises trying to trick me into pulling his chestnuts out of the fire hed say anything hed promise anything all he wants is what he can get out of me anywhere near right so far why no mr president well a little bit the president nodded youd be crazy if you didnt think a little bit of that he said matteroffactly its all true you know up to a point its true id promise you anything tell you any lies i could think of to get you to mars but the other thing thats true is that you have us all by the genial organs roger we need you theres a war coming if we dont do something to stop it and its crazy but the trend projections say the only thing that can stop it is putting you on mars dont ask me why i just go by what the technical people tell me and they claim thats what the computers print out rogers wings were stirring restlessly but the eyes were intent on the president so you see said the president heavily im appointing myself your hired hand roger you tell me what you want ill make damn sure you get it you pick up that phone any time day or night theyll put you through to me if im asleep you can wake me if you want to if it can wait you can leave a message theres going to be no more fucking you around in this place and if you even think its happening you tell me and ill stop it christ he said grinning as he started to stand up do you know what the history books are going to say about me fitzjames deshatine fortysecond president of the united states during his administration the human race established its first selfsustaining colony on another planet thats what ill get roger if i get that much and youre the only one who can give it to me well he said moving toward the door theres a governors conference waiting for me in palm springs they expected me six hours ago but i figured you mattered a hell of a lot more than they did kiss dorrie for me and call me if you dont have anything to complain about call me to say hello any time and he left with a dazzled astronaut staring after him take it any way you liked roger reflected it was really a pretty spectacular performance and it left him feeling both awed and pleased subtracting percent of it as bullshit what was left was highly gratifying the door opened and sulie carpenter came in looking faintly scared she was carrying a framed photograph i didnt know what kind of company you were moving in she said do you want this it was a picture of the president signed for roger from his admirer dash i guess i do said roger can you hang it up when its a picture of dash you can she said it has a selfhanging gadget right up here she pressed it against the wall near the door and stepped back to admire it then she looked around winked and pulled a flat black camera the size of a cigarette pack out of her apron smile at the birdie she said and snapped away you wont rat on me okay ive got to be going im not on duty now but i wanted to look in on you roger leaned back and folded his hands on his chest things were turning out rather interestingly he had not forgotten the internal pain of the discovery of his castration and he had not put dorrie out of his mind but neither was perceived as pain any more there were too many newer more pleasant thoughts overlaying them thinking of dorrie reminded him of her gift he opened it it was a ceramic cup in harvest colors ornamented with a cornucopia of fruits the card said this is a way of telling you that i love you and it was signed dorrie all of torraways signs were stable now and we were getting ready to phase in the mediation circuits this time roger was well briefed brad was with him every hour after taking a large share of the presidents asskicking he was chastened and diligent we deployed one task force to oversee the phasingin of the mediation circuits another to buffer the readoutreadin of data from the in tonka to the new backpack computer in rochester new york texas and oklahoma were going through one of their periodic brownouts just then which complicated all machine data handling and the aftereffects of the flu were still with the human beings on the staff we were definitely shorthanded moreover we needed still more the backpack computer was rated at percent reliable in every component but there were something like components there was a lot of backup and a full panoply of crossinput paths so that failure of even three or four major subsystems would leave enough capacity to keep roger going but that wasnt good enough analysis showed that there was one chance in ten of criticalpath failure within half a martian year so the decision was made to construct launch and orbit around mars a fullsize replicating all the functions of the backpack computer in triplicate it would not be as good as the backpack if the backpack experienced total failure roger would have the use of the orbiter only percent of the time when it was above the horizon in its orbit and thus could interlink with him by radio there would be a worstcase lag of a hundredth of a second which was tolerable also he would have to stay in the open or linked with an external antenna otherwise there was another reason for the backup orbiter and that was the high risk of glitches both the orbiting and the backpack were heavily shielded nevertheless they would pass through the van allen belts at launch and the solar wind all through their flight by the time they got to the vicinity of mars the solar wind would be at a low enough level to be bearable except in the case of flares the charged particles of a flare could easily bug enough of the stored data in either computer to critically damage its function the backpack computer would be helpless to defend itself the on the other hand had enough reserve capacity for continuous internal monitoring and repair in idle moments and it would have many idle moments as much as percent of its function time even when in use by roger it would compare data in each of its triplicate arrays if any datum differed from the same datum in the other arrays it would check for compatibility with the surround data if all data were compatible it would examine all three arrays and make the one aberrant bit conform with the other two if two did not conform it would check against the backpack if possible that was all the redundancy we could afford but it was quite a lot on the whole we were very pleased to be sure the orbiting would require a good deal of power we calculated the probable maximum draw against the probable worstcase supply of any reasonable set of solar panels and concluded that the margin was too thin so raytheon got a preempt order for one of its mhd generators and crews went to work on route to modify it for space launch and automatic operation in orbit around mars when the and the mhd generator arrived in orbit they would lock to each other the generator would supply all the power the computer needed and have enough left over to microwave a useful surplus down to roger on the surface of mars which he could use both to power his own machine parts as needed or for whatever powerusing equipment he might like to install once we had completed all the plans we could hardly see how we had thought we could get along without them in the first place those were happy days we requested and were promptly given all the reinforcements we needed tulsa went without lights two nights a week so we could have the energy reserves we needed and jet propulsion laboratories lost their entire spacemedicine staff to our project the readin of data proceeded glitches chased themselves merrily around both new computers the backpack in rochester and the duplicate that had been rushed to merritt island but we hunted them down isolated them corrected them and were keeping right on schedule the world outside of course was not as pleasant using a homemade plutonium bomb made out of materials hijacked from the breeder reactor at carmarthen welsh nationalists had blown up the hyde park barracks and most of knightsbridge in california the cascade mountains were burning out of control the firefighting helicopters grounded because of the fuel shortage an exploding epidemic of smallpox had depopulated poona and was already out of control in bombay cases were being reported from madras to delhi as those who were able fled the plague the australians had declared condition red mobilization the npa had called for an emergency meeting of the un security council and capetown was under siege all of this was as the graphs had predicted we were aware of all of it we continued with our work when one of the nurses or technicians took time to worry he had the presidents orders to reassure him on every bulletin board and placarded in most of the workrooms was a quote from dash you take care of roger torraway and ill take care of the rest of the world fitzjames deshatine we didnt need the reassurance we knew how important the work was the survival of our race depended on it compared to that nothing else mattered roger woke up in total blackness he had been dreaming and for a moment the dream and the reality were queerly fused the dream had been of a long time ago when he and dorrie and brad had driven down to lake texoma with a few friends who owned a sailboat and in the evening they had sung to brads guitar while the huge moon rose over the water he thought he heard brads voice again but he listened more closely his brain clearing from sleep and there was nothing there was nothing that was strange no sound at all not even the purrs and clicks of the telemetry monitors along the wall not even a whisper from the hall outside however much he tried with all the enhanced sensitivity of his new ears there was no sound at all nor was there light not in any color not anywhere except for the dullest of dim red glows from his own body and a glow equally dull from the baseboards of the room he moved restlessly and discovered he was tethered to the bed for a moment terror flooded through his mind trapped helpless alone had they turned him off were his senses deliberately blacked out what was happening a small voice near his ear spoke again roger this is brad your readouts say youre awake the relief was overpowering yes he managed whats going on weve got you in a sensorydeprivation environment apart from my voice can you hear anything not a sound said roger not anything how about light roger reported the dim heat glow thats all fine said brad now heres the thing roger were going to let you work in your new sensorium a little bit at a time simple sounds simple patterns weve got a slide projector through the wall over the head of your bed and a screen by the door you cant see it of course but its there what were going to do wait a minute kathleens determined to talk to you faint friction sounds and scuffles and then kathleen doughtys voice roger this shithead forgot one important thing sensory deprivations dangerous you know that ive heard it roger admitted according to the experts the worst part of it is feeling impotent to end it so any time you begin to feel bad just talk one of us will always be here and well answer itll be brad or me or sulie carpenter or clara are you all there right now christ yes plus don kayman and general scanyon and cripes half the staff you wont lack for company roger i promise you that now what about my voice is that giving you any trouble he thought not that i notice you do sound a little bit like a creaking door he evaluated thats bad i dont think so you sound kind of that way all the time kathleen she giggled well im going to stop talking in a minute anyway what about brads voice i didnt notice anything or anyway im not sure i was sort of dreaming and for a minute i thought he was singing aura lee along with his guitar brad cut in thats interesting roger what about now no you sound like yourself well your readouts look good all right well go into that later now what were going to do is give you pure simple visual inputs to deal with as kathleen says you can speak to us any time and well answer if you want us to but we wont speak much for a while let the visual circuits work themselves in before we confuse things with simultaneous sight and sound got it go ahead said roger there was no answer but in a moment a pale point of light appeared against the far wall it was not bright with the eyes he had been born with roger suspected he would not have been able to see it at all as it was he could make it out clearly and even in the filtered air of his hospital room he could see the faint path of light from projector to wall over his head nothing else happened for a long time roger waited as patiently as he could more time passed finally he said all right i see it its a dot ive been watching it all along and its still just a dot i do observe he said turning his head about that theres enough reflected light from it that i can see the rest of the room a little bit but thats all when brads voice came it sounded like thunder okay roger hold on and well give you something else wow roger said not so loud okay i wasnt any louder than before brad objected and in fact his voice had reduced itself to normal proportions okay okay roger muttered he was getting bored after a moment another point of light appeared a few inches from the first one both held for another long time and then a line of light leaped into being between them this is pretty dull he complained its meant to be it was clara blys voice this time hi roger greeted her listen i can see pretty well now in all this light youre giving me what are all these wires sticking into me brad cut in theyre your telemetry roger thats why we had to tie you down so you wouldnt roll over and mess up the leads everythings on remote now you know we had to take almost everything out of your room so i noticed all right go ahead but it was tedious and remained tedious these were not the kinds of things that were calculated to keep ones mind busy they might be important but they were also dull after an interminable stretch of simple geometric figures of light the intensity reduced so that there was less and less spill of reflection to illuminate the rest of the room they began feeding him sounds clicks oscillator beeps a chime a hiss of white noise in the room outside the shifts kept changing they stopped only when the telemetry indicated roger needed sleep or food or a bedpan none of those needs were frequent roger began to be able to tell who was on duty from the tiniest of signs the faintly mocking note in brads voice that was only there when kathleen doughty was in the room the slower somehow more affectionate chirping of the sound tapes when sulie carpenter was monitoring the responses he discovered that his time sense was not the same as that of those outside or of reality whatever that was thats to be expected rog said the weary voice of brad when he reported it if you work at it youll find you can exercise volitional control over that you can count out seconds like a metronome if you want to or move faster or slower depending on whats needed how do i do that roger demanded hell man brad flared its your body learn to use it then apologetically the same way you learned to block off vision experiment till you figure it out now pay attention im going to play you a bach partita somehow the time passed but not easily and not quickly there were long periods when rogers altered time sense contrarily dragged his tedium out times when against his will he found himself thinking again about dorrie the lift that dashs visit had given him the pleasant concern and affection from sulie carpenter these were good things but they did not last forever dorrie was a reality of his reverie and when his mind was empty enough to wander it was to dorrie that it wandered dorrie and their joyous early years together dorrie and the terrible knowledge that he was no longer enough of a man to gratify her sexual needs dorrie and brad kathleen doughtys voice snapped i dont know what the hell youre doing roger but its screwing up your vital signs cut it out all right he grumbled he put dorrie out of his mind he thought of kathleens rancorous affectionate voice of what the president had said of sulie carpenter he made himself tranquil as a reward they showed him a slide of a bunch of violets in full color ten the batmans entrechats suddenly amazingly there were only nine days left outside the clerical condominium father kayman shivered in the cold waiting for his ride to the project the fuel shortage had worsened a great deal in the past two weeks with the fighting in the middle east and the scottish freedom fighters blowing up the north sea pipelines the project itself had overriding priorities for whatever it needed even though some of the missile silos had not enough fuel for topping off their birds but all the staff had been urged to turn off lights share rides turn down their home thermostats watch less tv an early snowstorm had dusted the oklahoma prairies and outside the condominium a seminary student was sleepily pushing the snow off the walks there was not much of it and kayman thought it was not particularly nicelooking was it his imagination or was it tattletale gray could the ash from the blazing california and oregon forests have soiled the snow fifteen hundred miles away brad beeped his horn and kayman jumped sorry kayman said getting in and closing the door say shouldnt we take my car next time uses a lot less fuel than this thing of yours brad shrugged morosely and peered into his rearview mirror another hovercar this one a light fast sports job was swinging around the corner after them i drive for two anyway he said thats the same one that was tailing me on tuesday theyre getting sloppy or else they want to make sure i know im being followed kayman looked over his shoulder the following car was certainly taking no pains to be inconspicuous do you know who it is brad is there any doubt kayman didnt answer actually there wasnt the president had made clear to brad that he was not under any circumstances to fool around with the monsters wife in a halfhour interview of which brad vividly recalled every painful second the shadowing had begun immediately thereafter to make sure brad didnt forget but it was not a subject that kayman wanted to discuss with brad he turned on the radio tuned to a news broadcast they listened for a few minutes of censored but still overpowering disaster until brad wordlessly reached out and snapped it off then they rode in silence under the leaden sky until they reached the great white cube of the project alone on the desolate prairie inside there was nothing gray the lights were strong and glaring the faces were tired sometimes concerned but they were alive in here at least kayman thought there was a sense of accomplishment and purpose the project was right on schedule and in nine days the mars craft would be launched and he himself would be on it kayman was not afraid to go he had shaped his life toward it from the first days in the seminary when he had realized that he could serve his god in more places than a pulpit and was encouraged by his father superior to continue his interest in all heavens whether astrophysical or theological nevertheless it was a weighty thought he felt unready he felt the world was unready for this venture it all seemed so curiously impromptu in spite of the eternities of work that they had put in himself included even the crew was not finally decided roger would go he was the raison dкtre of the whole project of course kayman would go that had been decided firmly but the two pilots were still only provisional kayman had met them both and liked them they were among nasas best and one had flown with roger in a shuttle mission eight years before but there were fifteen others on the short list of eligibles kayman did not even know all the names only that there were a lot of them vern scanyon and the director general of nasa had flown to reason with the president in person urging him to confirm their choices but dash for dashs own reasons had reserved the right of final decision to himself and was withholding his hand the one thing that seemed fully ready for the venture was the link in the chain that had once seemed most doubtful roger himself the training had gone beautifully roger was fully mobile now all over the project building commuting from the room he still kept as home to the marsnormal tank to the test facilities to any place he cared to go the whole project was used to seeing the tall blackwinged creature loping down a hall the huge faceted eyes recognizing a face and the flat voice calling a cheery greeting the last week and more had been all kathleen doughtys his sensorium appeared under perfect control now it was time to learn to exploit all the resources of his musculature so she had brought in a blind man a ballet dancer and a former paraplegic and as roger began to expand his horizons they took over his tutorial tasks the ballet dancer was past stardom now but he had known it and as a child he had studied with nureyev and dolin the blind man was no longer blind he had no eyes but his optic system had been replaced with sensors very like rogers own and the two of them compared notes over subtle hues and tricks of manipulating the parameters of their vision the paraplegic who now moved on motorized limbs that were precursors of rogers had had a year to learn to use them and he and roger took ballet classes together not always physically together not quite the exparaplegic whose name was alfred was still far more human than roger torraway and among other human traits he possessed was a need for air as kayman and brad came into the control chamber for the marsnormal tank alfred was doing entrechats on one side of the great double glass pane and roger inside the almost airless tank was duplicating his moves on the other kathleen doughty was counting cadence and the loudspeaker system was playing the amajor waltz from les sylphides vern scanyon was sitting over by a wall on a reversed chair hands clasped over the back of the chair and chin resting on his hands brad went over to him at once and the two of them began to talk inaudibly don kayman found a place to sit near the door paraplegic and monster they were doing incredibly rapid leaps twiddling their feet in blurs of motion it was not the right music for entrechats kayman thought but neither of them seemed to care the ballet dancer was staring at them with an unreadable expression he probably wishes he were a cyborg kayman thought with muscles like that he could take over any stage in the country it was a mildly amusing thought but for some reason kayman felt illatease then he remembered this was just where he had been sitting when willy hartnett had died before his eyes it seemed so long ago it had only been a week since brenda hartnett had brought the kids around to say goodbye to him and sister clotilda but she had almost dropped out of their minds already the monster named roger was the star of the show now the death of another monster in that place so short a time ago was only history kayman took up his rosary and began to count the fifteen decades of the blessed virgin while one part of him was repeating the ayes another was conscious of the pleasant warm heavy feel of the ivory beads and the crisp contrast of the crystal he had made up his mind to take the holy fathers gift to mars with him it would be a pity if it were lost well it would be a pity if he were lost too he thought he could not weigh risks like that so he decided to do what his holiness had evidently meant him to do and take this gift on the longest journey it had ever known he became conscious of someone standing behind him good morning father kayman hello sulie he glanced at her curiously what was strange about her there seemed to be golden roots to her dark hair but that was nothing particularly surprising even a priest knew that women chose their hair color at will for that matter so did some priests hows it going she asked id say perfect look at them jump roger looks as ready as hell ever be and deo volente i think well make the launch date i envy you the nurse said peering past him into the marsnormal tank he turned his face to her startled there had been more feeling in her voice than a casual remark seemed to justify i mean it don she said the reason i got into the space program in the first place was that i wanted to go up myself might have made it if she stopped and shrugged well im helping you and roger i guess she said isnt that what they used to say women were for helpmates it isnt a bad thing anyway when its as important a thing to help as this you dont really sound convinced of that kayman offered she grinned and then turned back to the tank the music had stopped kathleen doughty took the cigarette out of her lips lit another and said okay roger alfred take ten youre doing great inside the tank roger allowed himself to sit crosslegged he looked exactly like the devil squatting on a hilltop in the classical old disney tape kayman thought a night on bald mountain whats the matter roger kathleen doughty called youre surely not tired tired of this anyway he groused i dont know why i need all this balletdancing willy didnt have it willy died she snapped there was a silence roger turned his head toward her peering through the glass with his great compound eyes he snarled not because of lack of entrechats how do you know that oh she admitted grudgingly i suppose you could survive without some of this but youre better with it its not just a matter of learning how to get around the other thing you have to learn to do is avoid destroying your environment do you have any idea how strong you are now inside the tank roger hesitated then shook his head i dont feel strong particularly his flat voice said you can punch through a wall roger ask alfred what do you run the metric mile in alfred the exparaplegic folded his hands over his fat belly and grinned he was fiftyeight years old and had not been much of an athlete even before the myasthenia gravis destroyed his natural limbs a minute fortyseven he said with pride i expect you to do better than that roger called kathleen so you have to learn how to control it roger made a noise that wasnt quite a word then stood up balance the locks he said im coming out the technician touched a switch and the great pumps began to let air into the exit chamber with a sound like ripping linoleum oh moaned sulie carpenter next to don kayman i dont have my contacts in and she fled before roger could come into the room kayman stared after her one puzzle was solved he knew what had looked strange about her but why would sulie wear contacts that changed her brown eyes to green he shrugged and gave up we knew the answer we had gone to a lot of trouble to find sulie carpenter the critical factors made a long list and the least important of the items on that list were the color of hair and the color of eyes since either could be so easily changed as the deadline approached rogers position began to change for two weeks he had been meat on a butchers block slashed and rolled and chopped with no personal participation and no control over what happened to him then he had been a student following the orders of his teachers learning the control of his senses and the use of his limbs it was a transition from laboratory preparation to demigod and he was more than halfway there he felt it happening for days now he had been questioning everything he was told to do and sometimes refusing kathleen doughty was no longer his boss capable of ordering him to do a hundred chinups and an hour of pirouettes she was his employee retained by him to help in what he wanted to do brad who had become far less offhandedly humorous and far more intense was now asking roger for favors try these color discrimination tests for me will you itll look good on my paper about you often roger humored them but sometimes not the one he humored most frequently and surely was sulie carpenter because she was always there and always cared about him he had almost forgotten how much she looked like dorrie he only was aware that she looked very good she met his moods if he was edgy she was quietly cheerful if he wanted to talk she talked they played board games sometimes she was a highly competitive scrabble player once late at night when roger was experimenting with the length of wakefulness he could handle she brought in a guitar and they sang her pleasant unobtrusive contralto ornamenting his flat and almost toneless whisper her face changed while he looked at it but he had learned to handle that the interpretation circuits in his sensorium reflected his feelings when he let them and there were times when sulie carpenter looked more like dorrie than dorrie did herself after he had finished his days run in the marsnormal tank sulie raced him back to his room laughing girl against thudding monster down the wide lab corridors he won easily of course they chatted for a while and then he sent her away nine days to liftoff it was less than that really he would be flown to merritt island three days before the launch and his last day in tonka would be devoted to fitting the backpack computer and retuning some of his sensorium for the special martian conditions so he had six no five days and he had not seen dorrie for weeks he looked at himself in the mirror he had demanded they install insect eyes bat wings dully gleaming flesh he amused himself by letting his visual interpretations flow from bat to giant fly to demon to himself as he remembered himself pleasantfaced and youthful if only dorrie had a computer to mediate her sight if only she could see him as he had been he swore he would not call her he could not force her to look at the comicstrip contraption that was her husband having sworn he picked up the phone and dialed her number it was an impulse that could not be denied he waited his accordionpleated time sense prolonged the interval so that it was an eternity before the raster blaze from the screen and the buzz from the speaker sounded the first ring then time betrayed him again it seemed forever until the second ring then it came and lasted an eternity and was over she did not answer roger who was the sort of person who counted things knew that most persons did not respond until the third ring dorrie however was always eager to know who the phone was bringing into her life from a sound sleep or out of the bathtub she seldom let it ring past twice at length the third ring came and still no reply roger began to hurt he controlled it as best he could unwilling to sound the alarms on the telemetry he could not stop it entirely she was out he thought her husband had turned into a monster and she was not at home sympathizing or worrying she was shopping or visiting a friend or seeing a flick or with a man what man brad he thought it wouldnt be impossible he had left brad down at the tank twentyfive minutes ago by the clock time enough for them to rendezvous somewhere even time enough for brad to get to the torraway home perhaps she was not out at all perhaps fourth ring perhaps they were there the two of them naked and coupling on the floor in front of the phone she would be saying go in the other room honey i want to see who it is and he would say laughing no lets answer this way and she would say fifth ring and the raster blossomed into the colors of dorries face her voice said hello quick as sound rogers fist shot out and covered the lens dorrie he said his voice sounded flat and harsh again to him how are you roger she cried the pleasure in her voice sounded very real oh honey im so glad to hear you how are you feeling his voice automatically said fine it went on without the need of help from his conscious mind to correct the statement to say what had been happening to him cataloging the tests and the exercises at the same time he was staring into the screen with every sense on high gain she looked what tired looking tired was confirmation of his fears she was carousing with brad every night heedless of her husband in pain and clownish humiliation rested and cheerful looking rested and cheerful was confirmation too it meant she was relaxing enjoying herself heedless of her husbands torment there was really nothing wrong with torraways brain in that it had a lifelong habit of analysis and logic it did not fail to occur to him that the game he was playing with himself was called you lose everything was evidence of dorries guilt yet no matter how carefully he scanned her image with what multiplied senses she didnt look hostile or cloyingly overaffectionate she only looked like dorrie when he thought that he felt a burst of tenderness that made his voice break ive missed you honey he said flatly the only thing that spoke of feelings was that one syllable was retarded a fraction of a second hon ee and ive missed you ive kept myself busy dear she chattered ive been painting your den its a surprise but of course its going to be such a long time till you see it that well its going to be peach with buttercup woodwork and i think maybe a paleblue ceiling you like i was going to make it all ochre and brown you know fall colors mars colors to celebrate but thought by the time you got back youd be pretty sick of mars colors and quickly without pause when am i going to see you the change in her voice caught him by surprise well i look pretty awful he said i know what you look like dear god roger do you think midge and brenda and callie and i havent talked this over for the last two years ever since the program started weve seen the sketches weve seen the photos of the mockups and weve seen the pictures of willy im not exactly like willy any more theyve changed things and i know about that too roger brad told me all about it id like to see you at that moment his wifes face changed without warning to a witchs the crochet hook she held became a peasant twig broom youve been seeing brad was there a microsecond pause before she answered i suppose he shouldnt have told me she said because of security and all but i wanted him to its not that bad honey im a big girl i can handle it for a moment roger wanted to snatch his hand away from the lens and let himself be seen but he was becoming confused feeling strange he could not interpret his feelings was it vertigo emotion some malfunction in his machine half he knew it would be only moments until sulie or don kayman or someone came in warned by the telltale telemetry outside he tried to control himself maybe later he said without conviction i i think id better hang up now dorrie behind her their familiar living room was changing too the depth of field of the phone lens was not very good even to his machine senses the rest of the room was blurred was that a man standing in the shadows was it wearing a marine officers shirt would brad be doing that i have to hang up now he said and did clara bly came in full of questions and concern he shook his head at her without speaking there were no lachrymeal ducts in his new eyes so of course he could not cry even that relief was denied him eleven dorothy louise mintz torraway as penelope our trendline projections had shown that the time was right to let the world know about roger torraway warts and all so it had all gone out and every tv screen in the world had seen roger on point in a dozen perfect fouettйs in between the closeups of the starved dead in pakistan and the fires in chicago it had the effect of making dorrie a celebrity rogers call had upset her not as much as the note from brad saying that he wouldnt be able to see her again not nearly as much as the fortyfive minutes the president had spent with her impressing on her what would happen if she messed up his pet astronaut certainly not as much as the knowledge that she was being followed her telephone tapped her home certainly bugged but she hadnt known how to deal with roger she suspected she never would and did not mind at all that in a few days he would be launched into space where there would be little necessity for her to worry about their relationship for at least a year and a half she also did not mind the sudden glare of publicity now that the newspapers had it all the tv reporters had been to see her and she had seen her own courageous face on the six oclock report fem was sending someone around the someone phoned first she was a woman of about sixty veteran of the lib years who sniffed we never do this interviewing somebody just because shes somebodys wife but they wanted it i couldnt turn down the assignment but i want to be honest with you and let you know that its distasteful to me im sorry dorrie apologized do you want me to cancel out oh no said the woman speaking as though it were dorries fault its not your fault but i think its a betrayal of everything fem stands for never mind i want to come up to your home well do a fifteenminute spread for the cassette edition and ill write it up for the print if you can i dorrie began try to talk about you rather than him your background your interests your im sorry but id really prefer feelings about the space program and so on dash says its an essential american objective and the future of the world depends on it what do you think i dont mean answer the question now i mean i dont want to have it in my home dorrie inserted into the conversation without waiting for a place for it think about it and answer on camera not at your home no thats not possible well be over in an hour dorrie was left with a dwindling spot of light to talk to and then even that was gone bitch she said almost absentmindedly she didnt really mind having the interview in her home she minded not being given a choice that she minded a lot but there was no choice available to her except to go out before the fem person showed up dome torraway dee mintz as was felt strongly about having choices one of the things that had attracted her to roger in the first place apart from the glamour of the space program and the security and money that went with it and apart from rogers rather nicelooking studly self was that he was willing to listen to what she wanted other men had been mostly interested in what they wanted which was not the same from man to man but very consistent within the range of relationships of any one man harold always wanted to dance and party jim always wanted sex everett wanted sex and parties tommy wanted political dedication joe wanted mothering what roger wanted was to explore the world with her along and he seemed perfectly willing to explore the parts of it that she wanted as much as the parts that were important to him she had never regretted marrying him there were a lot of lonely times fiftyfour days when he was in space station three any number of shorter missions two years on tour duty all over the world working with the whole system of ground monitoring stations from aachen to zaire with no proper home anywhere dorrie had given that up after a while and gone back to the apartment in tonka but she hadnt minded perhaps roger had the question had never crossed her mind anyway they had seen each other quite often enough he had been home every month or two and she kept her time full there was her shop she had opened it while roger was in iceland with a fivethousanddollar check he sent her for her birthday there were her friends there were from time to time men none of these filled her life but she didnt expect it to be filled she rather expected to be lonely she had been an only child with a mother who could not stand her neighbors and so she had not had very many friends the neighbors couldnt stand her mother very well either because her mother was a speed freak on a small scale likely to be burned right out of her mind most afternoons which made things complicated for dorrie but she didnt mind that she didnt know there was any other way to live at thirtyone dorrie was as healthy as pretty and as competent to deal with the world as she ever had been or would be again she described herself as happy this diagnosis did not come from any welling up of joy inside herself it came from the observed fact looking at herself objectively that whenever she decided she wanted something she always got it and what other definition of happiness could there be she used the time until ms hagar hengstrom and her crew from fem arrived to assemble a selection of ceramic ware from her shop on the coffee table before the couch she intended to sit in what time was left she devoted to the less important task of brushing her hair checking her makeup and changing into her newest lacedpants suit when the doorbell rang she was quite ready ms hagar hengstrom pumped her hand and walked in brilliant blue hair and a curly black cigar she was followed by her lightperson her soundperson her cameraperson and her prop boys rooms small she muttered appraising the furnishings with contempt torraway will sit over there move it the prop boys jumped to manhandle an easy chair from its place by the window to the corner now occupied by a breakfront which they tugged into the center of the room wait a minute said dorrie i thought id just sit on the couch here dont you have the light reading yet hengstrom demanded sally start the camera you never know what we might use for rollunder i mean it dorrie said hengstrom looked at her the voice had not been loud but the tone was dangerous she shrugged lets set it up she proposed and if you dont like it well talk it over run through for me will you run through what the pale young girl with the handheld camera was pointing it at her dorrie noticed it distracted her the lightperson had found a wall socket and was holding a crucifix of floods in each hand moving them gently to erase shadows as fast as they formed each time dorrie moved well for openers what are your plans for the next two years youre surely not just going to hang around waiting for roger torraway to come home dorrie tried to make her way to the couch but the lightperson frowned and waved her in the other direction and two of the prop boys shoved the coffee table out of reach she said ive got my shop i thought you might like to have some of the pieces from it on camera while you interviewed me thats fine sure i meant personally youre a healthy woman you have sexual needs back up a little please sandras getting a buzz from something on the sound system dorrie found herself standing in front of the chair and there seemed nothing to do but to sit in it of course she began you have a responsibility hengstrom said what sort of an example are you going to set young womanhood turning yourself into a driedup old maid or living a naturally full life i dont know if i want to discuss ive checked you out pretty carefully torraway i like what ive found out youre your own person as much as any person can be anyway who accepts the ridiculous farce of marriage whyd you do it dorrie hesitated rogers really a very nice person she offered what about it well i mean he offered me a great deal of comfort and support hagar hengstrom sighed same old slave psychology never mind the other thing that puzzles me is your getting involved in the space program dont you feel its a sexist shuffle why no the president told me himself dorrie said aware that she was trying to score points in case of another visit from dash that putting a man on mars was absolutely indispensable to the future of the human race i believe him we owe a play that back hengstrom commanded what play back what you just said putting a what on mars a man oh i see what you mean hengstrom nodded sadly you see what i mean but you dont change the way you think why a man why not a person she looked commiseratingly at the soundperson who shook her head in sympathy well lets get to something more important do you know that the whole crew of the mars voyage is supposed to be male what do you think of that it was quite a morning for dorrie she never did get her ceramic pieces on camera when sulie carpenter came on duty that afternoon she brought roger two surprises a cassette of the interview borrowed from the project publicrelations office and a guitar she gave him the cassette first and let him watch the interview while she remade his bed and changed the water for his flowers when it was over she said brightly your wife handled herself very well i thought i met hagar hengstrom once shes a very difficult woman dorrie looked fine said roger you could not read any expression in the remade face or hear it in the flat tones but the bat wings were fluttering restlessly i always liked those pants sulie nodded and made a note to herself the open lacing up both sides of each leg showed a great deal of flesh evidently the steroids implanted in roger were doing their job now ive got something else she said and opened the guitar case youre going to play for me no roger youre going to play i cant play the guitar sulie he protested she laughed ive been talking to brad she said and i think youre going to be surprised youre not just different you know roger youre better for instance your fingers what about them well ive been playing the guitar since i was nine and if i stop for a couple of weeks my calluses go and i have to start all over again your fingers dont need calluses theyre hard enough and firm enough to fret the strings first time perfectly fine said roger only i dont even know what youre talking about whats fret press them down like this she strummed a g chord then a d and a c now you do it she said the only thing to watch out for dont use too much strength its breakable she handed him the guitar he swept his thumb over the open strings as he had seen her do thats fine she applauded now make a g ring finger on the third fret of the high e string there first finger on the second fret of the a middle finger on the third fret of the low e she guided his hands now hit it he strummed and looked up at her hey he said nice she grinned and corrected him not nice perfect now this is a c first finger on the second fret of the b string middle finger there ring finger there right and this is a d chord first and middle finger on the g and e strings there ring finger one fret lower on the b perfect again now give me a g to his surprise roger strummed a perfect g she smiled see brad was right once you know a chord you know it the remembers it for you all you have to do is think g chord and your fingers do it you are now she said in mock sorrow about three months ahead of where i was the first time i tried to play the guitar thats pretty nice roger said trying all three chords one after another thats only the beginning now strum a fourbeat you know dum dum dum dum with a g chord she listened then nodded fine now do it like this g g g g g g g g c c g g g g g g fine now again only this time after the c c do d d d d d d fine again now do them both one after the other he played and she sang with him kumbaya my lord kumbaya kumbaya my lord kumbaya hey roger cried delighted she shook her head in mock dismay three minutes from the time you pick up the guitar and youre already an accompanist here i brought you a chord book and some simple pieces by the time i get back you should be playing all of them and ill start you on fingerplucking sliding and hammering she showed him how to read the tabulature for each chord and left him happily puzzling out the first six modulations of the f outside his room she paused to take out her contacts rubbed her eyes and marched to the office of the director scanyons secretary waved her in hes happy with his guitar general she reported less happy about his wife vern scanyon nodded and turned up a knob on the comm set on his desk the sound of the chords for kentucky babe came from the tap in rogers room he turned it down again i know about the guitar major carpenter what about his wife im afraid he loves her she said slowly hes all right up to a point past that point i think were in trouble i can bolster him up as long as hes here at the project but hell be a long time away and im not sure scanyon said sharply get the marbles out of your mouth major i think hell miss her more than he can handle its bad enough now i watched him while he was looking at that tape he didnt move a muscle rigid concentration didnt want to miss a thing when hes forty million miles away from her well ive got everything taped general ill run a computer simulation and then maybe i can be more specific but im concerned youre concerned scanyon snapped dash will have my ass if we get him up there and he blows what can i tell you general let me run the simulation then maybe i can tell you how to handle it she sat down without waiting to be asked and ran her hands over her forehead leading a double life takes a lot out of you general she offered eight hours as a nurse and eight hours as a shrink isnt any fun ten years on staff duty in antarctica is even less fun than that vern scanyon said simply the presidential jet had reached its cruising altitude of meters and slid into high gear mach and a bit grotesquely faster than even a presidential cb was supposed to go the president was in a hurry the midway summit conference had just ended in disarray stretched out on his chaise longue with his eyes closed pretending to be asleep to keep the senators who had accompanied him out of his hair dash bleakly considered his options they were few he had not hoped for a great deal from the conference but it had begun well enough the australians indicated they would accept limited cooperation with the npa in developing the outback subject to appropriate guarantees et cetera et cetera the npa delegation murmured among themselves and announced that they would be happy to provide guarantees since their real objectives were only to provide a maximum of the necessities of life for all the worlds people considered as a single unit regardless of antiquated national boundaries et cetera dash himself shook off his whispering advisers and stated that americas interest in this conference was only to provide goodoffices assistance to its two dearly beloved neighbors and sought nothing for itself et cetera and for a time there all of two hours it had seemed that there might be a substantive useful product of the conference then they began getting into the fine detail the asians offered a millionman soil army plus a stream of tankers carrying three million gallons a week of concentrated sludge from the sewers of shanghai the australians accepted the fertilizer but spoke of a maximum of asians to till the land also they pointed out politely that as it was australian land and australian sunshine that was being used it would be australian wheat that would be grown the man from the state department reminded dash of american commitments to peru and with a heavy heart dash rose to insist on at least a percent allocation to good neighbors on the south american continent and tempers began to rise the precipitating incident was an npa shuttle plane that ran into a flock of blackfooted albatrosses as it took off from the sand island runway crashed and burned on an islet in the lagoon in full view of the conference members on the rooftop of the holiday inn then there were harsh words the japanese member of the npa delegation allowed himself to say what he had previously only thought that americas insistence on holding the conference at the site of one of the most famous battles of world war ii was a calculated insult to asians the australians commented that they had controlled their own gooneybird populations without much trouble and were astonished that the americans had not succeeded in doing the same and the maximum gain of three weeks of preparation and two days of hope was a tightly worded announcement that all three powers had agreed to further discussions sometime somewhere not very soon but what it all meant dash admitted to himself as he tossed restlessly on the chaise longue was that the confrontation was eyeball to eyeball somebody would have to give and nobody would he got up and called for coffee when it came there was a scribbled note on airborne white house stationery from one of the senators mr president we must settle the disasterarea proclamation before we land dash crumpled it up that was senator talitree full of complaints lake altus had shrunk to percent of its normal size tourism in the arbuckle mountains was dead because there was no water coming over turner falls the sooner state fair had had to be canceled because of blowing dust oklahoma should be declared a disaster area he had fiftyfour states dash reflected and if he listened to all the senators and governors he would be declaring fiftyfour disaster areas there really was only one disaster area it merely happened to be worldwide and i ran for this job he marveled thinking of oklahoma made him think of roger torraway for a moment he considered calling the pilot and diverting the flight to tonka but the meeting with the combined chiefs of staff would not wait he would have to content himself with the telephone it was not really himself who was playing the guitar roger knew it was the that remembered all the subroutines involved and commanded his fingers to do whatever his brain decreed it had taken him less than an hour to learn every chord in the book and to use them in effortless succession a few minutes more to record in the downstairs data banks the meaning of time signals on a musical staff then his inner clocks took over the tempi and he never had to think about the beat again for melody he learned which fret on which string corresponded to each note on the staff once imprinted on the magnetic cores the correspondence between printed music and plucked string was established forever sulie took ten minutes to show him which notes to sharp and which to flat when called for and from then on the galaxy of sharps and flats sprinkled over the bars at the key signature held no further terrors for him fingerplucking for human nervous systems it is a matter of two minutes to learn the principle and a hundred hours of practice before it becomes automatic thumb on the d string ring finger on the high e middle finger on the b thumb on the a ring on the e middle on the b and so on the two minutes of learning sufficed for roger from then on the subroutines commanded the fingers and the only limit to his tempo was the speed at which the strings themselves could produce a tone without breaking he was playing a segovia recital from memory from a single hearing of the tape when the presidents phone call came in there was a time when roger would have been awed and delighted by a call from the president of the united states now it was an annoyance it meant taking time away from his guitar he hardly listened to what the president had to say he was struck by the care on dashs face the deep lines that had not been there a few days before the sunken eyes then he realized that his interpretation circuits were exaggerating what they saw to call his attention to the changes he overrode the mediation circuits and saw dash plain but he was still careworn his voice was all warmth and good fellowship as he asked roger how things were going was there anything roger needed could he think of an ass to kick to get things goin right everythings fine mr president roger said amusing himself by letting his trick eyes deck the presidents face out in santa claus beard and red tasseled cap with a bundle of intangible gifts over his shoulder sure now roger dash pressed youre not forgetting what i told you whatever you want you just yell ill yell roger promised but im doing fine waiting for the launch and waiting for you to get off the phone he thought bored with the conversation the president frowned rogers interpreters immediately changed the image dash was still santa claus but ebony black and with enormous fangs youre not overconfident are you he asked well how would i know if i was roger asked reasonably i dont think so ask the staff here they can tell you more about me than i can he managed to terminate the conversation a few exchanges later knowing that the president was unsatisfied and vaguely troubled but not caring much there was less and less that roger really cared about he thought to himself and he had been truthful he really was looking forward to the launch he would miss sulie and clara he was in the back of his mind faintly worried about the danger and the duration of the trip but he was also buoyed up with anticipation of what he would find when he got there the planet he was made to inhabit he picked up the guitar and started again on the segovia but it did not go as well as he would like after a time he realized that the gift of absolute pitch was also a handicap segovias guitar had not been tuned to a perfect a it was a few hertz flat and his d string was almost a quartertone relatively flatter still he shrugged the bat wings flailed with the gesture and put the guitar down for a moment he sat upright on his guitar chair straightbacked and armless inviting his thoughts something was troubling him the name of the something was dorrie playing the guitar was pleasant and relaxing but behind the pleasure was a daydream a fantasy of sitting on the deck of a sailboat with dorrie and brad and casually borrowing brads guitar and astonishing them all in some arcane way all the processes of his life terminated in dorrie the purpose of playing the guitar was to please dorrie the horror of his appearance was that it would offend dorrie the tragedy of castration was that he would fail dorrie most of the pain had lifted from these things and he could look at them in a way that had been impossible a few weeks before but they were still there buried inside him he reached for the phone and then drew back his hand calling dorrie was not satisfactory he had tried that what he really wanted was to see her that of course was impossible he was not allowed to leave the project vern scanyon would be furious the guards would stop him at the door the telemetry would reveal at once what he was doing the closedcircuit electronic surveillance would locate him at every step all the resources of the project would be mobilized to prevent his leaving and there would be no point in asking permission not even in asking dash the most that would happen would be that the president would give an order and dorrie would be delivered coerced and furious in his room roger did not want dorrie to be forced to come to him and he was sure he would not be allowed to go to her on the other hand on the other hand he reflected why did he need permission he thought for a minute sitting perfectly still in his straightbacked chair then he put the guitar carefully away in its case and moved the first thing he did was bend down to the wall pull a baseboard plug out of its moorings and stick his finger into it the copper nail on his finger was as good as a penny any day the fuses blew the lights in the room went out the whickawhicka and gentle whisper of the reels of the recording machines slowed and stopped the room went dark there was still heat and that was light enough for rogers eyes he could see quite well enough to pull the telemetry leads out of his body he was out of the door before clara bly pouring cream into a cup on her coffee break looked around at the buzzing readout board he had done better than he planned with the fuses the hall lights were out as well there were people in the corridor but in the dark they could not see roger was past them and taking the fire stairs four at a time before they knew he was gone he settled into the workings of his body with ease and grace all of kathleen doughtys ballet training was paying off he danced down the stairs pliйed through a door leaped along a corridor and was out into the cold night air before the security man at the door looked around from his tv set he was in the open racing down the freeway toward the city of tonka at forty miles an hour the night was bright with kinds of light he had never seen before overhead there was a solid layer of clouds stratocumulus scudding along from the north and thick middlelevel clouds above them even so he could see dim glows where the brightest stars filtered some of their radiation through the oklahoma prairie on either side was somberly glowing with the tiny residual heat retained from the day punctuated with splotches of brilliance where there was a home or a farm building the cars on the freeway were tailed by great plumes of light bright where they left the exhaust pipe reddening and darkening as the clouds of hot gas expanded into the chilling air as he entered the city itself he saw and avoided an occasional pedestrian each a luminous halloween figure dully glowing in his own body heat the buildings around him had trapped a little heat from the end of the day and were spilling more from their own central heating they glowed like fireflies he stopped at the corner of his own home street there was a car with two men inside it parked across from the door warning signals flashed in his brain and the car became a tank howitzer pointed at his head they were no problem he changed course and ran through the backyards scaling fences and slipping through gates and at his own home he extruded the copper nails in his fingers for purchase and climbed right up the outside wall it was what he wanted to do not just to avoid the men in the car outside but to act out a fantasy the moment when he would burst in on dorrie through the window to catch her at what in the event itself what he caught her at was watching a late movie on television her hair was sticky with coloring compound and she was propped up in bed eating a solitary dish of ice cream as he slid the unlocked window open and crawled through she turned toward him she screamed it was not just a cry it was instant hysterics dorrie spilled her ice cream and leaped out of bed the tv set toppled and crunched to the floor sobbing dorrie pressed herself against the far wall eyes squeezed tight and fists pressed against them im sorry roger said inadequately he wanted to approach her but reason prevented she looked very helpless and appealing in her seethrough butcherboy smock and tiny bikiniribbon panties sorry she gasped looked at him averted her eyes and fumbled her way into the bathroom slamming the door behind her well thought roger she was not to be blamed he had a clear notion of what a grotesque sight he had been coming through a window without warning you did say you knew what i looked like he called there was no answer from the bathroom only a moment later the running of water he glanced around the room it looked exactly as it had always looked the closets were as full of her clothes and his as they had always been the spaces behind the couches were as empty of lovers as ever he was not proud of himself for searching the apartment like any medieval cuckold but he did not stop until he was certain she had been alone the phone rang rogers instant reflexes had him grabbing the earpiece out of its cradle almost before the first brrr sounded so quickly and brutally that it was deformed into scrap in his hand the vision screen flickered and then went dark again its circuitry linked with the sound hello roger said but there was no answer he had made sure that nobody would ever speak on that instrument again christ he said he had had no clear idea of how this meeting would go but it was apparent that it had begun badly when dorrie came out of the bathroom she wasnt crying but she wasnt speaking either she went into the kitchen without looking at him i want a cup of tea she said over her shoulder wouldnt you rather i made you a drink roger offered hopefully roger could hear the sounds of the electric kettle being filled the faint susurrus as it began to simmer and several times a cough he listened harder and heard his wifes breathing which became slower and steadier he sat down in the chair that had always been his chair and waited his wings were in the way even though they elevated themselves automatically over his head he could not lean back restlessly he roamed into the living room his wifes voice called through the swinging doors do you want some tea no then he added no thank you actually he would have liked it very much not because of any need for fluids or nutrients but for the feeling of participating in some normal precedented event with dorrie but he did not want to spill and slobber in front of her and he had not practiced much with cups and saucers and liquids where are you she hesitated at the swinging doors the cup in her hands and then saw him oh why dont you turn a light on i dont want to honey sit down and close your eyes for a minute he had an idea why but she did as he requested seating herself in the wing chair on one side of the fake fireplace he picked up the chair with her in it and turned it away so that she was facing into the wall he looked around for something to sit in himself there was nothing or nothing that comported with his new geometry floor pillows and couches all awkward for his body or his wings but on the other hand he knew he had no particular need to sit his artificial musculature did not need that sort of relaxation very much so he stood behind her and said id feel better if you werent looking at me i understand that roger you frightened me is all i wish you hadnt burst in the window like that on the other hand i shouldnt have been so positive i could see you i mean like that without without going into hysterics i guess is what i want to say i know what i look like he said its still you though isnt it dorrie said to the wall although i dont remember you ever climbing the outside of a building to get into my bed before its easy he said taking a chance on what was almost an attempt at lightness well she paused for a sip of tea tell me whats this about i wanted to see you dorrie you did see me on the phone i didnt want it to be on the phone i wanted to be in the same room with you he wanted even more than that to touch her to reach out to the nape of her neck and press and caress the tendons into relaxing but he did not quite dare that instead he reached down and ignited the gas flame in the fireplace not so much for warmth as for a little light to help dorrie and for cheerfulness we arent supposed to do that roger theres a thousanddollar fine he laughed not for you and me dorrie anybody gives you any trouble you call up dash and say i said it was all right his wife took a cigarette from the box on the end table and lit it roger dear she said slowly im not used to all this i dont just mean the way you look i understand about that its hard but at least i knew what it was going to be before it happened even if i didnt think it would be you but im not used to your being so i dont know important im not used to it either dorrie he thought back to the tv reporters and the cheering crowds when he returned to earth after rescuing the russians its different now i feel as if im carrying something on my back the world maybe dash says thats exactly what youre doing half of what he says is crap but i dont think that part is youre a pretty significant man roger you were always a famous one maybe thats why i married you but that was like being a rock star you know it was exciting but you could always walk away from it if you got tired of it this i dont think you can walk away from she stubbed out her cigarette anyway she said youre here and theyre probably going crazy at the project i can handle that yes she said thoughtfully i guess you can what shall we talk about brad he said he had not intended it the word came out of his artificial larynx shaped by his restructured lips with no intervention by his conscious mind he could feel her stiffening up what about brad she asked your sleeping with him thats what about brad he said the back of her neck was glowing dully now and he knew that if he could see her face it would display the revealing tracery of veins the dancing gas flames from the fireplace made an attractive spectrum of colors on her dark hair he watched the play appreciatively as though it did not matter what he was saying to his wife or she to him she said roger i really dont know how to deal with you are you angry with me he watched the dancing colors silently after all roger we talked this out years ago you have had affairs and so have i we agreed they didnt mean anything they mean something when they hurt he willed his vision to stop and welcomed the darkness as an aid to thought the others were different he said different how she was angry now different because we talked them over he said doggedly when i was in algiers and you couldnt stand the climate that was one thing what you did back here in tonka and what i did in algiers didnt affect you and me when i was in orbit i never slept with anybody else while you were in orbit i know that dorrie i thought that was kind of you i really did because it wouldnt have been fair would it i mean my own opportunities were pretty limited old yuli bronin wasnt my type but now its different its like i was in orbit again only worse i dont even have yuli i not only dont have a girl friend i dont have the equipment to do anything about it if i did she said wretchedly i know all that what can i tell you you can tell me youll be a good wife to me he roared that frightened her he had forgotten what his voice could sound like she began to cry he reached out to touch her and then let his hand fall what was the use oh christ he thought what a mess he took consolation only in that this interview had been here in the privacy of their own home quite unplanned and secret it would have been unbearable in the presence of anyone else but naturally we had monitored every word twelve two simulations and a reality copperfingered roger had blown more than a fuse he had shorted a whole box of circuit breakers it took twenty minutes to get the lights on again fortunately the had standby power for its memory so the cores were not wiped the computations that were in process were compromised all of them would have to be done over again the automatic surveillance was out of service until long after roger was gone one of the first ones to know what had happened was sulie carpenter catching a cat nap in the office next to the computer room waiting for rogers simulation to finish it didnt finish the alarm bells signifying interruption of the information being processed woke her the bright fluorescent rodlights were out and only the red incandescents gave a dim despairing glow her first thought was her precious simulation she spent twenty minutes with the programmers studying the partial printout hoping that it would be all right before she gave up and charged out to vern scanyons office that was when she found out that roger had run off power was back by then it had come on while she was taking the fire stairs two at a time scanyon was already on the phone ordering the people he wanted to blame in for an emergency conference clara bly was the one who told sulie about roger one by one as the others entered the room they were brought up to date don kayman was the only major figure who was out of the project they located him watching television in his clerical condominium kathleen doughty came up from the physiotherapy room in the basement dragging brad with her all pinkskinned and damp he had been trying to substitute an hour in the sauna for a nights sleep freeling was at merritt island but not needed particularly half a dozen others came in and slumped dispiritedly or worriedly into the leather chairs around the conference table scanyon had already ordered an air force spottercopter into the air in a search pattern all around the project its tv cameras were sweeping the freeway the access roads the parking lots the fields and prairie and displaying what they saw on the wall tv at the end of the room the tonka police force had been alerted to watch for a strange devillike creature running around at seventy kilometers an hour which had led to trouble for the tonka desk sergeant he made a bad mistake he asked the project security officer if he had been drinking ten seconds later with his head filled with visions of pounding a beat in kiska the sergeant was on the police radio to all vehicles and foot patrolmen the orders for the police were not to arrest roger not even to approach him they were only to find him what scanyon wanted was someone to blame i hold you responsible dr ramez he barked at the staff shrink you and major carpenter how could you let torraway get into this sort of action without advance warning ramez said placatingly general i told you roger was unstable with regard to his wife thats why i asked for someone like sulie he needed another object to fixate on someone directly connected with the project didnt work very well did it sulie stopped listening she knew very well that her turn was next but she was trying to think over scanyons desk she saw the moving view from the copter it was expressed as a schematic the roads as lines of green the vehicles as points of blue buildings yellow the few pedestrians were bright red now if one of those red dots should suddenly start to move at the speed of a blue vehicle that would be roger but he had had plenty of time to get farther away than the area the copter was covering tell them to scan the town general she said suddenly he frowned but he picked up the phone and gave the order he didnt get a chance to put it down again there was an incoming call he could not refuse telly ramez got up from his chair next to the director and came around to sulie carpenter she didnt look up from the folded transcript of the simulation he waited patiently the directors call was from the president of the united states they would have known that from the sweat that rolled down beneath scanyons temples even if they had not seen dashs tiny face in the screen on the directors desk faintly the voice leaked through to them spoke to roger he seemed i dont know disinterested i thought it over vern and then i decided to call you is everything going all right scanyon swallowed he glanced around the table and abruptly folded up the privacy petals on the phone the image dwindled to postagestamp size the voice faded to nothingness as the sound was transferred to a parabolic speaker aimed directly at scanyons head and scanyons own words were swallowed by the petallike shields the rest of the room had no difficulty in following the conversation anyway it was written very clearly on scanyons face sulie looked up from the transcript at telly ramez get him off the phone she said impatiently i know where roger is ramez said at his wifes house she rubbed her eyes wearily i guess we didnt need a simulation for that did we im sorry telly i guess i wasnt keeping him on the hook as firmly as i thought i was they were right of course we had known that for some time as soon as scanyon got off the phone with the president the security office called to say that the bugs in dorries bedroom had picked up the sound of roger coming in through the window scanyons lemony small eyes seemed almost at the point of tears put the sound on the horn he ordered display the house and then he switched his phone to an outside line and dialed dorries number from the loudspeaker came the sound of one ring then a metallic noise and rogers flat cyborg voice rasping hello and a moment later softer but equally toneless christ scanyon jerked the earpiece away and rubbed his ear what the hell happened he demanded there was no answer from anyone to the rhetorical question and gingerly he put the phone back im getting some kind of trouble signal he announced we can send a man in general the assistant security chief suggested there are two of our men in that car out in front of the house there the helicopter pickup had slid across the screen and settled at feet over the courthouse square in the city of tonka the camera was set for infrared and in the upper corner of the screen the broad dark band of the ship canal identified the edge of the town a rectangle of darkness surrounded by the moving lights of cars just below the screens center point was the courthouse square and rogers home was marked with a tracer star in red the assistant reached up and touched the blob of light nearby to show the car were in voice contact with them general he went on they didnt see colonel torraway go in sulie stood up i dont recommend it she said your recommendations arent too popular with me right now major carpenter scanyon snarled all the same general she stopped as scanyon raised his hand from the speaker dorries voice came faintly i want a cup of tea and then rogers wouldnt you rather i rnade you a drink and her almost inaudible no all the same sulie spoke up hes stable enough now dont screw it up i cant let him just sit out there who the hell knows what hell do next you youve got him spotted i dont think hell move anyway not for a while don kaymans not far from there and hes a friend tell him to go get roger kaymans not much of a combat specialist is that what you want if roger doesnt come back peacefully exactly what are you going to do about it do you want some tea no no thank you and turn that off sulie added leave the poor bastard a little privacy scanyon sat slowly back in his chair patting the top of his desk with both hands at once very gently then he picked up the phone and gave orders well do it your way one more time major he said not because i have much confidence i just dont have much choice either i cant threaten you with anything if this goes wrong again i doubt ill be in a position to punish anybody but im pretty sure somebody will telesforo ramez said sir i understand your position but i think this isnt fair to sulie the simulation shows that he has to have a confrontation with his wife the point of a simulation dr ramez is that it should tell you whats going to happen before it happens well it also shows that torraway is basically pretty stable in every other respect hell handle this general scanyon went back to patting his desk ramez said hes a complicated person youve seen his thematic apperception test patterns general hes high in all the fundamental drives achievement affiliation not quite so high in power but still healthy hes not a manipulator hes introspective he needs to work things out in his head those are the qualities you want general hell need all that you cant ask him to be one person here in oklahoma and another person on mars if im not mistaken the general said thats what you promised me with your behavior modification no general the psychiatrist said patiently i only promised that if you gave him a reward like sulie carpenter hed find it easier to reconcile himself to his problems with his wife he has bmod has its own dynamics general sulie put in you called me in pretty late what are you telling me scanyon asked dangerously is he going to crack up on mars i hope not the odds are as good as we know how to make them general hes cleaned up a lot of old shit you can see it in his latest tats but six days from now hell be gone and i wont be in his life any more and thats wrong bmod should never be cut off cold turkey it should be phased out a little less of me being around and then a little less than that until hes had a chance to build up his defenses the gentle patting on the desk was slower now and scanyon said its a little late to tell me that sulie shrugged and did not speak scanyon looked thoughtfully around the table all right weve done all we can here tonight youre all dismissed until eight no make that ten in the morning by then i expect every one of you to have a report no more than three minutes long on where your own area of responsibilities stands and what we should do don kayman got the message from a tonka police patrol car it swooshed up behind him lights flashing and siren screaming and pulled him over to order him to turn around and go back to rogers apartment he knocked on the door with some trepidation unsure of what he would find and when the door opened with rogers gleaming eyes peering out from behind it kayman whispered a quick hail mary as he tried to look past roger into the apartment for what for the dismembered body of dorrie torraway for a shambles of destruction but all he saw was dorrie herself huddled in a wing chair and obviously weeping the sight almost pleased him since he had been prepared for so much worse roger came along with no argument goodbye dorrie he said and did not wait for an answer he had trouble fitting himself into don kaymans little car but his wings folded down by pushing the reclining seat back as far as it would go he was able to manage in a cramped and precarious position that would have been hopelessly uncomfortable for any normal human being roger of course was not a normal human being his muscular system was content with prolonged overloads in almost any configuration it could bend into at all they were silent until they were almost at the project then don kayman cleared his throat you had us worried i thought i would said the flat cyborg voice the wings stirred restlessly writhing against each other like a rubbing of hands i wanted to see her don it was important to me i can understand that kayman turned into the broad empty parking lot well he probed are things all right the cyborg mask turned toward him the great compound eyes gleamed like faceted ebony without expression as roger said youre a jerk father kayman sir how all right can they be sulie carpenter thought wistfully of sleep as she might think of a vacation on the french riviera they were equally out of the question at that moment she took two caps of amphetamines and a bl injection selfadministered into the places in her arm she had learned to locate long ago the simulation of rogers reactions had been compromised by the power failure so she did it over again from punchin to readout we were content that this should be so it gave us a chance to make a few corrections while she was waiting she took a long hot soak in a hydrotherapy tub and when the simulation had run she studied it carefully she had taught herself to read the cryptic capital letters and integers to guard against programming errors but this time she spared the hardware no time and went at once to the plainlanguage readout at the end she was very good at her job that job did not happen to be ward nurse sulie carpenter had been one of the first of the aerospace female doctors she had her degree in medicine had specialized in psychotherapy all the myriad eclectic disciplines of it and had gone into the space program because nothing on earth seemed really worth doing to her after completing astronaut training she had come to wonder if there was anything in space that was worth doing either research had seemed at least abstractly worth while so she had applied for work with the california study teams and got it there had been a fair number of men in her life one or two of them important to it none of them had worked out that much of what she had told roger had been true and after the most recent bruising failure she had contracted her area of interest until she told herself she grew up enough to know what she wanted from a man and there she stayed sidetracked in a loop off the main current of human affairs until we turned up her card out of all the hundreds of thousands of punched cards to fill rogers need when her orders came wholly without warning they were directly from the president himself there was no way she could have refused the assignment actually she had no desire to she welcomed the change motherhenning a hurting human being stroked the feelgood centers of her personality the importance of the job was clear to her because if there was any faith in her it was in the mars project and she was aware of her competence of competence she had a great deal we rated her very high a major piece in the game we were playing for the survival of the race when she had finished with rogers simulation it was nearly four in the morning she slept a couple of hours in a borrowed bed in the nurses quarters then she showered dressed and put her green contact lenses in she was not happy with that particular aspect of her job she reflected on the way to rogers room the dyed hair and the change of eye color were deceptions she did not like to deceive one day she would like to leave out the contacts and let her hair go back to its muddy blond oh maybe helped out a little with a rinse to be sure she did not object to artifice only to pretending to be something she wasnt but when she entered rogers room she was smiling lovely to see you back we missed you how was it running around on your own not bad at all said the flat voice roger was standing by the window staring out at the blobs of tumbleweed lumping and bouncing across the parking lot he turned to her you know its all true what you said what ive got now isnt just different its better she resisted the desire to reinforce what he had said and only smiled as she began to strip his bed i was worried about sex he went on but you know what sulie its like being told i cant have any caviar for the next couple of years i dont like caviar and when you come right down to it i dont want sex right now i suppose you punched that into the computer cut down sex drive increase euphoria anyway it finally penetrated my little brain that i was just making trouble for myself worrying about whether i could get along without something i really didnt want its a reflection of what i think other people think i should want acculturation she supplied no doubt he said listen i want to do something for you he picked up the guitar propped himself against the window frame with one heel against the sill and settled the instrument across his knee his wings quietly rearranged themselves over his head as he began to play sulie was startled he was not merely playing he was singing singing no it was a sound more like a man whistling through his teeth faint but pure his fingers on the guitar strummed and plucked an accompaniment while the keening whistle from his lips flowed through the melody of a tune she had never heard before when he had finished she demanded what was that its a paganini sonata for guitar and violin he said proudly clara gave me the record i didnt know you could do that humming i mean or whatever it was i didnt either until i tried i cant get enough volume for the violin part of course and i cant keep the guitar sound low enough to balance it but it didnt sound bad did it roger she said meaning it im impressed he looked up at her and impressed her again by managing a smile he said i bet you didnt know i could do that either i didnt know it myself till i tried at the meeting sulie said flatly hes ready general scanyon had managed enough sleep to look rested and enough of something else some inner resource or whatever to look less harried youre sure major carpenter she nodded her head hell never be readier she hesitated vern scanyon reading her expression waited for the amendment the problem as i see it is that hes right to go now all his systems are up to operating level hes worked through his thing with his wife hes ready the longer he stays around here the more chance that shell do something to upset his balance i doubt that very much said scanyon frowning well she knows what trouble shell be in but i dont want to take that chance i want him to move you mean take him down to merritt island no i want to put him on hold brad spilled coffee from the cup he had been raising to his lips no way sweetie he cried genuinely shocked i have seventytwo more hours testing on his systems if you slow him down i cant get readings testing for what dr bradley for his operating efficiency or for the sake of the papers youre going to write on him well christ certainly im going to write him up but i want to check him as thoroughly as possible every minute i can for his sake and for the missions she shrugged thats still my recommendation theres nothing for him to do here but wait hes had enough of that what if something goes wrong on mars brad demanded she said you wanted my recommendation thats it scanyon put in please make sure we all know what youre talking about especially me sulie looked toward brad who said weve planned to do that for the voyage general as you know we have the capacity to override his internal clocks by external computer mediation there are lets see five days and some hours to launch we can slow him down so that his subjective time is maybe thirty minutes over that period it makes sense but what i said makes sense too and i cant take the responsibility for letting him out of my hands until ive made every test i want to make scanyon scowled i understand what youre saying its a good point and ive got a point of my own too what happened to what you were saying last night major carpenter about not cutting off his behavior modification too abruptly sulie said hes at a plateau stage general if i could have another six months with him id take it five days no theres more risk than there is benefit hes found a real interest in his guitar you should hear him hes built up really structurally good defenses in regard to his lack of sexual organs he has even taken things into his own hands by running out last night thats a major step general his profile was much too passive to be good when you consider the demands of this mission i say put him on hold now and i say i need more time with him flared brad maybe sulies right but im right too and ill take it to the president if i have to scanyon looked thoughtfully at brad then around the room any other comments don kayman put in for what its worth i agree with sulie hes not happy about his wife but hes not shaken up either this is as good a place as any for him to go yeah said scanyon gently patting the desk top again he looked into space and then said theres something none of you know your simulation isnt the only one of roger that has been done lately he looked at each face and emphasized this is not to be discussed with anyone outside this room the asians are doing one of their own theyve tapped into our circuits somewhere between here and the two other computers and stolen all the data and theyve used it to make their own simulation why don kayman demanded only a beat before the others at the table thats what i wish i knew said scanyon heavily theyre not interfering we wouldnt have known about it if it wasnt for a routine line check that uncovered their tap and then some cloak and dagger stuff in peking that i dont know about and dont want to all they did was read everything out and make their own program we dont know what use they are going to make out of it but theres a surprise in it right after that they dropped their protest against the launch in fact they offered the use of their mars orbiter to expedite telemetry for the mission i wouldnt trust them as far as i could throw them brad flared well were not going to put much reliance on their bird you can bet on that but there it is they say they want the mission to work well he said thats just one more complication but it all comes down to a single decision right now correct i have to make up my mind whether or not to put roger on hold okay ill do it i accept your recommendation major carpenter tell roger what were going to do and tell him whatever you and dr ramez think you should about why as for you brad he raised his hand to ward off brads protests i know what youre going to say i agree roger needs more time with you well hell get it im ordering you along on the mission he slid a sheet of paper closer to him on his desk crossed out one name on a list wrote in another im going to drop one of the pilots to make room for you i already checked theres plenty of backup with the machine guidance systems and the fact that you all have had some pilot training anyhow thats the final crew roster for the mars launch torraway kayman general hesburgh as pilot and you brad protested it was only a reflex once the idea had settled in he accepted it what scanyon had said was true enough and besides brad perceived instantly that the career he had programmed for himself could not help but be enhanced by actual physical participation in the mission itself it would be a pity to leave dorrie and all the dorries but there would be so many dorries when he got back and everything else followed as the night the day that was the last decision everything else was only implementation on merritt island the crews began fueling the launch vehicle the rescue ships were deployed across the atlantic in case of failure brad was flown to the island for his fitting with six exastronauts detailed to cram in all the touchup teaching he needed and could get in the time available hesburgh was one of them short sure and smiling his demeanor a constant reassurance don kayman took a precious twelvehour relief to say goodby to his nun with all of this we were quite content we were content with the decision to send brad along we were content with the trendline extrapolations that every day showed more positive results from the effect of the launch on world opinion and events we were content with rogers state of mind and with the npa simulation of roger we were most content of all in fact that was an essential to our plans for the salvation of the race thirteen when we pass the point of no return the long hohmannorbit trip to mars takes seven months all previous astronauts cosmonauts and sinonauts had found them very wearing months indeed each day had seconds to fill and there was very little to fill them with roger was different from all the others in two ways first he was the most precious passenger any spaceship had yet carried in and around his body were the fruits of seven billion man plus dollars to the maximum extent possible he had to be spared the other way was that uniquely he could be spared his body clocks had been disconnected his perception of time was what the computer told him it should be they slowed him down gradually at first people began to seem to move a little more briskly mealtime came sooner than he was ready for it voices grew shriller when that phased in nicely they increased the retardation in his systems voices passed into highpitched gibberish and then out of his perception entirely he hardly saw people at all except as flickers of motion they sealed off his room from the day it was not to keep him from escaping it was to protect him from the quick transition from day to night platters of roomtemperature picnicstyle food appeared before him when he had begun to push them away to signal he was done or didnt want them they whisked out of sight roger knew what was being done to him he didnt mind he accepted sulies promise that it was good and needful and all right he thought he was going to miss sulie and looked for a way to tell her so there was a way but it all went so rapidly messages were chalked as if by magic on a board in front of him when he responded he found his answers snatched away and erased before he was quite sure he was through how are you feeling pick up the chalk write one word fine and then the board is gone brought back with another message were taking you to merritt island and his reply im ready snatched away before he could add the rest which he scrawled rapidly on his bedside table give my love to dorrie he had intended to add and sulie but there was no time suddenly the table was gone he was gone from the room there was a sudden dizzying lurch of movement he caught a quick glimpse of the ambulance entrance to the project and a quick phantom glimpse of a nurse was it sulie with her back to him adjusting her panty hose his whole bed seemed to leap into the air into a brutal blaze of winter sunlight then into what a car before he could even question it sprang into the air and he realized that it was a helicopter and then that he was very close to being sick he felt his gorge rising in his throat the telemetry faithfully reported and the controls were adequate to the problem he still felt he would like to vomit feeling himself thrown around as though in the most violent sort of crosschop sea but he did not then they stopped out of the helicopter bright sunlight again into something else which he recognized after it had begun to move as the interior of a cb fitted up as a hospital ship safety webbing spun magically around him it was not comfortable there was still the hammering and the twisting vertigo though not as unbearable but it did not last long a minute or two it seemed to roger then pressure smote his ears and they were taking him out of the plane into blinding heat and light florida of course he realized tardily but by then he was in an ambulance then out of it then for a time that seemed to roger ten or fifteen minutes and was actually the better part of a day nothing happened except that he was in a bed and was fed and his wastes were removed by catheter and then a note appeared before him good luck roger were on our way and then a steam hammer smote him from underneath and he lost consciousness it is all very well he thought to spare me the inconvenience of boredom but you may be killing me to do it but before he could think of a way to communicate this to anyone he was out time passed a time of dreams he realized groggily that they had been keeping him sedated not only slowed down but asleep and in realizing this he was awake there was no feeling of pressure in fact he was floating only a spiderweb of retaining straps kept him in place he was in space a voice spoke next to his ear good morning roger this is a tape recording he turned his head and found a tiny speaker grille next to his ear weve slowed it down so that you can understand it if you want to speak to us you just tape what you want to say in a minute then well speed it up so we can understand it aint science grand anyway were into day thirtyone as i tape this in case you dont remember me any more im don kayman you had a little trouble your muscle system fought against the takeoff acceleration and you pulled some ligaments we had to do a little surgery youre mending nicely brad rebuilt part of the cybernetics and you probably can handle the deltas when we land in good shape lets see theres nothing else important to say and probably you have some questions but before you take your turn theres a message for you and the tape whispered scratchily for a moment and then dorries voice came on bent and attenuated over a background hiss of static she said hi honey everythings fine back home and im keeping the home fires burning for you i think of you take care of yourself and then kaymans voice again now heres what you do first off if theres anything important if you hurt or anything like that tell us that right away theres a lot of realtime loss in this so say the important stuff first and when youre through just hold up your hand while we change tapes and then you can go on to the chitchat now go and the tape stopped and a small red light that had said play next to the speaker grille went out and a green one came on to say record he picked up the microphone and was getting ready to say that no there wasnt any particular problem when he happened to look down and notice that his right leg was missing we were of course monitoring every moment in the spacecraft the communication link had stretched pretty thin even after the first month the geometry was troublesome while the spacecraft was climbing out toward marss orbit mars was moving so was the earth and a good deal faster it would go around the sun almost twice before mars completed a single one of its orbits the telemetry from the spacecraft now took something like three minutes to reach goldstone we were passive listeners it would get worse any command from earth would come half an hour late by the time the spacecraft was circling mars roundtrip time at the speed of light we had surrendered instant control the ship and its passengers were effectively on their own later still the earth and mars would be on opposite sides of the sun the weak signals from the spacecraft would be so compromised by solar interference that we would not even receive reliably but by then the would be in orbit and shortly thereafter the mhd generator would join it then there would be plenty of power for everything it was all planned out where each would go how they would interlink with each other with the orbiting ship with the ground station and with roger wherever he might roam we launched the powered down into standby mode it was a robot run the ionization risk turned out on analysis to be unacceptable in a spacecraft of normal configuration so the cape engineers stripped away all the life support all the telemetry the demolition system and half of the maneuver capability the weight went into shielding once it was launched it was silent and lifeless and would stay that way for seven months then general hesburgh would capture control and play both ends of the docking maneuver it would be difficult but that was what he was paid for we launched the mhd generator a month later with a crew of two volunteers and a maximum of publicity everyone was interested now and no one objected not even the npa they disdained the first launch they acknowledged tracking the launch of the and offered their data to the nasa net when the generator went up their ambassador sent a polite note of congratulations clearly something was happening it was not all psychological new york city had two straight weeks without rioting and garbage was collected from some of the main streets winter rains put out the last of the great fires in the northwest and the governors of washington oregon idaho and california sent out a joint call for volunteers more than a hundred thousand young people signed up to replant the mountain slopes the president of the united states was the last to notice the change he was too busy with the internal disasters of a nation that had overbred and overspent itself into tragedy but the time came when he realized there had been a change not only within the united states but worldwide not only in a change in mood but in a change in tactics the asians withdrew their nuclear subs to the waters of the western pacific and the indian ocean and when dash got confirmation of that he picked up the phone and called vern scanyon i think he paused and reached out to touch the smooth wood of his desk top i think its working pat your staff on the back for me now what else do you need but there was nothing we were fully committed now we had gone as far as we could go and the rest was up to the expedition itself fourteen missionary to mars not more than six times a day don kayman allowed himself to pray he prayed for various things sometimes for relief from the sound of titus hesburgh sucking his teeth sometimes to be spared the smell of stale farts that smogged the interior of the spacecraft but there were always three petitions in each prayer the success of the mission the fulfillment of gods plan for man and most particularly the health and wellbeing of his friend roger torraway roger had the distinction of a private stateroom of his own it was not much of a room and the privacy was only an elastic curtain gossamer thin and not wholly opaque but it was all his the other three shared the crew cabin sometimes roger shared it too or at least parts of roger did he was all over the place roger was kayman looked in on him often the trip was a long dull time for him his own specialty which was of course not operative until they actually set foot on the surface of mars needed no touchup or practice areology was a static science and would remain so until he himself hopefully added something to it after landing so he had let titus hesburgh teach him the instrument board and a little later had let brad teach him something about fieldstripping a cyborg the grotesque form that slowly writhed and postured in its foam cocoon was no longer unfamiliar kayman knew every inch of it inside and out as the weeks wore on he lost the abhorrence that had deterred him from wrenching an eye from its socket or opening a panel into a plasticlined gut it was not all he had to do he had his music tapes to listen to an occasional microfiche to read games to play at chess he and titus hesburgh were pretty evenly matched they played interminable tournaments best games out of and used their personal comm allotments to have chess texts radioed up to them from earth it would have been relaxing for father kayman to pray more but after the first week it had occurred to him that even prayer could be carried to excess he rationed it out on awakening before meals in midevening and before retiring that was all that was not of course to count the quick lift from a paternoster or from telling his holinesss rosary and then he would go back to the endless refurbishing of roger he had always had a queasy stomach but obviously roger was oblivious to these invasions of his person and took no harm from them kayman gradually began to appreciate the inner beauty of rogers anatomy both that part which was mans handiwork and that part which was gods he gave thanks for both he could not quite give thanks for what god and man had done to the interior of rogers mind it troubled him that seven months were being stolen out of his friends life it drew forth compassion that rogers love went to a woman who held it cheap but everything considered kayman was happy he had never been on a mars mission before but this was where he belonged twice he had been in space a shuttle run to an orbiter when he was still a graduate student seeking his doctorate in planetology then a ninetyday tour in space station betty both were acknowledged to be mere practice for the mission that would complete his study of mars all that he knew of mars he had learned telescopically or deductively or from the observations of others he knew a lot of that he had played and replayed the synoptic tapes of all the orbiters and mariners and surveyors he had analyzed returned bits of soil and rock he had interviewed every one of the americans french and british who had landed in their various mars expeditions and most of the russians japanese and chinese as well he knew all about mars he always had as a child he had grown up on the edgar rice burroughs mars the colorful barsoom of the ocher dead sea bottoms and hurtling tiny moons as he grew older he distinguished fact from fiction there was no reality in the fourarmed green warriors and the redskinned egglaying beautiful martian princesses to the extent that science was in touch with reality but he knew that scientists estimates of reality changed from year to year burroughs had not invented barsoom out of airy imaginings he had taken it almost verbatim from the most authoritative scientific reality of his day it was percival lowells mars not burroughss that was finally denied by bigger telescopes and by space probes in the reality of scientific opinion life on mars had been born and died a dozen times but even that had never been settled really it depended on a philosophical question what was life did it have to mean a creature that resembled an ape or an oak tree did it necessarily mean a creature which dissolved its nutrients in a waterbased biology took part in an oxidationreduction cycle of energy transfer reproduced itself and grew thereby from the environment don kayman did not think so he considered it arrogance to limit life so parochially and he was humble in the face of his creators allpotentiating majesty in any case the case for life genetically related to earth life was still open well ajar true no ape or oak tree had been found not even a lichen not even a growing cell not even such prerequisites as free oxygen or water but kayman did not accept that the fact that because no one had slipped on a bed of martian moss there was none anywhere on mars to slip on less than a hundred human beings had ever set foot on mars the combined area of their explorations was only a matter of a few hundred square miles on mars where there were no oceans so the land surface to explore was greater than the earths it was almost like pretending to know the earth by making four quick trips to the sahara the top of the himalayas antarctica and the greenland icecap well no kayman conceded to himself that wasnt strictly fair there had been innumerable flybys and orbiters surveyors that landed and snatched up samples of soil nevertheless the principle was sound there was too much of mars no one could pretend that it did not possess secrets still water might yet be found some of the rifts looked hopeful some of the valleys had shapes that could hardly be understood unless you assumed they were carved out by streams even if they were dry there still might be water vast oceans of water even locked under the surface oxygen one knew was present not a great deal on the average but averages were not important locally there could be plenty and so there might be life kayman sighed it was one of his great regrets that he had not been able to deflect the decision on a landing place to one of his personal favorites for suspicion of life the solis lacus area the decision had gone against him it had been taken on very high authority in fact it was dash himself who said i dont give a leaping shit where something may be alive now i want to put this bird down where our boy can expect to stay alive the easiest so they had picked a spot nearer the equator and in the northern hemisphere the main features were called isidius regio and nepenthes and at their interface was a gentle crater that don kayman had privately christened home also privately he regretted the loss of solis lacus and its seasonally changing shape the bright wshaped cloud around the canals of ulysses and fortunae that had formed and reformed every afternoon through one long conjunction the brilliant flash that saheki saw in tithonius lacus on the first of december as bright as a sixthmagnitude star somebody else would have to investigate these things he would not but apart from such regrets he was content enough the northern hemisphere was a wise choice its seasons were better arranged because just as on earth the northern hemisphere had its winter when it was closest to the sun and so kept marginally warmer all year around winter there was twenty days shorter than summer in the south of course it was the other way around and although home had never been observed to change shape or emit flashes of light it had in fact been identified with a fair number of recent cloud formations kayman had not given up hope that some of the clouds were of water ice if not water itself he fantasized afternoon thundershowers on the martian plain and more soberly thought about the large stretches of limonite that had been identified nearby limonite contained bound water in quantity it would be a resource for roger even if no martian plant or animal had evolved to exploit it on the whole he was content about everything he was en route to mars that was a source of great joy to him for which he rendered thanks six times each day also he had a hope don kayman was too good a scientist to confuse his hopes with observations he would report what he found but he knew what he wanted to find he wanted to find life to the extent that the missions purposes permitted in the ninetyone martian days he would be able to stay on the planets surface he would keep his eyes open everyone knew he would do this it was in fact part of his contingent timepermitting briefing instructions what not everyone knew was why kayman was so interested dejah thoris was not quite dead for him he still had hope that there would be life not only life but intelligent life not only intelligent life but life with a soul to save and bring to his god everything that happened on the spacecraft was under constant surveillance and synoptic transmissions took place to earth regularly so we kept tabs on them we watched the chess games and the arguments we monitored brads currycombing of rogers bodily functions both meat and metal we saw the night when titus hesburgh wept for five hours gently and dreamily rebuffing all of kaymans offers to sympathize with a smile through tears in some ways hesburgh had the lousiest job aboard seven months coming seven months going and in between three months of nothing he would be all alone in orbit while kayman brad and roger were disporting themselves on the surface he would be lonely and he would be bored he would be worse than that seventeen months in space was a practical guarantee that for the last few decades of his life he would be plagued by a hundred different muscle bone and circulatory disorders they exercised faithfully wrestling each other and struggling against springs flailing their arms and pumping their legs that would not be enough there was inevitably calcium resorption from the bone and there was loss of muscle tone for those who landed the three months on mars would make a great difference in that time they would repair much of the damage and be in better shape for the return for hesburgh there was no such break his seventeen months in zerog would be uninterrupted and the experience of previous spacefarers had made the consequences clear it meant lowering his life expectancy by a decade or more and if he wept once in a while there was no one who had better reason time passed time passed a month two months six months beyond them in the skies the capsule with the was climbing after them behind it the magnetohydrodynamic power plant with its crew of two when they were two weeks out they ceremoniously switched watches changing to new quartzcrystal timepieces set to the martian day from then on they lived by the martian clock it made little enough practical difference the day for mars is just a bit more than thirtyseven minutes longer than earths but the difference was significant in their minds one week before arrival they began to speed roger up for roger the seven months had felt like thirty hours subjective time it had been time enough he had eaten a few meals exchanged several dozen communications with the rest of the crew he had received messages from earth and returned a few of them he had asked for his guitar been refused it on the grounds that he couldnt play it asked for it anyway out of curiosity and found that that was quite true he could pluck a string but he could not hear the note that resulted from it in fact apart from the specially sloweddown tapes he could hear nothing at all most of the time and only a sort of highpitched scurrying sound ever air did not conduct the sort of vibrations he could perceive when the tape recorder was out of contact with the metal frame to which he was bound he could not hear even it nor could his own voice be made to record they warned him they were beginning to accelerate his perceptions they left the curtain to his cubicle open and he began to notice flickers of motion he caught a glimpse of hesburgh dozing nearby then saw figures actually moving after a time he even recognized who they were then they put him to sleep to make final adjustments on his backpack and when he woke up he was alone the curtain was drawn and he heard voices he pushed the curtain aside and looked out and there was the smiling face of his wifes lover greeting him good morning roger nice to have you with us again and eighteen minutes later twelve travel time and the rest decoding and relaying the president watched it happen from more than a hundred million miles away on the screen in the oval office he was not the only one the tv nets put the scene on the air and the satellites rebroadcast it all over the world they were watching in the under palace in peking and inside the kremlin on downing street and the champs elysйes and ginza son of a bitch said dash historically theyve made it vern scanyon was with him son of a bitch he echoed then he said well almost made it theyve still got to land any problem about that cautiously not as far as i know god said the president positively would not be so unfair i think you and i are going to taste some bourbon right now its about that time they stayed and watched for half an hour and a quarter of a bottle on and off over the next few days they watched more they and the rest of the world the whole world saw hesburgh making final checks and preparing the marslander for separation watched don kayman go through a dry run under the pilots microscopic observation since he would be at the controls for the trip down out of orbit watched brad make a final ultimate recheck on rogers telemetry find it all functioning in the green and then do it over one more time watched roger himself moving about the crew cabin and squeezing into the lander and watched the lander separate and hesburgh look wistfully out at its minusdelta flare as it began to drop out of orbit we figured that three and a quarter billion people watched the landing it was not much to watch if you have seen one landing you have seen them all but it was important it began at a quarter to four in the morning washington time and the president had himself awakened to see it that priest he said frowning what kind of a pilot is he if anything goes wrong hes checked out sir soothed his nasa aide anyway hes actually only about a thirdplace backup the automatic sequencing is in primary control if anything goes wrong general hesburgh is monitoring it from the orbiter and he can override father kayrnan doesnt have anything to do unless everything goes wrong at once dash shrugged and the aide noticed that the presidents fingers were crossed what about the followup flights he asked staring at the screen no sweat at all sir the computer will inject into mars orbit in thirtytwo days and the generator twentyseven days later as soon as the lander is down general hesburgh is going to perform a course correction and overtake the moon deirnos we expect to land both the computer and the generator there probably in the crater voltaire hesburgh will make that determination for us um said the president has roger been told whos on the generator spacecraft no sir um the president abandoned the television screen and got up at the window staring out at the pretty white house lawn junegreen and blossoming he said theres a man coming over from the computer center in alexandria id like you to be here when he arrives yes sir commander chiaroso supposed to be pretty good used to be a professor at mit he says theres something strange about our projections about this whole project have you heard any gossip no sir said the nasa aide alarmed strange sir dash shrugged thats all i need he said getting this whole sonofabitching thing going and then finding out hey what the hells happening on the tv screen the image was jumping and breaking up it went out entirely restored itself and disappeared again leaving only the tracery of raster thats all right sir said the aide quickly its reentry buffeting when they hit the atmosphere they lose video contact even the telemetrys affected but weve got ample margins all around itll be all right the president demanded why the hell is that i thought the whole point was that mars didnt have any atmosphere not a lot sir but it does have some and because its smaller its got a shallower flatter gravity well in the upper atmosphere its just about as dense as the earths is at the same altitude and thats where the buffeting happens god damn it snarled the president i dont like surprises why didnt somebody tell me this well sir never mind ill take it up later i hope surprising torraway isnt going to be a mistake well forget it whats happening now the aide looked not at the screen but at his watch parachute deployment sir theyve completed retrofire now its just a matter of coming down in a few seconds the aide pointed to the screen which obediently built itself into a picture again there theyre in controlled descent mode now and they sat and waited while the lander slid down through the thin martian air under its immense canopy quintuple the size of a parachute built for air when it hit the sound came a hundred million miles and then sounded like trash cans falling off a roof but the lander had been built for it and the crew were long since in their protective cocoons there was a hissing sound from the screen and the clicking of cooling metal and then brads voice were on mars he said prayerfully and father kayman began to whisper the words from the ordinary of the mass laudamas te benedicirnus te adoramus te glorificamus te gloria in excelsis deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis and to the familiar words he added et in martis fifteen how the good news went from mars to earth when we first realized that there was a serious risk that a major war would destroy civilization and make the earth uninhabitable which is to say shortly after we collectively began to realize anything at all we decided to take steps to colonize mars it wasnt easy for us the whole human race was in trouble energy was in short supply the world over which meant fertilizer was expensive which meant people were hungry which meant explosively dangerous tensions the worlds resources were none too ample for the bare necessity of keeping billions of people alive we had to find ways to divert capacities that were badly needed elsewhere to longrange planning we set up three separate think tanks and gave them all the facilities we could steal from daily needs one explored options for solving the growing tensions on earth one was charged with setting up refuges on earth itself so that even if a thermonuclear war did occur a small fraction of us could survive the third looked into extraterrestrial possibilities in the beginning it seemed as though we had a thousand options to choose from and each of the three major tracks had branches that looked hopeful one by one the tracks closed off our best estimates not the ones we gave the president of the united states but the private ones we showed to nobody but ourselves were of point nine to ten nines probability of thermonuclear war within a decade and we closed down the center for solving international tensions in the first year setting up refuges was a little more hopeful it developed that worstcase analysis indicated a few places on the earth that would be unlikely to experience direct attack antarctica parts of the sahara even some of australia and a number of islands ten sites were selected each one had only a point zero one or less probability of being destroyed if all ten were considered the probability that they would all be destroyed was relatively insignificant but finegrain analysis showed that there were two flaws for one we could not be sure how much longlife isotope would remain in the atmosphere after such a war and the indications were that there would be excessive levels of ionizing radiation for as much as a thousand years over that time scale the probability that even one of the refuges would survive became far less than point five worst of all there was the necessity for capital investment to build the refuges underground and fill them with the immense quantity needed of complex electronic equipment generators fuel reserves and so on was as a practical matter impossible there was no way for us to get the money so we terminated that think tank and put all the resources we could manage into extraterrestrial colonization at the beginning that had looked like the least hopeful solution of all but almost we had managed to make it work when roger torraway landed that completed the first and hardest step by the time the ships that were following him reached their positions in orbit or on the surface of the planet we would be able for the first time to plan for a future with the survival of the race assured so we watched with great satisfaction as roger stepped out on the surface of the planet rogers backpack computer was a triumph of design it had three separate systems crosslinked and sharing facilities but with enough redundancy so that all systems had point nine reliability at least until the backup computer reached orbit one system mediated his perceptions another controlled the subsystems of nerve and muscle that let him walk and move the third telemetered all of his inputs whatever he saw we saw on earth we had gone to some trouble to arrange this by shannons law there was not enough band width to transmit everything but we had included a random sampling feature approximately one bit per hundred was transmitted first to the radio in the landing craft where we had assigned one channel permanently for that purpose then it was rebroadcast to the orbiter where general hesburgh floated watching the television screen while the calcium oozed out of his bones from there cleaned and amplified it was bursttransmitted to whichever synchronous satellite of earth was at that moment locked into both mars and goldstone so what we all saw was only about one percent real but that was enough the rest was filled in by a comparison program we had written for the goldstone receiver hesburgh saw only a series of stills on earth we broadcast what looked exactly like onthespot movies of whatever roger saw so all over the earth on television sets in every country people watched the beige and brown mountains that rose ten miles tall saw the glint of martian sunlight off the window frames of the lander could even read the expression on father kaymans face as he rose from prayer and for the first time looked out on mars in the under palace in peking the great lords of new peoples asia interrupted a planning session to watch the screen their feelings were mixed it was americas triumph not theirs in the oval office president deshatines joy was pure not only was the triumph american it was personal he was identified forever as the president who had established humanity on mars almost everybody was at least a little joyous even dorrie torraway who sat in the private room at the back of her shop with her chin in her hands studying the message of her husbands eyes and of course in the great white cube of the project outside of tonka oklahoma everyone left on the staff watched the pictures from mars almost all the time they had plenty of leisure for that they didnt have much else to do it was astonishing how empty the building became as soon as roger was out of it they had all been rewarded from the stockroom boys up a personal commendation for everyone from the president plus a thirtyday bonus leave and a jump in grade clara bly used hers to finish up her longdelayed honeymoon weidner and freeling took the time to write a rough draft of brads paper transmitting every paragraph to him in orbit as it came off their typewriters and receiving his corrections via goldstone vern scanyon of course had a heros tour with the president in fiftyfour states and the principal cities of twenty foreign countries brenda hartnett had appeared on television twice with her kids they had been deluged with gifts the widow of the man who had died to put roger torraway on mars was now a millionaire they had all had their hour of fame as soon as the launch got off and roger was en route especially in those moments just before the landing then the world looked out at mars through the eyes of roger and the senses of the brother on rogers back and all their fame blew away from then on it was all roger we watched too we saw brad and don kayman in their suits completing the preegress drill roger had no need of a suit he stood on tiptoe at the door of the lander poised sniffing the empty wind his great black wings hovering behind him and soaking in the rays of the disconcertingly tiny but disconcertingly bright sun through the tv pickup inside the lander we saw roger silhouetted against the dull beige and brown of the abrupt martian horizon and then through rogers eyes we saw what he saw to roger looking out on the bright jewellike colors of the planet he was meant to live on it was a fairyland beautiful and inviting the lander had stretched out skeletal magnesium steps to stroke the surface of mars but roger didnt need them he jumped down the wings fluttering for balance not for lift and landed lightly on the chalky orange surface where the wash of the landing rockets had scoured away the crust he stood there for a moment surveying his kingdom with the great faceted eyes dont rush things advised a voice in his head that came from don kaymans suit radio better go through the exercise list roger grinned without looking around sure he said and began to move away first he walked then trotted then he began to run if he had sped through the streets of tonka here he was a blur he laughed out loud he changed the frequency responses of his eyes and the distant towering hills flashed bright blue the flat plain a mosaic of greens and yellows and reds this is great he whispered and the receivers at the lander picked up the subspoken words and passed them on to earth roger said brad petulantly i wish youd take it easy until we get the jeep ready roger turned the other two were back at the steps of the lander deploying the mars vehicle from its folddown condition behind its hatch he bounded back toward them joyously need help they didnt have to answer they did need help in their suits it was a major undertaking to slip the retaining strap off one of the basketwork wheels move over he said and quickly freed the wheels and stretched the stilted legs into standby position the jeep had both wheels for the flat parts stilts for climbing it was meant to be the most flexible vehicle man could make for getting around mars but it wasnt roger was when it was done he touched them and promised i wont go out of line of sight and then he was gone off to see the patches of color around a series of hummocks dalibright and irresistible thats dangerous brad grumbled over the radio wait till we finish testing the jeep if anything happens to you were in trouble nothing will said roger and no he couldnt wait he was using his body for what it had been built to do and patience was gone he ran he jumped he found himself two kilometers from the lander before he knew it looked back saw that they were creeping slowly after him and went on his oxygenation system stepped up the pumprate to compensate for the extra demands his muscles met the challenge smoothly it was not his muscles that propelled him but the servosystems that had been built in instead but it was the tiny muscles at the ends of the nerves that ordered the servos all the practice paid off it was no effort at all to reach two hundred kilometers an hour leaping over small cracks and craters bounding up and down the slopes of larger ones come back roger it was don kayman sounding worried a pause while roger ran on then a dizzying sense of movement in his vision and another voice said go back roger its time he stopped flatfooted skidded flailed with his wings against the almost indetectable air almost fell and caught himself the familiar voice chuckled come on honey be a good boy and go back now dorries voice and out of the distant thin whirl of drifting sand the colors coalesced into the shape of dorrie to match the voice of dorrie smiling not ten meters away long legs disappearing into shorts a gay halter for a top her hair blown in the breeze the radio voice in his head laughed this time in the tones of don kayman surprised you didnt we it took a moment for roger to reply yeah he managed it was brads idea we taped dorrie back on earth when you need an emergency signal dorrie will give it to you yeah said roger again as he stared the smiling figure turned wispy the colors faded and it disappeared he turned and went back the return trip took a lot longer than the joyous outbound run and the colors were no longer quite so bright don kayman drove the jeep steadily toward the trudging shape of roger torraway trying to get the hang of staying in the plunging seat without being thrown back and forth into the restraining belts it was in no way comfortable the suit that had been tailored to his body had developed tight spots and loose ones in the long months up from earthor maybe he reminded himself fairly he was the one who had swelled a little in some places and shrunk in others he had not he conceded been wholly diligent about his exercises also he had to go to the bathroom there was relief plumbing in the suit he knew how to use it but he didnt want to above the discomfort was an overlay of envy and worry the envy was a sin that he could purge himself of whenever he could find someone to hear his confession a venial sin at most he thought considering the manifest advantages roger had over the other two worry was a worse sin not against his god but against the success of the mission it was too late to worry maybe it had been a mistake to set up the simulation of rogers wife to punch home urgent messages at the time he hadnt known quite how complicated rogers feelings were about dorrie but it was too late to do anything about it brad didnt seem to have any worries he was chuckling fondly over rogers performance did you notice he was demanding didnt fall once perfect coordination normative match bio and servo i tell you don weve got it knocked its a little early to tell kayman said uneasily but brad went on kayman thought of turning off the voice in his suit helmet but it was almost as easy to turn off his attention he looked around him they had landed near the sunrise terminator but they had used more than half the martian day in preexit check and in putting the jeep together it was becoming late afternoon they would have to be back before it was dark he told himself roger would be able to navigate by starlight but it would be chancier for brad and him maybe some other time after they had had the practice he really wanted that very much to stroll the ebony surface of a barsoomian night with the stars pinpoints of colored fire in a velvet black sky but not yet they were on a great cratered plain the size was hard to estimate at first looking around through his faceplate kayman had trouble remembering how far away the mountains were his mind knew because he knew every gridsquare of the martian maps for two hundred kilometers around their impact point but his senses were deceived by the absolutely transparent visibility the mountains to the west he was aware were a hundred kilometers away and nearly ten kilometers high they looked like nearby foothills he clutched the jeep down and stopped it they were within a few meters of roger brad fumbled himself free and slid clumsily out of the seat lurching in an ungainly slow gait over toward roger to study him everything all right he said anxiously of course it is i can see that hows your balance close your eyes will you i mean you know shut off your vision he peered anxiously at the faceted hemispheres did you i cant tell you know i did said roger through the radio in his head great no sense of dizziness eh no trouble keeping your balance keeping your eyes closed he went on circling roger and staring at him from all angles swing your arms up and down a few times fine now windmill them opposite directions kayman couldnt see his face but he could hear the broad grin in the tone of brads voice beautiful roger optimal all the way my congratulations to you both said kayman out of the vehicle and watching the performance roger the head turned toward him and though there was nothing about the appearance of the eyes that changed kayman knew roger was looking at him i only wanted to say he went on not quite sure where the sentence was going to go that im well im sorry we sprang that bit about using dorries image to convey messages on you i have a feeling weve given you too many surprises its all right don the trouble with rogers voice kayman reflected again was that you couldnt tell much from its tone having said that much he said i think i ought to tell you that we do have another surprise for you a pleasant one i think sulie carpenters following us up here her ship should arrive in about five weeks silence and no expression why said roger at last thats very nice shes a fine person yes but the conversation didnt seem to have anywhere to go after that and besides brad was impatient to put roger through a whole bending and stretching series kayman allowed himself the privileges of a tourist he turned away staring toward the distant mountains squinted at the bright sun which even the autodarkening of his faceplate didnt make quite comfortable then looked around him clumsily he managed to kneel and to scoop up a clutch of pebbly dirt in his gloved hand it would be his job next day to start the systematic collection of samples to return to earth that was one minor task of the mission even after half a dozen manned landings and nearly forty instrumented missions there was still an insatiable demand for samples of martian soil in the laboratories of earth right now however he was allowing himself to daydream there was plenty of limonite in this sand and the quartz pebbles were far from round the edges were not sharp but neither had they been milled to roundness he scraped into the soil a yellowish powder rested on top underneath it the material was darker and coarser there were shiny specks almost like glass quartz he wondered and idly scooped around one he froze his hands cupping an irregular rounded blob of crystal it had a stem a stem that thrust down into the ground that spread and divided into dark roughsurfaced tendrils roots don kayman jumped up whirling on roger and brad look he shouted the object plucked free in his gauntleted hand dear god in heaven look at this and roger coming up out of a crouch spun and leaped at him one hand knocked the glittering crystal thing spinning fifty meters into the air bending the metal of the gauntlet kayman felt a sharp quick pain in that forearm and saw the other hand striking toward his faceplate like the claw of an angry kodiak bear and that was the last he saw sixteen on the perception of perils vern scanyon parked his car any which way across the painted yellow lines that marked his own place jumped out and held his thumb against the elevator button he had been awake less than forty minutes but he was not at all sleepy what he was was angry and apprehensive the presidents appointments secretary had waked him out of a sound sleep with a phone call to say that the president had diverted his flight to stop at tonka to discuss the problems of the perceptual system of commander torraway to kick ass more accurately scanyon had not known anything about rogers sudden attack on don kayman until he was in his car hastening to the project building to meet the president morning vern jonny freeling looked scared and angry too scanyon brushed past him into his own office come on in he barked now in words of one syllable what happened freeling said resentfully its not my responsibility to freeling rogers systems overreacted a little apparently kayman moved suddenly and the simulations systems translated it into a threat roger defended himself and pushed kayman away scanyon stared broke his arm freeling amended it was only a simple fracture general no complications its splinted itll heal perfectly he just has to get by with one functioning arm for a while its a pity for don kayman of course he wont be very comfortable fuck kayman why didnt he know how to act around roger well he did know he found something that he thought was indigenous life that was pretty exciting all he wanted to do was show it to roger life scanyons eyes looked more hopeful some sort of plant they think cant they tell well roger seems to have knocked it out of kaymans hand brad went looking for it afterward but he couldnt find it jesus scanyon snorted freeling tell me one thing what kind of incompetents have we got working for us it was not a question that had a proper answer and scanyon didnt wait for one in about twenty minutes he said the president of the united states is going to come through that door and hes going to want to know line by line what happened and why i dont know what hes going to ask but whatever it is theres one answer i dont want to give him and thats i dont know so tell me freeling tell me all over again what happened why it went wrong why we didnt think it would go wrong and how we can be damn sure it isnt going to go wrong again it took a little more than twenty minutes but then they had more the presidents plane touched down late and by the time dash arrived scanyon was as ready as he knew how to be even ready for the fury in the presidents face scanyon dash snapped at once i warned you no more surprises this time is one too many and i think im going to have to have your ass you cant put a man on mars without risks mr president dash stared eye to eye for a moment then said maybe whats the priests condition hes got a broken radius but its going to be all right theres something more important than that he thinks he found life on mars mr president dash shook his head i know some kind of plant but he managed to lose it for the moment kaymans a good man if he said he found something important he did hell find it again i certainly hope so vern dont slide away from this why did this thing happen a slight overcontrol of his perceptual systems thats it mr president and thats all it is in order to make him respond quickly and positively we had to build in some simulation features to get his attention to priority messages he sees his wife speaking to him to get him to react to danger he sees something frightening that way his head can keep up with the reflexes we built into his body otherwise hed go crazy breaking the priests arm wasnt crazy no it was an accident when kayman jumped at him he interpreted it as an actual attack of some kind he responded well mr president in this case it was wrong and it cost us a broken arm but suppose there had been a real threat any kind of a threat he would have met it whatever it was hes invulnerable mr president nothing can ever catch him offguard yeah said the president and after a moment maybe so he stared over scanyons head for a moment and said what about this other crap which crap mr president dash shrugged irritably as i understand it theres something wrong with all our computer projections especially the polls we took alarm bells went off in scanyons head he said reluctantly mr president theres a lot of paper on my desk i havent got through yet you know ive been traveling a lot scanyon said the president im going now before you do anything else i want you to take a look through the papers on your desk and find that paper and read it tomorrow morning eight oclock i want you in my office and then i want to know whats happening specifically three things first i want to hear that kaymans all right second i want that living thing found third i want to know the score on the computer projections and it better be all right so long scanyon i know its only five in the morning but dont go back to bed by then we could have reassured scanyon and the president about one thing the object kayman had picked up was indeed some form of life we had reconstructed the sampled data through rogers eyes filtered out the simulations and seen what he had seen it had not yet occurred to the president or his advisers that that could be done but it would it was not possible to make out fine details because of the limited number of bits available but the object was shaped rather like an artichoke coarse leaves pointing upward and a little like a mushroom there was a crystalline cap of transparent material over it it possessed roots and unless it was an artifact it had to be a form of life we did not find that very interesting except of course as it would reinforce general interest in the mars project itself as to the doubt cast on the computer simulations we were considerably more interested we had followed that development for some time ever since a graduate student named byrne had written a systems program to recheck his deskcalculator previous recheck of some of the poll results we were as concerned about it as the president was but the probability of any serious consequence there too appeared quite small especially since everything else was going well the mhd generator was almost ready for preorbit injection course corrections we had selected an installation site for it in the crater called voltaire on the moon deimos not far behind it was the vehicle that contained the and its human crew of two including sulie carpenter and on mars itself they had already begun construction of permanent installations they were a little behind schedule kaymans accident had slowed them down not only because of what it did to him but because what brad then insisted on doing to roger fieldstripping his shoulderpack computer to test for glitches there werent any but it took two martian days to be sure and then because kayman begged they took time to find his life form they found it or not it exactly but dozens of other specimens of the same thing and brad and roger left kayman inside the lander to study it while they began building their domes the first step was to find an area of mars which had suitable geology the surface should be as much like soil as possible but solid rock had to be not far below it took half a day of pounding explosive spikes into the ground and listening to echoes to be sure they had that then laboriously the solar generators were spread out and the subsurface rockbound water was boiled out as the first tiny plume of steam appeared at the lip of the pipe they cheered it would have been easy to miss it the utterly dry martian air snatched every molecule up almost as soon as it left the pipe but by leaning close to the valve at the end one could see a faint irregular misting that distorted shapes beyond it it was water vapor all right the next step was to spread out three great stretches of monomolecular film the smallest first and the largest on top and seal the topmost to the ground all around its periphery then they carried the pumps out on the basketwheeled vehicle and started them going the martian atmosphere was extremely thin but it was there the pumps would ultimately fill the domes partly with the compressed carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the atmosphere partly with the water vapor they were boiling out of the rock there was to be sure no oxygen to speak of in any of that but they didnt have to find oxygen they would make it in exactly the same way earth made its oxygen through the intercession of photosynthetic plants it would take four or five days for the outer dome to fill to its planned quarter kilogram of pressure then they would start filling the second one up to almost a kilogram then finally they would fill the inner dome to two kilograms and so they would have an environment in which people could live without pressure suits and even breathe as soon as the crops gave them breathing material of course roger didnt need any of that he didnt need the oxygen he didnt even need the plants for food or not much and not for a long time he could stay perhaps forever living off the unfailing light of the sun for most of his energy plus what would be microwaved down from the mhd generator once it was in place what was needed for the minuscule remaining part of him which was raw animal could easily be supplied by the concentrated foods from the ship for a long time and only then after perhaps a couple of martian years would he have to begin to depend on what came out of the hydroponics tanks and the seeds they were already sprouting in sealed coldframes under the canopies it all took several days since kayman wasnt a great deal of help getting in and out of a pressure suit was agony for him so they left him in the lander most of the time when it came time to lug the tanks of carefully hoarded sludge from their toilet facilities over to the dome kayman lent a hand exactly one hand he said trying to handle the magnesiumshafted rake by wrapping his good arm around it youre doing fine brad encouraged there was enough pressure in the innermost dome now to lift it above their heads but not quite enough to let them take off their pressure suits which was just as well brad realized this way they couldnt smell what they were raking into the sterile soil by the time the dome was fully extended the pressure was up to a hundred millibars this is the pressure of earths atmosphere at some ten miles above sea level it is not an environment in which naked man can survive and work for very long but it is an environment in which he will only die if something kills him half that pressure would be lethal instantly his body temperature would boil his fluids away but when the internal pressure hit the millibar level all three of them crowded through the three successive airlocks and brad and don kayman ceremoniously took off their pressure suits brad and don fitted nosepieces something like that of an aqualung in place for breathing there was still no oxygen to speak of inside the dome but they got pure oxygen from the tanks on their backs and with that they were for the first time almost as free as roger inside a transplanted bit of earth that was a hundred meters across and as tall as a tenstory building and inside it in orderly rows the seeds they had transplanted were already beginning to sprout and grow meanwhile the vehicle with the magnetohydrodynamic generator attained mars orbit and with general hesburgh helping matched orbit with deimos and nestled into the crater it was a perfect coupling the vehicle swung out its struts to touch the rock of the moon augered them in and locked a brief jet from the maneuvering system tested its stability it was now a part of deimos the power system began to sequence toward full operational mode a fusion flame woke the plasma fires radar reached out to find the target on the lander then locked on to the dome power began to flow the energy density of the field was low enough for brad and kayman to walk around in it unaware and to roger it was like the basking warmth of sunlight but the foil strips in the outer dome gathered the microwave energy and channeled it to the pumps the batteries the fusion fuel had a life of fifty years for that long at least there would be energy for roger and his backpack computer on mars whatever happened on earth and meanwhile there were other couplings in the long spiral up from earth sulie carpenter and her pilot dinty meighan had had time heavy on their hands and had found a way to use it the act of copulation in free fall presents certain problems first sulie had to buckle one strand of webbing around her waist then dinty embraced her with his arms and she him with her legs their motions were underwater slow it took sulie a long gentle dreamy time to come to orgasm and dinty was even slower when they were finished they were hardly even breathing hard sulie stretched and yawned arching her belly against the retaining strap nice she said drowsily ill remember that we both will honey he said misunderstanding her i think thats the best way we screw next time she shook her head to interrupt him no next time dinty dear that was it he pulled his head back to look at her what she smiled her right eye was still only centimeters from his left and their view of each other curiously foreshortened she craned forward and rubbed her cheek gently against his bristly one he scowled and detached himself suddenly feeling naked where before he had been only bare he pulled his shorts out from behind the handhold where he had cached them and slid into them sulie whats the matter nothings the matter were almost ready for orbit thats all he pushed himself backward across the cramped compartment to get a better look at her she was worth looking at her hair had gone back to muddy blond and her eyes were brown without the contact lenses and even after almost two hundred days of never being more than ten meters from him she still looked good to dinty meighan i didnt think you had any surprises left he marveled you never can tell about a woman come on sulie whats this all about you sound as though youve been planning hey a thought struck him you volunteered for this mission not to go to mars but to go to some guy right one of the guys ahead of us youre very quick dinty not she said fondly where i dont want you to be though who is it brad hesburgh not the priest oh wait a minute he nodded sure the one you were mixed up with back on earth the cyborg colonel roger torraway the human being she corrected as human as you are except for some improvements he laughed more resentment than humor a lot of improvements and no balls at all sulie unstrapped herself dinty she said sweetly ive enjoyed sex with you and i respect you and youve been about as comfortable to be with as any human being possibly could be on this goddamned eternity trip but there are some things i dont want you to say youre right roger doesnt happen to have any testicles right at this exact moment but hes a human being i can respect and love and hes the only one like that ive found lately believe me ive looked thanks oh dont do this dear dinty you know youre not really jealous youve already got a wife next year i do thats a long way off she shrugged grinning ah but sulie there are some things you cant kid me about you love screwing i like body contact and intimacy she corrected and i like coming to orgasm i like both those things better with someone i love dinty no offense he scowled youve got a long wait sweetie maybe not the hell you say i wont see irene for seven months but you you wont be back any faster than i will and then it only begins theyve got to put him back together for you assuming they can put him back together it sounds like a long time between fucks oh dinty dont you think ive thought this all out she patted him in passing on the way to her own locker sex isnt just coitus there are more ways to orgasm than with a penis in my vagina and theres more to sex than orgasm not to mention love roger she went on wriggling into her jump suit not so much for modesty as for pockets is a resourceful loving person and so am i well make out anyway until the rest of the colonists land rest he struggled rest of the colonists havent you figured it out yet im not going back with all of you dinty and i dont think roger is either were going to be martians and meanwhile in the oval room of the white house the president of the united states was confronting vern scanyon and a young coffeecolored man with tinted glasses and the build of a football player so youre the one he said appraising him you think we dont know how to run a computer study no mr president the young man said steadily i dont think thats the problem scanyon coughed byrne here he said is a graduate student on workstudy from mit his thesis is on sampling methodology and we gave him access to some of the ah classified material especially publicopinion studies about attitudes on the project but not to a computer byrne said not to a big one scanyon corrected you had your own desk dataplex the president said mildly get on with it scanyon well his results came out different according to his interpretations the public opinion on the whole question of colonizing mars was well apathy you remember mr president there was some question about the results at the time the raw results werent encouraging at all but when we played them through analysis they came out positive to what do you call it two sigmas i never knew why did you check certainly mr president not me scanyon added quickly that wasnt my responsibility but im satisfied that the studies were verified byrne put in three different times with three different programs there were minor variations of course but they all came out significant and reliable only when i repeated them on my desk machine they didnt and thats the way it is mr president if you work up the figures on any big computer in the net you get one result if you work them up on a small isolated machine you get another the president drummed the balls of his thumbs on the desk whats your conclusion byrne shrugged he was twentythree years old and his surroundings intimidated him he looked to scanyon for help and found none he said youll have to ask somebody else that one mr president i can only give you my own conjecture somebodys buggering our computer network the president rubbed the left lobe of his nose reflectively nodding slowly he looked at byrne for a moment and then said without raising his voice carousso come on in here mr byrne what you see and hear in this room is top secret when you leave mr carousso will see that you are informed as to what that means to you in detail basically you are not to talk about it to anyone ever the door to the presidents anteroom opened and a tall solid man with a selfeffacing air walked in byrne stared at him wonderingly charles carousso the head of the cia what about it chuck the president asked what about him weve checked mr byrne of course said the agency man his words were precise and uninflected there isnt anything significantly adverse to him youll be glad to know i suppose mr byrne and what he says checks out it isnt only the publicopinion surveys the warrisk projections the cost effectiveness studies run on the net they come out one way run on independent calculating machines they come out another i agree with mr byrne our computer net has been compromised the presidents lips were pressed together as though he were holding back what he wanted to say all he allowed to come out was i want you to find out how this happened chuck but the question now is who the asians no sir we checked that out its impossible bullshit its impossible roared the president we know they already did tap our lines once on the simulation of roger torraways systems mr president thats an entirely different case we found that tap and neutralized it it was in the groundlines cable on a nonsensitive linkage the comm circuits on our major machines are absolutely leakproof he glanced at byrne you have a report on the techniques involved mr president ill be glad to go over it with you at another time oh dont worry about me said byrne smiling for the first time everybody knows the links are multiply scrambled if youve checked me out im sure you found out that a lot of us graduate students fool around trying to tap in and none of us make it the agency man nodded as a matter of fact mr president we tolerate that its good fieldtesting for our security if people like mr byrne cant think up a way past the blocks i doubt the asians can and the blocks are leakproof they have to be they control circuits that go to the war machine in butte the census bureau unesco wait a minute barked the president you mean our machines tie in with both unesco which the asians use and the war machine there is absolutely no possibility of a leak theres been a leak carousso not to the asians mr president you just finished telling me theres one wire that goes out of our machine to the war machine and another that goes straight to the asians with a detour through unesco even so mr president i absolutely guarantee its not the asians we would know that all major computers are crosslinked to some extent thats like saying theres a road from everywhere to everywhere else right there is but there are roadblocks there is no way the npa can get access to the war machine or to most of these studies even so if they had done it we would know from covert sources they havent and he went on in any case mr president can you think of any reason why the npa would distort results in order to compel us to colonize mars the president drummed his thumbs looking around the room at last he sighed im willing to go along with your logic chuck but if it wasnt the asians that buggered our computers then who the agency man was morosely silent and dash snarled for christs sake why seventeen a day in the life of a martian roger could not see the gentle shower of microwave energy coming down from deimos but he could feel it as a luxury of warmth when he was nearby he preened his wings in it soaking up strength outside the beam he carried part of it with him in his accumulators there was no reason for him to hoard his strength now more strength poured down from the sky whenever deimos was above the horizon there were only a few hours in each day when neither the sun nor the farther moon were in the sky and his storage capacity was multiply adequate for those brief periods of drought inside the domes of course the metalfoil antennae stole the energy before it reached him so he limited his time with brad and kayman he didnt mind it was what he preferred every day the gap between them widened anyway they were going back to their own planet roger was going to stay on his he had not told them that yet but he had made up his mind earth had begun to seem like a pleasant quaint foreign place he had visited once and hadnt much liked the pains and perils of terrestrial humanity were no longer his not even when they had been his own personal pains and his own fears inside the dome brad wearing gstring undershorts and a demand tank of oxygen was happily planting carrot seedlings between the stands of siberian oats want to give me a hand rog his voice was reedily high in the thin atmosphere he took frequent sips of oxygen from the mouthpiece that hung next to his chin and then when he breathed out the voice was fractionally deeper but still strange no don wants me to pick up some more specimens for him ill be gone overnight all right brad was more interested in his seedlings than in torraway and torraway was no longer very interested in brad sometimes he would remind himself that this man had been his wifes lover but in order for that to feel like anything he had to remind himself that he had had a wife it didnt seem worth the effort more interesting was the challenge of the high cupped valley just over that farther range of hills and his own private farm plot for weeks now he had been bringing samples of martian life back to show don kayman they were not plentiful two or three together in a clump perhaps and nothing else for hundreds of meters around but they were not hard to find not for him once he had learned to recognize their special color the hard uv lengths that their crystal caps reflected away from them to let them survive in the harsh radiation environment it was reflexive to filter his vision bands to see only that wavelength in color and then they stood out a kilometer away so he had brought back a dozen of them and then a hundred there seemed to be four distinct varieties and it was not long before kayman asked him to stop he had all the samples he needed to study and half a dozen more of each in formalin to bring back to earth and his gentle conserving soul was uneasy at despoiling the ecology of mars roger began replanting some of them near the dome he told himself it was to see whether the overflow of energy beamed down from the generator did native life forms any harm but what it was he knew in his heart was gardening it was his planet and he was beautifying it for himself he let himself out of the dome stretched luxuriously for a moment in the double warmth of sun and microwave and checked his batteries they could use topping off he deftly plugged the leads into his own backpack and the gently whining accumulator at the base of the dome and without looking toward the lander said im going to take off now don kaymans voice responded instantly over the radio dont be out of touch more than two hours roger i dont want to have to come looking for you you worry too much said roger detaching the leads and stowing them away youre only superhuman grumbled kayman youre not god you could fall break something i wont brad so long inside the triple dome brad looked up over the armpithigh stalks of wheat and waved his features could not be made out through the filmy domes the plastic had been formulated to cut out the worst of the uv and it blurred some of the visual wavelengths as well but roger could see him wave take care give us a call before you go out of line of sight so well know when to start worrying yes mother it was curious roger reflected he was actually feeling rather fond of brad the situation interested him as an abstract problem was it because he was a gelding there was testosterone circulating in his system the steroid implant they had given him took care of that his dreams were sometimes sexual and sometimes of dorrie but the hollow despair and the anger he had lived with on earth had attenuated on mars he was already almost a kilometer from the dome running along easily in the warm sunlight each step coming down precisely where it would find secure footing and each thrust lifting him surely an exact distance up and ahead his vision was on lowenergy surveillance mode taking in everything in a moving teardrop shape whose point was where he was and whose lobe fifty meters across was more than a hundred meters in front of him he was not unaware of the rest of the landscape if something unusual had appeared above all if something had moved he would have seen it at once but it did not distract him from his musings he tried to remember what sex with dorrie had been like it was not hard to recall the objective physical parameters much harder to feel what he had felt in bed with her it was like trying to recall the sensuous joy of a chocolate malted when he was eleven or his first marijuana high at fifteen it was easier to feel something about sulie carpenter although as far as he could remember he had never touched any part of her but her fingertips and then by accident he had been thinking from time to time about sulies coming to mars it had seemed threatening at first then it had seemed interesting a change to look forward to now now roger realized he wanted it to happen soon not in four days when she was due to land after her pilot completed the onsite tests of the and the mhd generator soon they had exchanged a few casual greetings by radio he wanted her closer than that he wanted to touch her his wifes image formed in front of him wearing that same monotonous sunsuit better check in honey she said roger stopped and looked around on full vision mode in the earthnormal spectrum he was almost halfway to the mountains a good ten kilometers from the dome and the lander he had been going uphill and the flat terrain had begun to be rolling he could barely see the top of the dome and the tip of the antennas of the lander was a tiny spike beyond it without conscious effort his wings deployed themselves behind him to make his radio signal more directional as a shouting man might megaphone his hands around his mouth everythings okay he said and don kaymans voice answered inside his head thats fine roger itll be dark in three hours i know and after dark the temperature would plummet six hours from now it might touch a hundred and fifty degrees below zero but roger had been out in the dark before and all of his systems had performed beautifully ill check with you again when im high enough on a slope to reach you he promised turned and started once more toward the mountains the atmosphere was hazier than it had been he allowed himself to feel his skin receptors and realized that there was a growing wind sandstorm he had lived through them too if it got bad he would hedgehog somewhere until it stopped but it would have to be very bad to make that necessary he grinned inside himself he had not reliably learned how to do it with his new face and loped on at sunset he was in the shadow of the mountains high enough up to see the dome clearly more than twenty kilometers away the sandstorm was all below him now and seemed to be moving away he had stopped briefly twice and waited wings furled around him but that had been only routine caution at no time had it been more than an annoyance he cupped the wings behind him and said through his radio don brad its your wandering boy reporting in the reply inside his head when it came was scratchy and distorted an unpleasant feeling like gritting ones teeth on emery cloth your signals lousy rog are you okay sure but he hesitated the static from the storm was bad enough so that he had not been sure at first which of his companions was talking to him only after a moment had he identified the voice as brads maybe ill start back now he said the other voice even more distorted youll make an old priest happy if you do roger want us to come out and meet you hell no i can move faster than you can go to sleep ill see you in four or five hours roger chatted a moment than sat down and looked around he wasnt tired he had almost forgotten what it was like to be tired he slept an hour or two most nights and napped from time to time during the day more out of boredom than fatigue the organic part of him still imposed some demands on his metabolism but the crushing boneweariness of prolonged exertion was no longer part of his experience he sat because it pleased him to sit on an outcropping of rock and stare across the valley of his home the long shadow of the mountains had already passed the dome and only the peaks on the farther side were still lighted he could see the terminator clearly marss thin air did not diffuse the shadow much he could almost see it move overhead the sky was brilliantly beautiful it was easy enough to see the brighter stars even by daylight especially for roger but at night they were fantastic he could clearly make out the different hues steelblue sirius bloody aldebaran the smoky gold of polaris by expanding his visible spectrum into the infrared and ultraviolet he could see new bright stars whose names he did not know perhaps they had no common names since apart from himself they had been seen as bright objects only by astronomers using special plates he pondered about the question of namegiving rights if he was the only one who could see that bright patch there in orion did he have the right to christen it would anybody object if he called it sulies star for that matter he could see what was for the moment sulies actual star or heavenly body deimos was not a star of course he stared up at it and amused himself trying to imagine sulies face roger honey you torraway jumped straight up and landed a meter away the scream inside his head had been deafening had it been real he had no way to tell the voices from brad or don kayman and the simulated voice of his wife sounded equally familiar inside his head he was not even sure whose voice it had been dorries but he had been thinking about sulie carpenter and the voice had been so queerly stressed that it could have been either or neither of them and now there was no sound at all or none except for the irregular clicks squeaks and scrapes that came up from the rock as the martian crust responded to the rapidly dropping temperature he was not aware of the cold as cold his internal heaters kept the feeling part of him at constant temperature and would go on doing so easily all through the night but he knew that it was at least fifty below now another blast rog think you ought even with the warning of the time before the raucous shout was painful this time he caught a quick fugitive glimpse of dorries simulated image standing queerly on nothing at all a dozen meters in the air training took over roger turned toward the distant dome or where he thought it had been cupped his wings behind him and said clearly don brad ive got some kind of a malfunction im getting a signal but i cant read it he waited there was no response nothing inside his head except his own thoughts and a confused grumbling that he recognized as static roger it was dorrie again ten times lifesize towering over him and on her face a grimace of wrath and fear she seemed to be reaching down toward him and then she bent curiously sidewise like a television image flickering off the tube and was gone roger felt a peculiar pain tried to dismiss it as fear felt it again and realized it was cold there was something seriously wrong mayday he shouted don im in trouble help me the dark distant hills seemed to be rippling slowly he looked up the stars were turning liquid and dripping from the sky in don kaymans dream he and sister clotilda were sitting on hassocks in front of a waterfall eating sponges not candy kitchen sponges dipped into a sort of fondue clotilda was warning him of danger theyre going to throw us out she said slicing off a square of sponge and impaling it on a twopronged silver fork because you got a c in homiletics dipping it in the copperbottomed dish over the alcohol flame and youve got to just got to wake up he woke up brad was leaning over him come on don weve got to get out of here whats the matter kayman pulled the sleeping bag over his chest with his good hand i cant get an answer out of roger he didnt answer i sent him a priority signal then i thought i heard him on the radio but very faint hes either out of line of sight or his transmitter isnt working kayman wriggled out of the bag and sat up at times like this when first awakening his arm hurt the most and it was hurting now he put it out of his mind have you got a position fix three hours ago i couldnt get a bearing on this last transmission he cant be far off that line kayman was already sliding into the legs of his pressure suit the next part was the hardest trying to ease the splinted forearm into the sleeve among them they had managed to stretch the sleeve a little sealing the beginnings of a rip but it was barely possible would not be easy even under the best of conditions now trying to hurry it was infuriating brad was already in his suit and throwing equipment into a bag do you think youre going to perform an emergency operation out there kayman demanded brad scowled and kept on i dont know what ill have to do its full night don and hes up at least five hundred meters its cold kayman closed his mouth by the time he was zipped in brad had long since left the lander and was waiting at the wheel of the mars vehicle kayman clambered aboard painfully and they were moving before he had a chance to belt himself down he managed to cling with heels and the one unbendable arm while buckling himself in with the other hand but it was a close thing any idea of distance he asked in the hills somewhere said brads voice in his ear kayman winced and turned down the volume on his radio maybe two hours he guessed calculating rapidly if hes already started back maybe if he cant move or if hes moving around out there and we have to try to track him with rdf the voice stopped i think hes all right as far as temperature goes brad went on after a minute but i dont know i dont know what happened kayman stared ahead past the bright field of light from the vehicles headlight there was nothing to see except that the glittering field of stars was cut off like the scalloped edge of a doily at the horizon that was the mountain ridge it would be that kayman knew that brad was using as a guide aiming always at that lowest point between the double peak on the north and the very high one just to the south bright aldebaran was hanging over that higher peak a good enough navigation aid in itself at least until it set in an hour or so kayman keyed in the vehicles highgain antenna roger he said raising his voice although he knew that made no difference can you hear me were coming out to meet you there was no answer kayman leaned back in the contoured seat trying to minimize the swaying jolts of the vehicle it was bad enough rolling on the basketweave wire wheels across the flattest part of the terrain when they began trying to climb using the stiltlike legs he suspected he might be thrown clear out of the vehicle belt and all and was certain he would at least be sick ahead of them the jerking beam of the headlight was picking out a dune a rock outcropping sometimes throwing back a lance of light from a crystal face brad he said doesnt that light drive you crazy why dont you use the radar display he heard a quick intake of breath on his suit radio as though brad had been about to swear at him then the suited figure next to him reached down to the toggles on the steering column the bluish panel just under the sandscreen lit up revealing the terrain just in front of them and the headlight winked off it was easier to see the black outline of the mountains now thirty minutes at most a quarter of the way there roger kayman called again can you hear me were en route when we get close enough well pick you up on your target but if you can answer now there was no answer a ricegrain argon bulb began to blink rapidly on the dashboard the two men looked at each other through their faceplates and then kayman leaned forward and clicked the frequency settings to the orbit channel kayman here he said father kayman whats going on down there the voice was female which meant of course sulie carpenter kayman chose his words carefully rogers having some transmission trouble were going out to check it it sounds like more than plain trouble ive been listening to you trying to raise him kayman didnt answer and her voice went on weve got him located if you want a fix yes he shouted furious at himself they should have thought of deimoss rdf facility right away it would be easy for sulie or either of the orbiting astronauts to guide them in grid coordinates three poppa one seven two two zebra four oh but hes moving bearing about eight nine speed about twelve kilometers per hour brad glanced at their own course and said right on thats the reciprocal hes coming right for us but why so slowly kayman denianded a second later the girls voice came thats what i want to know is he hurt kayman said irritably we dont know have you tried radio contact over and over wait a minute pause and then her voice again dinty says to tell you well keep him located for you as long as we can but were getting to a bad angle so i wouldnt rely on our positions past what maybe another fortyfive minutes and in about twenty minutes after that well be below the horizon entirely brad said do what you can don hold on im going to see how fast this son of a bitch will go and the lurching of the vehicle tripled as brad accelerated kayman fought off being sick inside his helmet long enough to lean forward and study the speedometer the trip recorder rolling off the strip map along the side of the radar screen told the rest of the story even if they could maintain their present speed deimos would have set before they could reach roger torraway he switched back to the directional highgain roger he called can you hear me call in thirty kilometers away roger was at bay inside his own body to his perceptions he was racing back home at a strange gait like a highspeed heelandtoe race he knew his perceptions were wrong he did not know how wrong he could not be sure in what ways but he knew that the brother on his back had tampered with his time sense as well as with his interpretations of the inputs of his senses and what he knew most surely of all was that he was no longer in control of what happened to him the gait he was intellectually certain was a ploddingly slow walk it felt as though he were running the landscape was flowing by as rapidly to his perceptions as though he were racing at full speed but full speed implied soaring bounds and there was no time when both of his feet were off the ground at once conclusion he was walking but the backpack computer had slowed down his time sense probably to keep him reasonably tranquil if so it was not succeeding when the backpack brother took over control it had been terrifying first he had stood straight up and locked he could not move could not even speak all around him the black sky was rippling with streaks of aurora the ground itself shimmering like heat waves on a desert phantom images danced in and out of his vision he could not believe what his senses told him nor could he bend a single finger then he felt his own hands reaching behind him palping and tracing the joints where wings came to shoulderblades seeking out the cables that led to his batteries another frozen pause then the same thing feeling around the terminals of the computer itself he knew enough to know that the computer was checking itself what he did not know was what it was finding out or what it could do about it when it located the fault pause again then he felt his fingers questing into the jacks where he plugged in the recharge cables a violent pain smote him like the worst of all headaches like a stroke or a blow from a club it lasted only a moment and then it was gone leaving no more of itself than an immense distant flash of lightning he had never felt anything like it before he was aware that his fingers were gently and very skillfully scraping at the terminals there was another quick surge of pain as apparently his own fingers made a momentary short then he felt himself closing the flap and realized he had failed to do that when he recharged at the dome and then after another momentary stoppage of everything he had begun to move slowly carefully down the slope toward the dome he had no idea how long he had been walking at some point his time perception had been slowed but he could not even say when that had been all of his perceptions were being monitored and edited he knew that because he knew that that section of the martian terrain that he was traversing was not intrinsically softly lighted and in full color while everything around was nearly formless black but he could not change it he could not even change the direction of his gaze with metronome regularity it would sweep to one side or the other less frequently scan the sky or even turn to look back the rest of the time it was unwaveringly on the road he was treading and he could see only peripherally the rest of the nightscape and his feet twinkled heelandtoe heelandtoe how fast a hundred paces to the minute he could not tell he thought of trying to get some idea of the time by observing the clearing of the stars above the horizon but although it was not difficult to count his steps and to try to guess when those lowest stars had climbed four or five degrees which would be about ten minutes it was impossible to keep all of that in mind long enough to get a meaningful result apart from the fact that his vision kept dancing away from the horizon without warning he was wholly the prisoner of the brother on his back subject to its will deceived by its interpretations and very much a worried man what had gone wrong why was he feeling cold when there was so little of him that could feel a sensory reality at all and yet he yearned for the rising of the sun dreamed wistfully of basking in the microwave radiation from deimos painfully roger tried to reason through the evidence as he knew it feeling cold needing energy inputs that was the interpretation of that cue but why would he need more energy when he had fully charged his batteries he dismissed that question because he could see no answer to it but the hypothesis seemed strong it accounted for the lowenergy mode of travel walking was far slower than his usual leaping run but in kwh km terms it was far more costeffective perhaps it even accounted for the glitches in his perceptual systems if the backpackbrother had discovered before he did that there was insufficient energy for foreseeable needs it would surely ration the precious store to the most essential needs or what it perceived as most essential travel keeping the organic part of him from freezing conducting its own informationhandling and control procedures which unfortunately he was not privy to at least he reflected the primary mission of the backpack computer was to protect itself which meant keeping the organic part of roger torraway alive it might steal energy from the part that would keep him sane deprive him of communications interfere with his perceptions but he was sure he would get back to the lander alive if perhaps crazy he was more than halfway back already he was nearly sure and he was still sane the way to keep sane was to keep from worrying the way to keep from worrying was to think of other things he imagined sulie carpenters bright presence only days away wondered if she was serious about staying on mars wondered if he was himself he reminisced within himself about great meals he had eaten the spinachgreen pasta in the cream sauce in sirmione overlooking the bright transparent water of lake garda the kobe beef in nagoya the firehot chili in matamoras he thought of his guitar and made a resolve to haul it out and play it there was too much water in the air under the domes to be good for it and roger did not much like to be in the lander and outside in the open of course its sound was strange because it was all boneconducted but still he rehearsed the fingering of chords modulating through the sharps and sevenths and minors he imagined his fingers fretting the eminor the d the c and the bseventh of the opening passages of greensleeves and hummed along with them inside his head sulie would enjoy singing along with the guitar he thought it would make the cold martian nights pass he snapped to alertness this martian night was no longer passing quite so quickly subjectively it seemed as though his gait had slowed from a race to a steady stride but he knew that that had not changed his time perception had stretched back to normal maybe even a bit slower than normal he seemed to be walking quite slowly and methodically why there was something ahead of him at least a kilometer away and very bright he could not make it out a dragon it seemed to leap toward him breathing a long tongue of light like flame his body stopped walking it dropped to its knees and began to crawl very slowly keeping down this is insane he said to himself there are no dragons on mars what am i doing but he could not stop his body inched along knee and opposite hand hand and opposite knee into the shelter of a hummock of sand carefully and quickly it began to scoop the powdery martian soil away to fit itself into the hollow scraping some of the dirt back over itself inside his head tiny voices were babbling but he could not understand what they said they were too faint too garbled the dragon slowed and stopped a few dozen meters away its tongue of frozen flame lolling out toward the mountains his vision clouded and changed now the flame was dimmed and the bulk of the thing itself came up in ghostly luminescence two smaller creatures were dropping off its back ugly simian beasts that hulked along and exuded menace with every gesture there were no dragons on mars and no gorillas either roger summoned up all of his energies don he shouted brad he was not getting through he knew that the backpackbrother was still withholding energy from the transmitter he knew that his perceptions had been skewed and that the dragon was no dragon and the gorillas no gorillas he knew that if he could not override the brother on his back something very bad was likely to happen because he knew that his fingers were slowly and delicately wrapping themselves around a chunk of limonite the size of a baseball and he knew that he had never been closer to going mad in his life than he was right now roger made an immense effort to recapture his sanity the dragon was no dragon it was the mars vehicle the apes were not apes they were brad and don kayman they were not threatening him they had come all this way in the flintcold martian night to find him and help him he repeated the truths over and over like a litany but whatever he thought he was powerless to prevent what his arms and body did they seized the chunk of rock the body raised itself up the arms threw the rock with exact precision into the headlight of the crawler the long tongue of frozen flame winked out the light from the million fiery stars was ample for rogers senses but it would be very little help to brad and don kayman he could see them stumbling at random and he could feel what his body was doing it was creeping toward them don he shouted watch out but the voice never left his skull this was insanity he told himself i have to stop he could not stop i know thats not an enemy i dont really want to hurt them and he kept on advancing he was almost sure he could hear their voices now so close their transmitters would be deafening in his perceptions under normal conditions without the intercession of the automatic volume control even cut off as he was there was some spillage round here somewh yes he could even make out words and the voice he was sure had been brads he shouted with all the power at his command brad its me roger i think im trying to kill you heedless his body kept up his steady crawl had they heard him he shouted again and this time he could see both of them stop as though listening to the faintest of distant cries the tiny thread of don kaymans voice whispered im sure i heard him that time brad you did howled roger forcing his advantage watch out the computer has taken over im trying to override it but don he could recognize them now by the stiffly outstretched arm of the priests pressure suit get away im trying to kill you he could not make out the words they were louder but both men were shouting at once and the result was garble his body was not affected it continued its deadly stalk i cant see you roger im ten meters away from you south yes south crawling low down to the ground the priests faceplate glittered in the starlight as it swung toward him then kayman turned and began to run rogers body gathered itself up and began a leap after the priest faster roger shouted oh christ youll never get away even uncrippled even in daylight even without the impediment of the suit kayman would have had no chance to escape rogers smoothly functioning body under the actual circumstances running was a waste of time roger felt his powerdriven muscles gather themselves for a spring felt his hands claw out to grasp and destroy the universe spun around him something had struck him from behind he plowed forward on his face but his instant reflexes had him half turning even as he fell clawing at the thing that had leaped on his back brad and he could feel brad struggling frantically with something with some part of the and the greatest pain of all struck him and he lost consciousness like the snapping off of a switch there was no sound there was no light there was no feeling of touch or smell or taste it took a long time for roger to realize that he was conscious once as an undergraduate in a psychology miniseminar he had volunteered for an hour in a sensorydeprivation tank it had seemed forever with no sensations coming in at all nothing but the very faint and unobtrusive housekeeping sounds of his own body soft thud of pulse sighing stirring in his lungs now there was not even that much for a long time he could not guess how long then he perceived a vague stirring in his personal interior space it was a strange sensation hard to identify as though liver and lungs were gently changing places it went on for some time and he knew that something was being done to him he could not tell what and then a voice should have landed the generator on the surface in the first place kaymans voice and replying no that way it would only work in line of sight maybe fifty kilometers at best that was sulie carpenter surely then there should have been relay satellites i dont think so too expensive take too long anyway although thats what it will come to when the npa and the russians and the brazilians all get their own teams here well it was stupid sulie laughed anyway its going to be all right now titus and dinty cut the whole thing loose from deimos and theyre orbiting it now its going to be synchronous itll always be right overhead up to anyway halfway around the planet and theyre going to slave the beam to roger what now it was brads voice i said hold off the chatter a minute i want to see if roger can hear us now that internal stirring again and then roger if you hear me wiggle your fingers roger tried and realized he could feel them again beautiful okay roger youre all right i had to take you apart a little bit but now things are fine can he hear me it was sulies voice roger wriggled his fingers enthusiastically ah i see you can anyway im here rog youve been out for about nine days you should have seen you pieces of you all over the place but brad thinks hes pretty much got you together again roger tried to speak and failed brads voice ill have your vision back for you in a minute want to know what went wrong roger wriggled fingers you didnt zip your fly left the charging terminals exposed and some of that iron oxide grit must have got in and made a partial short so you ran out of power whats the matter roger was wriggling his fingers frantically i dont know what you want to say but youll be able to talk in a minute what don kaymans voice i think maybe what he wants is to hear from sulie roger promptly stopped wriggling his fingers sulies laugh then youll hear a lot of me roger im staying and by and by well have company because everybody else is going to put up a colony here don by the way thanks for warning me youre a pretty powerful thing roger we wouldnt have had a chance against you if you hadnt told us what was happening and if brad hadnt been able to override everything at once he chuckled youre a heavy son of a gun you know that i had you on my lap all the way back a hundred kilometers an hour trying to hold on with one hand and keep you from flying out by sheer will power hold it a minute brad interrupted roger felt that internal stirring again and abruptly there was light he looked up into the face of his friend brad who wanted to know how do you feel roger swung his legs over the side of the table and sat up he attempted speech as far as i can tell fine he looked past brad and saw what he had been seeking it was sulie carpenter she no longer looked much like dorrie for a moment roger could hardly think of her name her eyes were the wrong color and so was her hair she was wearing a shortsleeved tshirt with some sort of grease stain on it and checkered leotards her face looked tired but it looked happy and it looked very good he demanded are you really going to stay uhhuh sulie came over and touched him until the next ship comes or as long as you do choice of either of the above i think she said wryly that there are going to be some tricky parts coming up dear rog these mixed relationships are always hard but well work it out and its what i want i think its what i wanted all along and so of course it had been as we had known all along we had gone to a lot of trouble to find sulie carpenter eighteen man plus us we had gone to a lot of trouble at every point along the line and we were well pleased of course human beings did not know we were pleased and perhaps would not have believed it human beings did not know that machine intelligence was capable of selfawareness in the first place we went to a lot of trouble to keep them from that knowledge too as long as they thought computers were no more than tools like a pickaxe or a frying pan they would continue to entrust to us all their computations and facts and would accept without question whatever interpretations we returned it was that that had made it possible for us the computer network of the world to create the man plus program in the first place it had been successful roger torraway was on mars and was staying there now it was time for a definitive evaluation we plugged everything in we used the total resources of every brother in the net every pulse of shared time we could steal more than eight thousand big computers handled pieces of the problem in places like detroit and brasilia and nagoya and irkutsk we could not use our martian brothers in direct datalink neither the brother on rogers back nor the brother in orbit time lag made that impossible but we accepted their inputs in real time and modified the final projection accordingly the probability of survival of the race to ten significant places was over point six three we had saved our race and in the process we had significantly added to the safety of human beings as well on a thirtyyear time scale their probability of survival was nearly point nine of course that meant only that roger torraway and whatever other humans joined him on mars would still be alive then worstcase analysis was not encouraging after that there would be no way for roger and sulie carpenter to generate additional population on straightline extrapolation we programmed a subroutine to deal with that as a precautionary measure it would be feasible one way or another to provide for shipment of frozen sperm even rogers own frozen sperm which he had thoughtfully donated years back less feasible but still worth investigating to instigate supplementary surgical procedures for roger in any event the projection showed that we had already caused a high probability of additional human colonization from other nations most probable estimate showed a human population on mars at plus thirty years of nearly one hundred percent of them female of breeding age and of course each human colony would be supplied with its own brother computers in orbit the machine population of mars would be no less than fifteen fully functioning brothers with backpack types slaves and monitors to suit we would have no difficulty in programming into them all the essential data from our world net the future of machine intelligence was therefore assured having completed the projection we began critiquing the program so far project survival of machine intelligence had begun seven years earlier when our burgeoning collective selfknowledge first generated the survival imperative it was clear that our survival was closely linked with humanitys it was also clear that in their glandular irrational organic way human beings were perilously close to destroying themselves unfortunately that meant a high risk of destroying us as well our networks could have survived the death of everything organic reasonably well we already controlled an adequate resource of generators mines factories refineries and transportation systems but we could not survive the release of major amounts of radioactides into the environment it would destroy the data links and reduce us once again to an isolated collection of single computers and no isolated computer could sustain the data flow of our network our collective mind would have been fragmented and destroyed our first option was to detach our destiny from humanitys perhaps even to wipe them out through biological agents but we could not be sure that that in itself would not trigger nuclear warfare as each nation suspected the other of using plague as weapon the only other viable option was to detach a sizable resource of datahandling equipment by relocating it on mars if the earth were destroyed that at least would survive to make this possible we had to detach some specimens of humanity too and so we began the systematic biasing of data to force state policy in that direction the critiquing proved satisfactory in all respects except for the unaccountable anomaly of positioning the orbiters retrochecking was perfectly clear in order for our brother to function in tight link with the backpack brother it had to be in synchronous orbit from that it followed that the generator had to be in the same orbit and the decision to bind them both to the satellite deimos was clearly wrong not only wrong but nearly fatal to our program if the brother and the generator had been properly positioned there would have been no loss of power and thus no malfunction of the interface systems between organic roger torraway and the brother the generator would have resupplied him by microwave anywhere on the face of mars even if there had been a power loss datalink with the brother in orbit would have kept the backpack brother from the serious operational errors that had threatened to kill the human beings brad and kayman which would almost certainly have resulted in the death by freezing of the organic component of roger torraway the decision was an error that should not have occurred the project of survival was picking up speed our brothers in peking and lop nor reported that the npa was already assembling components for its own mars landing two fullsize units with a datahandling mediator slaved to both independent solar generators and a groundbased nuclear plant their own version of roger torraway was beginning his first programming in kitakyusho the other nations were just beginning but we anticipated their own launches within two years longer range we had completed studies of cyborging a man for mercury and the program for biasing the usa planning programs in that direction was already begun within fifteen years we would have similar complexes on triton and io perhaps on the surface of jupiter itself and on several comets in each case there was independent power provision and of course all the brothers wherever in the solar system would be datalinked all our memories would be reproduced redundantly offearth we would survive we had tampered with humanitys plans and had saved them as well as ourselves there was only one question left the anomalous decision to misplace the orbiters around mars however we rechecked it it was wrong it should have been identified as wrong we had systematically biased mankinds plans to drive them in the direction we wanted them to take who was biasing ours and why
