the immeasurable horror clark ashton smith i do not mean to boast when i say that cowardice has never been among my failings it would be needless to boast in view of my honorable record as an etherace in six interplanetary expeditions but i tell you that i would not return to venus for any consideration not for all the platinum and radium in its mountainsides nor all the medicinal saps and pollens and vegetable ambergris of its forests there will always be men to imperil their lives and their sanity in the venusian tradingposts and fools who will still try to circumnavigate a world of unearthly dangers but i have done my share and i know that venus was not designed for human nerves or human brains the loathsome multiform fecundity of its overheated jungles ought to be enough for any one not to mention the way in which so many posts have been wholly blotted out between the departure of one spacefreighter and the arrival of the next no venus was not meant for man if you still doubt me listen to my story i was with the first venusian expedition under the leadership of admiral carfax in we were able to make no more than a mere landing and were then compelled to return earthward because of our shortage of oxygen due to a serious miscalculation regarding our needs it was unsafe we found to breathe the thick vaporladen air of venus for more than short intervals and we couldnt afford to make an overdraft on our tanks in we went back more fully equipped for all contingencies this time and landed on a high plateau near the equator this plateau being comparatively free from the noxious flora and fauna of the abysmal steaming jungles was to form the base of our explorations i felt signally honored when admiral carfax put me in charge of the planetary coaster whose various parts had been brought forth from the bowels of the huge ethership and fitted together for local use i richard harmon was only an engineer a third assistant pilot of the spacevessel with no claim whatever to scientific renown and the four men entrusted to my guidance were all experts of international fame they were john ashley botanist aristide rocher geologist robert manville biologist and zoologist and hugo markheim head of the interplanetary survey carfax and the remaining sixteen of our party were to stay with the ethership till we returned and made our report we were to follow the equator landing often for close observations and make if feasible a complete circuit of the planet in our absence a second coaster was to be fitted together in preparation for a longitudinal voyage around the poles the coaster was of that type which is now commonly used for flying at all levels within the terrestrial atmosphere it was made of neonintempered aluminum it was roomy and comfortable with ports of synthetic crystal tougher than steel and could be hermetically closed there were the usual engines run by explosive atomic power and a supplementary set of the old electrosolar turbines in case of emergency the vessel was fitted with heating and refrigerating systems and was armed with electronic machineguns having a fortymile range and we carried for handweapons a plentiful supply of infrared grenades of heattubes and zero tubes not knowing what hostile forms of life we might encounter these weapons were the deadliest ever devised by man and a child could have wiped out whole armies with them but i could smile now at their inadequacy the plateau on which we had landed was far up in a range which we named the purple mountains because they were covered from base to summit with enormous twofoot lichens of a rich tyrian hue there were similarly covered areas in the plateau where the soil was too thin for the sustenance of more elaborate plantforms here among the multitudinous geysers and the horned fantastic peaks that were intermittently visible through a steamcharged atmosphere we had established ourselves in a lichenfield even here we had to wear our refrigerating suits and carry oxygen whenever we stepped out of the ethership for otherwise the heat would have parboiled us in a few minutes and the ultraterrestrial gases in the air would have speedily overpowered us it was a weird business putting the coaster together under such circumstances with our huge inflated suits and masks of green vitrolium we must have looked like a crew of demons toiling in the fumes of gehenna i shall never forget the hour when the five of us who had been chosen for that first voyage said goodbye to admiral carfax and the others and stepped into the coaster somehow there was a greater thrill about it than that which attended the beginning of our trip through sidereal space the miles of our proposed circuit would of course be a mere bagatelle but what marvels and prodigies of unimagined life we might not find if we had only known the truth but indeed it was fortunate that we could not know flying very slowly as near to the ground as was practicable we left the plateau and descended through a long jungleinvaded pass to the equatorial plains sometimes even when we almost grazed the jungletops we were caught in voluminous rolling masses of cloud and sometimes there were spaces where we could see dimly ahead for a few miles or could even discern the whitehot glaring of the dropsical sun that hung perpetually at zenith we could get only a vague idea of the vegetation beneath us it was a blurred mass of bluish and whitish greens of etiolated mauves and saffrons tinged with jade but we could see that many of them had the character of calamites and giant grasses rather than trees for a long while we sought vainly an open space in which to alight and begin our investigations after we had flown on for an hour or two above the serried jungle we crossed a great river that couldnt have been so very far below the boilingpoint to judge from the columns of steam that coiled upward from it here we could measure the height of the jungle for the shores were lined with titanic reeds marked off in ten yard segments that rose for a hundred yards in air and were overshadowed by the palmferns behind them but even here there was no place for us to descend we crossed other rivers some of which would have made the amazon look like a summer creek and we must have gone on for another hour above that fuming everlasting forest ere we came to a clear spot of land we wondered about that clearing even at first sight it was a winding milewide swath in the jungle whose end and beginning were both lost in the vapors the purplish soil seemed to have been freshly cleared and was clean and smooth as if a whole legion of steamrollers had gone over it we were immensely excited thinking that it must be the work of intelligent beings of whom so far we had found no slightest trace i brought the coaster gently down in the clearing close to the jungles edge and donning our refrigerating suits and arming ourselves with heattubes we unscrewed the seven inch crystal of the manhole and emerged the curiosity we felt concerning that clearing was drowned in our wonder before the bordering forest i doubt if i can give you any real idea of what it was like the most exuberant tropic jungle on earth would have been a cornpatch in comparison the sheer fertility of it was stupendous terrifying horrifying everything was overgrown overcrowded with a fulsome rankness that pushed and swelled and mounted even as you watched it life was everywhere seething bursting pullulating rotting i tell you we could actually see it grow and decay like a slow moving picture and the variety of it was a botanists nightmare ashley cursed like a longshoreman when he tried to classify some of the things we found and manville had his problems too for all sorts of novel insects and animals were flopping crawling crashing and flying through the monstrous woods im almost afraid to describe some of those plants the overlooming palm ferns with their poddy fronds of unwholesome mauve were bad enough but the smaller things that grew beneath them or sprouted from their boles and joints half of them were unspeakably parasitic and many were plainly sarcophagous there were bellshaped flowers the size of wine barrels that dripped a paralyzing fluid on anything that passed beneath them and the carcasses of flying lizards and strange legless mammals were rotting in a circle about each of them with the tips of new flowers starting from the putrefaction in which they had been seeded there were vegetable webs in which squirming things had been caught webs that were like a tangle of green hairy ropes there were broad lowlying masses of fungoid white and yellow that yielded like a bog to suck in the unwary creatures that had trodden upon them and there were orchids of madly grotesque types that rooted themselves only in the bodies of living animals so that many of the fauna we saw were adorned with floral parasites even though we were all armed with heattubes we didnt care to go very far in those woods new plants were shooting up all around us and nearly everything both animal and vegetable seemed to have alimentary designs upon us we had to turn our heattubes on the various tendrils and branches that coiled about us and our suits were heavily dusted with the white pollen of carnivorous flowers a pollen that was anaesthetic to the helpless monsters on which it fell once a veritable behemoth with a dinosaurlike head and forelegs loomed above us suddenly from the ferns it had trampled down but fled with screams of deafening thunder when we leveled our heatrays upon it until its armored hide began to sizzle longlegged serpents larger than anacondas were stalking about and they were so vicious and came in such increasing numbers that we found it hard to discourage them so we retreated to the coaster when we came again to the clearing where the soil had been perfectly bare a few minutes before we saw that the tips of new trees and plants were already beginning to cover it at their rate of growth the coaster would have been lost to sight among them in an hour or two we had almost forgotten the enigma of that clearing but now the problem presented itself with renewed force harmon that swath must have been made within the last hour exclaimed manville to me as we climbed back into the vessel behind the others if we follow it i rejoined well soon find who or what is making it are you fellows game for a little sidetrip i had closed the manhole and was now addressing all four of my companions there was no demur from any one though the following of the swath would mean a diagonal divagation from our set course all of us were tense with excitement and curiosity no one could venture a surmise that seemed at all credible concerning the agency that had left a milewide trail and also we were undecided as to the direction of its progress i set the engines running and with that familiar roar of disintegrating carbon atoms in the cylinders beneath us we soared to the level of the ferntops and i steered the coaster in the direction towards which its nose happened to be pointing however we soon found that we were on the wrong track for the new growth below us became disproportionately taller and thicker as the mighty jungle sought to refill the gap that had been cloven through its center so i turned the coaster and we went back in the opposite direction i dont believe we uttered half a dozen words among us as we followed the swath and saw the dwindling of the planttops below till that bare purplish soil reappeared we had no idea what we would find and we were now too excited even for conjecture i will readily admit that i for one felt a little nervous the things we had already seen in the forest together with that formidable recent clearing which no earthly machinery would have made were enough to unsettle the equilibrium of the human system as i have said before i am no coward and i have faced a variety of ultraterrene perils without flinching but already i began to suspect that we were among things which no earthbeing was ever meant to face or even imagine the hideous fertility of that jungle had almost sickened me what then could be the agency that had cleared that jungle away more cleanly than a harvester running through a grainfield i watched the vaporladen scene ahead in the reflector beside me and the others all had their faces glued to the crystalline ports nothing untoward could be seen as yet but i began to notice a slight unaccountable increase of our speed i had not increased the power we had been running slowly at no more than one hundred fifty miles per hour and now we were gaining as if we were borne in the sweep of some tremendous aircurrent or the pull of a magnetic force the vapors had closed in before us now they eddied to each side leaving the landscape visible for many miles i think we all saw the thing simultaneously but no one spoke for a full thirty seconds then manville muttered very softly my god in front no more than a halfmile distant the swath was filled from side to side with a moving mass of livid angleworm pink that rose above the jungletops it was like a sheer cliff before us as we flew toward it we could see that it was moving away from us was creeping onward through the forest the mass gave the impression of a jellyfish consistency it rose and fell expanding and contracting in a slow rhythmic manner with a noticeable deepening of color at each contraction life murmured manville life in an unknown form on a scale that would not be possible in our world the coaster was now rushing toward the wormcoloured mass at more than two hundred miles an hour a moment more and we would have plunged into that palpitating wall i turned the wheel sharply and we veered to the left and rose with an odd sluggishness above the jungle where we could look down that sluggishness worried me after our former headlong speed it was as if we were fighting some new gravitational force of unexpected potency we all had a feeling of actual nausea as we gazed down there were leagues and leagues of that living substance and the farther end was lost in the fuming vapors it was moving faster than a man could run with that horribly regular expansion and contraction as if it were breathing there were no visible limbs or appendages no organs of any distinguishable kind but we knew that the thing was alive and aware fly closer whispered manville horror and scientific fascination contended in his voice i steered diagonally downward and felt an increase of the strange pull against which we were fighting i had to reverse the gears and turn on more power to prevent the vessel from plunging headlong we hung above the pink mass at a hundredyard elevation and watched it it flowed beneath us like an unnatural river in a flat glistening tide voyez cried rocher who preferred to speak in his native tongue though he knew english as well as any of us two flying monsters large as pterodactyls were now circling above the mass not far below us it seemed as if they like the vessel were struggling against a powerful downward attraction through the airtight soundvalves we could hear the thunderous beating of their immense wings as they strove to rise and were drawn gradually toward the pink surface as they neared it the mass rose up in a mighty wave and in the deep mouthlike hollow that formed at the waves bottom a colorless fluid began to exude and collect in a pool then the wave curved over caught the struggling monsters and lapsed again to a level slowly palpitating surface above its prey we waited a little and i realized that the onward flowing of the mass had ceased except for that queer throbbing it was now entirely quiescent but somehow there was a deadly menace in its tranquillity as if the thing were watching or meditating apparently it had no eyes no ears no senseorgans of any sort but i began to get the idea that in some unknowable manner through senses beyond our apprehension it was aware of our presence and was considering us attentively now all at once i saw that the mass was no longer quiescent it had begun to rise toward us very stealthily and gradually in a pyramidal ridge and at the ridges foot even as before a clear transparent pool was gathering the coaster wavered and threatened to fall the magnetic pull whatever it was had grown stronger than ever i turned on fresh power we rose with a painful dragging slowness and the ridge below shot abruptly into a pillar that loomed beside us and toppled over toward the vessel before it could reach us manville had seized the switch that operated one of the machineguns had aimed it at the pillar and released a stream of disintegrative bolts that caused the overhanging menace to vanish like a melting arm of cloud below us the pyramidal base of the truncated pillar writhed and shuddered convulsively and sank back once more into a level surface the coaster soared dizzily as if freed from a retarding weight and reaching what i thought would be a safe elevation we flew along the rim of the mass in an effort to determine its extent and as we flew the thing began to glide along beneath us at its former rate of progress i dont know how many miles of it there were winding on through the monstrous jungle like a glacier of angleworm flesh i tell you the thing made me feel as if my solar plexus had gone wrong there was neither head nor tail to that damnable mass and nothing anywhere that we could identify as special organs it was a weltering sea of protoplasmic cells organized on a scale that staggered all preconceptions of biology manville was nearly out of his senses with excitement and the rest of us were so profoundly shocked and overwhelmed that we began to wonder if the thing were real or were merely an hallucination of nerves disordered by novel and terrific planetary forces well we came to the end of it at last where the pink wave was eating its way through the jungle everything in its path was being crushed down and absorbed the fourhundredfoot ferns the giant grasses the grotesque carnivorous plants and their victims the flying waddling creeping and striding monsters of all types and the thing made so little sound there was a low murmur like that of gently moving water and the snap or swish of trees as they went down but nothing more i guess we might as well go on observed manville regretfully id like to analyze a section of that stuff but weve seen what it can do and i cant ask you to take any chances with the coaster no i agreed theres nothing to be done about it so if you gentlemen are all willing we might as well resume our course i set the vessel back toward the equator at a goodly speed christ that stuff is following us cried manville a minute later he had been watching from a rear port intent on steering forthrightly it had not occurred to me to keep an eye on the thing now i looked into the rear reflector the pink mass had changed its course and was crawling along behind us evidently at an increased rate of progression for otherwise we would have been out of sight by now we all felt pretty creepy i assure you but it seemed ridiculous to imagine that the thing could overtake us even at our moderate speed we were gaining upon it momently and if need be we could treble our rate or soar to higher atmospheric levels but even at that the whole business made a very disagreeable impression before long we plunged into a belt of thick vapors and lost sight of our pursuer we seemed to be traversing a sort of swamp for we caught glimpses of titan reeds and mammoth aquatic plants amid winding stretches of voluminously steaming water we heard the bellow of unknown leviathans and saw the dim craning of their hideous heads on interminable necks as we passed and once the coaster was covered with boiling spray from a marshgeyser or volcano and we flew blindly till we were out of it again then we crossed a lake of burning oil or mineral pitch with flames that were half a mile in height and the temperature rose uncomfortably in spite of our refrigerating system then there were more marshes involved in rolling steam and after an hour or two we emerged from the vapors and another zone of prodigiously luxuriant jungle began to reveal its fronded tops below us flying over that jungle was like moving in a hashish eternity there was no end to it and no change it simply went on and on through a world without limits or horizons and the white vaporous glare of the swollen sun even at zenith became a corroding torture to nerves and brain we all felt a terrific fatigue more from the nervous tax than anything else manville and rocher went to sleep markheim nodded at his post and i began to watch for a place where i could bring the coaster safely down and take a nap myself the vessel would have kept its own course if i had set the gears but i didnt want to miss anything or take any chance of collision with a high mountainrange well it seemed there was no place to land in that interminable bristling wilderness of cyclopean growths we flew on and i grew sleepier and sleepier then through the swirling mists ahead i saw the vague looming of low mountains there were bare needlesharp peaks and long gentle scaurs of a blackish stone almost entirely covered with red and yellow lichens taller than heather it all looked very peaceful and desolate i brought the coaster down on a level shelf of one of the scaurs and fell asleep almost before the heavy thudding of the engines had died i dont know what it was that awakened me but i sat up with a start with a preternaturally distinct awareness that something was wrong i glanced around at my companions who were all slumbering quietly and then i peered into the reflectors where the entire landscape about us was depicted i was unable to believe it for a moment that wormcolored glacier that had crawled up the scarp beneath us and was now hanging over the vessel like a sheer immeasurable flowing precipice it had reached out in mighty arms on either side as if to surround us it seemed to blot out the misty heavens as it hung there pulsing and darkening and all aslaver with rills of a hueless liquid from the mouths that had formed in its front i lost a few precious seconds ere i could start the atomic engines and as the vessel rose the top of that loathsome cliff lengthened out and fell over like the crest of a breaking billow it caught us with a buffeting shock it enveloped us we went down tossing and pitching as into a seatrough and our interior grew dark and blind till i switched on the lights the vessel was now lurching nose downward as that unbelievable wave sucked it in my companions were awake and i shouted halfincoherent orders to them as i turned on the full power of our cylinders and also set the electrosolar turbines going the sides and ceiling of the coaster seemed to bend inward with the pressure as we sought to wrench ourselves free my companions had flown to the machineguns they pumped them incessantly and bolts of electronic force tore like a broadside of lightning into the mass that had engulfed us we tried literally to blast ourselves out with each gun revolving at the widest possible radius i dont know how it was ever done but at last the pressure above us began to give there was a glimmering of light through our rear ports and pitching dizzily we broke loose but even as the light returned something dripped on my bare arms from the ceiling a thin rill of waterclear fluid that seared like vitriol and almost laid me out with the sheer agony as it ate into my flesh i heard someone scream and fall and turning my head saw manville writhing on the floor beneath a steady drip of the same fluid the roof and walls of the coaster were rent in several placesaand some of the rifts were widening momently that execrable liquid which doubtless served as both saliva and digestive juice had been eating the adamantinetempered metal like acid and we had not escaped any too soon the next few minutes were worse than a whole herd of nightmares even with our double enginepower even with the machineguns still tearing at the mass beside us it was a struggle to get away to combat the malign extragravitational magnetism of that hellish lifesubstance and all the while venusian air was pouring in through the rents and our atmosphere was becoming unbreathable also the refrigerating system was half useless now and we sweltered in a steaming inferno till each of us donned his airtight insulative suit in turn while the others held to the guns and the steering manville had ceased to writhe and we saw that he was dead we would not have dared to look at him overlong even if there had been time for half his face and body were eaten away by the corroding liquid we soared gradually till we could look down on the horror that had so nearly devoured us there it was mile on mile of it stretching up the mountainside with the farther end somewhere in the jungle below it seemed impossible in view of the distance we had traversed that the thing was the same lifemass we had met earlier in the day but whatever it was it must have smelt us out somehow and seemingly it didnt mind scaling a mountain to get us or perhaps it was in the habit of climbing mountains anyway it was hard to discourage for our gunfire seemed to make mere pinholes in it that closed up again when the gunners aim shifted and when we started to drop grenades upon it from our hardwon elevation it merely throbbed and heaved a little more vehemently and darkened to a cancerous red as if it were getting angry and when we flew off on the way we had come toward the jungle and the swamp beyond the damnable thing started to flow backward beneath us along the lichenmantled slope evidently it was determined to have us i reeled in the seat with the pain of my seared arms as i held our course we were in no condition to continue the circuit of venus and there was nothing for it but a return to the purple mountains we flew at top speed but that flowing mass of life protoplasm organism or whatever it was fairly raced us at last we got ahead of it where it slithered in milewide devastation through the jungle but not very far ahead at that it hung on interminably and we all grew sick with watching it suddenly we saw that the thing had ceased to follow us and was veering off at a sharp angle what do you make of that cried markheim we were all so amazed by the cessation of pursuit that i halted the vessel and we hung in midair wondering what had happened then we saw another endless mass of a verminlike gray was crawling through the jungle to meet the pink mass the two seemed to rise up in sheer columns like warring serpents as they neared each other then they came together and we could see that they were battling were devouring each other were gaining and losing alternately as they flowed back and forth in a huge area from which all vegetation was speedily blotted at length the pink mass appeared to have won a decisive victory it poured on and on without cease ingesting the other driving it back and we watched no longer but resumed our flight toward the purple mountains i have no very distinct recollection of that flight it is all a blur of incalescent vapors of boundless fuming forests of blazing bitumen lakes and volcanospouting marshes i lived in a reeling eternity of pain sickness vertigo and toward the last a raging delirium in which i was no longer aware of my surroundings except by fits and starts i dont know how i held on how i kept course my subliminal mind must have done it i suppose the others were all pretty sick too and could not have helped me i seemed to be fighting an immeasurable formless monster in that delirium and after a dozen eons of inconclusive combat i came out of it long enough to see that the purple mountains were jutting their horns from the vapors just ahead dimly i steered along the jungletaken pass and across the plateau and the glaring heavens turned to a sea of blackness a sea that fell and bore me down to oblivion as i landed the coaster beside the glimmering bulk of the ethership somehow very tortuously and vaguely i floated out of that sea of blackness i seemed to take hours in regaining full awareness and the process was painful and confusing as if my brain were unwilling to function when i finally came to myself i was lying in my bunk on the ether ship and admiral carfax and the two doctors of the expedition were beside me together with markheim and rocher they told me i had been unconscious for fifty hours my collapse they thought had been partly due to unnatural nervestrain and shock but my arms were both in a terrible state from the ravages of the vitriolic animal fluid that had dripped upon them it had been necessary to amputate my left arm at the elbow and only the most skillful care had saved the other from a like fate my companions though ill to the point of nausea had retained consciousness and had told the story of our unbelievable adventures i dont see how you drove the coaster said carfax this from our reticent and praisesparing chief was an actual brevet my right arm was a long time in healing indeed it never became quite normal again never regained the muscular strength and nervous quickness required for aviation or spaceflying and i wasnt so sorry either my nerves were badly shaken and i was content to let others do their share when the holes in the acideaten coaster had been caulked with metal melted by our heattubes and another exploring party was sent out along the equator we waited for a hundred hours on the plateau in the purple mountains but the coaster didnt return radio communications with it had ceased after the first nine hours the second coaster was put together and went out with admiral carfax himself in charge markheim and rocher also insisted on going along we kept in touch with the vessel till it began to approach the enormous tundras in which the sunlit hemisphere of venus terminates and beyond which are the frozen realms of perpetual twilight and darkness the radio reports were full of incredible things and i wont tell you how many of those moving lifemasses were sighted eating their way through the hideously fertile jungles or crawling out of the steamenveloped venusian seas that gave them birth nothing however was found of the first coaster then the reports ceased and a black horror settled upon us who had remained in the ethership the huge spacevessel was illadapted to horizontal flight within atmospheric levels but we set out anyway and tried to find the coasters though we all knew there could no longer be anything to find i wont detail our trip we all saw enough to turn our stomachs permanently and those horrors of immeasurable life were sweet and charming in comparison with some of the things that our searchlights revealed on the dark side of the planet anyhow we gave it up at last and came back to earth and i for one have been well satisfied to remain on terra firma others can do the exploring and work the venusian mines and plantations i know too well the fate of those lost parties and their vessels and i know what has happened to the warehouses of neomanganese steel that have utterly disappeared and have been replaced by a halfgrown jungle
