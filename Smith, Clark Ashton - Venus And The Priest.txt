venus and the priest by clark ashton smith scene the house of a village priest at midnight the priest himself is revealed in prayer before the crucifix besides a table piled with commentaries and the lives of the saints his features are buried in a shadow such as rembrandt loved to paint but the ochrecoloured light of a dying candle gleams on his heavy hair and on a back and shoulders to whose shapely outlines the black gown has moulded itself in supple curves he bows head with a voiceless prayer whose nature perhaps it were not well to examine overcuriously or surmise with too much confidence suddenly the austere room and the young attractive frame of the priest are suffused with a glare of rosy light that emanates from the midair the crucifix is seen to tremble and totter and recede the room seems to expand the walls to melt away and the heavy cross with burden soars and diminishes to a flying mote lost in immensities of splendor in its place a woman standsa woman fair and voluptuous as the first dreams of puberty and naked as an antique statue her breasts and arms are moulded in the solemn superb inevitable lines of a divine lasciviousness and her hair is like morning on a waterfall her eyes are the sapphires bathed in wine she smiles and in the curve of he r crescent lips ineffable lore is manifest as if an entire kalpa of summers were epitomizes in a single rose with open arms she advances toward the priest who turns in terror and put s the table with its blackbound commentaries between himself and the apparition she pauses but continues to smile the priest saint anthony preserve us who are you venus
