a trivial verse yet these my earlier welcome shared so let the better shield the worse and some might say those ruder songs had freshness which the new have lost to spring the opening leaf belongs the chestnutburs await the frost when those i wrote my locks were brown when these i write ah well aday the autumn thistles silvery down is not the purple bloom of may go little book whose pages hold those garnered years in loving trust how long before your blue and gold shall fade and whiten in the dust o sexton of the alcoved tomb where souls in leathern cerements lie tell me each living poets doom how long before his book shall die it matters little soon or late a day a month a year an age i read oblivion in its date and finis on its titlepage before we sighed our griefs were told before we smiled our joys were sung and all our passions shaped of old in accents lost to mortal tongue in vain a fresher mould we seek can all the varied phrases tell that babels wandering children speak how thrushes sing or lilacs smell caged in the poets lonely heart love wastes unheard its tenderest tone the soul that sings must dwell apart its inward melodies unknown deal gently with us ye who read our largest hope is unfulfilled the promise still outruns the deed the tower but not the spire we build our whitest pearl we never find our ripest fruit we never reach the flowering moments of the mind drop half their petals in our speech these are my blossoms if they wear one streak of morn or evenings glow accept them but to me more fair the buds of song that never blow april earlier poems old ironsides this was the popular name by which the frigate constitution was known the poem was first printed in the boston daily advertiser at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for service i subjoin the paragraph which led to the writing of the poem it is from the advertiser of tuesday september old ironsides it has been affirmed upon good authority that the secretary of the navy has recommended to the board of navy commissioners to dispose of the frigate constitution since it has been understood that such a step was in contemplation we have heard but one opinion expressed and that in decided disapprobation of the measure such a national object of interest so endeared to our national pride as old ironsides is should never by any act of our government cease to belong to the navy so long as our country is to be found upon the map of nations in england it was lately determined by the admiralty to cut the victory a onehundred gun ship which it will be recollected bore the flag of lord nelson at the battle of trafalgar down to a seventyfour but so loud were the lamentations of the people upon the proposed measure that the intention was abandoned we confidently anticipate that the secretary of the navy will in like manner consult the general wish in regard to the constitution and either let her remain in ordinary or rebuild her whenever the public service may require new york journal of commerce the poem was an impromptu outburst of feeling and was published on the next day but one after reading the above paragraph ay tear her tattered ensign down long has it waved on high and many an eye has danced to see that banner in the sky beneath it rung the battle shout and burst the cannons roar the meteor of the ocean air shall sweep the clouds no more her deck once red with heroes blood where knelt the vanquished foe when winds were hurrying oer the flood and waves were white below no more shall feel the victors tread or know the conquered knee the harpies of the shore shall pluck the eagle of the sea oh better that her shattered hulk should sink beneath the wave her thunders shook the mighty deep and there should be her grave nail to the mast her holy flag set every threadbare sail and give her to the god of storms the lightning and the gale the last leaf this poem was suggested by the appearance in one of our streets of a venerable relic of the revolution said to be one of the party who threw the tea overboard in boston harbor he was a fine monumental specimen in his cocked hat and knee breeches with his buckled shoes and his sturdy cane the smile with which i as a young man greeted him meant no disrespect to an honored fellowcitizen whose costume was out of date but whose patriotism never changed with years i do not recall any earlier example of this form of verse which was commended by the fastidious edgar allan poe who made a copy of the whole poem which i have in his own handwriting good abraham lincoln had a great liking for the poem and repeated it from memory to governor andrew as the governor himself told me i saw him once before as he passed by the door and again the pavement stones resound as he totters oer the ground with his cane they say that in his prime ere the pruningknife of time cut him down not a better man was found by the crier on his round through the town but now he walks the streets and he looks at all he meets sad and wan and he shakes his feeble head that it seems as if he said they are gone the mossy marbles rest on the lips that he has prest in their bloom and the names he loved to hear have been carved for many a year on the tomb my grandmamma has said poor old lady she is dead long ago that he had a roman nose and his cheek was like a rose in the snow but now his nose is thin and it rests upon his chin like a staff and a crook is in his back and a melancholy crack in his laugh i know it is a sin for me to sit and grin at him here but the old threecornered hat and the breeches and all that are so queer and if i should live to be the last leaf upon the tree in the spring let them smile as i do now at the old forsaken bough where i cling the cambridge churchyard our ancient church its lowly tower beneath the loftier spire is shadowed when the sunset hour clothes the tall shaft in fire it sinks beyond the distant eye long ere the glittering vane high wheeling in the western sky has faded oer the plain like sentinel and nun they keep their vigil on the green one seems to guard and one to weep the dead that lie between and both roll out so full and near their musics mingling waves they shake the grass whose pennoned spear leans on the narrow graves the stranger parts the flaunting weeds whose seeds the winds have strown so thick beneath the line he reads they shade the sculptured stone the child unveils his clustered brow and ponders for a while the graven willows pendent bough or rudest cherubs smile but what to them the dirge the knell these were the mourners share the sullen clang whose heavy swell throbbed through the beating air the rattling cord the rolling stone the shelving sand that slid and far beneath with hollow tone rung on the coffins lid the slumberers mound grows fresh and green then slowly disappears the mosses creep the gray stones lean earth hides his date and years but long before the onceloved name is sunk or worn away no lip the silent dust may claim that pressed the breathing clay go where the ancient pathway guides see where our sires laid down their smiling babes their cherished brides the patriarchs of the town hast thou a tear for buried love a sigh for transient power all that a century left above go read it in an hour the indians shaft the britons ball the sabres thirsting edge the hot shell shattering in its fall the bayonets rending wedge here scattered death yet seek the spot no trace thine eye can see no altar and they need it not who leave their children free look where the turbid raindrops stand in many a chiselled square the knightly crest the shield the brand of honored names were there alas for every tear is dried those blazoned tablets knew save when the icy marbles side drips with the evening dew or gaze upon yon pillared stone the empty urn of pride there stand the goblet and the sun what need of more beside where lives the memory of the dead who made their tomb a toy whose ashes press that nameless bed go ask the village boy lean oer the slender western wall ye everroaming girls the breath that bids the blossom fall may lift your floating curls to sweep the simple lines that tell an exiles date and doom and sigh for where his daughters dwell they wreathe the strangers tomb and one amid these shades was born beneath this turf who lies once beaming as the summers morn that closed her gentle eyes if sinless angels love as we who stood thy grave beside three seraph welcomes waited thee the daughter sister bride i wandered to thy buried mound when earth was hid below the level of the glaring ground choked to its gates with snow and when with summers flowery waves the lake of verdure rolled as if a sultans whiterobed slaves had scattered pearls and gold nay the soft pinions of the air that lift this trembling tone its breath of love may almost bear to kiss thy funeral stone and now thy smiles have passed away for all the joy they gave may sweetest dews and warmest ray lie on thine early grave when damps beneath and storms above have bowed these fragile towers still oer the graves yon locust grove shall swing its orient flowers and i would ask no mouldering bust if eer this humble line which breathed a sigh oer others dust might call a tear on mine to an insect the katydid is a species of grasshopper found in the united states so called from the sound which it makes worcester i used to hear this insect in providence rhode island but i do not remember hearing it in cambridge massachusetts where i passed my boyhood it is well known in other towns in the neighborhood of boston i love to hear thine earnest voice wherever thou art hid thou testy little dogmatist thou pretty katydid thou mindest me of gentlefolks old gentlefolks are they thou sayst an undisputed thing in such a solemn way thou art a female katydid i know it by the trill that quivers through thy piercing notes so petulant and shrill i think there is a knot of you beneath the hollow tree a knot of spinster katydids do katydids drink tea oh tell me where did katy live and what did katy do and was she very fair and young and yet so wicked too did katy love a naughty man or kiss more cheeks than one i warrant katy did no more than many a kate has done dear me ill tell you all about my fuss with little jane and ann with whom i used to walk so often down the lane and all that tore their locks of black or wet their eyes of blue pray tell me sweetest katydid what did poor katy do ah no the living oak shall crash that stood for ages still the rock shall rend its mossy base and thunder down the hill before the little katydid shall add one word to tell the mystic story of the maid whose name she knows so well peace to the evermurmuring race and when the latest one shall fold in death her feeble wings beneath the autumn sun then shall she raise her fainting voice and lift her drooping lid and then the child of future years shall hear what katy did the dilemma now by the blessed paphian queen who heaves the breast of sweet sixteen by every name i cut on bark before my morning star grew dark by hymens torch by cupids dart by all that thrills the beating heart the bright black eye the melting blue i cannot choose between the two i had a vision in my dreams i saw a row of twenty beams from every beam a rope was hung in every rope a lover swung i asked the hue of every eye that bade each luckless lover die ten shadowy lips said heavenly blue and ten accused the darker hue i asked a matron which she deemed with fairest light of beauty beamed she answered some thought both were fair give her blue eyes and golden hair i might have liked her judgment well but as she spoke she rung the bell and all her girls nor small nor few came marching in their eyes were blue i asked a maiden back she flung the locks that round her forehead hung and turned her eye a glorious one bright as a diamond in the sun on me until beneath its rays i felt as if my hair would blaze she liked all eyes but eyes of green she looked at me what could she mean ah many lids love lurks between nor heeds the coloring of his screen and when his random arrows fly the victim falls but knows not why gaze not upon his shield of jet the shaft upon the string is set look not beneath his azure veil though every limb were cased in mail well both might make a martyr break the chain that bound him to the stake and both with but a single ray can melt our very hearts away and both when balanced hardly seem to stir the scales or rock the beam but that is dearest all the while that wears for us the sweetest smile my aunt my aunt my dear unmarried aunt long years have oer her flown yet still she strains the aching clasp that binds her virgin zone i know it hurts her though she looks as cheerful as she can her waist is ampler than her life for life is but a span my aunt my poor deluded aunt her hair is almost gray why will she train that winter curl in such a springlike way how can she lay her glasses down and say she reads as well when through a double convex lens she just makes out to spell her father grandpapa i forgive this erring lip its smiles vowed she should make the finest girl within a hundred miles he sent her to a stylish school t was in her thirteenth june and with her as the rules required two towels and a spoon they braced my aunt against a board to make her straight and tall they laced her up they starved her down to make her light and small they pinched her feet they singed her hair they screwed it up with pins oh never mortal suffered more in penance for her sins so when my precious aunt was done my grandsire brought her back by daylight lest some rabid youth might follow on the track ah said my grandsire as he shook some powder in his pan what could this lovely creature do against a desperate man alas nor chariot nor barouche nor bandit cavalcade tore from the trembling fathers arms his allaccomplished maid for her how happy had it been and heaven had spared to me to see one sad ungathered rose on my ancestral tree reflections of a proud pedestrian i saw the curl of his waving lash and the glance of his knowing eye and i knew that he thought he was cutting a dash as his steed went thundering by and he may ride in the rattling gig or flourish the stanhope gay and dream that he looks exceeding big to the people that walk in the way but he shall think when the night is still on the stableboys gathering numbers and the ghost of many a veteran bill shall hover around his slumbers the ghastly dun shall worry his sleep and constables cluster around him and he shall creep from the woodhole deep where their spectre eyes have found him ay gather your reins and crack your thong and bid your steed go faster he does not know as he scrambles along that he has a fool for his master and hurry away on your lonely ride nor deign from the mire to save me i will paddle it stoutly at your side with the tandem that nature gave me daily trials by a sensitive man oh there are times when all this fret and tumult that we hear do seem more stale than to the sextons ear his own dull chimes ding dong ding dong the world is in a simmer like a sea over a pent volcano woe is me all the day long from crib to shroud nurse oer our cradles screameth lullaby and friends in boots tramp round us as we die snuffling aloud at mornings call the smallvoiced pugdog welcomes in the sun and fleabit mongrels wakening one by one give answer all when evening dim draws round us then the lonely caterwaul tart solo sour duet and general squall these are our hymn women with tongues like polar needles ever on the jar men plugless wordspouts whose deep fountains are within their lungs children with drums strapped round them by the fond paternal ass peripatetics with a blade of grass between their thumbs vagrants whose arts have caged some devil in their mad machine which grinding squeaks with husky groans between come out by starts cockneys that kill thin horses of a sunday men with clams hoarse as young bisons roaring for their dams from hill to hill soldiers with guns making a nuisance of the blessed air childcrying bellmen children in despair screeching for buns storms thunders waves howl crash and bellow till ye get your fill ye sometimes rest men never can be still but in their graves evening by a tailor day hath put on his jacket and around his burning bosom buttoned it with stars here will i lay me on the velvet grass that is like padding to earths meagre ribs and hold communion with the things about me ah me how lovely is the golden braid that binds the skirt of nights descending robe the thin leaves quivering on their silken threads do make a music like to rustling satin as the light breezes smooth their downy nap ha what is this that rises to my touch so like a cushion can it be a cabbage it is it is that deeply injured flower which boys do flout us with but yet i love thee thou giant rose wrapped in a green surtout doubtless in eden thou didst blush as bright as these thy puny brethren and thy breath sweetened the fragrance of her spicy air but now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau stripped of his gaudy hues and essences and growing portly in his sober garments is that a swan that rides upon the water oh no it is that other gentle bird which is the patron of our noble calling i well remember in my early years when these young hands first closed upon a goose i have a scar upon my thimble finger which chronicles the hour of young ambition my father was a tailor and his father and my sires grandsire all of them were tailors they had an ancient goose it was an heirloom from some remoter tailor of our race it happened i did see it on a time when none was near and i did deal with it and it did burn me oh most fearfully it is a joy to straighten out ones limbs and leap elastic from the level counter leaving the petty grievances of earth the breaking thread the din of clashing shears and all the needles that do wound the spirit for such a pensive hour of soothing silence kind nature shuffling in her loose undress lays bare her shady bosom i can feel with all around me i can hail the flowers that sprig earths mantle and yon quiet bird that rides the stream is to me as a brother the vulgar know not all the hidden pockets where nature stows away her loveliness but this unnatural posture of the legs cramps my extended calves and i must go where i can coil them in their wonted fashion the dorchester giant the puddingstone is a remarkable conglomerate found very abundantly in the towns mentioned all of which are in the neighborhood of boston we used in those primitive days to ask friends to ride with us when we meant to take them to drive with us there was a giant in time of old a mighty one was he he had a wife but she was a scold so he kept her shut in his mammoth fold and he had children three it happened to be an election day and the giants were choosing a king the people were not democrats then they did not talk of the rights of men and all that sort of thing then the giant took his children three and fastened them in the pen the children roared quoth the giant be still and dorchester heights and milton hill rolled back the sound again then he brought them a pudding stuffed with plums as big as the statehouse dome quoth he there s something for you to eat so stop your mouths with your lection treat and wait till your dad comes home so the giant pulled him a chestnut stout and whittled the boughs away the boys and their mother set up a shout said he you re in and you cant get out bellow as loud as you may off he went and he growled a tune as he strode the fields along t is said a buffalo fainted away and fell as cold as a lump of clay when he heard the giants song but whether the story s true or not it is nt for me to show there s many a thing that s twice as queer in somebodys lectures that we hear and those are true you know what are those lone ones doing now the wife and the children sad oh they are in a terrible rout screaming and throwing their pudding about acting as they were mad they flung it over to roxbury hills they flung it over the plain and all over milton and dorchester too great lumps of pudding the giants threw they tumbled as thick as rain giant and mammoth have passed away for ages have floated by the suet is hard as a marrowbone and every plum is turned to a stone but there the puddings lie and if some pleasant afternoon you ll ask me out to ride the whole of the story i will tell and you shall see where the puddings fell and pay for the punch beside to the portrait of a lady in the athenaeum gallery well miss i wonder where you live i wonder whats your name i wonder how you came to be in such a stylish frame perhaps you were a favorite child perhaps an only one perhaps your friends were not aware you had your portrait done yet you must be a harmless soul i cannot think that sin would care to throw his loaded dice with such a stake to win i cannot think you would provoke the poets wicked pen or make young women bite their lips or ruin fine young men pray did you ever hear my love of boys that go about who for a very trifling sum will snip ones picture out im not averse to red and white but all things have their place i think a profile cut in black would suit your style of face i love sweet features i will own that i should like myself to see my portrait on a wall or bust upon a shelf but nature sometimes makes one up of such sad odds and ends it really might be quite as well hushed up among ones friends the comet the comet he is on his way and singing as he flies the whizzing planets shrink before the spectre of the skies ah well may regal orbs burn blue and satellites turn pale ten million cubic miles of head ten billion leagues of tail on on by whistling spheres of light he flashes and he flames he turns not to the left nor right he asks them not their names one spurn from his demoniac heel away away they fly where darkness might be bottled up and sold for tyrian dye and what would happen to the land and how would look the sea if in the bearded devils path our earth should chance to be full hot and high the sea would boil full red the forests gleam methought i saw and heard it all in a dyspeptic dream i saw a tutor take his tube the comets course to spy i heard a scream the gathered rays had stewed the tutors eye i saw a fort the soldiers all were armed with goggles green pop cracked the guns whiz flew the balls bang went the magazine i saw a poet dip a scroll each moment in a tub i read upon the warping back the dream of beelzebub he could not see his verses burn although his brain was fried and ever and anon he bent to wet them as they dried i saw the scalding pitch roll down the crackling sweating pines and streams of smoke like waterspouts burst through the rumbling mines i asked the firemen why they made such noise about the town they answered not but all the while the brakes went up and down i saw a roasting pullet sit upon a baking egg i saw a cripple scorch his hand extinguishing his leg i saw nine geese upon the wing towards the frozen pole and every mothers gosling fell crisped to a crackling coal i saw the ox that browsed the grass writhe in the blistering rays the herbage in his shrinking jaws was all a fiery blaze i saw huge fishes boiled to rags bob through the bubbling brine and thoughts of supper crossed my soul i had been rash at mine strange sights strange sounds oh fearful dream its memory haunts me still the steaming sea the crimson glare that wreathed each wooded hill stranger if through thy reeling brain such midnight visions sweep spare spare oh spare thine evening meal and sweet shall be thy sleep the musicgrinders there are three ways in which men take ones money from his purse and very hard it is to tell which of the three is worse but all of them are bad enough to make a body curse youre riding out some pleasant day and counting up your gains a fellow jumps from out a bush and takes your horses reins another hints some words about a bullet in your brains its hard to meet such pressing friends in such a lonely spot its very hard to lose your cash but harder to be shot and so you take your wallet out though you would rather not perhaps youre going out to dine some odious creature begs youll hear about the cannonball that carried off his pegs and says it is a dreadful thing for men to lose their legs he tells you of his starving wife his children to be fed poor little lovely innocents all clamorous for bread and so you kindly help to put a bachelor to bed youre sitting on your windowseat beneath a cloudless moon you hear a sound that seems to wear the semblance of a tune as if a broken fife should strive to drown a cracked bassoon and nearer nearer still the tide of music seems to come theres something like a human voice and something like a drum you sit in speechless agony until your ear is numb poor home sweet home should seem to be a very dismal place your auld acquaintance all at once is altered in the face their discords sting through burns and moore like hedgehogs dressed in lace you think they are crusaders sent from some infernal clime to pluck the eyes of sentiment and dock the tail of rhyme to crack the voice of melody and break the legs of time but hark the air again is still the music all is ground and silence like a poultice comes to heal the blows of sound it cannot be it is it is a hat is going round no pay the dentist when he leaves a fracture in your jaw and pay the owner of the bear that stunned you with his paw and buy the lobster that has had your knuckles in his claw but if you are a portly man put on your fiercest frown and talk about a constable to turn them out of town then close your sentence with an oath and shut the window down and if you are a slender man not big enough for that or if you cannot make a speech because you are a flat go very quietly and drop a button in the hat the treadmill song the stars are rolling in the sky the earth rolls on below and we can feel the rattling wheel revolving as we go then tread away my gallant boys and make the axle fly why should not wheels go round about like planets in the sky wake up wake up my ducklegged man and stir your solid pegs arouse arouse my gawky friend and shake your spider legs what though youre awkward at the trade theres time enough to learn so lean upon the rail my lad and take another turn theyve built us up a noble wall to keep the vulgar out weve nothing in the world to do but just to walk about so faster now you middle men and try to beat the ends its pleasant work to ramble round among ones honest friends here tread upon the long mans toes he shant be lazy here and punch the little fellows ribs and tweak that lubbers ear hes lost them both dont pull his hair because he wears a scratch but poke him in the further eye that is nt in the patch hark fellows there s the supperbell and so our work is done its pretty sport suppose we take a round or two for fun if ever they should turn me out when i have better grown now hang me but i mean to have a treadmill of my own the september gale this tremendous hurricane occurred on the d of september i remember it well being then seven years old a full account of it was published i think in the records of the american academy of arts and sciences some of my recollections are given in the seasons an article to be found in a book of mine entitled pages from an old volume of life im not a chicken i have seen full many a chill september and though i was a youngster then that gale i well remember the day before my kitestring snapped and i my kite pursuing the wind whisked off my palmleaf hat for me two storms were brewing it came as quarrels sometimes do when married folks get clashing there was a heavy sigh or two before the fire was flashing a little stir among the clouds before they rent asunder a little rocking of the trees and then came on the thunder lord how the ponds and rivers boiled they seemed like bursting craters and oaks lay scattered on the ground as if they were ptaters and all above was in a howl and all below a clatter the earth was like a fryingpan or some such hissing matter it chanced to be our washingday and all our things were drying the storm came roaring through the lines and set them all a flying i saw the shirts and petticoats go riding off like witches i lost ah bitterly i wept i lost my sunday breeches i saw them straddling through the air alas too late to win them i saw them chase the clouds as if the devil had been in them they were my darlings and my pride my boyhoods only riches farewell farewell i faintly cried my breeches oh my breeches that night i saw them in my dreams how changed from what i knew them the dews had steeped their faded threads the winds had whistled through them i saw the wide and ghastly rents where demon claws had torn them a hole was in their amplest part as if an imp had worn them i have had many happy years and tailors kind and clever but those young pantaloons have gone forever and forever and not till fate has cut the last of all my earthly stitches this aching heart shall cease to mourn my loved my longlost breeches the height of the ridiculous i wrote some lines once on a time in wondrous merry mood and thought as usual men would say they were exceeding good they were so queer so very queer i laughed as i would die albeit in the general way a sober man am i i called my servant and he came how kind it was of him to mind a slender man like me he of the mighty limb these to the printer i exclaimed and in my humorous way i added as a trifling jest therell be the devil to pay he took the paper and i watched and saw him peep within at the first line he read his face was all upon the grin he read the next the grin grew broad and shot from ear to ear he read the third a chuckling noise i now began to hear the fourth he broke into a roar the fifth his waistband split the sixth he burst five buttons off and tumbled in a fit ten days and nights with sleepless eye i watched that wretched man and since i never dare to write as funny as i can the last reader i sometimes sit beneath a tree and read my own sweet songs though naught they may to others be each humble line prolongs a tone that might have passed away but for that scarce remembered lay i keep them like a lock or leaf that some dear girl has given frail record of an hour as brief as sunset clouds in heaven but spreading purple twilight still high over memorys shadowed hill they lie upon my pathway bleak those flowers that once ran wild as on a fathers careworn cheek the ringlets of his child the golden mingling with the gray and stealing half its snows away what care i though the dust is spread around these yellow leaves or oer them his sarcastic thread oblivions insect weaves though weeds are tangled on the stream it still reflects my mornings beam and therefore love i such as smile on these neglected songs nor deem that flatterys needless wile my opening bosom wrongs for who would trample at my side a few pale buds my gardens pride it may be that my scanty ore long years have washed away and where were golden sands before is naught but common clay still something sparkles in the sun for memory to look back upon and when my name no more is heard my lyre no more is known still let me like a winters bird in silence and alone fold over them the weary wing once flashing through the dews of spring yes let my fancy fondly wrap my youth in its decline and riot in the rosy lap of thoughts that once were mine and give the worm my little store when the last reader reads no more poetry a metrical essay read before the phi beta kappa society harvard university august to charles wentworth upham the following metrical essay is affectionately inscribed this academic poem presents the simple and partial views of a young person trained after the schools of classical english verse as represented by pope goldsmith and campbell with whose lines his memory was early stocked it will be observed that it deals chiefly with the constructive side of the poets function that which makes him a poet is not the power of writing melodious rhymes it is not the possession of ordinary human sensibilities nor even of both these qualities in connection with each other i should rather say if i were now called upon to define it it is the power of transfiguring the experiences and shows of life into an aspect which comes from his imagination and kindles that of others emotion is its stimulus and language furnishes its expression but these are not all as some might infer was the doctrine of the poem before the reader a common mistake made by young persons who suppose themselves to have the poetical gift is that their own spiritual exaltation finds a true expression in the conventional phrases which are borrowed from the voices of the singers whose inspiration they think they share looking at this poem as an expression of some aspects of the ars poetica with some passages which i can read even at this mature period of life without blushing for them it may stand as the most serious representation of my early efforts intended as it was for public delivery many of its paragraphs may betray the fact by their somewhat rhetorical and sonorous character scenes of my youth awake its slumbering fire ye winds of memory sweep the silent lyre ray of the past if yet thou canst appear break through the clouds of fancys waning year chase from her breast the thin autumnal snow if leaf or blossom still is fresh below long have i wandered the returning tide brought back an exile to his cradles side and as my bark her timeworn flag unrolled to greet the landbreeze with its faded fold so in remembrance of my boyhoods time i lift these ensigns of neglected rhyme oh more than blest that all my wanderings through my anchor falls where first my pennons flew the morning light which rains its quivering beams wide oer the plains the summits and the streams in one broad blaze expands its golden glow on all that answers to its glance below yet changed on earth each far reflected ray braids with fresh hues the shining brow of day now clothed in blushes by the painted flowers tracks on their cheeks the rosyfingered hours now lost in shades whose dark entangled leaves drip at the noontide from their pendent eaves fades into gloom or gleams in light again from every dewdrop on the jewelled plain we like the leaf the summit or the wave reflect the light our common nature gave but every sunbeam falling from her throne wears on our hearts some coloring of our own chilled in the slave and burning in the free like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea lost like the lightning in the sullen clod or shedding radiance like the smiles of god pure pale in virtue as the star above or quivering roseate on the leaves of love glaring like noontide where it glows upon ambitions sands the desert in the sun or soft suffusing oer the varied scene lifes common coloring intellectual green thus heaven repeating its material plan arched over all the rainbow mind of man but he who blind to universal laws sees but effects unconscious of their cause believes each image in itself is bright not robed in drapery of reflected light is like the rustic who amidst his toil has found some crystal in his meagre soil and lost in rapture thinks for him alone earth worked her wonders on the sparkling stone nor dreams that nature with as nice a line carved countless angles through the boundless mine thus err the many who entranced to find unwonted lustre in some clearer mind believe that genius sets the laws at naught which chain the pinions of our wildest thought untaught to measure with the eye of art the wandering fancy or the wayward heart who match the little only with the less and gaze in rapture at its slight excess proud of a pebble as the brightest gem whose light might crown an emperors diadem and most of all the pure ethereal fire which seems to radiate from the poets lyre is to the world a mystery and a charm an aegis wielded on a mortals arm while reason turns her dazzled eye away and bows her sceptre to her subjects sway and thus the poet clothed with godlike state usurped his makers title to create he whose thoughts differing not in shape but dress what others feel more fitly can express sits like the maniac on his fancied throne peeps through the bars and calls the world his own there breathes no being but has some pretence to that fine instinct called poetic sense the rudest savage roaming through the wild the simplest rustic bending oer his child the infant listening to the warbling bird the mother smiling at its halfformed word the boy uncaged who tracks the fields at large the girl turned matron to her babelike charge the freeman casting with unpurchased hand the vote that shakes the turret of the land the slave who slumbering on his rusted chain dreams of the palmtrees on his burning plain the hotcheeked reveller tossing down the wine to join the chorus pealing auld lang syne the gentle maid whose azure eye grows dim while heaven is listening to her evening hymn the jewelled beauty when her steps draw near the circling dance and dazzling chandelier een trembling age when springs renewing air waves the thin ringlets of his silvered hair all all are glowing with the inward flame whose wider halo wreathes the poets name while unenbalmed the silent dreamer dies his memory passing with his smiles and sighs if glorious visions born for all mankind the bright auroras of our twilight mind if fancies varying as the shapes that lie stained on the windows of the sunset sky if hopes that beckon with delusive gleams till the eye dances in the void of dreams if passions following with the winds that urge earths wildest wanderer to her farthest verge if these on all some transient hours bestow of rapture tingling with its hectic glow then all are poets and if earth had rolled her myriad centuries and her doom were told each moaning billow of her shoreless wave would wail its requiem oer a poets grave if to embody in a breathing word tones that the spirit trembled when it heard to fix the image all unveiled and warm and carve in language its ethereal form so pure so perfect that the lines express no meagre shrinking no unlaced excess to feel that art in living truth has taught ourselves reflected in the sculptured thought if this alone bestow the right to claim the deathless garland and the sacred name then none are poets save the saints on high whose harps can murmur all that words deny but though to none is granted to reveal in perfect semblance all that each may feel as withered flowers recall forgotten love so warmed to life our faded passions move in every line where kindling fancy throws the gleam of pleasures or the shade of woes when schooled by time the stately queen of art had smoothed the pathways leading to the heart assumed her measured tread her solemn tone and round her courts the clouds of fable thrown the wreaths of heaven descended on her shrine and wondering earth proclaimed the muse divine yet if her votaries had but dared profane the mystic symbols of her sacred reign how had they smiled beneath the veil to find what slender threads can chain the mighty mind poets like painters their machinery claim and verse bestows the varnish and the frame our grating english whose teutonic jar shakes the racked axle of arts rattling car fits like mosaic in the lines that gird fast in its place each manyangled word from saxon lips anacreons numbers glide as once they melted on the teian tide and fresh transfused the iliad thrills again from albions cliffs as oer achaias plain the proud heroic with its pulselike beat rings like the cymbals clashing as they meet the sweet spenserian gathering as it flows sweeps gently onward to its dying close where waves on waves in long succession pour till the ninth billow melts along the shore the lonely spirit of the mournful lay which lives immortal as the verse of gray in sable plumage slowly drifts along on eagle pinion through the air of song the glittering lyric bounds elastic by with flashing ringlets and exulting eye while every image in her airy whirl gleams like a diamond on a dancing girl born with mankind with mans expanded range and varying fates the poets numbers change thus in his history may we hope to find some clearer epochs of the poets mind as from the cradle of its birth we trace slow wandering forth the patriarchal race i when the green earth beneath the zephyrs wing wears on her breast the varnished buds of spring when the loosed current as its folds uncoil slides in the channels of the mellowed soil when the young hyacinth returns to seek the air and sunshine with her emerald beak when the light snowdrops starting from their cells hang each pagoda with its silver bells when the frail willow twines her trailing bow with pallid leaves that sweep the soil below when the broad elm sole empress of the plain whose circling shadow speaks a centurys reign wreathes in the clouds her regal diadem a forest waving on a single stem then mark the poet though to him unknown the quaintmouthed titles such as scholars own see how his eye in ecstasy pursues the steps of nature tracked in radiant hues nay in thyself whateer may be thy fate pallid with toil or surfeited with state mark how thy fancies with the vernal rose awake all sweetness from their long repose then turn to ponder oer the classic page traced with the idyls of a greener age and learn the instinct which arose to warm arts earliest essay and her simplest form to themes like these her narrow path confined the firstborn impulse moving in the mind in vales unshaken by the trumpets sound where peaceful labor tills his fertile ground the silent changes of the rolling years marked on the soil or dialled on the spheres the crested forests and the colored flowers the dewy grottos and the blushing bowers these and their guardians who with liquid names strephons and chloes melt in mutual flames woo the young muses from their mountain shade to make arcadias in the lonely glade nor think they visit only with their smiles the fabled valleys and elysian isles he who is wearied of his village plain may roam the edens of the world in vain t is not the starcrowned cliff the cataracts flow the softer foliage or the greener glow the lake of sapphire or the sparhung cave the brighter sunset or the broader wave can warm his heart whom every wind has blown to every shore forgetful of his own home of our childhood how affection clings and hovers round thee with her seraph wings dearer thy hills though clad in autumn brown than fairest summits which the cedars crown sweeter the fragrance of thy summer breeze than all arabia breathes along the seas the strangers gale wafts home the exiles sigh for the hearts temple is its own blue sky oh happiest they whose early love unchanged hopes undissolved and friendship unestranged tired of their wanderings still can deign to see love hopes and friendship centring all in thee and thou my village as again i tread amidst thy living and above thy dead though some fair playmates guard with charter fears their cheeks grown holy with the lapse of years though with the dust some reverend locks may blend where lifes last milestone marks the journeys end on every bud the changing year recalls the brightening glance of morning memory falls still following onward as the months unclose the balmy lilac or the bridal rose and still shall follow till they sink once more beneath the snowdrifts of the frozen shore as when my bark long tossing in the gale furled in her port her tempestrended sail what shall i give thee can a simple lay flung on thy bosom like a girls bouquet do more than deck thee for an idle hour then fall unheeded fading like the flower yet when i trod with footsteps wild and free the crackling leaves beneath yon lindentree panting from play or dripping from the stream how bright the visions of my boyish dream or modest charles along thy broken edge black with soft ooze and fringed with arrowy sedge as once i wandered in the morning sun with reeking sandal and superfluous gun how oft as fancy whispered in the gale thou wast the avon of her flattering tale ye hills whose foliage fretted on the skies prints shadowy arches on their evening dyes how should my song with holiest charm invest each dark ravine and forestlifting crest how clothe in beauty each familiar scene till all was classic on my native green as the drained fountain filled with autumn leaves the field swept naked of its garnered sheaves so wastes at noon the promise of our dawn the springs all choking and the harvest gone yet hear the lay of one whose natal star still seemed the brightest when it shone afar whose cheek grown pallid with ungracious toil glows in the welcome of his parent soil and ask no garlands sought beyond the tide but take the leaflets gathered at your side ii but times were changed the torch of terror came to light the summits with the beacons flame the streams ran crimson the tall mountain pines rose a new forest oer embattled lines the bloodless sickle lent the warriors steel the harvest bowed beneath his chariot wheel where late the wooddove sheltered her repose the raven waited for the conflicts close the cuirassed sentry walked his sleepless round where daphne smiled or amaryllis frowned where timid minstrels sung their blushing charms some wild tyrtaeus called aloud to arms when glory wakes when fiery spirits leap roused by her accents from their tranquil sleep the ray that flashes from the soldiers crest lights as it glances in the poets breast not in pale dreamers whose fantastic lay toys with smooth trifles like a child at play but men who act the passions they inspire who wave the sabre as they sweep the lyre ye mild enthusiasts whose pacific frowns are lost like dewdrops caught in burning towns pluck as ye will the radiant plumes of fame break caesars bust to make yourselves a name but if your country bares the avengers blade for wrongs unpunished or for debts unpaid when the roused nation bids her armies form and screams her eagle through the gathering storm when from your ports the bannered frigate rides her black bows scowling to the crested tides your hour has past in vain your feeble cry as the babes wailings to the thundering sky scourge of mankind with all the dread array that wraps in wrath thy desolating way as the wild tempest wakes the slumbering sea thou only teachest all that man can be alike thy tocsin has the power to charm the toilknit sinews of the rustics arm or swell the pulses in the poets veins and bid the nations tremble at his strains the city slept beneath the moonbeams glance her white walls gleaming through the vines of france and all was hushed save where the footsteps fell on some high tower of midnight sentinel but one still watched no selfencircled woes chased from his lids the angel of repose he watched he wept for thoughts of bitter years bowed his dark lashes wet with burning tears his countrys sufferings and her childrens shame streamed oer his memory like a forests flame each treasured insult each remembered wrong rolled through his heart and kindled into song his taper faded and the morning gales swept through the world the warsong of marseilles now while around the smiles of peace expand and plentys wreaths festoon the laughing land while france ships outward her reluctant ore and half our navy basks upon the shore from ruder themes our meekeyed muses turn to crown with roses their enamelled urn if eer again return those awful days whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacons blaze whose grass was trampled by the soldiers heel whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain to rend the silence of our tented plain when gallias flag its triple fold displays her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise when round the german close the warclouds dim far through their shadows floats his battlehymn when crowned with joy the camps of england ring a thousand voices shout god save the king when victory follows with our eagles glance our nations anthem pipes a country dance some prouder muse when comes the hour at last may shake our hillsides with her bugleblast not ours the task but since the lyric dress relieves the statelier with its sprightliness hear an old song which some perchance have seen in stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine there was an hour when patriots dared profane the mast that britain strove to bow in vain and one who listened to the tale of shame whose heart still answered to that sacred name whose eye still followed oer his countrys tides thy glorious flag our brave old ironsides from yon lone attic on a smiling morn thus mocked the spoilers with his schoolboy scorn iii when florid peace resumed her golden reign and arts revived and valleys bloomed again while war still panted on hisbroken blade once more the muse her heavenly wing essayed rude was the song some ballad stern and wild lulled the light slumbers of the soldiers child or young romancer with his threatening glance and fearful fables of his bloodless lance scared the soft fancy of the clinging girls whose snowy fingers smoothed his raven curls but when long years the stately form had bent and faithless memory her illusions lent so vast the outlines of tradition grew that history wondered at the shapes she drew and veiled at length their too ambitious hues beneath the pinions of the epic muse far swept her wing for stormier days had brought with darker passions deeper tides of thought the camps harsh tumult and the conflicts glow the thrill of triumph and the gasp of woe the tender parting and the glad return the festal banquet and the funeral urn and all the drama which at once uprears its spectral shadows through the clash of spears from camp and field to echoing verse transferred swelled the proud song that listening nations heard why floats the amaranth in eternal bloom oer iliums turrets and achilles tomb why lingers fancy where the sunbeams smile on circes gardens and calypsos isle why follows memory to the gate of troy her plumed defender and his trembling boy lo the blind dreamer kneeling on the sand to trace these records with his doubtful hand in fabled tones his own emotion flows and other lips repeat his silent woes in hectors infant see the babes that shun those deathlike eyes unconscious of the sun or in his hero hear himself implore give me to see and ajax asks no more thus live undying through the lapse of time the solemn legends of the warriors clime like egypts pyramid or paestums fane they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain yet not like them for time by slow degrees saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile but arts fair fabric strengthening as it rears its laurelled columns through the mist of years as the blue arches of the bending skies still gird the torrent following as it flies spreads with the surges bearing on mankind its starred pavilion oer the tides of mind in vain the patriot asks some lofty lay to dress in state our wars of yesterday the classic days those mothers of romance that roused a nation for a womans glance the age of mystery with its hoarded power that girt the tyrant in his storied tower have passed and faded like a dream of youth and riper eras ask for historys truth on other shores above their mouldering towns in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns pride in its aisles and paupers at the door which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore simple and frail our lowly temples throw their slender shadows on the paths below scarce steal the winds that sweep his woodland tracks the larchs perfume from the settlers axe ere like a vision of the morning air his slight framed steeple marks the house of prayer its planks all reeking and its paint undried its rafters sprouting on the shady side it sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves yet faiths pure hymn beneath its shelter rude breathes out as sweetly to the tangled wood as where the rays through pictured glories pour on marble shaft and tessellated floor heaven asks no surplice round the heart that feels and all is holy where devotion kneels thus on the soil the patriots knee should bend which holds the dust once living to defend whereer the hireling shrinks before the free each pass becomes a new thermopylae whereer the battles of the brave are won there every mountain looks on marathon our fathers live they guard in glory still the grassgrown bastions of the fortressed hill still ring the echoes of the trampled gorge with god and freedom england and saint george the royal cipher on the captured gun mocks the sharp nightdews and the blistering sun the redcross banner shades its captors bust its folds still loaded with the conflicts dust the drum suspended by its tattered marge once rolled and rattled to the hessians charge the stars have floated from britannias mast the redcoats trumpets blown the rebels blast point to the summits where the brave have bled where every village claims its glorious dead say when their bosoms met the bayonets shock their only corselet was the rustic frock say when they mustered to the gathering horn the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn yet when their leader bade his lines advance no musket wavered in the lions glance say when they fainted in the forced retreat they tracked the snowdrifts with their bleeding feet yet still their banners tossing in the blast bore ever ready faithful to the last through storm and battle till they waved again on yorktowns hills and saratogas plain then if so fierce the insatiate patriots flame truth looks too pale and history seems too tame bid him await some new columbiads page to gild the tablets of an iron age and save his tears which yet may fall upon some fabled field some fancied washington iv but once again from their aeolian cave the winds of genius wandered on the wave tired of the scenes the timid pencil drew sick of the notes the sounding clarion blew sated with heroes who had worn so long the shadowy plumage of historic song the newborn poet left the beaten course to track the passions to their living source then rose the drama and the world admired her varied page with deeper thought inspired bound to no clime for passions throb is one in greenlands twilight or in indias sun born for no age for all the thoughts that roll in the dark vortex of the stormy soul unchained in song no freezing years can tame god gave them birth and man is still the same so full on life her magic mirror shone her sister arts paid tribute to her throne one reared her temple one her canvas warmed and music thrilled while eloquence informed the weary rustic left his stinted task for smiles and tears the dagger and the mask the sage turned scholar half forgot his lore to be the woman he despised before oer sense and thought she threw her golden chain and time the anarch spares her deathless reign thus lives medea in our tamer age as when her buskin pressed the grecian stage not in the cells where frigid learning delves in aldine folios mouldering on their shelves but breathing burning in the glittering throng whose thousand bravoes roll untired along circling and spreading through the gilded halls from londons galleries to san carlos walls thus shall he live whose more than mortal name mocks with its ray the pallid torch of fame so proudly lifted that it seems afar no earthly pharos but a heavenly star who unconfined to arts diurnal bound girds her whole zodiac in his flaming round and leads the passions like the orb that guides from pole to pole the palpitating tides v though round the muse the robe of song is thrown think not the poet lives in verse alone long ere the chisel of the sculptor taught the lifeless stone to mock the living thought long ere the painter bade the canvas glow with every line the forms of beauty know long ere the iris of the muses threw on every leaf its own celestial hue in fables dress the breath of genius poured and warmed the shapes that later times adored untaught by science how to forge the keys that loose the gates of natures mysteries unschooled by faith who with her angel tread leads through the labyrinth with a single thread his fancy hovering round her guarded tower rained through its bars like danaes golden shower he spoke the seanymph answered from her cave he called the naiad left her mountain wave he dreamed of beauty lo amidst his dream narcissus mirrored in the breathless stream and nights chaste empress in her bridal play laughed through the foliage where endymion lay and ocean dimpled as the languid swell kissed the red lip of cythereas shell of power bellona swept the crimson field and blueeyed pallas shook her gorgon shield oer the hushed waves their mightier monarch drove and ida trembled to the tread of jove so every grace that plastic language knows to nameless poets its perfection owes the roughhewn words to simplest thoughts confined were cut and polished in their nicer mind caught on their edge imaginations ray splits into rainbows shooting far away from sense to soul from soul to sense it flies and through all nature links analogies he who reads right will rarely look upon a better poet than his lexicon there is a race which cold ungenial skies breed from decay as fungous growths arise though dying fast yet springing fast again which still usurps an unsubstantial reign with frames too languid for the charms of sense and minds worn down with action too intense tired of a world whose joys they never knew themselves deceived yet thinking all untrue scarce men without and less than girls within sick of their life before its cares begin the dull disease which drains their feeble hearts to lifes decay some hectic thrills imparts and lends a force which like the maniacs power pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour and this is genius say does heaven degrade the manly frame for health for action made break down the sinews rack the brow with pains blanch the right cheek and drain the purple veins to clothe the mind with more extended sway thus faintly struggling in degenerate clay no gentle maid too ready to admire though false its notes the pale enthusiasts lyre if this be genius though its bitter springs glowed like the morn beneath auroras wings seek not the source whose sullen bosom feeds but fruitless flowers and dark envenomed weeds but if so bright the dear illusion seems thou wouldst be partner of thy poets dreams and hang in rapture on his bloodless charms or die like raphael in his angel arms go and enjoy thy blessed lot to share in cowpers gloom or chattertons despair not such were they whom wandering oer the waves i looked to meet but only found their graves if friendships smile the better part of fame should lend my song the only wreath i claim whose voice would greet me with a sweeter tone whose living hand more kindly press my own than theirs could memory as her silent tread prints the pale flowers that blossom oer the dead those breathless lips now closed in peace restore or wake those pulses hushed to beat no more thou calm chaste scholar i can see thee now the first young laurels on thy pallid brow oer thy slight figure floating lightly down in graceful folds the academic gown on thy curled lip the classic lines that taught how nice the mind that sculptured them with thought and triumph glistening in the clear blue eye too bright to live but oh too fair to die and thou dear friend whom science still deplores and love still mourns on oceansevered shores though the bleak forest twice has bowed with snow since thou wast laid its budding leaves below thine image mingles with my closing strain as when we wandered by the turbid seine both blessed with hopes which revelled bright and free on all we longed or all we dreamed to be to thee the amaranth and the cypress fell and i was spared to breathe this last farewell but lived there one in unremembered days or lives there still who spurns the poets bays whose fingers dewy from castalias springs rest on the lyre yet scorn to touch the strings who shakes the senate with the silver tone the groves of pindus might have sighed to own have such eer been remember cannings name do such still live let alarics dirge proclaim immortal art whereer the rounded sky bends oer the cradle where thy children lie their home is earth their herald every tongue whose accents echo to the voice that sung one leap of ocean scatters on the sand the quarried bulwarks of the loosening land one thrill of earth dissolves a centurys toil strewed like the leaves that vanish in the soil one hill oerflows and cities sink below their marbles splintering in the lavas glow but one sweet tone scarce whispered to the air from shore to shore the blasts of ages bear one humble name which oft perchance has borne the tyrants mockery and the courtiers scorn towers oer the dust of earths forgotten graves as once emerging through the waste of waves the rocky titan round whose shattered spear coiled the last whirlpool of the drowning sphere additional poems the pilgrims vision in the hour of twilight shadows the pilgrim sire looked out he thought of the bloudy salvages that lurked all round about of wituwamets pictured knife and pecksuots whooping shout for the babys limbs were feeble though his fathers arms were stout his home was a freezing cabin too bare for the hungry rat its roof was thatched with ragged grass and bald enough of that the hole that served for casement was glazed with an ancient hat and the ice was gently thawing from the log whereon he sat along the dreary landscape his eyes went to and fro the trees all clad in icicles the streams that did not flow a sudden thought flashed oer him a dream of long ago he smote his leathern jerkin and murmured even so come hither godbeglorified and sit upon my knee behold the dream unfolding whereof i spake to thee by the winters hearth in leyden and on the stormy sea true is the dreams beginning so may its ending be i saw in the naked forest our scattered remnant cast a screen of shivering branches between them and the blast the snow was falling round them the dying fell as fast i looked to see them perish when lo the vision passed again mine eyes were opened the feeble had waxed strong the babes had grown to sturdy men the remnant was a throng by shadowed lake and winding stream and all the shores along the howling demons quaked to hear the christians godly song they slept the village fathers by river lake and shore when far adown the steep of time the vision rose once more i saw along the winter snow a spectral column pour and high above their broken ranks a tattered flag they bore their leader rode before them of bearing calm and high the light of heavens own kindling throned in his awful eye these were a nations champions her dread appeal to try god for the right i faltered and lo the train passed by once more the strife is ended the solemn issue tried the lord of hosts his mighty arm has helped our israels side gray stone and grassy hillock tell where our martyrs died but peaceful smiles the harvest and stainless flows the tide a crash as when some swollen cloud cracks oer the tangled trees with side to side and spar to spar whose smoking decks are these i know saint georges bloodred cross thou mistress of the seas but what is she whose streaming bars roll out before the breeze ah well her iron ribs are knit whose thunders strive to quell the bellowing throats the blazing lips that pealed the armadas knell the mist was cleared a wreath of stars rose oer the crimsoned swell and wavering from its haughty peak the cross of england fell o trembling faith though dark the morn a heavenly torch is thine while feebler races melt away and paler orbs decline still shall the fiery pillars ray along thy pathway shine to light the chosen tribe that sought this western palestine i see the living tide roll on it crowns with flaming towers the icy capes of labrador the spaniards land of flowers it streams beyond the splintered ridge that parts the northern showers from eastern rock to sunset wave the continent is ours he ceased the grim old soldiersaint then softly bent to cheer the pilgrimchild whose wasting face was meekly turned to hear and drew his toilworn sleeve across to brush the manly tear from cheeks that never changed in woe and never blanched in fear the weary pilgrim slumbers his restingplace unknown his hands were crossed his lips were closed the dust was oer him strown the drifting soil the mouldering leaf along the sod were blown his mound has melted into earth his memory lives alone so let it live unfading the memory of the dead long as the pale anemone springs where their tears were shed or raining in the summers wind in flakes of burning red the wild rose sprinkles with its leaves the turf where once they bled yea when the frowning bulwarks that guard this holy strand have sunk beneath the trampling surge in beds of sparkling sand while in the waste of ocean one hoary rock shall stand be this its latest legend here was the pilgrims land the steamboat see how yon flaming herald treads the ridged and rolling waves as crashing oer their crested heads she bows her surly slaves with foam before and fire behind she rends the clinging sea that flies before the roaring wind beneath her hissing lee the morning spray like seaborn flowers with heaped and glistening bells falls round her fast in ringing showers with every wave that swells and burning oer the midnight deep in lurid fringes thrown the living gems of ocean sweep along her flashing zone with clashing wheel and lifting keel and smoking torch on high when winds are loud and billows reel she thunders foaming by when seas are silent and serene with even beam she glides the sunshine glimmering through the green that skirts her gleaming sides now like a wild nymph far apart she veils her shadowy form the beating of her restless heart still sounding through the storm now answers like a courtly dame the reddening surges oer with flying scarf of spangled flame the pharos of the shore tonight yon pilot shall not sleep who trims his narrowed sail tonight yon frigate scarce shall keep her broad breast to the gale and many a foresail scooped and strained shall break from yard and stay before this smoky wreath has stained the rising mist of day hark hark i hear yon whistling shroud i see yon quivering mast the black throat of the hunted cloud is panting forth the blast an hour and whirled like winnowing chaff the giant surge shall fling his tresses oer yon pennon staff white as the seabirds wing yet rest ye wanderers of the deep nor wind nor wave shall tire those fleshless arms whose pulses leap with floods of living fire sleep on and when the morning light streams oer the shining bay oh think of those for whom the night shall never wake in day lexington slowly the mist oer the meadow was creeping bright on the dewy buds glistened the sun when from his couch while his children were sleeping rose the bold rebel and shouldered his gun waving her golden veil over the silent dale blithe looked the morning on cottage and spire hushed was his parting sigh while from his noble eye flashed the last sparkle of libertys fire on the smooth green where the fresh leaf is springing calmly the firstborn of glory have met hark the deathvolley around them is ringing look with their lifeblood the young grass is wet faint is the feeble breath murmuring low in death tell to our sons how their fathers have died nerveless the iron hand raised for its native land lies by the weapon that gleams at its side over the hillsides the wild knell is tolling from their far hamlets the yeomanry come as through the stormclouds the thunderburst rolling circles the beat of the mustering drum fast on the soldiers path darken the waves of wrath long have they gathered and loud shall they fall red glares the muskets flash sharp rings the rifles crash blazing and clanging from thicket and wall gayly the plume of the horseman was dancing never to shadow his cold brow again proudly at morning the warsteed was prancing reeking and panting he droops on the rein pale is the lip of scorn voiceless the trumpet horn torn is the silkenfringed red cross on high many a belted breast low on the turf shall rest ere the dark hunters the herd have passed by snowgirdled crags where the hoarse wind is raving rocks where the weary floods murmur and wail wilds where the fern by the furrow is waving reeled with the echoes that rode on the gale far as the tempest thrills over the darkened hills far as the sunshine streams over the plain roused by the tyrant band woke all the mighty land girded for battle from mountain to main green be the graves where her martyrs are lying shroudless and tombless they sunk to their rest while oer their ashes the starry fold flying wraps the proud eagle they roused from his nest borne on her northern pine long oer the foaming brine spread her broad banner to storm and to sun heaven keep her ever free wide as oer land and sea floats the fair emblem her heroes have won on lending a punchbowl this punchbowl was according to old family tradition a caudlecup it is a massive piece of silver its cherubs and other ornaments of coarse repousse work and has two handles like a lovingcup by which it was held or passed from guest to guest this ancient silver bowl of mine it tells of good old times of joyous days and jolly nights and merry christmas times they were a free and jovial race but honest brave and true who dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new a spanish galleon brought the bar so runs the ancient tale t was hammered by an antwerp smith whose arm was like a flail and now and then between the strokes for fear his strength should fail he wiped his brow and quaffed a cup of good old flemish ale t was purchased by an english squire to please his loving dame who saw the cherubs and conceived a longing for the same and oft as on the ancient stock another twig was found t was filled with candle spiced and hot and handed smoking round but changing hands it reached at length a puritan divine who used to follow timothy and take a little wine but hated punch and prelacy and so it was perhaps he went to leyden where he found conventicles and schnapps and then of course you know whats next it left the dutchmans shore with those that in the mayflower came a hundred souls and more along with all the furniture to fill their new abodes to judge by what is still on hand at least a hundred loads t was on a dreary winters eve the night was closing dim when brave miles standish took the bowl and filled it to the brim the little captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword and all his sturdy menatarms were ranged about the board he poured the fiery hollands in the man that never feared he took a long and solemn draught and wiped his yellow beard and one by one the musketeers the men that fought and prayed all drank as t were their mothers milk and not a man afraid that night affrighted from his nest the screaming eagle flew he heard the pequots ringing whoop the soldiers wild halloo and there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin run from the white man when you find he smells of hollands gin a hundred years and fifty more had spread their leaves and snows a thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherubs nose when once again the bowl was filled but not in mirth or joy t was mingled by a mothers hand to cheer her parting boy drink john she said t will do you good poor child youll never bear this working in the dismal trench out in the midnight air and if god bless me you were hurt t would keep away the chill so john did drink and well he wrought that night at bunkers hill i tell you there was generous warmth in good old english cheer i tell you t was a pleasant thought to bring its symbol here t is but the fool that loves excess hast thou a drunken soul thy bane is in thy shallow skull not in my silver bowl i love the memory of the past its pressed yet fragrant flowers the moss that clothes its broken walls the ivy on its towers nay this poor bauble it bequeathed my eyes grow moist and dim to think of all the vanished joys that danced around its brim then fill a fair and honest cup and bear it straight to me the goblet hallows all it holds whateer the liquid be and may the cherubs on its face protect me from the sin that dooms one to those dreadful words my dear where have you been a song for the centennial celebration of harvard college this song which i had the temerity to sing myself felix audacia mr franklin dexter had the goodness to call it was sent in a little too late to be printed with the official account of the celebration it was written at the suggestion of dr jacob bigelow who thought the popular tune the poachers song would be a good model for a lively ballad or ditty he himself wrote the admirable latin song to be found in the record of the meeting when the puritans came over our hills and swamps to clear the woods were full of catamounts and indians red as deer with tomahawks and scalpingknives that make folks heads look queer oh the ship from england used to bring a hundred wigs a year the crows came cawing through the air to pluck the pilgrims corn the bears came snuffing round the door wheneer a babe was born the rattlesnakes were bigger round than the but of the old rams horn the deacon blew at meeting time on every sabbath morn but soon they knocked the wigwams down and pinetree trunk and limb began to sprout among the leaves in shape of steeples slim and out the little wharves were stretched along the oceans rim and up the little schoolhouse shot to keep the boys in trim and when at length the college rose the sachem cocked his eye at every tutors meagre ribs whose coattails whistled by but when the greek and hebrew words came tumbling from his jaws the coppercolored children all ran screaming to the squaws and who was on the catalogue when college was begun two nephews of the president and the professors son they turned a little indian by as brown as any bun lord how the seniors knocked about the freshman class of one they had not then the dainty things that commons now afford but succotash and hominy were smoking on the board they did not rattle round in gigs or dash in longtailed blues but always on commencement days the tutors blacked their shoes god bless the ancient puritans their lot was hard enough but honest hearts make iron arms and tender maids are tough so love and faith have formed and fed our trueborn yankee stuff and keep the kernel in the shell the british found so rough the island huntingsong the island referred to is a domain of princely proportions which has long been the seat of a generous hospitality naushon is its old indian name william swain esq commonly known as the governor was the proprietor of it at the time when this song was written mr john m forbes is his worthy successor in territorial rights and as a hospitable entertainer the island book has been the recipient of many poems from visitors and friends of the owners of the old mansion no more the summer floweret charms the leaves will soon be sere and autumn folds his jewelled arms around the dying year so ere the waning seasons claim our leafless groves awhile with golden wine and glowing flame we ll crown our lonely isle once more the merry voices sound within the antlered hall and long and loud the baying hounds return the hunters call and through the woods and oer the hill and far along the bay the drivers horn is sounding shrill up sportsmen and away no bars of steel or walls of stone our little empire bound but circling with his azure zone the sea runs foaming round the whitening wave the purpled skies the blue and lifted shore braid with their dim and blending dyes our wide horizon oer and who will leave the grave debate that shakes the smoky town to rule amid our islandstate and wear our oakleaf crown and who will be awhile content to hunt our woodland game and leave the vulgar pack that scent the reeking track of fame ah who that shares in toils like these will sigh not to prolong our days beneath the broadleaved trees our nights of mirth and song then leave the dust of noisy streets ye outlaws of the wood and follow through his green retreats your noble robin hood departed days yes dear departed cherished days could memorys hand restore your morning light your evening rays from times gray urn once more then might this restless heart be still this straining eye might close and hope her fainting pinions fold while the fair phantoms rose but like a child in oceans arms we strive against the stream each moment farther from the shore where lifes young fountains gleam each moment fainter wave the fields and wider rolls the sea the mist grows dark the sun goes down day breaks and where are we the only daughter illustration of a picture they bid me strike the idle strings as if my summer days had shaken sunbeams from their wings to warm my autumn lays they bring to me their painted urn as if it were not time to lift my gauntlet and to spurn the lists of boyish rhyme and were it not that i have still some weakness in my heart that clings around my stronger will and pleads for gentler art perchance i had not turned away the thoughts grown tame with toil to cheat this lone and pallid ray that wastes the midnight oil alas with every year i feel some roses leave my brow too young for wisdoms tardy seal too old for garlands now yet while the dewy breath of spring steals oer the tingling air and spreads and fans each emerald wing the forest soon shall wear how bright the opening year would seem had i one look like thine to meet me when the morning beam unseals these lids of mine too long i bear this lonely lot that bids my heart run wild to press the lips that love me not to clasp the strangers child how oft beyond the dashing seas amidst those royal bowers where danced the lilacs in the breeze and swung the chestnutflowers i wandered like a wearied slave whose morning task is done to watch the little hands that gave their whiteness to the sun to revel in the bright young eyes whose lustre sparkled through the sable fringe of southern skies or gleamed in saxon blue how oft i heard anothers name called in some truants tone sweet accents which i longed to claim to learn and lisp my own too soon the gentle hands that pressed the ringlets of the child are folded on the faithful breast where first he breathed and smiled too oft the clinging arms untwine the melting lips forget and darkness veils the bridal shrine where wreaths and torches met if heaven but leaves a single thread of hopes dissolving chain even when her parting plumes are spread it bids them fold again the cradle rocks beside the tomb the cheek now changed and chill smiles on us in the morning bloom of one that loves us still sweet image i have done thee wrong to claim this destined lay the leaf that asked an idle song must bear my tears away yet in thy memory shouldst thou keep this else forgotten strain till years have taught thine eyes to weep and flatterys voice is vain oh then thou fledgling of the nest like the longwandering dove thy weary heart may faint for rest as mine on changeless love and while these sculptured lines retrace the hours now dancing by this vision of thy girlish grace may cost thee too a sigh song written for the dinner given to charles dickens by the young men of boston february the stars their early vigils keep the silent hours are near when drooping eyes forget to weep yet still we linger here and what the passing churl may ask can claim such wondrous power that toil forgets his wonted task and love his promised hour the irish harp no longer thrills or breathes a fainter tone the clarion blast from scotlands hills alas no more is blown and passions burning lip bewails her harolds wasted fire still lingering oer the dust that veils the lord of englands lyre but grieve not oer its broken strings nor think its soul hath died while yet the lark at heavens gate sings as once oer avons side while gentle summer sheds her bloom and dewy blossoms wave alike oer juliets storied tomb and nellys nameless grave thou glorious island of the sea though wide the wasting flood that parts our distant land from thee we claim thy generous blood nor oer thy far horizon springs one hallowed star of fame but kindles like an angels wings our western skies in flame lines recited at the berkshire jubilee pittsfield mass august come back to your mother ye children for shame who have wandered like truants for riches or fame with a smile on her face and a sprig in her cap she calls you to feast from her bountiful lap come out from your alleys your courts and your lanes and breathe like young eagles the air of our plains take a whiff from our fields and your excellent wives will declare it s all nonsense insuring your lives come you of the law who can talk if you please till the man in the moon will allow its a cheese and leave the old lady that never tells lies to sleep with her handkerchief over her eyes ye healers of men for a moment decline your feats in the rhubarb and ipecac line while you shut up your turnpike your neighbors can go the old roundabout road to the regions below you clerk on whose ears are a couple of pens and whose head is an anthill of units and tens though plato denies you we welcome you still as a featherless biped in spite of your quill poor drudge of the city how happy he feels with the burs on his legs and the grass at his heels no dodger behind his bandannas to share no constable grumbling you must nt walk there in yonder green meadow to memory dear he slaps a mosquito and brushes a tear the dewdrops hang round him on blossoms and shoots he breathes but one sigh for his youth and his boots there stands the old schoolhouse hard by the old church that tree at its side had the flavor of birch oh sweet were the days of his juvenile tricks though the prairie of youth had so many big licks by the side of yon river he weeps and he slumps the boots fill with water as if they were pumps till sated with rapture he steals to his bed with a glow in his heart and a cold in his head t is past he is dreaming i see him again the ledger returns as by legerdemain his neckcloth is damp with an easterly flaw and he holds in his fingers an omnibus straw he dreams the chill gust is a blossomy gale that the straw is a rose from his dear native vale and murmurs unconscious of space and of time a extra super ah is nt it prime oh what are the prizes we perish to win to the first little shiner we caught with a pin no soil upon earth is so dear to our eyes as the soil we first stirred in terrestrial pies then come from all parties and parts to our feast though not at the astor well give you at least a bite at an apple a seat on the grass and the best of old water at nothing a glass nux postcoenatica i was sitting with my microscope upon my parlor rug with a very heavy quarto and a very lively bug the true bug had been organized with only two antennae but the humbug in the copperplate would have them twice as many and i thought like dr faustus of the emptiness of art how we take a fragment for the whole and call the whole a part when i heard a heavy footstep that was loud enough for two and a man of forty entered exclaiming how d ye do he was not a ghost my visitor but solid flesh and bone he wore a palo alto hat his weight was twenty stone its odd how hats expand their brims as riper years invade as if when life had reached its noon it wanted them for shade i lost my focus dropped my book the bug who was a flea at once exploded and commenced experiments on me they have a certain heartiness that frequently appalls those mediaeval gentlemen in semilunar smalls my boy he said colloquial ways the vast broadhatted man come dine with us on thursday next you must you know you can were going to have a roaring time with lots of fun and noise distinguished guests et cetera the judge and all the boys not so i said my temporal bones are showing pretty clear it s time to stop just look and see that hair above this ear my golden days are more than spent and what is very strange if these are real silver hairs im getting lots of change besides my prospects dont you know that people wont employ a man that wrongs his manliness by laughing like a boy and suspect the azure blossom that unfolds upon a shoot as if wisdoms old potato could not flourish at its root its a very fine reflection when you re etching out a smile on a copperplate of faces that would stretch at least a mile that what with sneers from enemies and cheapening shrugs of friends it will cost you all the earnings that a month of labor lends its a vastly pleasing prospect when youre screwing out a laugh that your very next years income is diminished by a half and a little boy trips barefoot that pegasus may go and the babys milk is watered that your helicon may flow no the joke has been a good one but im getting fond of quiet and i dont like deviations from my customary diet so i think i will not go with you to hear the toasts and speeches but stick to old montgomery place and have some pig and peaches the fat man answered shut your mouth and hear the genuine creed the true essentials of a feast are only fun and feed the force that wheels the planets round delights in spinning tops and that young earthquake t other day was great at shaking props i tell you what philosopher if all the longest heads that ever knocked their sinciputs in stretching on their beds were round one great mahogany id beat those fine old folks with twenty dishes twenty fools and twenty clever jokes why if columbus should be there the company would beg hed show that little trick of his of balancing the egg milton to stilton would give in and solomon to salmon and roger bacon be a bore and francis bacon gammon and as for all the patronage of all the clowns and boors that squint their little narrow eyes at any freak of yours do leave them to your prosier friends such fellows ought to die when rhubarb is so very scarce and ipecac so high and so i come like lochinvar to tread a single measure to purchase with a loaf of bread a sugarplum of pleasure to enter for the cup of glass thats run for after dinner which yields a single sparkling draught then breaks and cuts the winner ah thats the way delusion comes a glass of old madeira a pair of visual diaphragms revolved by jane or sarah and down go vows and promises without the slightest question if eating words wont compromise the organs of digestion and yet among my native shades beside my nursing mother where every stranger seems a friend and every friend a brother i feel the old convivial glow unaided oer me stealing the warm champagny the oldparticular brandypunchy feeling were all alike vesuvius flings the scoriae from his fountain but down they come in volleying rain back to the burning mountain we leave like those volcanic stones our precious alma mater but will keep dropping in again to see the dear old crater verses for afterdinner phi beta kappa society i was thinking last night as i sat in the cars with the charmingest prospect of cinders and stars next thursday is bless me how hard it will be if that cannibal president calls upon me there is nothing on earth that he will not devour from a tutor in seed to a freshman in flower no sage is too gray and no youth is too green and you cant be too plump though youre never too lean while others enlarge on the boiled and the roast he serves a raw clergyman up with a toast or catches some doctor quite tender and young and basely insists on a bit of his tongue poor victim prepared for his classical spit with a stuffing of praise and a basting of wit you may twitch at your collar and wrinkle your brow but youre up on your legs and youre in for it now oh think of your friends they are waiting to hear those jokes that are thought so remarkably queer and all the jack horners of metrical buns are prying and fingering to pick out the puns those thoughts which like chickens will always thrive best when reared by the heat of the natural nest will perish if hatched from their embryo dream in the mist and the glow of convivial steam oh pardon me then if i meekly retire with a very small flash of ethereal fire no rubbing will kindle your lucifer match if the fiz

her ancient home a poor forsaken maid no banner flaunting high above no blazoned cross she bore one holy book of light and love was all her worldly store the dark brown shadows passed away and wider

grain but wrath soon gathered uncontrolled among the baser churls to see her ankles red with gold her forehead white with pearls who gave to thee the glittering bands that lace thine azure veins who bade thee lift those snowwhite hands we bound in gilded chains these are the gems my children gave the stately dame replied the wise the gentle and the brave i nurtured at my side if envy still your

when the morning star shall rise thou shalt wake with weeping eyes when the second sun goes down thou more tranquil shalt be grown taught too well that wild despair dims thine eyes and spoils thy hair all the first unquiet week thou shalt wear a smileless cheek in the first months second half thou shalt once attempt to laugh then in pickwick thou shalt dip slightly puckering round the lip till at last in sorrows spite samuel makes thee laugh outright while the first seven mornings last round thy chamber bolted fast many a youth shall fume and pout hang the girl shes always out while the second

head they circled with the vine and oer their best and bravest dead they poured the darkred wine then once again etc methinks oer every sparkling glass young eros waves his wings and echoes oer its dimples pass from dead anacreons strings and tossing round its beaded brim their locks of floating gold with bacchant dance and choral hymn return the nymphs of old then once again etc a welcome then to joy and mirth from hearts as fresh as ours to scatter oer the dust of earth their sweetly mingled flowers t is wisdoms self the cup that fills in spite of follys frown and nature from her vineclad

glow and mirror its bloom in the bright wave below a health to sweet woman the days are no more when she watched for her lord till the revel was oer and smoothed the white pillow and blushed when he came as she pressed her cold lips on his forehead of flame alas for the loved one too spotless and fair the joys of his banquet to chasten and share her eye lost its light that his goblet might shine and the rose of her cheek was dissolved in his wine joy smiles in the fountain health flows in the rills as their ribbons of silver unwind from the hills they breathe not the mist of the bacchanals dream but the lilies of innocence float on their stream then a health and a welcome to woman once more she brings us a passport that laughs at our door it is written on crimson its letters are pearls it is countersigned nature so room for the girls a sentiment the pledge of friendship it is still divine though watery floods have quenched its burning wine whatever vase the sacred drops may hold the gourd the shell the cup of beaten gold around its brim the hand of nature throws a garland sweeter than the banquets rose bright are the blushes of the vinewreathed bowl warm with the sunshine of anacreons soul but dearer memories gild the tasteless wave that fainting sidney perished as he gave t is the hearts current lends the cup its glow whateer the fountain whence the draught may flow the diamond dewdrops sparkling through the sand scooped by the arab in his sunburnt hand or the dark streamlet oozing from the snow where creep and crouch the shuddering esquimaux ay in the stream that ere again we meet shall burst the pavement glistening at our feet and stealing silent from its leafy hills thread all our alleys with its thousand rills in each pale draught if generous feeling blend

mercantile library association october yes dear enchantress wandering far and long in realms unperfumed by the breath of song where flowers illflavored shed their sweets around and bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground whose gems are crystals from the epsom mine whose vineyards flow with antimonial wine whose gates admit no mirthful feature in save one gaunt mocker the sardonic grin whose pangs are real not the woes of rhyme that blueeyed misses warble out of time truant not recreant to thy sacred claim older by reckoning but in heart the same freed for a moment from the chains of toil i tread once more thy consecrated soil here at thy feet my old allegiance own thy subject still and loyal to thy throne my dazzled glance explores the crowded hall alas how vain to hope the smiles of all i know my audience all the gay and young love the light antics of a playful tongue and these remembering some expansive line my lips let loose among the nuts and wine are all impatience till the opening pun proclaims the witty shamfight is begun two fifths at least if not the total half have come infuriate for an earthquake laugh i know full well what alderman has tied his red bandanna tight about his side i see the mother who aware that boys perform their laughter with superfluous noise beside her kerchief brought an extra one to stop the explosions of her bursting son i know a tailor

smile awaits them ere my song is through i know myself not servile for applause my muse permits no deprecating clause modest or vain she will not be denied one bold confession due to honest pride and well she knows the drooping veil of song shall save her boldness from the cavillers wrong her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts to tell the secrets of our aching hearts for this a suppliant captive prostrate bound she kneels imploring at the feet of sound for this convulsed in thoughts maternal pains she loads her arms with rhymes resounding chains faint though the music of her fetters be it lends one charm her lips are ever free think not i come in manhoods fiery noon to steal his laurels from the stage buffoon his sword of lath the harlequin may wield behold the star upon my lifted shield though the just critic pass my humble name and sweeter lips have drained the cup of fame while my gay stanza pleased the banquets lords the soul within was tuned to deeper chords say shall my arms in other conflicts taught to swing aloft the ponderous mace of thought lift in obedience to a schoolgirls law mirths tinsel wand or laughters tickling straw say shall i wound with satires rankling spear the pure warm hearts that bid me welcome here no while i wander through the land of dreams to strive with great and play with trifling themes let some kind meaning fill the varied line you have your judgment will you trust to mine between two breaths what crowded mysteries lie the first short gasp the last and longdrawn sigh like phantoms painted on the magic slide forth from the darkness of the past we glide as living shadows for a moment seen in airy pageant on the eternal screen traced by a ray from one unchanging flame then seek the dust and stillness whence we came but whence and why our trembling souls inquire caught these dim visions their awakening fire oh who forgets when first the piercing thought through childhoods musings found its way unsought i am i live the mystery and the fear when the dread question what has brought me here burst through lifes twilight as before the sun roll the deep thunders of the morning gun are angel faces silent and serene bent on the conflicts of this little scene whose dreamlike efforts whose unreal strife are but the preludes to a larger life or does lifes summer see the end of all these leaves of being mouldering as they fall as the old poet vaguely used to deem as wesley questioned in his youthful dream oh could such mockery reach our souls indeed give back the pharaohs or the athenians creed better than this a heaven of mans device the indians sports the moslems paradise or is our beings only end and aim to add new glories to our makers name as the poor insect shrivelling in the blaze lends a faint sparkle to its streaming rays does earth send upward to the eternals ear the mingled discords of her jarring sphere to swell his anthem while creation rings with notes of anguish from its shattered strings is it for this the immortal artist means these conscious throbbing agonized machines dark is the soul whose sullen creed can bind in chains like these the allembracing mind no twofaced bigot thou dost ill reprove the sensual selfish yet benignant jove and praise a tyrant throned in lonely pride who loves himself and cares for naught beside who gave thee summoned from primeval night a thousand laws and not a single right a heart to feel and quivering nerves to thrill the sense of wrong the deathdefying will who girt thy senses with this goodly frame its earthly glories and its orbs of flame not for thyself unworthy of a thought poor helpless victim of a life unsought but all for him unchanging and supreme the heartless centre of thy frozen scheme trust not the teacher with his lying scroll who tears the charter of thy shuddering soul the god of love who gave the breath that warms all living dust in all its varied forms asks not the tribute of a world like this to fill the measure of his perfect bliss though winged with life through all its radiant shores creation flowed with unexhausted stores cherub and seraph had not yet enjoyed for this he called thee from the quickening void nor this alone a larger gift was thine a mightier purpose swelled his vast design thought conscience will to make them all thine own he rent a pillar from the eternal throne made in his image thou must nobly dare the thorny crown of sovereignty to share with eye uplifted it is thine to view from thine own centre heavens oerarching blue so round thy heart a beaming circle lies no fiend can blot no hypocrite disguise from all its orbs one cheering voice is heard full to thine ear it bears the fathers word now as in eden where his firstborn trod seek thine own welfare true to man and god think not too meanly of thy low estate thou hast a choice to choose is to create remember whose the sacred lips that tell angels approve thee when thy choice is well remember one a judge of righteous men swore to spare sodom if she held but ten use well the freedom which thy master gave thinkst thou that heaven can tolerate a slave and he who made thee to be just and true will bless thee love thee ay respect thee too nature has placed thee on a changeful tide to breast its waves but not without a guide yet as the needle will forget its aim jarred by the fury of the electric flame as the true current it will falsely feel warped from its axis by a freight of steel so will thy conscience lose its balanced truth if passions lightning fall upon thy youth so the pure effluence quit its sacred hold girt round too deeply with magnetic gold go to yon tower where busy science plies her vast antennae feeling through the skies that little vernier on whose slender lines the midnight taper trembles as it shines a silent index tracks the planets march in all their wanderings through the ethereal arch tells through the mist where dazzled mercury burns and marks the spot where uranus returns so till by wrong or negligence effaced the living index which thy maker traced repeats the line each starry virtue draws through the wide circuit of creations laws still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray where the dark shadows of temptation stray but once defaced forgets the orbs of light and leaves thee wandering oer the expanse of night what is thy creed a hundred lips inquire thou seekest god beneath what christian spire nor ask they idly for uncounted lies float upward on the smoke of sacrifice when mans first incense rose above the plain of earths two altars one was built by cain uncursed by doubt our earliest creed we take we love the precepts for the teachers sake the simple lessons which the nursery taught fell soft and stainless on the buds of thought and the full blossom owes its fairest hue to those sweet teardrops of affections dew too oft the light that led our earlier hours fades with the perfume of our cradle flowers the clear cold question chills to frozen doubt tired of beliefs we dread to live without oh then if reason waver at thy side let humbler memory be thy gentle guide go to thy birthplace and if faith was there repeat thy fathers creed thy mothers prayer faith loves to lean on times destroying arm and age like distance lends a double charm in dim cathedrals dark with vaulted gloom what holy awe invests the saintly tomb there pride will bow and anxious care expand and creeping avarice come with open hand the gay can weep the impious can adore from morns first glimmerings on the chancel floor till dying sunset sheds his crimson stains through the faint halos of the irised panes yet there are graves whose rudelyshapen sod bears the fresh footprints where the sexton trod graves where the verdure has not dared to shoot where the chance wildflower has not fixed its root whose slumbering tenants dead without a name the eternal record shall at length proclaim pure as the holiest in the long array of hooded mitred or tiaraed clay come seek the air some pictures we may gain whose passing shadows shall not be in vain not from the scenes that crowd the strangers soil not from our own amidst the stir of toil but when the sabbath brings its kind release and care lies slumbering on the lap of peace the air is hushed the street is holy ground hark the sweet bells renew their welcome sound as one by one awakes each silent tongue it tells the turret whence its voice is flung the chapel last of sublunary things that stirs our echoes with the name of kings whose bell just glistening from the font and forge rolled its proud requiem for the second george solemn and swelling as of old it rang flings to the wind its deep sonorous clang the simpler pile that mindful of the hour when howes artillery shook its halfbuilt tower wears on its bosom as a bride might do the iron breastpin which the rebels threw wakes the sharp echoes with the quivering thrill of keen vibrations tremulous and shrill aloft suspended in the mornings fire crash the vast cymbals from the southern spire the giant standing by the elmclad green his white lance lifted oer the silent scene whirling in air his brazen goblet round swings from its brim the swollen floods of sound while sad with memories of the olden time throbs from his tower the northern minstrels chime faint single tones that spell their ancient song but tears still follow as they breathe along child of the soil whom fortune sends to range where man and nature faith and customs change borne in thy memory each familiar tone mourns on the winds that sigh in every zone when ceylon sweeps thee with her perfumed breeze through the warm billows of the indian seas when ship and shadow blended both in one flames oer thy mast the equatorial sun from sparkling midnight to refulgent noon thy canvas swelling with the still monsoon when through thy shrouds the wild tornado sings and thy poor seabird folds her tattered wings oft will delusion oer thy senses steal and airy echoes ring the sabbath peal then dim with grateful tears in long array rise the fair town the islandstudded bay home with its smiling board its cheering fire the halfchoked welcome of the expecting sire the mothers kiss and still if aught remain our whispering hearts shall aid the silent strain ah let the dreamer oer the taffrail lean to muse unheeded and to weep unseen fear not the tropics dews the evenings chills his heart lies warm among his triple hills turned from her path by this deceitful gleam my wayward fancy half forgets her theme see through the streets that slumbered in repose the living current of devotion flows its varied forms in one harmonious band age leading childhood by its dimpled hand want in the robe whose faded edges fall to tell of rags beneath the tartan shawl and wealth in silks that fluttering to appear lift the deep borders of the proud cashmere see but glance briefly sorrowworn and pale those sunken cheeks beneath the widows veil alone she wanders where with him she trod no arm to stay her but she leans on god while other doublets deviate here and there what secret handcuff binds that pretty pair compactest couple pressing side to side ah the white bonnet that reveals the bride by the white neckcloth with its straitened tie the sober hat the sabbathspeaking eye severe and smileless he that runs may read the stern disciple of genevas creed decent and slow behold his solemn march silent he enters through yon crowded arch a livelier bearing of the outward man the lighthued gloves the undevout rattan now smartly raised or half profanely twirled a bright fresh twinkle from the weekday world tell their plain story yes thine eyes behold a cheerful christian from the liberal fold down the chill street that curves in gloomiest shade what marks betray yon solitary maid the cheeks red rose that speaks of balmier air the celtic hue that shades her braided hair the gilded missal in her kerchief tied poor nora exile from killarneys side sister in toil though blanched by colder skies that left their azure in her downcast eyes see pallid margaret labors patient child scarce weaned from home the nursling of the wild where white katahdin oer the horizon shines and broad penobscot dashes through the pines still as she hastes her careful fingers hold the unfailing hymnbook in its cambric fold six days at drudgerys heavy wheel she stands the seventh sweet morning folds her weary hands yes child of suffering thou mayst well be sure he who ordained the sabbath loves the poor this weekly picture faithful memory draws nor claims the noisy tribute of applause faint is the glow such barren hopes can lend and frail the line that asks no loftier end trust me kind listener i will yet beguile thy saddened features of the promised smile this magic mantle thou must well divide it has its sable and its ermine side yet ere the lining of the robe appears take thou in silence what i give in tears dear listening soul this transitory scene of murmuring stillness busily serene this solemn pause the breathingspace of man the halt of toils exhausted caravan comes sweet with music to thy wearied ear rise with its anthems to a holier sphere deal meekly gently with the hopes that guide the lowliest brother straying from thy side if right they bid thee tremble for thine own if wrong the verdict is for god alone what though the champions of thy faith esteem the sprinkled fountain or baptismal stream shall jealous passions in unseemly strife cross their dark weapons oer the waves of life let my free soul expanding as it can leave to his scheme the thoughtful puritan but calvins dogma shall my lips deride in that stern faith my angel mary died or ask if mercys milder creed can save sweet sister risen from thy newmade grave true the harsh founders of thy church reviled that ancient faith the trust of erins child must thou be raking in the crumbled past for racks and fagots in her teeth to cast see from the ashes of helvetias pile the whitened skull of old servetus smile round her young heart thy romish upas threw its firm deep fibres strengthening as she grew thy sneering voice may call them popish tricks her latin prayers her dangling crucifix but de profundis blessed her fathers grave that idol cross her dying mother gave what if some angel looks with equal eyes on her and thee the simple and the wise writes each dark fault against thy brighter creed and drops a tear with every foolish bead grieve as thou must oer historys reeking page blush for the wrongs that stain thy happier age strive with the wanderer from the better path bearing thy message meekly not in wrath weep for the frail that err the weak that fall have thine own faith but hope and pray for all faith conscience love a meaner task remains and humbler thoughts must creep in lowlier strains shalt thou be honest ask the worldly schools and all will tell thee knaves are busier fools

clothes the officeseekers shoes scraps from cold feasts where conversation runs through mouldy toasts to oxidated puns and grating songs a listening crowd endures rasped from the throats of bellowing amateurs sermons whose writers played such dangerous tricks their own heresiarchs called them heretics strange that one term such distant poles should link the priestleyans copper and the puseyans zinc poems that shuffle with superfluous legs a blindfold minuet over addled eggs where all the syllables that end in ed like old dragoons have cuts across the head essays so dark champollion might

toast can hardly claim amidst its various wealth the right unchallenged to propose a health yet though its tenant is denied the feast friendship must launch his sentiment at least as prisoned damsels

walks unchallenged through the gate to sit beside the throne the stethoscope song a professional ballad there was a young man in boston town he bought him a stethoscope nice and new all mounted and finished and polished down with an ivory cap and a stopper too it happened a spider within did crawl and spun him a web of ample size wherein there chanced one day to fall a couple of very imprudent flies the first was a bottlefly big and blue the second was smaller and thin and long so there was a concert between the two like an octave flute and a tavern gong now being from paris but recently this fine young man would show his skill and so they gave him his hand to try a hospital patient extremely ill some said that his liver was short of bile and some that his heart was over size while some kept arguing all the while he was crammed with tubercles up to his eyes this fine young man then up stepped he and all the doctors made a pause said he the man must die you see by the fiftyseventh of louiss laws but since the case is a desperate one to explore his chest it may be well for if he should die and it were not done you know the autopsy would not tell then out his stethoscope he took and on it placed his curious ear mon dieu said he with a knowing look why here is a sound that s mighty queer the bourdonnement is very clear amphoric buzzing as im alive five doctors took their turn to hear amphoric buzzing said all the five theres empyema beyond a doubt well plunge a trocar in his side the diagnosis was made out they tapped the patient so he died now such as hate newfashioned toys began to look extremely glum they said that rattles were made for boys and vowed that his buzzing was all a hum there was an old lady had long been sick and what was the matter none did know her pulse was slow though her tongue was quick to her this knowing youth must go so there the nice old lady sat with phials and boxes all in a row she asked the young doctor what he was at to thump her and tumble her ruffles so now when the stethoscope came out the flies began to buzz and whiz oh ho i the matter is clear no doubt an aneurism there plainly is the bruit de rape and the bruit de scie and the bruit de diable are all combined how happy bouillaud would be if he a case like this could find now when the neighboring doctors found a case so rare had been descried they every day her ribs did pound in squads of twenty so she died then six young damsels slight and frail received this kind young doctors cares they all were getting slim and pale and short of breath on mounting stairs they all made rhymes with sighs and skies and loathed their puddings and buttered rolls and dieted much to their friends surprise on pickles and pencils and chalk and coals so fast their little hearts did bound the frightened insects buzzed the more so over all their chests he found the rale sifflant and the rale sonore he shook his head theres grave disease i greatly fear you all must die a slight postmortem if you please surviving friends would gratify the six young damsels wept aloud which so prevailed on six young men that each his honest love avowed whereat they all got well again this poor young man was all aghast the price of stethoscopes came down and so he was reduced at last to practise in a country town the doctors being very sore a stethoscope they did devise that had a rammer to clear the bore with a knob at the end to kill the flies now use your ears all you that can but dont forget to mind your eyes or you may be cheated like this young man by a couple of silly abnormal flies extracts from a medical poem the stability of science the feeble seabirds blinded in the storms on some tall lighthouse dash their little forms and the rude granite scatters for their pains those small deposits that were meant for brains yet the proud fabric in the mornings sun stands all unconscious of the mischief done still the red beacon pours its evening rays for the lost pilot with as full a blaze nay shines all radiance oer the scattered fleet of gulls and boobies brainless at its feet i tell their fate though courtesy disclaims to call our kind by such ungentle names yet if your rashness bid you vainly dare think of their doom ye simple and beware see where aloft its hoary forehead rears the towering pride of twice a thousand years far far below the vast incumbent pile sleeps the gray rock from arts aegean isle its massive courses circling as they rise swell from the waves to mingle with the skies there every quarry lends its marble spoil and clustering ages blend their common toil the greek the roman reared its ancient walls the silent arab arched its mystic halls in that fair niche by countless billows laved trace the deep lines that sydenham engraved on yon broad front that breasts the changing swell mark where the ponderous sledge of hunter fell by that square buttress look where louis stands the stone yet warm from his uplifted hands and say o science shall thy lifeblood freeze when fluttering folly flaps on walls like these a portrait thoughtful in youth but not austere in age calm but not cold and cheerful though a sage too true to flatter and too kind to sneer and only just when seemingly severe so gently blending courtesy and art that wisdoms lips seemed borrowing friendships heart taught by the sorrows that his age had known in others trials to forget his own as hour by hour his lengthened day declined a sweeter radiance lingered oer his mind cold were the lips that spoke his early praise and hushed the voices of his morning days yet the same accents dwelt on every tongue and love renewing kept him ever young a sentiment o bios bpaxus life is but a song h rexvn uakpn art is wondrous

more perplexed for poets than for port and sherry they want the men of word torn out our friends will come with anxious faces to see our blankets off no doubt and trot us out and show our paces they hint that papers by the score are rather musty kind of rations they dont exactly mean a bore but only trying to the patience that such as you know who i mean distinguished for their what d ye call em should bring the dews of hippocrene to sprinkle on the faces solemn the same old story thats the chaff to catch the birds that sing the ditties upon my soul it makes me laugh to read these letters

meeting held may canto first old rip van winkle had a grandson rip of the paternal block a genuine chip a lazy sleepy curious kind of chap he like his grandsire took a mighty nap whereof the story i propose to tell in two brief cantos if you listen well the times were hard when rip to manhood grew they always will be when theres work to do he tried at farming found it rather slow and then at teaching what he did nt know then took to hanging round the tavern bars to frequent toddies and longnine cigars till dame van winkle out of patience vexed with preaching homilies having for their text a mop a broomstick aught that might avail to point a moral or adorn a tale exclaimed i have it now then mr v hes good for something make him an m d the die was cast the youngster was content they packed his shirts and stockings and he went how hard he studied it were vain to tell he drowsed through wistar nodded over bell slept sound with cooper snored aloud on good heard heaps of lectures doubtless understood a constant listener for he did not fail to carve his name on every bench and rail months grew to years at last he counted three and rip van winkle found himself m d illustrious title in a gilded frame he set the sheepskin with his latin name ripum van winklum quem we scimus know idoneum esse to do so and so he hired an office soon its walls displayed his new diploma and his

hatched a brood of twice ive wellnigh said them words unfitting quite for these fair precincts and for ears polite the surest foot may chance at last to slip and so at length it proved with doctor rip one fullsized bottle stood upon the shelf which held the medicine that he took himself whateer the reason it must be confessed he filled that bottle oftener than the rest what drug it held i dont presume to know the gilded label said elixir pro one day the doctor found the bottle full and being thirsty took a vigorous pull put back the elixir where t was always found and had old dobbin saddled and brought round you know those oldtime rhubarbcolored nags that carried doctors and their saddlebags sagacious beasts they stopped at every place where blinds were shut knew every patients case looked up and thought the babys in a fit that wont last long hell soon be through with it but shook their heads before the knockered door where some old lady told the story oer whose endless stream of tribulation flows for gastric griefs and peristaltic woes what jackolantern led him from his way and where it led him it were hard to say enough that wandering many a weary mile through paths the mountain sheep trod single file oercome by feelings such as patients know who dose too freely with elixir pro he tumbl dismounted slightly in a heap and lay promiscuous lapped in balmy sleep night followed night and day succeeded day but snoring still the slumbering doctor lay poor dobbin starving thought upon his stall and straggled homeward saddlebags and all the village people hunted all around but rip was missing never could be found drownded they guessed for more than half a year the pouts and eels did taste uncommon queer some said of applebrandy other some found a strong flavor of new england rum why cant a fellow hear the fine things said about a fellow when a fellows dead the best of doctors so the press declared a public blessing while his life was spared true to his country bounteous to the poor in all things temperate sober just and pure the best of husbands echoed mrs van and set her cap to catch another man so ends this canto if its quantum suff well just stop here and say weve had enough and leave poor rip to sleep for thirty years i grind the organ if you lend your ears to hear my second canto after that we ll send around the monkey with the hat canto second so thirty years had passed but not a word in all that time of rip was ever heard the world wagged on it never does go back the widow van was now the widow mac france was an empire andrew j was dead and abraham l was reigning in his stead four murderous years had passed in savage strife yet still the rebel held his bloody knife at last one morning who forgets the day when the black cloud of war dissolved away the joyous tidings spread oer land and sea rebellion done for grant has captured lee up every flagstaff sprang the stars and stripes out rushed the extras wild with mammoth types down went the laborers hod the schoolboys book hooraw he cried the rebel armys took ah what a time the folks all mad with joy each fond pale mother thinking of her boy old grayhaired fathers meeting have

the picture how a man appears whos been asleep a score or two of years you all have seen it to perfection done by joe van wink i mean rip jefferson well so it was old rip at last came back claimed his old wife the present widow mac had his old sign regilded and began to practise physic on the same old plan some weeks went by it was not long to wait and please to call grew frequent on the slate he had in fact an ancient mildewed air a long gray beard a plenteous lack of hair the musty look that always recommends your good old doctor to his ailing friends talk of your science after all is said theres nothing like a bare and shiny head age lends the graces that are sure to please folks want their doctors mouldy like their cheese so rip began to look at peoples tongues and thump their briskets called it sound their lungs brushed up his knowledge smartly as he could read in old cullen and in doctor good the town was healthy for a month or two he gave the sexton little work to do about the time when dogday heats begin the summers usual maladies set in with autumn evenings dysentery came and dusky typhoid lit his smouldering flame the blacksmith ailed the carpenter was down and half the children sickened in the town the sextons face grew shorter than before the sextons wife a brandnew bonnet wore things looked quite serious death had got a grip on old and young in spite of doctor rip and now the squire was taken with a chill wife gave hotdrops at night an indian pill next morning feverish bedtime getting worse out of his head began to rave and curse the doctor sent for double quick he came ant tart gran duo and repeat the same if no et cetera third day nothing new percussed his thorax till t was black and blue lungfever threatening something of the sort out with the lancet let him bleed a quart ten leeches next then blisters to his side ten grains of calomel just then he died the deacon next required the doctors care took cold by sitting in a draught of air pains in the back but what the matter is not quite so clear wife calls it rheumatiz rubs back with flannel gives him something hot ah says the deacon that goes nigh the spot next day a rigor run my little man and say the deacon sends for doctor van the doctor came percussion as before thumping and banging till his ribs were sore right side the flattest then more vigorous raps fever thats certain pleurisy perhaps a quart of blood will ease the pain no doubt ten leeches next will help to suck it out then clap a blister on the painful part but first two grains of antimonium tart last with a dose of cleansing calomel unload the portal system that sounds well but when the selfsame remedies were tried as all the village knew the squire had died the neighbors hinted this will never do hes killed the squire hell kill the deacon too now when a doctors patients are perplexed a consultation comes in order next you know what that is in a certain place meet certain doctors to discuss a case and other matters such as weather crops potatoes pumpkins lagerbeer and hops for whats the use there s little to be said nine times in ten your mans as good as dead at best a talk the secret to disclose where three men guess and sometimes one man knows the counsel summoned came without delay young doctor green and shrewd old doctor gray they heard the story bleed says doctor green thats downright murder cut his throat you mean leeches the reptiles why for pitys sake not try an adder or a rattlesnake blisters why bless you they re against the law its rank assault and battery if they draw tartrate of antimony shade of luke stomachs turn pale at thought of such rebuke the portal system whats the man about unload your nonsense calomels played out youve been asleep youd better sleep away

thirty years come round youll find the lancet in its honored place leeches and blisters rescued from disgrace your drugs redeemed from fashions passing scorn and counted safe to give to babes unborn poor sleepy rip m m s s m d a puzzled serious saddened man was he home from the deacons house he plodded slow and filled one bumper of elixir pro goodby he faltered mrs van my dear im going to sleep

always here perhaps youll track him by a whiff you know a certain flavor of elixir pro now then i give you as you seem to think we can give toasts without a drop to drink health to the mighty sleeper long live he our brother rip m m s s m d songs in many keys the piping of our slender peaceful reeds whispers uncared for while the trumpets bray song is thin air our hearts exulting play beats time but to the tread of marching deeds following the mighty van that freedom leads her glorious standard flaming to the day the crimsoned pavement where a hero bleeds breathes nobler lessons than the poets lay strong arms broad breasts brave hearts are better worth than strains that sing the ravished echoes dumb hark t is the loud reverberating drum rolls oer the prairied west the rockbound north the myriadhanded future stretches forth its shadowy palms behold we come we come turn oer these idle leaves such toys as these were not unsought for as in languid dreams we lay beside our lotusfeeding streams and nursed our fancies in forgetful ease it matters little if they pall or please dropping untimely while the sudden gleams glare from the mustering clouds whose blackness seems too swollen to hold its lightning from the trees yet in some lull of passion when at last these calm revolving moons that come and go turning our months to years they creep so slow have brought us rest the not unwelcome past may flutter to thee through these leaflets cast on the wild winds that all around us blow may agnes the story of sir harry frankland and agnes surriage is told in the ballad with a very strict adhesion to the facts these were obtained from information afforded me by the rev mr webster of hopkinton in company with whom i visited the frankland mansion in that town then standing from a very interesting memoir by the rev elias nason of medford and from the manuscript diary of sir harry or more properly sir charles henry frankland now in the library of the massachusetts historical society at the time of the visit referred to old julia was living and on our return we called at the house where she resided she was living june when this ballad was published her account is little more than paraphrased in the poem if the incidents are treated with a certain liberality at the close of the fifth part the essential fact that agnes rescued sir harry from the ruins after the earthquake and their subsequent marriage as related may be accepted as literal truth so with regard to most of the trifling details which are given they are taken from the record it is greatly to be regretted that the frankland mansion no longer exists it was accidentally burned on the d of january a year or two after the first sketch of this ballad was written a visit to it was like stepping out of the century into the years before the revolution a new house similar in plan and arrangements to the old one has been built upon its site and the terraces the clump of box and the lilacs doubtless remain to bear witness to the truth of this story the story which i have told literally in rhyme has been made the subject of a carefully studied and interesting romance by mr e l bynner part first the knight the tale i tell is gospel true as all the bookmen know and pilgrims who have strayed to view the wrecks still left to show the old old story fair and young and fond and not too wise that matrons tell with sharpened tongue to maids with downcast eyes ah maidens err and matrons warn beneath the coldest sky love lurks amid the tasselled corn as in the bearded rye but who would dream our sober sires had learned the old worlds ways and warmed their hearths with lawless fires in shirleys homespun days t is like some poets pictured trance his idle rhymes recite this old new englandborn romance of agnes and the knight yet known to all the country round their home is standing still between wachusetts lonely mound and shawmuts threefold hill one hour we rumble on the rail one halfhour guide the rein we reach at last oer hill and dale the village on the plain with blackening wall and mossy roof with stained and warping floor a stately mansion stands aloof and bars its haughty door

silver crown a sudden paleness struck her brow a swifter blush succeeds it burns her cheek it kindles now beneath her golden beads she flitted but the glittering eye still sought the lovely face who was she what and whence and why doomed to such menial place a skippers daughter so they said left orphan by the gale that cost the fleet of marblehead and gloucester thirty sail ah many a lonely home is found along the essex shore that cheered its goodman outward bound and sees his face no more not so the matron whispered sure no orphan girl is she the surriage folk are deadly poor since edward left the sea and mary with her growing brood has work enough to do to find the children clothes and food with thomas john and hugh this girl of marys growing tall just turned her sixteenth year to earn her bread and help them all would work as housemaid here so agnes with her golden beads and naught beside as dower grew at the wayside with the weeds herself a gardenflower t was strange t was sad so fresh so fair thus pitys voice began such grace an angels shape and air the halfheard whisper ran for eyes could see in georges time as now in later days and lips could shape in prose and rhyme the honeyed breath of praise no time to woo the train must go long ere the sun is down to reach before the nightwinds blow the manysteepled town t is midnight street and square are still dark roll the whispering waves that lap the piers beneath the hill ridged thick with ancient graves ah gentle sleep thy hand will smooth the weary couch of pain when all thy poppies fail to soothe the lovers throbbing brain t is morn the orangemantled sun breaks through the fading gray and long and loud the castle gun peals oer the glistening bay thank god t is day with eager eye he hails the morning shine if art can win or gold can buy the maiden shall be mine part third the conquest who saw this hussy when she came what is the wench and who they whisper agnes is her name pray what has she to do the housemaids parley at the gate the scullions on the stair and in the footmens grave debate the butler deigns to share black dinah stolen when a child and sold on boston pier grown up in service petted spoiled speaks in the coachmans ear what all this household at his will and all are yet too few more servants and more servants still this pert young madam too servant fine servant laughed aloud the man of coach and steeds she looks too fair she steps too proud this girl with golden beads i tell you you may fret and frown and call her what you choose you ll find my lady in her gown your mistress in her shoes ah gentle maidens free from blame god grant you never know the little whisper loud with shame that makes the world your foe why tell the lordly flatterers art that won the maidens ear the fluttering of the frightened heart the blush the smile the tear alas it were the saddening tale that every language knows the wooing wind the yielding sail the sunbeam and the rose and now the gown of sober stuff has changed to fair brocade with broidered hem and hanging cuff and flower of silken braid and clasped around her blanching wrist a jewelled bracelet shines her flowing tresses massive twist a glittering net confines and mingling with their truant wave a fretted chain is hung but ah the gift her mother gave its beads are all unstrung her place is at the masters board where none disputes her claim she walks beside the mansions lord his bride in all but name the busy tongues have ceased to talk or speak in softened tone so gracious in her daily walk the angel light has shown no want that kindness may relieve assails her heart in vain the lifting of a ragged sleeve will check her palfreys rein a thoughtful calm a quiet grace in every movement shown reveal her moulded for the place she may not call her own and save that on her youthful brow there broods a shadowy care no matron sealed with holy vow in all the land so fair part fourth the rescue a ship comes foaming up the bay along the pier she glides before her furrow melts away a courier mounts and rides haste haste post haste the letters bear sir harry frankland these sad news to tell the loving pair the knight must cross the seas alas we part the lips that spoke lost all their rosy red as when a crystal cup is broke and all its wine is shed nay droop not thus whereer he cried i go by land or sea my love my life my joy my pride thy place is still by me through town and city far and wide their wandering feet have strayed from alpine lake to ocean tide and cold sierras shade at length they see the waters gleam amid the fragrant bowers where lisbon mirrors in the stream her belt of ancient towers red is the orange on its bough tomorrows sun shall fling oer cintras hazelshaded brow the flush of aprils wing the streets are loud with noisy mirth they dance on every green the mornings dial marks the birth of proud braganzas queen at eve beneath their pictured dome the gilded courtiers throng the broad moidores have cheated rome of all her lords of song ah lisbon dreams not of the day pleased with her painted scenes when all her towers shall slide away as now these canvas screens the spring has passed the summer fled and yet they linger still though autumns rustling leaves have spread the flank of cintras hill the town has learned their saxon name and touched their english gold nor tale of doubt nor hint of blame from over sea is told three hours the first november dawn has climbed with feeble ray through mists like heavy curtains drawn before the darkened day how still the muffled echoes sleep hark hark a hollow sound a noise like chariots rumbling deep beneath the solid ground the channel lifts the water slides and bares its bar of sand anon a mountain billow strides and crashes oer the land the turrets lean the steeples reel like masts on oceans swell and clash a long discordant peal the deathdoomed citys knell the pavement bursts the earth upheaves beneath the staggering town the turrets crack the castle cleaves the spires come rushing down around the lurid mountains glow with strange unearthly gleams while black abysses gape below then close in jagged seams and all is over street and square in ruined heaps are piled ah where is she so frail so fair amid the tumult wild unscathed she treads the wreckpiled street whose narrow gaps afford a pathway for her bleeding feet to seek her absent lord a temples broken walls arrest her wild and wandering eyes beneath its shattered portal pressed her lord unconscious lies the power that living hearts obey shall lifeless blocks withstand love led her footsteps where he lay love nerves her womans hand one cry the marble shaft she grasps up heaves the ponderous stone he breathes her fainting form he clasps her life has bought his own part fifth the reward how like the starless night of death our beings brief eclipse when faltering heart and failing breath have bleached the fading lips the earth has folded like a wave and thrice a thousand score clasped shroudless in their closing grave the sun shall see no more she lives what guerdon shall repay his debt of ransomed life one word can charm all wrongs away the sacred name of wife the love that won her girlish charms must shield her matron fame and write beneath the frankland arms the village beautys name go call the priest no vain delay shall dim the sacred ring who knows what change the passing day the fleeting hour may bring before the holy altar bent there kneels a goodly pair a stately man of high descent a woman passing fair no jewels lend the blinding sheen that meaner beauty needs but on her bosom heaves unseen a string of golden beads the vow is spoke the prayer is said and with a gentle pride the lady agnes lifts her head sir harry franklands bride no more her faithful heart shall bear those griefs so meekly borne the passing sneer the freezing stare the icy look of scorn no more the blueeyed english dames their haughty lips shall curl wheneer a hissing whisper names the poor new england girl but stay his mothers haughty brow the pride of ancient race will plighted faith and holy vow win back her fond embrace too well she knew the saddening tale of love no vow had blest that turned his blushing honors pale and stained his knightly crest they seek his northern home alas he goes alone before his own dear agnes may not pass the proud ancestral door he stood before the stately dame he spoke she calmly heard but not to pity nor to blame she breathed no single word he told his love her faith betrayed she heard with tearless eyes could she forgive the erring maid she stared in cold surprise how fond her heart he told how true the haughty eyelids fell the kindly deeds she loved to do she murmured it is well but when he told that fearful day and how her feet were led to where entombed in life he lay the breathing with the dead and how she bruised her tender breasts against the crushing stone that still the strongarmed clown protests no man can lift alone oh then the frozen spring was broke by turns she wept and smiled sweet agnes so the mother spoke god bless my angel child she saved thee from the jaws of death t is thine to right her wrongs i tell thee i who gave thee breath to her thy life belongs thus agnes won her noble name her lawless lovers hand the lowly maiden so became a lady in the land part sixth conclusion the tale is done it little needs to track their after ways and string again the golden beads of loves uncounted days they leave the fair ancestral isle for bleak new englands shore how gracious is the courtly smile of all who frowned before again through lisbons orange bowers they watch the rivers gleam and shudder as her shadowy towers shake in the trembling stream fate parts at length the fondest pair his cheek alas grows pale the breast that trampling death could spare his noiseless shafts assail he longs to change the heaven of blue for englands clouded sky to breathe the air his boyhood knew he seeks then but to die hard by the terraced hillside town where healing streamlets run still sparkling with their old renown the waters of the sun the lady agnes raised the stone that marks his honored grave and there sir harry sleeps alone by wiltshire avons wave the home of early love was dear she sought its peaceful shade and kept her state for many a year with none to make afraid at last the evil days were come that saw the red cross fall she hears the rebels rattling drum farewell to frankland hall i tell you as my tale began the hall is standing still and you kind listener maid or man may see it if you will the box is glistening huge and green like trees the lilacs grow three elms higharching still are seen and one lies stretched below the hangings rough with velvet flowers flap on the latticed wall and oer the mossy ridgepole towers the rockhewn chimney tall the doors on mighty hinges clash with massive bolt and bar the heavy englishmoulded sash scarce can the nightwinds jar behold the chosen room he sought alone to fast and pray each year as chill november brought the dismal earthquake day there hung the rapier blade he wore bent in its flattened sheath the coat the shrieking woman tore caught in her clenching teeth the coat with tarnished silver lace she snapped at as she slid and down upon her deathwhite face crashed the huge coffins lid a graded terrace yet remains if on its turf you stand and look along the wooded plains that stretch on either hand the broken forest walls define a dim receding view where on the far horizons line he cut his vista through if further story you shall crave or ask for living proof go see old julia born a slave beneath sir harrys roof she told me half that i have told and she remembers well the mansion as it looked of old before its glories fell the box when round the terraced square its glossy wall was drawn the climbing vines the snowballs fair the roses on the lawn and julia says with truthful look stamped on her wrinkled face that in her own black hands she took the coat with silver lace and you may hold the story light or if you like believe but there it was the womans bite a mouthful from the sleeve now go your ways i need not tell the moral of my rhyme but youths and maidens ponder well this tale of olden time the ploughman anniversary of the berkshire agricultural society october clear the brown path to meet his coulters gleam lo on he comes behind his smoking team with toils bright dewdrops on his sunburnt brow the lord of earth the hero of the plough first in the field before the reddening sun last in the shadows when the day is done line after line along the bursting sod marks the broad acres where his feet have trod still where he treads the stubborn clods divide the smooth fresh furrow opens deep and wide matted and dense the tangled turf upheaves mellow and dark the ridgy cornfield cleaves up the steep hillside where the laboring train slants the long track that scores the level plain through the moist valley clogged with oozing clay the patient convoy breaks its destined way at every turn the loosening chains resound the swinging ploughshare circles glistening round till the wide field one billowy waste appears and wearied hands unbind the panting steers these are the hands whose sturdy labor brings the peasants food the golden pomp of kings this is the page whose letters shall be seen changed by the sun to words of living green this is the scholar whose immortal pen spells the first lesson hunger taught to men these are the lines which heavencommanded toil shows on his deed the charter of the soil o gracious mother whose benignant breast wakes us to life and lulls us all to rest how thy sweet features kind to every clime mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time we stain thy flowers they blossom oer the dead we rend thy bosom and it gives us bread oer the red field that trampling strife has torn waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain still thy soft answer is the growing grain yet o our mother while uncounted charms steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms let not our virtues in thy love decay and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away no by these hills whose banners now displayed in blazing cohorts autumn has arrayed by yon twin summits on whose splintery crests the tossing hemlocks hold the eagles nests by these fair plains the mountain circle screens and feeds with streamlets from its dark ravines true to their home these faithful arms shall toil to crown with peace their own untainted soil and true to god to freedom to mankind if her chained bandogs faction shall unbind these stately forms that bending even now bowed their strong manhood to the humble plough shall rise erect the guardians of the land the same stern iron in the same right hand till oer their hills the shouts of triumph run the sword has rescued what the ploughshare won spring winter is past the heart of nature warms beneath the wrecks of unresisted storms doubtful at first suspected more than seen the southern slopes are fringed with tender green on sheltered banks beneath the dripping eaves springs earliest nurslings spread their glowing leaves bright with the hues from wider pictures won white azure golden drift or sky or sun the snowdrop bearing on her patient breast the frozen trophy torn from winters crest the violet gazing on the arch of blue till her own iris wears its deepened hue the spendthrift crocus bursting through the mould naked and shivering with his cup of gold swelled with new life the darkening elm on high prints her thick buds against the spotted sky on all her boughs the stately chestnut cleaves the gummy shroud that wraps her embryo leaves the housefly stealing from his narrow grave drugged with the opiate that november gave beats with faint wing against the sunny pane or crawls tenacious oer its lucid plain from shaded chinks of lichencrusted walls in languid curves the gliding serpent crawls the bogs green harper thawing from his sleep twangs a hoarse note and tries a shortened leap on floating rails that face the softening noons the still shy turtles range their dark platoons or toiling aimless oer the mellowing fields trail through the grass their tessellated shields at last young april ever frail and fair wooed by her playmate with the golden hair chased to the margin of receding floods oer the soft meadows starred with opening buds in tears and blushes sighs herself away and hides her cheek beneath the flowers of may then the proud tulip lights her beacon blaze her clustering curls the hyacinth displays oer her tall blades the crested fleurdelis like blueeyed pallas towers erect and free with yellower flames the lengthened sunshine glows and love lays bare the passionbreathing rose queen of the lake along its reedy verge the rival lily hastens to emerge her snowy shoulders glistening as she strips till morn is sultan of her parted lips then bursts the song from every leafy glade the yielding seasons bridal serenade then flash the wings returning summer calls through the deep arches of her forest halls the bluebird breathing from his azure plumes the fragrance borrowed where the myrtle blooms the thrush poor wanderer dropping meekly down clad in his remnant of autumnal brown the oriole drifting like a flake of fire rent by a whirlwind from a blazing spire the robin jerking his spasmodic throat repeats imperious his staccato note the crackbrained bobolink courts his crazy mate poised on a bulrush tipsy with his weight nay in his cage the lone canary sings feels the soft air and spreads his idle wings why dream i here within these caging walls deaf to her voice while blooming nature calls peering and gazing with insatiate looks through blinding lenses or in wearying books off gloomy spectres of the shrivelled past fly with the leaves that fill the autumn blast ye imps of science whose relentless chains lock the warm tides within these living veins close your dim cavern while its captive strays dazzled and giddy in the mornings blaze the study yet in the darksome crypt i left so late whose only altar is its rusted grate sepulchral rayless joyless as it seems shamed by the glare of mays refulgent beams while the dim seasons dragged their shrouded train its paler splendors were not quite in vain from these dull bars the cheerful firelights glow streamed through the casement oer the spectral snow here while the nightwind wreaked its frantic will on the loose ocean and the rockbound hill rent the cracked topsail from its quivering yard and rived the oak a thousand storms had scarred fenced by these walls the peaceful taper shone nor felt a breath to slant its trembling cone not all unblest the mild interior scene when the red curtain spread its falling screen oer some light task the lonely hours were past and the long evening only flew too fast or the wide chair its leathern arms would lend in genial welcome to some easy friend stretched on its bosom with relaxing nerves slow moulding plastic to its hollow curves perchance indulging if of generous creed in brave sir walters dreamcompelling weed or happier still the evening hour would bring to the round table its expected ring and while the punchbowls sounding depths were stirred its silver cherubs smiling as they heard our hearts would open as at evenings hour the closesealed primrose frees its hidden flower such the warm life this dim retreat has known not quite deserted when its guests were flown nay filled with friends an unobtrusive set guiltless of calls and cards and etiquette ready to answer never known to ask claiming no service prompt for every task on those dark shelves no housewife hand profanes oer his mute files the monarch folio reigns a mingled race the wreck of chance and time that talk all tongues and breathe

stands the gray patriarch of the graver rows its fourth ripe century narrowing to its close not daily conned but glorious still to view with glistening letters wrought in red and blue there towers

standing there the bells when oer the street the morning peal is flung from yon tall belfry with the brazen tongue its wide vibrations wafted by the gale to each far listener tell a different tale the sexton stooping to the quivering floor till the great caldron spills its brassy roar whirls the hot axle counting one by one each dull concussion till his task is done toils patient daughter when the welcome note clangs through the silence from the steeples throat streams a white unit to the checkered street demure but guessing whom she soon shall meet the bell responsive to her secret flame with every note repeats her lovers name the lover tenant of the neighboring lane sighing and fearing lest he sigh in vain hears the stern accents as they come and go their only burden one despairing no oceans rough child whom many a shore has known ere homeward breezes swept him to his own starts at the echo as it circles round a thousand memories kindling with the sound the early favorites unforgotten charms whose blue initials stain his tawny arms his first farewell the flapping canvas spread the seaward streamers crackling overhead his kind pale mother not ashamed to weep her firstborns bridal with the haggard deep while the brave father stood with tearless eye smiling and choking with his last goodby t is but a wave whose spreading circle beats with the same impulse every nerve it meets yet who shall count the varied shapes that ride on the round surge of that aerial tide o child of earth if floating sounds like these steal from thyself their power to wound or please if here or there thy changing will inclines as the bright zodiac shifts its rolling signs look at thy heart and when its depths are known then try thy brothers judging by thine own but keep thy wisdom to the narrower range while its own standards are the sport of change nor count us rebels when we disobey the passing breath that holds thy passions sway nonresistance perhaps too far in these considerate days has patience carried her submissive ways wisdom has taught us to be calm and meek to take one blow and turn the other cheek it is not written what a man shall do if the rude caitiff smite the other too land of our fathers in thine hour of need god help thee guarded by the passive creed as the lone pilgrim trusts to beads and cowl when through the forest rings the gray wolfs howl as the deep galleon trusts her gilded prow when the black corsair slants athwart her bow as the poor pheasant with his peaceful mien trusts to his feathers shining goldengreen when the dark plumage with the crimson beak has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak so trust thy friends whose babbling tongues would charm the lifted sabre from thy foemans arm thy torches ready for the answering peal from bellowing fort and thunderfreighted keel the moral bully yon wheyfaced brother who delights to wear a weedy flux of illconditioned hair seems of the sort that in a crowded place one elbows freely into smallest space a timid creature lax of knee and hip whom small disturbance whitens round the lip one of those harmless spectacled machines the holyweek of protestants convenes whom schoolboys question if their walk transcends the last advices of maternal friends whom john obedient to his masters sign conducts laborious up to ninetynine while peter glistening with luxurious scorn husks his white ivories like an ear of corn dark in the brow and bilious in the cheek whose yellowish linen flowers but once a week conspicuous annual in their threadbare suits and the laced highlows which they call their boots well mayst thou shun that dingy front severe but him o stranger him thou canst not fear be slow to judge and slower to despise man of broad shoulders and heroic size the tiger writhing from the boas rings drops at the fountain where the cobra stings in that lean phantom whose extended glove points to the text of universal love behold the master that can tame thee down to crouch the vassal of his sunday frown his velvet throat against thy corded wrist his loosened tongue against thy doubled fist the moral bully though he never swears nor kicks intruders down his entry stairs though meekness plants his backwardsloping hat and nonresistance ties his white cravat though his black broadcloth glories to be seen in the same plight with shylocks gaberdine hugs the same passion to his narrow breast that heaves the cuirass on the troopers chest hears the same hellhounds yelling in his rear that chase from port the maddened buccaneer feels the same comfort while his acrid words turn the sweet milk of kindness into curds or with grim logic prove beyond debate that all we love is worthiest of our hate as the scarred ruffian of the pirates deck when his long swivel rakes the staggering wreck heaven keep us all is every rascal clown whose arm is stronger free to knock us down has every scarecrow whose cachectic soul seems fresh from bedlam airing on parole who though he carries but a doubtful trace of angel visits on his hungry face from lack of marrow or the coins to pay has dodged some vices in a shabby way the right to stick us with his cutthroat terms and bait his homilies with his brother worms the minds diet no life worth naming ever comes to good if always nourished on the selfsame food the creeping mite may live so if he please and feed on stilton till he turns to cheese but cool magendie proves beyond a doubt if mammals try it that their eyes drop out no reasoning natures find it safe to feed for their sole diet on a single creed it spoils their eyeballs while it spares their tongues and starves the heart to feed the noisy lungs when the first larvae on the elm are seen the crawling wretches like its leaves are green ere chill october shakes the latest down they like the foliage change their tint to brown on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy you stretch to pluck it tis a butterfly the flattened treetoads so resemble bark theyre hard to find as ethiops in the dark the woodcock stiffening to fictitious mud cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood so by long living on a single lie nay on one truth will creatures get its dye red yellow green they take their subjects hue except when squabbling turns them black and blue our limitations we trust and fear we question and believe from lifes dark threads a trembling faith to weave frail as the web that misty night has spun whose dewgemmed awnings glitter in the sun while the calm centuries spell their lessons out each truth we conquer spreads the realm of doubt when sinais summit was jehovahs throne the chosen prophet knew his voice alone when pilates hall that awful question heard the heavenly captive answered not a word eternal truth beyond our hopes and fears sweep the vast orbits of thy myriad spheres from age to age while history carves sublime on her waste rock the flaming curves of time how the wild swayings of our planet show that worlds unseen surround the world we know the old player the curtain rose in thunders long and loud the galleries rung the veteran actor bowed in flaming line the telltales of the stage showed on his brow the autograph of age pale hueless waves amid his clustered hair and umbered shadows prints of toil and care round the wide circle glanced his vacant eye he strove to speak his voice was but a sigh year after year had seen its shortlived race flit past the scenes and others take their place yet the old prompter watched his accents still his name still flaunted on the evenings bill heroes the monarchs of the scenic floor had died in earnest and were heard no more beauties whose cheeks such roseate bloom oerspread they faced the footlights in unborrowed red had faded slowly through successive shades to gray duennas foils of younger maids sweet voices lost the melting tones that start with southern throbs the sturdy saxon heart while fresh sopranos shook the painted sky with their long breathless quivering locustcry yet there he stood the man of other days in the clear presents full unsparing blaze as on the oak a faded leaf that clings while a new april spreads its burnished wings how bright yon rows that soared in triple tier their central sun the flashing chandelier how dim the eye that sought with doubtful aim some friendly smile it still might dare to claim how fresh these hearts his own how worn and cold such the sad thoughts that longdrawn sigh had told no word yet faltered on his trembling tongue again again the crashing galleries rung as the old guardsman at the bugles blast hears in its strain the echoes of the past so as the plaudits rolled and thundered round a life of memories startled at the sound he lived again the page of earliest days days of small fee and parsimonious praise then lithe young romeo hark that silvered tone from those smooth lips alas they were his own then the bronzed moor with all his love and woe told his strange tale of midnight melting snow and dark plumed hamlet with his cloak and blade looked on the royal ghost himself a shade all in one flash his youthful memories came traced in bright hues of evanescent flame as the spent swimmers in the lifelong dream while the last bubble rises through the stream call him not old whose visionary brain holds oer the past its undivided reign for him in vain the envious seasons roll who bears eternal summer in his soul if yet the minstrels song the poets lay spring with her birds or children at their play or maidens smile or heavenly dream of art stir the few lifedrops creeping round his heart turn to the record where his years are told count his gray hairs they cannot make him old what magic power has changed the faded mime one breath of memory on the dust of time as the last window in the buttressed wall of some gray minster tottering to its fall though to the passing crowd its hues are spread a dull mosaic yellow green and red viewed from within a radiant glory shows when through its pictured screen the sunlight flows and kneeling pilgrims on its storied pane see angels glow in every shapeless stain so streamed the vision through his sunken eye clad in the splendors of his morning sky all the wild hopes his eager boyhood knew all the young fancies riper years proved true the sweet lowwhispered words the winning glance from queens of song from houris of the dance wealths lavish gift and flatterys soothing phrase and beautys silence when her blush was praise and melting pride her lashes wet with tears triumphs and banquets wreaths and crowns and cheers pangs of wild joy that perish on the tongue and all that poets dream but leave unsung in every heart some viewless founts are fed from faroff hillsides where the dews were shed on the worn features of the weariest face some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace as in old gardens left by exiled kings the marble basins tell of hidden springs but gray with dust and overgrown with weeds their choking jets the passer little heeds till times revenges break their seals away and clad in rainbow light the waters play good night fond dreamer let the curtain fall the worlds a stage and we are players all a strange rehearsal kings without their crowns and threadbare lords and jewelwearing clowns speak the vain words that mock their throbbing hearts as want stern prompter spells them out their parts the tinselled hero whom we praise and pay is twice an actor in a twofold play we smile at children when a painted screen seems to their simple eyes a real scene ask the poor hireling who has left his throne to seek the cheerless home he calls his own which of his double lives most real seems the world of solid fact or scenic dreams canvas or clouds the footlights or the spheres the play of two short hours or seventy years dream on though heaven may woo our open eyes through their closed lids we look on fairer skies truth is for other worlds and hope for this the cheating future lends the presents bliss life is a running shade with fettered hands that chases phantoms over shifting sands death a still spectre on a marble seat with ever clutching palms and shackled feet the airy shapes that mock lifes slender chain the flying joys he strives to clasp in vain death only grasps to live is to pursue dream on there s nothing but illusion true a poem dedication of the pittsfield cemetery september angel of death extend thy silent reign stretch thy dark sceptre oer this new domain no sable car along the winding road has borne to earth its unresisting load no sudden mound has risen yet to show where the pale slumberer folds his arms below no marble gleams to bid his memory live in the brief lines that hurrying time can give yet o destroyer from thy shrouded throne look on our gift this realm is all thine own fair is the scene its sweetness oft beguiled from their dim paths the children of the wild the darkhaired maiden loved its grassy dells the feathered warrior claimed its wooded swells still on its slopes the ploughmans ridges show the pointed flints that left his fatal bow chipped with rough art and slow barbarian toil last of his wrecks that strews the alien soil here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store till the brown arms of labor held no more the scythes broad meadow with its dusky blush the sickles harvest with its velvet flush the greenhaired maize her silken tresses laid in soft luxuriance on her harsh brocade the gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume the coarser wheat that rolls in lakes of bloom its coral stems and milkwhite flowers alive with the wide murmurs of the scattered hive here glowed the apple with the pencilled streak of morning painted on its southern cheek the pears long necklace strung with golden drops arched like the banian oer its pillared props here crept the growths that paid the laborers care with the cheap luxuries wealth consents to spare here sprang the healing herbs which could not save the hand that reared them from the neighboring grave yet all its varied charms forever free from task and tribute labor yields to thee no more when april sheds her fitful rain the sowers hand shall cast its flying grain no more when autumn strews the flaming leaves the reapers band shall gird its yellow sheaves for thee alike the circling seasons flow till the first blossoms heave the latest snow in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds lifes withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep till what thou sowest mightier angels reap spirit of beauty let thy graces blend with loveliest nature all that art can lend come from the bowers where summers lifeblood flows through the red lips of junes halfopen rose dressed in bright hues the loving sunshines dower for tranquil nature owns no mourning flower come from the forest where the beechs screen bars the fierce noonbeam with its flakes of green stay the rude axe that bares the shadowy plains stanch the deep wound that dries the maples veins come with the stream whose silverbraided rills fling their unclasping bracelets from the hills till in one gleam beneath the forests wings melts the white glitter of a hundred springs come from the steeps where look majestic forth from their twin thrones the giants of the north on the huge shapes that crouching at their knees stretch their broad shoulders rough with shaggy trees through the wide waste of ether not in vain their softened gaze shall reach our distant plain there while the mourner turns his aching eyes on the blue mounds that print the bluer skies nature shall whisper that the fading view of mightiest grief may wear a heavenly hue cherub of wisdom let thy marble page leave its sad lesson new to every age teach us to live not grudging every breath to the chill winds that waft us on to death but ruling calmly every pulse it warms and tempering gently every word it forms seraph of love in heavens adoring zone nearest of all around the central throne while with soft hands the pillowed turf we spread that soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed with the low whisper who shall first be laid in the dark chambers yet unbroken shade let thy sweet radiance shine rekindled here and all we cherish grow more truly dear here in the gates of deaths oerhanging vault oh teach us kindness for our brothers fault lay all our wrongs beneath this peaceful sod and lead our hearts to mercy and its god father of all in deaths relentless claim we read thy mercy by its sterner name in the bright flower that decks the solemn bier we see thy glory in its narrowed sphere in the deep lessons that affliction draws we trace the curves of thy encircling laws in the long sigh that sets our spirits free we own the love that calls us back to thee through the hushed street along the silent plain the spectral future leads its mourning train dark with the shadows of uncounted bands where mans white lips and womans wringing hands track the still burden rolling slow before that love

its perfumed breath so parted by the rolling flood the love that springs from common blood needs but a single sunlit hour of mingling smiles to bud and flower unharmed its slumbering life has flown from shore to shore from zone to zone where summers falling roses stain the tepid waves of pontchartrain or where the lichen creeps below katahdins wreaths of whirling snow though fiery sun and

sprinkled dots brands of the noontide beam the cardinal and the bloodred spots its double in the stream as if some wounded eagles breast slow throbbing oer the plain had left its airy path impressed in drops of scarlet rain and hark and hark the woodland rings there thrilled the thrushs soul and look that flash of flamy wings the fireplumed oriole above the henhawk swims and swoops flung from the bright blue sky below the robin hops and whoops his piercing indian cry beauty runs virgin in the woods robed in her rustic green and oft a longing thought intrudes as if we might have seen her every

of slender violets though all the gods their garlands shower i too may bring one purple flower alas what blossom shall i bring that opens in my northern spring the garden beds have all run wild so trim when i was yet a child flat plantains and unseemly stalks have crept across the gravel walks the vines are dead long long ago the almond buds no longer blow no more upon its mound i see the azure plumebound fleurdelis where once the tulips used to show in straggling tufts the pansies grow the grass has quenched my whiterayed gem the flowering star of bethlehem though its long blade of glossy green and pallid stripe may still be seen nature who treads her nobles down and gives their birthright to the clown has sown her baseborn weedy things above the gardens queens and kings yet one sweet flower of ancient race springs in the old familiar place when snows were melting down the vale and earth unlaced her icy mail and march his stormy trumpet blew and tender green came peeping through i loved the earliest one to seek that broke the soil with emerald beak and watch the trembling bells so blue spread on the column as it grew meek child of earth thou wilt not shame the sweet dead poets holy name the god of music gave thee birth called from the crimsonspotted earth where sobbing his young life away his own fair hyacinthus lay the hyacinth my garden gave shall lie upon that roman

sail is there morning a woman looking on the sea midnight with lamps the long veranda burns come wandering sail they watch they burn for thee suns come and go alas no bark returns and feet are thronging on the pebbly sands and torches flaring in the weedy caves whereer the waters lay with icy hands the shapes uplifted from their coral graves vainly they seek the idle quest is oer the coarse dark women with their hanging locks and lean wild children gather from the shore to the black hovels bedded in the rocks but love still prayed with agonizing wail one one last look ye heaving waters yield till ocean clashing in his jointed mail raised the pale burden on his level shield slow from the shore the sullen waves retire his form a nobler element shall claim nature baptized him in ethereal fire and death shall crown him with a wreath of flame fade mortal semblance never to return swift is the change within thy crimson shroud seal the white ashes in the peaceful urn all else has risen in yon silvery cloud sleep where thy gentle adonais lies whose open page lay on thy dying heart both in the smile of those bluevaulted skies earths fairest dome of all divinest art breathe for

as the voice of the watch to the mariners dream as the footstep of spring on the icegirdled stream there comes a soft footstep a whisper to me the vision is over the rivulet free we have trod from the threshold of turbulent march till the green scarf of april is hung on the larch and down the bright hillside that welcomes the day we hear the warm panting of beautiful may we will part before summer has opened her wing and the bosom of june swells the bodice of spring while the hope of the season lies fresh in the bud and the young life of nature runs warm in our blood it is but a word and the chain is unbound the bracelet of steel drops unclasped to the ground no hand shall replace it it rests where it fell it is but one word that we all know too well yet the hawk with the wildness untamed in his eye if you free him stares round ere he springs to the sky the slave whom no longer his fetters restrain will turn for a moment and look at his chain our parting is not as the friendship of years that chokes with the blessing it speaks through its tears we have walked in a garden and looking around have plucked a few leaves from the myrtles we found but now at the gate of the garden we stand and the moment has come for unclasping the hand will you drop it like lead and in silence retreat like the twenty crushed forms from an omnibus seat nay hold it one moment the last we may share i stretch it in kindness and not for my fare you may pass through the doorway in rank or in file if your ticket from nature is stamped with a smile for the sweetest of smiles is the smile as we part when the light round the lips is a ray from the heart and lest a stray tear from its fountain might swell we will seal the bright spring with a quiet farewell the hudson after a lecture at albany t was a vision of childhood that came with its dawn ere the curtain that covered lifes daystar was drawn the nurse told the tale when the shadows grew long and the mothers soft lullaby breathed it in song there flows a fair stream by the hills of the west she sang to her boy as he lay on her breast along its smooth margin thy fathers have played beside its deep waters their ashes are laid i wandered afar from the land of my birth i saw the old rivers renowned upon earth but fancy still painted that wideflowing stream with the manyhued pencil of infancys dream i saw the green banks of the castlecrowned rhine where the grapes drink the moonlight and change it to wine i stood by the avon whose waves as they glide still whisper his glory who sleeps at their side but my heart would still yearn for the sound of the waves that sing as they flow by my forefathers graves if manhood yet honors my cheek with a tear i care not who sees it no blush for it here farewell to the deepbosomed stream of the west i fling this loose blossom to float on its breast nor let the dear love of its children grow cold till the channel is dry where its waters have rolled december the new eden meeting

pilgrims plough then sprang from many a rockstrewn field the rippling grass the nodding grain such growths as english meadows yield to scanty sun and frequent rain but when the fiery days were done and autumn brought his purple haze then kindling in the slanted sun the hillsides gleamed with golden maize the food was scant the fruits were few a redstreak glistening here and there perchance in statelier precincts grew some stern old puritanic pear austere in taste and tough at core its unrelenting bulk was shed to ripen in the pilgrims store when all the summer sweets were fled such was his lot to front the storm with iron heart and marble brow nor ripen till his earthly form was cast from lifes autumnal bough but ever on the bleakest rock we bid the brightest beacon glow and still upon the thorniest stock the sweetest roses love to blow so on our rude and wintry soil we feed the kindling flame of art and steal the tropics blushing spoil to bloom on natures iceclad heart see how the softening mothers breast warms to her childrens patient wiles her lips by loving labor pressed break in a thousand dimpling smiles from when the flushing bud of june dawns with its first auroral hue

and hemlock cones dear though the shadowy maple be and dearer still the whispering pine dearest yon russetladen tree browned by the heavy rubbing kine there childhood flung its rustling stone there

mothers side the babes of days gone by all nurslings of her juno breasts whose milk is never dry we come again like halfgrown boys and gather at her beck about her knees and on her lap and clinging round her neck we find her at her stately door and in her ancient chair dressed in the robes of red and green she always loved to wear her eye has all its radiant youth her cheek its morning flame we drop our roses as we go hers flourish still the same we have been playing many an hour and far away weve strayed some laughing in the cheerful sun some lingering in the shade and some have tired and laid them down where darker shadows fall dear as her loving voice may be they cannot hear its call what miles we ve travelled since we shook the dewdrops from our shoes we gathered on this classic green so famed for heavy dues how many boys have joined the game how many slipped away since weve been running up and down and having out our play one boy at work with book and brief and one with gown and band one sailing vessels on the pool one digging sand one flying paper kites on change one planting little pills the seeds of certain annual flowers well known as little bills what maidens met us on our way and clasped us hand in hand what cherubs not the legless kind that fly but never stand how many a youthful head weve seen put on its silver crown what sudden changes back again to youths empurpled brown but fairer sights have met our eyes and broader lights have shone since others lit their midnight lamps where once we trimmed our own a thousand trains that flap the sky with flags of rushing fire and throbbing in the thunderers hand thoughts millionchorded lyre weve seen the sparks of empire fly beyond the mountain bars till glittering oer the western wave they joined the setting stars and ocean trodden into paths that trampling giants ford to find the planets vertebrae and sink its spinal cord weve tried reform and chloroform and both have turned our brain when france called

life its varnish and veneer its stuccofronts of character flake off and disappear we ve learned that oft the brownest hands will heap the biggest pile and met with many a perfect brick beneath a rimless tile what dreams we ve had of deathless name as scholars statesmen bards while fame the lady with the trump held up her picture cards till having nearly played our game she gayly whispered ah i said you should be something grand youll soon be grandpapa well well the old have had their day the young must take their turn theres something always to forget and something still to learn but how to tell whats old or young the taproot from the sprigs since florida revealed her fount to ponce de leon twiggs the wisest was a freshman once just freed from bar and bolt as noisy as a kettledrum as

these but ah when science drops her shield its peaceful shelter proved in vain and bares her snowwhite arm to wield the sad stern ministry of pain when shuddering oer the fount of life she folds her heavenanointed wings to lift unmoved the glittering knife that searches all its crimson springs when faithful to her ancient lore she thrusts aside her fragrant balm for blistering juice or cankering ore and tames them till they cure or calm when in her gracious hand are seen the dregs and scum of earth and seas her kindness counting all things clean that lend the sighing sufferer ease though on the field that death has won she save some stragglers in retreat these single acts of mercy done are but confessions of defeat what though our tempered poisons save some wrecks of life from aches and

we come in one tumultuous tide one surge of wild emotion as crowding through the frith of clyde rolls in the western ocean as when yon cloudless quartered moon hangs oer each storied river the swelling breasts of ayr and doon with sea green wavelets quiver the century shrivels like a scroll the past becomes the present and face to face and soul to soul we greet the monarchpeasant while shenstone strained in feeble flights with corydon and phillis while wolfe was climbing abrahams heights to snatch the bourbon lilies who heard the wailing infants cry the babe beneath the sheeliug whose song tonight in every sky will shake earths starry ceiling whose passionbreathing voice ascends and floats like incense oer us whose ringing lay of friendship blends with labors anvil chorus we love him not for sweetest song though never tone so tender we love him even in his wrong his wasteful selfsurrender we praise him not for gifts divine his muse was born of woman his manhood breathes in every line was ever heart more human we love him praise him just for this in every form and feature through wealth and want through woe and bliss he saw his fellowcreature no soul could sink beneath his love not even angel blasted no mortal power could soar above the pride that all outlasted ay heaven had set one living man beyond the pedants tether his virtues frailties he may scan who weighs them all together i fling my pebble on the cairn of him though dead undying sweet natures nursling bonniest bairn beneath her daisies lying the waning suns the wasting globe shall spare the minstrels story the centuries weave his purple robe the mountainmist of glory at a meeting of friends august i remember why yes god bless me and was it so long ago i fear im growing forgetful as old folks do you know it must have been in forty i would say thirtynine we talked this matter over i and a friend of mine he said well now old fellow im thinking that you and i if we act like other people shall be older by and by what though the bright blue ocean is smooth as a pond can be there is always a line of breakers to fringe the broadest sea were taking it mighty easy but that is nothing strange for up to the age of thirty we spend our years like change but creeping up towards the forties as fast as the old years fill and time steps in for payment we seem to change a bill i know it i said old fellow you speak the solemn truth a man cant live to a hundred and likewise keep his youth but what if the ten years coming shall silverstreak my hair you know i shall then be forty of course i shall not care at forty a man grows heavy and tired of fun and noise leaves dress to the fiveandtwenties and love to the silly boys no foppish tricks at forty no pinching of waists and toes but highlow shoes and flannels and good thick worsted hose but one fine august morning i found myself awake my birthday by jove im forty yes forty and no mistake why this is the very milestone i think i used to hold that when a fellow had come to a fellow would then be old but that is the young folks nonsense theyre full of their foolish stuff a mans in his prime at forty i see that plain enough at fifty a man is wrinkled and may be bald or gray i call men old at fifty in spite of all they say at last comes another august with mist and rain and shine its mornings are slowly counted and creep to twentynine and when on the western summits the fading light appears it touches with rosy fingers the last of my fifty years there have been both men and women whose hearts were firm and bold but there never was one of fifty that loved to say im old so any elderly person that strives to shirk his years make him stand up at a table and try him by his peers now here i stand at fifty my jury gathered round sprinkled with dust of silver but not yet silvercrowned ready to meet your verdict waiting to hear it told guilty of fifty summers speak is the verdict old no say that his hearing fails him say that his sight grows dim say that hes getting wrinkled and weak in back and limb losing his wits and temper but pleading to make amends the youth of his fifty summers he finds in his twenty friends

morning dew the lusty days of long ago when you were bill and i was joe your name may flaunt a titled trail proud as a cockerels rainbow tail and mine as brief appendix wear as tam oshanters luckless mare today old friend remember still that i am joe and you are bill youve won the great worlds envied prize and grand you look in peoples eyes with h o n and l l d in big brave letters fair to see your fist old fellow off they go how are you bill how are you joe youve worn the judges ermined robe you ve taught your name to half the globe youve sung mankind a deathless strain youve made the dead past live again the world may call you what it will but you and i are joe and bill the chaffing young folks stare and say see those old buffers bent and gray they talk like fellows in their teens mad poor old boys thats what it means and shake their heads they little know the throbbing hearts of bill and joe how bill forgets his hour of pride while joe sits smiling at his side how joe in spite of times disguise finds the old schoolmate in his eyes those calm stern eyes that melt and fill as joe looks fondly up at bill ah pensive scholar what is fame a fitful tongue of leaping flame a giddy whirlwinds fickle gust that lifts a pinch of mortal dust a few swift years and who can show which dust was bill and which was joe the weary idol takes his stand holds out his bruised and aching hand while gaping thousands come and go how vain it seems this empty show till all at once his pulses thrill t is poor old joes god bless you bill and shall we breathe in happier spheres the names that pleased our mortal ears in some sweet lull of harp and song for earthborn spirits none too long just whispering of the world below where this was bill and that was joe no matter while our home is here no sounding name is half so dear when fades at length our lingering day who cares what pompous tombstones say read on the hearts that love us still hic jacet joe hic jacet bill a song of twentynine the summer dawn is breaking on auburns tangled bowers the golden light is waking on harvards ancient towers the sun is in the sky that must see us do or die ere it shine on the line of the class of at last the day is ended the tutor screws no more by doubt and fear attended each hovers round the door till the good old praeses cries while the tears stand in his eyes you have passed and are classed with the boys of not long are they in making the college halls their own instead of standing shaking too bashful to be known but they kick the seniors shins ere the second week begins when they stray in the way of the boys of if a jolly set is trolling the last der freischutz airs or a cannon bullet rolling comes bouncing down the stairs the tutors looking out sigh alas there is no doubt t is the noise of the boys of the class of four happy years together by storm and sunshine tried in changing wind and weather they rough it side by side till they hear their mother cry you are fledged and you must fly and the bell tolls the knell of the days of since then in peace or trouble full many a year has rolled and life has counted double the days that then we told yet well end as weve begun for though scattered we are one while each year sees us here round the board of though fate may throw between us the mountains or the sea no time shall ever wean us no distance set us free but around the yearly board when the flaming pledge is poured it shall claim every name on the roll of to yonder peaceful ocean that glows with sunset fires shall reach the warm emotion this welcome day inspires beyond the ridges cold where a brother toils for gold till it shine through the mine round the boy of if one whom fate has broken shall lift a moistened eye well say before he s spoken old classmate dont you cry here take the purse i hold there s a tear upon the gold it was mineit is thine ant we boys of as nearer still and nearer the fatal stars appear the living shall be dearer with each encircling year till a few old men shall say we remember t is the day let it pass with a glass for the class of as one by one is falling beneath the leaves or snows each memory still recalling the broken ring shall close till the nightwinds softly pass oer the green and growing grass where it waves on the graves of the boys of questions and answers where oh where are the visions of morning fresh as the dews of our prime gone like tenants that quit without warning down the back entry of time where oh where are lifes lilies and roses nursed in the golden dawns smile dead as the bulrushes round little moses on the old banks of the nile where are the marys and anns and elizas loving and lovely of yore look in the columns of old advertisers married and dead by the score where the gray colts and the tenyearold fillies saturdays triumph and joy gone like our friend greek achilles homers ferocious old boy dieaway dreams of ecstatic emotion hopes like young eagles at play vows of unheardof and endless devotion how ye have faded away yet through the ebbing of times mighty river leave our young blossoms to die let him roll smooth in his current forever till the last pebble is dry an impromptu not premeditated the clock has struck noon ere it thrice tell the hours we shall meet round the table that blushes with flowers and i shall blush deeper with shamedriven blood that i came to the banquet and brought not a bud who cares that his verse is a beggar in art if you see through its rags the full throb of his heart who asks if his comrade is battered and tanned when he feels his warm soul in the clasp of his hand no be it an epic or be it a line the boys will all love it because it is mine i sung their last song on the morn of the day that tore from their lives the last blossom of may it is not the sunset that glows in the wine but the smile that beams over it makes it divine i scatter these drops and behold as they fall the daystar of memory shines through them all and these are the last they are drops that i stole from a winepress that crushes the life from the soul but they ran through my heart and they sprang to my brain till our twentieth sweet summer was smiling again the old man dreams oh for one hour of youthful joy give back my twentieth spring id rather laugh a brighthaired boy than reign a graybeard king off with the spoils of wrinkled age away with learnings crown tear out lifes wisdomwritten page and dash its trophies down one moment let my lifeblood stream from boyhoods fount of flame give me one giddy reeling dream of life all love and fame my listening angel heard the prayer and calmly smiling said if i but touch thy silvered hair thy hasty wish hath sped but is there nothing in thy track to bid thee fondly stay while the swift seasons hurry back to find the wishedfor day ah truest soul of womankind without thee what were life one bliss i cannot leave behind ill take my precious wife the angel took a sapphire pen and wrote in rainbow dew the man would be a boy again and be a husband too and is there nothing yet unsaid before the change appears remember all their gifts have fled with those dissolving years why yes for memory would recall my fond paternal joys i could not bear to leave them all ill take my girl and boys the smiling angel dropped his pen why this will never do the man would be a boy again and be a father too and so i laughed my laughter woke the household with its noise and wrote my dream when morning broke to please the grayhaired boys remember forget and what shall be the song tonight if song there needs must be if every year that brings us here must steal an hour from me say shall it ring a merry peal or heave a mourning sigh oer shadows cast by years long past on moments flitting by nay take the first unbidden line the idle hour may send no studied grace can mend the face that smiles as friend on friend the balsam oozes from the pine the sweetness from the rose and so unsought a kindly thought finds language as it flows the years rush by in sounding flight i hear their ceaseless wings their songs i hear some far some near and thus the burden rings the morn has fled the noon has past the sun will soon be set the twilight fade to midnight shade rememberand forget remember all that time has brought the starry hope on high the strength attained the courage gained the love that cannot die forget the bitter brooding thought the word too harshly said the living blame love hates to name the frailties of the dead we have been younger so they say but let the seasons roll he doth not lack an almanac whose youth is in his soul the snows may clog lifes iron track but does the axle tire while bearing swift through bank and drift the engines heart of fire i lift a goblet in my hand if good old wine it hold an ancient skin to keep it in is just the thing we re told we re grayer than the dusty flask we re older than our wine our corks reveal the white top seal the stamp of ah boys we clustered in the dawn to sever in the dark a merry crew with loud halloo we climbed our painted bark we sailed her through the four years cruise we ll sail her to the last our dear old flag though but a rag still flying on her mast so gliding on each winters gale shall pipe us all on deck till faint and few the gathering crew creep oer the parting wreck her sails and streamers spread aloft to fortunes rain or shine till storm or sun shall all be one and down goes twentynine our indian summer you ll believe me dear boys t is a pleasure to rise with a welcome like this in your darling old eyes to meet the same smiles and to hear the same tone which have greeted me oft in the years that have flown were i gray as the grayest old rat in the wall my locks would turn brown at the sight of you all if my heart were as dry as the shell on the sand it would fill like the goblet i hold in my hand there are noontides of autumn when summer returns though the leaves are all garnered and sealed in their urns and the bird on his perch that was silent so long believes the sweet sunshine and breaks into song we have caged the young birds of our beautiful june their plumes are still bright and their voices in tune one mcment of sunshine from faces like these and they sing as they sung in the greengrowing trees the voices of morning how sweet is their thrill when the shadows have turned and the evening grows still the text of our lives may get wiser with age but the print was so fair on its twentieth page look off from your goblet and up from your plate come take the last journal and glance at its date then think what we fellows should say and should do if the were a and the were a ah no for the shapes that would meet with as here from the far land of shadows are ever too dear though youth flung around us its pride and its charms we should see but the comrades we clasped in our arms a health to our future a sigh for our past we love we remember we hope to the last and for all the base lies that the almanacs hold while weve youth in our hearts we can never grow old mare rubrum flash out a stream of bloodred wine for i would drink to other days and brighter shall their memory shine seen flaming through its crimson blaze the roses die the summers fade but every ghost of boyhoods dream by natures magic power is laid to sleep beneath this bloodred stream it filled the purple grapes that lay and drank the splendors of the sun where the long summers cloudless day is mirrored in the broad garonne it pictures still the bacchant shapes that saw their hoarded sunlight shed the maidens dancing on the grapes their milkwhite ankles splashed with red beneath these waves of crimson lie in rosy fetters prisoned fast those flitting shapes that never die the swiftwinged visions of the past kiss but the crystals mystic rim each shadow rends its flowery chain springs in a bubble from its brim and walks the chambers of the brain poor beauty time and fortunes wrong no shape nor feature may withstand thy wrecks are scattered all along like emptied seashells on the sand yet sprinkled with this blushing rain the dust restores each blooming girl as if the seashells moved again their glistening lips of pink and pearl here lies the home of schoolboy life with creaking stair and windswept hall and scarred by many a truant knife our old initials on the wall here rest their keen vibrations mute the shout of voices known so well the ringing laugh the wailing flute the chiding of the sharptongued bell here clad in burning robes are laid lifes blossomed joys untimely shed and here those cherished forms have strayed we miss awhile and call them dead what wizard fills the wondrous glass what soil the enchanted clusters grew that buried passions wake and pass in beaded drops of fiery dew nay take the cup of bloodred wine our hearts can boast a warmer glow filled from a vintage more divine calmed but not chilled by winters snow tonight the palest

of thy children the boys lines i m ashamed that s the fact it s a pitiful case wont any kind classmate get up in my place just remember how often ive risen before i blush as i straighten my legs on the floor there are stories once pleasing too many times told there are beauties once charming too fearfully old there are voices weve heard till we know them so well though they talked for an hour theyd have nothing to tell yet classmates friends brothers dear blessed old boys made one by a lifetime of sorrows and joys what lips have such sounds as the poorest of these though honeyed like platos by musical bees what voice is so sweet and what greeting so dear as the simple warm welcome that waits for us here the love of our boyhood still breathes in its tone and our hearts throb the answer hes one of our own nay count not our numbers some sixty we know but these are above and those under the snow and thoughts are still mingled wherever we meet for those we remember with those that we greet we have rolled on lifes journey how fast and how far one round of humanitys manywheeled car but uphill and downhill through rattle and rub old true twentyniners weve stuck to our hub while a brain lives to think or a bosom to feel we will cling to it still like the spokes of a wheel and age as it chills us shall fasten the tire that youth fitted round in his circle of fire a voice of the loyal north january third we sing our countrys song tonight with saddened voice and eye her banner droops in clouded light beneath the wintry sky well pledge her once in golden wine before her stars have set though dim one reddening orb may shine we have a country yet t were vain to sigh oer errors past the fault of sires or sons our soldier heard the threatening blast and spiked his useless guns he saw the starwreathed ensign fall by mad invaders torn but saw it from the bastioned wall that laughed their rage to scorn what though their angry cry is flung across the howling wave they smite the air with idle tongue the gathering storm who brave enough of speech the trumpet rings be silent patient calm god help them if the tempest swings the pine against the palm our toilsome years have made us tame our strength has slept unfelt the furnacefire is slow to flame that bids our ploughshares melt t is hard to lose the bread they win in spite of natures frowns to drop the iron threads we spin that weave our web of towns to see the rusting turbines stand before the emptied flumes to fold the arms that flood the land with rivers from their looms but harder still for those who learn the truth forgot so long when once their slumbering passions burn the peaceful are the strong the lord have mercy on the weak and calm their frenzied ire and save our brothers ere they shriek we played with northern fire the eagle hold his mountain height the tiger pace his den give all their country each his right god keep us all amen j d r the friends that are and friends that were what shallow waves divide i miss the form for many a year still seated at my side i miss him yet i feel him still amidst our faithful band as if not death itself could chill the warmth of friendships hand

tempests cry before the gale with tattered sail a ship goes plunging by what name where bound the rocks around repeat the loud halloo the good ship union southward bound god help her and her crew and

mankind the owl hoots at noon that the eagle is blind we ask not your reasons t were wasting our time our life is a menace our welfare a crime we have battles to fight we have foes to subdue time waits not for us and we wait not for you the mower mows on though the adder may writhe and the copperhead coil round the blade of his scythe no sides in this quarrel your statesmen may urge of schoolhouse and wages with slavepen scourge no sides in the quarrel proclaim it as well to the angels that fight with the legions of hell they kneel in gods temple the north and the south with blood on each weapon and prayers in each mouth whose cry shall be answered ye heavens attend the lords of the lash as their voices ascend o lord we are shaped in the image of thee smite down the base millions that claim to be free and lend thy strong arm to the softhanded race who eat not their bread in the sweat of their face so pleads the proud planter what echoes are these the bay of his bloodhound is borne on the breeze and lost in the shriek of his victims despair his voice dies unheard hear the puritans prayer o lord that didst smother mankind in thy flood the sun is as sackcloth

ere they hasten in fear from the fastrising flood that shall girdle the sphere f w c fast as the rolling seasons bring the hour of fate to those we love each pearl that leaves the broken string is set in friendships crown above as narrower grows the earthly chain the circle widens in the sky these are our treasures that remain but those are stars that beam on high we miss oh how we miss his face with trembling accents speak his name earth cannot fill his shadowed place from all her rolls of pride and fame our song has lost the silvery thread that carolled through his jocund lips our laugh is mute our smile is fled and all our sunshine in eclipse and what and whence the wondrous charm that kept his manhood boylike still that lifes hard censors could disarm and lead them captive at his will his heart was shaped of rosier clay his veins were filled with ruddier fire time could not chill him fortune sway nor toil with all its burdens tire his speech burst throbbing from its fount and set our colder thoughts aglow as the hot leaping geysers mount and falling melt the iceland snow some word perchance we counted rash some phrase our calmness might disclaim yet t was the sunsets lightnings flash no angry bolt but harmless flame man judges all god knoweth each we read the rule he sees the law how oft his laughing children teach the truths his prophets never saw o friend whose wisdom flowered in mirth our hearts are sad our eyes are dim he gave thy smiles to brighten earth we trust thy joyous soul to him alas our weakness heaven forgive we murmur even while we trust how long earths breathing burdens live whose hearts before they die are dust but thou through griefs untimely tears we ask with halfreproachful sigh couldst thou not watch a few brief years till friendship faltered thou mayst die who loved our boyish years so well who knew so well their pleasant tales and all those livelier freaks could tell whose ofttold story never fails in vain we turn our aching eyes in vain we stretch our eager hands cold in his wintry shroud he lies beneath the dreary drifting sands ah speak not thus he lies not there we see him hear him as of old he comes he claims his wonted chair his beaming face we still behold his voice rings clear in all our songs and loud his mirthful accents rise to us our brothers life belongs dear friends a classmate never dies the last charge now men of the north will you join in the strife for country for freedom for honor for life the giant grows blind in his fury and spite one blow on his forehead will settle the fight flash full in his eyes the blue lightning of steel and stun him with cannonbolts peal upon peal mount troopers and follow your game to its lair as the hound tracks the wolf and the beagle the hare blow trumpets your summons till sluggards awake beat drums till the roofs of the fainthearted shake yet yet ere the signet is stamped on the scroll their names may be traced on the bloodsprinkled roll trust not the false herald that painted your shield true honor today must be sought on the field her scutcheon shows white with a blazon of red the lifedrops of crimson for liberty shed the hour is at hand and the moment draws nigh the dogstar of treason grows dim in the sky shine forth from the battlecloud light of the morn call back the bright hour when the nation was born the rivers of peace through our valleys shall run as the glaciers of tyranny melt in the sun smite smite the proud parricide down from his throne his sceptre once broken the world is our own our oldest friend i give you the health of the oldest friend that short of eternity earth can lend a friend so faithful and tried and true that nothing can wean him from me and you when first we screeched in the sudden blaze of the daylights blinding and blasting rays and gulped at the gaseous groggy air this old old friend stood waiting there and when with a kind of mortal strife we had gasped and choked into breathing life he watched by the cradle day and night and held our hands till we stood upright from gristle and pulp our frames have grown to stringy muscle and solid bone while we were changing he altered not we might forget but he never forgot he came with us to the college class little cared he for the stewards pass all the rest must pay their fee put the grim old deadhead entered free he stayed with us while we counted oer four times each of the seasons four and with every season from year to year the dear name classmate he made more dear he never leaves us he never will till our hands are cold and our hearts are still on birthdays and christmas and newyears too he always remembers both me and you every year this faithful friend his little present is sure to send every year wheresoeer we be he wants a keepsake from you and me how he loves us he pats our heads and lo they are gleaming with silver threads and he s always begging one lock of hair till our shining crowns have nothing to wear at length he will tell us one by one my child your labor on earth is done and now you must journey afar to see my elder brother eternity and so when long long years have passed some dear old fellow will be the last never a boy alive but he of all our goodly company when he lies down but not till then our kind classangel will drop the pen that writes in the daybook kept above our lifelong record of faith and love so heres a health in homely rhyme to our oldest classmate father time may our last survivor live to be as bald and as wise and as tough as he sherman s in savannah a halfrhymed impromptu like the tribes of israel fed on quails and manna sherman and his glorious band journeyed through the rebel land fed from heavens allbounteous hand marching on savannah as the moving pillar shone streamed the starry banner all day long in rosy light flaming splendor all the night till it swooped in eagle flight down on doomed savannah glory be to god on high shout the loud hosanna treasons wilderness is past canaans shore is won at last peal a nations trumpetblast sherman s in savannah soon shall richmonds tough old hide find a tough old tanner soon from every rebel wall shall the rag of treason fall till our banner flaps oer all as it crowns savannah my annual how long will this harp which you once loved to hear cheat your lips of a smile or your eyes of a tear how long stir the echoes it wakened of old while its strings were unbroken untarnished its gold dear friends of my boyhood my words do you wrong the heart the heart only shall throb in my song it reads the kind answer that looks from your eyes we will bid our old harper play on till he dies though youth the fair angel that looked oer the strings has lost the bright glory that gleamed on his wings though the freshness of morning has passed from its tone it is still the old harp that was always your own i claim not its music each note it affords i strike from your heartstrings that lend me its chords i know you will listen and love to the last for it trembles and thrills with the voice of your past ah brothers dear brothers the harp that i hold no craftsman could string and no artisan mould he shaped it he strung it who fashioned the lyres that ring with the hymns of the seraphim choirs not mine are the visions of beauty it brings not mine the faint fragrance around it that clings those shapes are the phantoms of years that are fled those sweets breathe from roses your summers have shed each hour of the past lends its tribute to this till it blooms like a bower in the garden of bliss the thorn and the thistle may grow as they will where friendship unfolds there is paradise still the bird wanders careless while summer is green the leafhidden cradle that rocked him unseen when autumns rude fingers the woods have undressed the boughs may look bare but they show him his nest too precious these moments the lustre they fling is the light of our year is the gem of its ring so brimming with sunshine we almost forget the rays it has lost and its border of jet while round us the manyhued halo is shed how dear are the living how near are the dead one circle scarce broken these waiting below those walking the shores where the asphodels blow not life shall enlarge it nor death shall divide no brother newborn finds his place at my side no titles shall freeze us no grandeurs infest his honor his worship are boys like the rest some won the worlds homage their names we hold dear but friendship not fame is the countersign here make room by the conqueror crowned in the strife for the comrade that limps from the battle of life what tongue talks of battle too long we have heard in sorrow in anguish that terrible word it reddened the sunshine it crimsoned the wave it sprinkled our doors with the blood of our brave peace peace comes at last with her garland of white peace broods in all hearts as we gather tonight the blazon of union spreads full in the sun we echo its words we are one we are one all here it is not what we say or sing that keeps our charm so long unbroken though every lightest leaf we bring may touch the heart as friendships token not what we sing or what we say can make us dearer to each other we love the singer and his lay but love as well the silent brother yet bring whateer your garden grows thrice welcome to our smiles and praises thanks for the myrtle and the rose thanks for the marigolds and daisies one flower erelong we all shall claim alas unloved of amaryllis natures last blossomneed i name the wreath of threescores silver lilies how many brothers meet tonight around our boyhoods covered embers go read the treasured names aright the old triennial list remembers though twenty wear the starry sign that tells a life has broke its tether the fiftyeight of twentyninegod bless the boys are all together these come with joyous look and word with friendly grasp and cheerful greeting those smile unseen and move unheard the angel guests of every meeting they cast no shadow in the flame that flushes from the gilded lustre but count us we are still the same one earthly band one heavenly cluster love dies not when he bows his head to pass beyond the narrow portals the light these glowing moments shed wakes from their sleep our lost immortals they come as in their joyous prime before their morning days were numbered death stays the envious hand of time the eyes have not grown dim that slumbered the paths that loving souls have trod arch oer the dust where worldlings grovel high as the zenith oer the sod the cross above the sextons shovel we rise beyond the realms of day they seem to stoop from spheres of glory with us one happy hour to stray while youth comes back in song and story ah ours is friendship true as steel that war has tried in edge and temper it writes upon its sacred seal the priests ubique omnes semper it lends the sky a fairer sun that cheers our lives with rays as steady as if our footsteps had begun to print the golden streets already the tangling years have clinched its knot too fast for mortal strength to sunder the lightning bolts of noon are shot no fear of evenings idle thunder too late too late no graceless hand shall stretch its cords in vain endeavor to rive the close encircling band that made and keeps us one forever so when upon the fated scroll the falling stars have all descended and blotted from the breathing roll our little page of life is ended we ask but one memorial line traced on thy tablet gracious mother my children boys of in pace how they loved each other once more once more will i come that is pleasant i beg to inquire if the gun that i carry has ever missed fire and which was the musterrollmention but one that missed your old comrade who carries the gun you see me as always my hand on the lock the cap on the nipple the hammer full cock it is rusty some tell me i heed not the scoff it is battered and bruised but it always goes off is it loaded ill bet you what doesnt it hold rammed full to the muzzle with memories untold why it scares me to fire lest the pieces should fly like the cannons that burst on the fourth of july one charge is a remnant of collegeday dreams its wadding is made of forensics and themes ah visions of fame what a flash in the pan as the trigger was pulled by each clever young man and love bless my stars what a cartridge is there with a wadding of roseleaves and ribbons and hair all crammed in one verse to go off at a shot were there ever such sweethearts of course there were not and next what a load it wall split the old gun three fingers four fingers five fingers of fun come tell me gray sages for mischief and noise was there ever a lot like us fellows the boys bump i bump down the staircase the cannonball goes aha old professor look out for your toes dont think my poor tutor to sleep in your bed two boys twentyninersroom over your head remember the nights when the tarbarrel blazed from red massachusetts the warcry was raised and hollis and stoughton reechoed the call till p poked his head out of holworthy hall old p as we called him at fifty or so not exactly a bud but not quite in full blow in ripening manhood suppose we should say just nearing his prime as we boys are today oh say can you look through the vista of age to the time when old morse drove the regular stage when lyon told tales of the longvanished years and lenox crept round with the rings in his ears and dost thou my brother remember indeed the days of our dealings with willard and read when dolly was kicking and running away and punch came up smoking on fillebrowns tray but where are the tutors my brother oh tell and where the professors remembered so well the sturdy old grecian of holworthy hall and latin and logic and hebrew and all they are dead the old fellows we called them so then though we since have found out they were lusty young men they are dead do you tell me but how do you

it off with a classical charge when that has gone off i shall drop my old gun and then stand at ease for my service is done bibamus ad classem vocatam the boys et eorum tutorem cui nomen est noyes et floreant valeant vigeant tam non peircius ipse enumeret quam the old cruiser here s the old cruiser twentynine forty times she s crossed the line same old masts and sails and crew tight and tough and as good as new into the harbor she bravely steers just as she s done for these forty years over her anchor goes splash and clang down her sails drop rattle and bang comes a vessel out of the dock fresh and spry as a fightingcock feathered with sails and spurred with steam heading out of the classic stream crew of a hundred all aboard every man as fine as a lord gay they look and proud they feel bowling along on even keel on they float with wind and tide gain at last the old ships side every man looks down in turn reads the name thats on her stern twentynine diable you say that was in skipper kirklands day what was the flying dutchmans name this old rover must be the same ho you boatswain that walks the deck how does it happen youre not a wreck one and another have come to grief how have you dodged by rock and reef boatswain lifting one knowing lid hitches his breeches and shifts his quid hey what is it who s come to grief louder young swab i m a little deaf i say old fellow what keeps your boat with all you jolly old boys afloat when scores of vessels as good as she have swallowed the salt of the bitter sea many a crew from many a craft goes drifting by on a broken raft pieced from a vessel that clove the brine taller and prouder than twentynine some capsized in an angry breeze some were lost in the narrow seas some on snags and some on sands struck and perished and lost their hands tell us young ones you gray old man what is your secret if you can we have a ship as good as you show us how to keep our crew so in his ear the youngster cries then the gray boatswain straight replies all your crew be sure you know never let one of your shipmates go if he leaves you change your tack follow him close and fetch him back when youve hauled him in at last grapple his flipper and hold him fast if youve wronged him speak him fair say youre sorry and make it square if hes wronged you wink so tight none of you see what s plain in sight when the world goes hard and wrong lend a hand to help him along when his stockings have holes to darn dont you grudge him your ball of yarn once in a twelvemonth come what may anchor your ship in a quiet bay call all hands and read the log and give em a taste of grub and grog stick to each other through thick and thin all the closer as age leaks in squalls will blow and clouds will frown but stay by your ship till you all go down added for the alumni meeting june so the gray boatswain of twentynine piped to the boys as they crossed the line round the cabin sat thirty guests babes of the nurse with a thousand breasts there were the judges grave and grand flanked by the priests on either hand there was the lord of wealth untold and the dear good fellow in broadcloth old thirty men from twenty towns sires and grandsires with silvered crowns thirty schoolboys all in a row bens and georges and bill and joe in thirty goblets the wine was poured but threescore gathered around the board for lo at the side of every chair a shadow hovered we all were there hymn for the classmeeting thou gracious power whose mercy lends the light of home the smile of friends our gathered flock thine arms infold as in the peaceful days of old wilt thou not hear us while we raise in sweet accord of solemn praise the voices that have mingled long in joyous flow of mirth and song for all the blessings life has brought for all its sorrowing hours have taught for all we mourn for all we keep the hands we clasp the loved that sleep the noontide sunshine of the past these brief bright moments fading fast the stars that gild our darkening years the twilight ray from holier spheres we thank thee father let thy grace our narrowing circle still embrace thy mercy shed its heavenly store thy peace be with us evermore evensong it may be yes it must be time that brings an end to mortal things that sends the beggar winter in the train of autumns burdened wain time that is heir of all our earthly state and knoweth well to wait till sea hath turned to shore and shore to sea if so it need must be ere he make good his claim and call his own old empires overthrown time who can find no heavenly orb too large to hold its fee in charge nor any motes that fill its beam so small but he shall care for all it may be must be yes he soon shall tire this hand that holds the lyre then ye who listened in that earlier day when to my careless lay i matched its chords and stole their firstborn thrill with untaught rudest skill vexing a treble from the slender strings thin as the locust sings when the shrillcrying child of summers heat pipes from its leafy seat the dim pavilion of embowering green beneath whose shadowy screen the small sopranist tries his single note against the songbirds throat and all the echoes listen but in vain they hear no answering strain then ye who listened in that earlier day shall sadly turn away saying the fire burns low the hearth is cold that warmed our blood of old cover its embers and its halfburnt brands and let us stretch our hands over a brighter and freshkindled flame lo this is not the same the joyous singer of our morning time flushed high with lusty rhyme speak kindly for he bears a human heart but whisper him apart tell him the woods their autumn robes have shed and all their birds have fled and shouting winds unbuild the naked nests they warmed with patient breasts tell him the sky is dark the summer oer and bid him sing no more ah welladay if words so cruelkind a listening ear might find but who that hears the music in his soul of rhythmic waves that roll crested with gleams of fire and as they flow stir all the deeps below till the great pearls no calm might ever reach leap glistening on the beach who that has known the passion and the pain the rush through heart and brain the joy so like a pang his hand is pressed hard on his throbbing breast when thou whose smile is life and bliss and fame hast set his pulse aflame muse of the lyre can say farewell to thee alas and must it be in many a clime in many a stately tongue the mighty bards have sung to these the immemorial thrones belong and purple robes of song yet the slight minstrel loves the slender tone his lips may call his own and finds the measure of the verse more sweet timed by his pulses beat than all the hymnings of the laurelled throng say not i do him wrong for nature spoils her warblers them she feeds in lotusgrowing meads and pours them subtle draughts from haunted streams that fill their souls with dreams full well i know the gracious mothers wiles and dear delusive smiles no callow fledgling of her singing brood but tastes that witching food and hearing overhead the eagles wing and how the thrushes sing vents his exiguous chirp and from his nest flaps forth we know the rest i own the weakness of the tuneful kind are not all harpers blind i sang too early must i sing too late the lengthening shadows wait the first pale stars of twilight yet how sweet the flattering whispers cheat thou hast the fire no evening chill can tame whose coals outlast its flame farewell ye carols of the laughing morn of earliest sunshine born the sower flings the seed and looks not back along his furrowed track the reaper leaves the stalks for other hands to gird with circling bands the wind earths careless servant truantborn blows clean the beaten corn and quits the threshers floor and goes his way to sport with oceans spray the headlongstumbling rivulet scrambling down to wash the seagirt town still babbling of the green and billowy waste whose salt he longs to taste ere his warm wave its chilling clasp may feel has twirled the millers wheel the song has done its task that makes us bold with secrets else untold and mine has run its errand through the dews i tracked the flying muse the daughter of the morning touched my lips with roseate fingertips whether i would or would not i must sing with the new choirs of spring now as i watch the fading autumn day and trill my softened lay i think of all that listened and of one for whom a brighter sun dawned at high summers noon ah comrades dear are not all gathered here our hearts have answered yes they hear our call all gathered here all all the smiling listener precisely i see it you all want to say that a tear is too sad and a laugh is too gay you could stand a faint smile you could manage a sigh but you value your ribs and you dont want to cry and why at our feast of the clasping of hands need we turn on the stream of our lachrymal glands though we see the white breakers of age on our bow let us take a good pull in the jollyboat now its hard if a fellow cannot feel content when a banquet like this does nt cost him a cent when his goblet and plate he may empty at will and our kind class committee will settle the bill and heres your old friend the identical bard who has rhymed and recited you verse by the yard since the days of the empire of andrew the first till you re full to the brim and feel ready to burst its awful to think of how year after year with his piece in his pocket he waits for you here no matter whos missing there always is one to lug out his manuscript sure as a gun why wont he stop writing humanity cries the answer is briefly he cant if he tries he has played with his foolish old feather so long that the goosequill in spite of him cackles in song you have watched him with patience from morning to dusk since the tassel was bright oer the green of the husk and now it s too bad it s a pitiful job he has shelled the ripe ear till hes come to the cob i see one face beaming it listens so well there must be some music yet left in my shell the wine of my soul is not thick on the lees one string is unbroken one friend i can please dear comrade the sunshine of seasons gone by looks out from your tender and tearmoistened eye a pharos of love on an icegirdled coast kind soul dont you hear me hes deaf as a post can it be one of natures benevolent tricks that you grow hard of hearing as i grow prolix and that look of delight which would angels beguile is the deaf mans prolonged unintelligent smile ah the ear may grow dull and the eye may wax dim but they still know a classmate they cant mistake him there is something to tell us thats one of our band though we groped in the dark for a touch of his hand well time with his snuffers is prowling about and his shaky old fingers will soon snuff us out theres a hint for us all in each pendulum tick for were low in the tallow and long in the wick you remember rossini you ve been at the play how his overtureendings keep crashing away till you think it s all over it cant but stop now that s the screech and the bang of the final bowwow and you find you re mistaken there s lots more to come more banging more screeching of fiddle and drum till when the last ending is finished and done you feel like a horse when the winningpost s won so i who have sung to you merry or sad since the days when they called me a promising lad though i ve made you more rhymes than a tutor could scan have a few more still left like the razorstrop man now pray dont be frightened i m ready to stop my galloping anapests clatter and pop in fact if you say so retire from today to the garret i left on a poets halfpay and yet i cant help it perhaps who can tell you might miss the poor singer you treated so well and confess you could stand him five minutes or so it was so like old times we remember you know t is not that the music can signify much but then there are chords that awake with a touch and our hearts can find echoes of sorrow and joy to the winch of the minstrel who hails from savoy so this handorgan tune that i cheerfully grind may bring the old places and faces to mind and seen in the light of the past we recall the flowers that have faded bloom fairest of all our sweet singer j a one memory trembles on our lips it throbs in every breast in teardimmed eyes in mirths eclipse the shadow stands confessed o silent voice that cheered so long our manhoods marching day without thy breath of heavenly song how weary seems the way vain every pictured phrase to tell our sorrowing hearts desire the shattered harp the broken shell the silent unstrung lyre for youth was round us while he sang it glowed in every tone with bridal chimes the echoes rang and made the past our own oh blissful dream our nursery joys we know must have an end but love and friendships broken toys may gods good angels mend the cheering smile the voice of mirth and laughters gay surprise that please the children born of earth why deem that heaven denies methinks in that refulgent sphere that knows not sun or moon an earthborn saint might long to hear one verse of bonny doon or walking through the streets of gold in heavens unclouded light his lips recall the song of old and hum the sky is bright and can we smile when thou art dead ah brothers even so the rose of summer will be red in spite of winters snow thou wouldst not leave us all in gloom because thy song is still nor blight the banquetgarlands bloom with griefs untimely chill the sighing wintry winds complain the singing bird has flown hark heard i not that ringing strain that clear celestial tone how poor these pallid phrases seem how weak this tinkling line as warbles through my waking dream that angel voice of thine thy requiem asks a sweeter lay it falters on my tongue for all we vainly strive to say thou shouldst thyself have sung h c m h s j k w the dirge is played the throbbing deathpeal rung the sadvoiced requiem sung on each white urn where memory dwells the wreath of rustling immortelles our loving hands have hung and balmiest leaves have strown and tenderest blossoms flung the birds that filled the air with songs have flown the wintry blasts have blown and these for whom the voice of spring bade the sweet choirs their carols sing sleep in those chambers lone where snows untrodden lie unheard the nightwinds moan we clasp them all in memory as the vine whose running stems intwine the marble shaft and steal around the lowly stone the nameless mound with sorrowing hearts resign our brothers true and tried and close our broken line how fast the lamps of life grow dim and die beneath our sunset sky still fading as along our track we cast our saddened glances back and while we vainly sigh the shadowy day recedes the starry night draws nigh as when from pier to pier across the tide with even keel we glide the lights we left along the shore grow less and less while more yet more new vistas open wide of fair illumined streets and casements goldeneyed each closing circle of our sunlit sphere seems to bring heaven more near can we not dream that those we love are listening in the world above and smiling as they hear the voices known so well of friends that still are dear does all that made us human fade away with this dissolving clay nay rather deem the blessed isles are bright and gay with joyous smiles that angels have their play and saints that tire of song may claim their holiday all else of earth may perish love alone not heaven shall find outgrown are they not here our spirit guests with love still throbbing in their breasts once more let flowers be strown welcome ye shadowy forms we count you still our own what i have come for i have come with my verses i think i may claim it is not the first time i have tried on the same they were puckered in rhyme they were wrinkled in wit but your hearts were so large that they made them a fit i have come not to tease you with more of my rhyme but to feel as i did in the blessed old time i want to hear him with the brobdingnag laugh we count him at least as three men and a half i have come to meet judges so wise and so grand that i shake in my shoes while theyre shaking my hand and the prince among merchants who put back the crown when they tried to enthrone him the king of the town i have come to see george yes i think there are four if they all were like these i could wish there were more i have come to see one whom we used to call jim i want to see oh dont i want to see him i have come to grow young on my word i declare i have thought i detected a change in my hair one hour with the boys will restore it to brown and a wrinkle or two i expect to rub down yes thats what ive come for as all of us come when i meet the dear boys i could wish i were dumb you asked me you know but its spoiling the fun i have told what i came for my ditty is done our banker old time in whose bank we deposit our notes is a miser who always wants guineas for groats he keeps all his customers still in arrears by lending them minutes and charging them years the twelvemonth rolls round and we never forget on the counter before us to pay him our debt we reckon the marks he has chalked on the door pay up and shake hands and begin a new score how long he will lend us how much we may owe no angel will tell us no mortal may know at fivescore at fourscore at threescore and ten he may close the account with a stroke of his pen this only we know amid sorrows and joys old time has been easy and kind with the boys though he must have and will have and does have his pay we have found him goodnatured enough in his way he never forgets us as others will do i am sure he knows me and i think he knows you for i see on your foreheads a mark that he lends as a sign he remembers to visit his friends in the shape of a classmate a wig on his crown his daybook and ledger laid carefully down he has welcomed us yearly a glass in his hand and pledged the good health of our brotherly band he s a thief we must own but how many there be that rob us less gently and fairly than he he has stripped the green leaves that were over us all but they let in the sunshine as fast as they fall young beauties may ravish the world with a glance as they languish in song as they float in the dance they are grandmothers now we remember as girls and the comely white cap takes the place of the curls but the sighing and moaning and groaning are oer we are pining and moping and sleepless no more and the hearts that were thumping like ships on the rocks beat as quiet and steady as meetinghouse clocks the trump of ambition loud sounding and shrill may blow its long blast but the echoes are still the springtides are past but no billow may reach the spoils they have landed far up on the beach we see that time robs us we know that he cheats but we still find a charm in his pleasant deceits while he leaves the remembrance of all that was best love friendship and hope and the promise of rest sweet shadows of twilight how calm their repose while the dewdrops fall soft in the breast of the rose how blest to the toiler his hour of release when the vesper is heard with its whisper of peace then heres to the wrinkled old miser our friend may he send us his bills to the centurys end and lend us the moments no sorrow alloys till he squares his account with the last of the boys for class meeting it is a pity and a shame alas alas i know it is to tread the trodden grapes again but so it has been so it is the purple vintage long is past with ripened clusters bursting so they filled the winevats to the brimt is strange you will be thirsting so too well our faithful memory tells what might be rhymed or sung about for all have sighed and some have wept since last years snows were flung about the beacon flame that fired the sky the modest ray that gladdened us a little breath has quenched their light and deepening shades have saddened us no more our brothers life is ours for cheering or for grieving us one only sadness they bequeathed the sorrow of their leaving us farewell farewell i turn the leaf i read my chiming measure in who knows but something still is there a friend may find a pleasure in for who can tell by what he likes what other peoples fancies are how all men think the best of wives their own particular nancies are if what i sing you brings a smile you will not stop to catechise nor read bceotias lumbering line with nicely scanning attic eyes perhaps the alabaster box that mary broke so lovingly while judas looked so sternly on the master so approvingly was not so fairly wrought as those that pilates wife and daughters had or many a dame of judahs line that drank of jordans waters had perhaps the balm that cost so dear as some remarked officiously the precious nard that filled the room with fragrance so deliciously so oft recalled in storied page and sung in verse melodious the dancing girl had thought too cheap that daughter of herodias where now are all the mighty deeds that herod boasted loudest of where now the flashing jewelry the tetrarchs wife was proudest of yet still to hear how mary loved all tribes of men are listening and still the sinful womans tears like stars heaven are glistening t is not the gift our hands have brought the love it is we bring with it the minstrels lips may shape the song his heart in tune must sing with it and so we love the simple lays and wish we might have more of them our poet brothers sing for us there must be half a score of them it may be that of fame and name our voices once were emulous with deeper thoughts with tenderer throbs their softening tones are tremulous the dead seem listening as of old ere friendship was bereft of them the living wear a kinder smile the remnant that is left of them though on the once unfurrowed brows the harrowteeth of time may show though all the strain of crippling years the halting feet of rhyme may show we look and hear with melting hearts for what we all remember is the morn of spring nor heed how chill the sky of gray november is thanks to the gracious powers above from all mankind that singled us and dropped the pearl of friendship in the cup they kindly mingled us and bound us in a wreath of flowers with hoops of steel knit under it nor time nor space nor chance nor change nor death himself shall sunder it ad amicos dumque virent genua et decet obducta solvatur fonte senectus the muse of boyhoods fervid hour grows tame as skies get chill and hazy where once she sought a passionflower she only hopes to find a daisy well who the changing world bewails who asks to have it stay unaltered shall grownup kittens chase their tails shall colts be never shod or haltered are we the boys that used to make the tables ring with noisy follies whose deeplunged laughter oft would shake the ceiling with its thundervolleys are we the youths with lips unshorn at beautys feet unwrinkled suitors whose memories reach traditions morn the days of prehistoric tutors the boys we knew but who are these whose heads might serve for plutarchs sages or foxs martyrs if you please or hermits of the dismal ages the boys we knew can these be those their cheeks with mornings blush were painted where are the harrys jims and joes with whom we once were well acquainted if we are they were not the same if they are we why then theyre masking do tell us neighbor what s your name who are you whats the use of asking you once were george or bill or ben theres you yourself there s you that other i know you now i knew you then you used to be your younger brother you both are all our own today but ah i hear a warning whisper yon roseate hour that flits away repeats the romans sad paulisper come back come back weve need of you to pay you for your word of warning well bathe your wings in brighter dew than ever wet the lids of morning behold this cup its mystic wine no aliens lip has ever tasted the blood of friendships clinging vine still flowing flowing yet unwasted old time forgot his running sand and laid his hourglass down to fill it and death himself with gentle hand has touched the chalice not to spill it each bubble rounding at the brim is rainbowed with its magic story the shining days with age grown dim are dressed again in robes of glory in all its freshness spring returns with song of birds and blossoms tender once more the torch of passion burns and youth is here in all its splendor hope swings her anchor like a toy love laughs and shows the silver arrow we knew so well as man and boy the shaft that stings through bone and marrow again our kindling pulses beat with tangled curls our fingers dally and bygone beauties smile as sweet as freshblown lilies of the valley o blessed hour we may forget its wreaths its rhymes its songs its laughter but not the loving eyes we met whose light shall gild the dim hereafter how every heart to each grows warm is one in sunshines ray we share it is one in sorrows blinding storm a look a word shall help him bear it the boys we were the boys we ll be as long as three as two are creeping then here s to him ah which is he who lives till all the rest are sleeping a life with tranquil comfort blest the young mans health the rich mans plenty all earth can give that earth has best and heaven at fourscore years and twenty how not to settle it i like at times to hear the steeples chimes with sober thoughts impressively that mingle but sometimes too i rather like dont you to hear the music of the sleigh bells jingle i like full well the deep resounding swell of mighty symphonies with chords inwoven but sometimes too a song of burns dont you after a solemn stormblast of beethoven good to the heels the wellworn slipper feels when the tired player shuffles off the buskin a page of hood may do a fellow good after a scolding from carlyle or ruskin some works i find say watts upon the mind no matter though at first they seemed amusing not quite the same but just a little tame after some five or six times reperusing so too at times when melancholy rhymes or solemn speeches sober down a dinner ive seen it s true quite often have nt you the bestfed guests perceptibly grow thinner better some jest in proper terms expressed or story strictly moral even if musty or song we sung when these old throats were young something to keep our souls from getting rusty the poorest scrap from memorys ragged lap comes like an heirloom from a dear dead mother hush theres a tear that has no business here a halfformed sigh that ere its birth we smother we cry we laugh ah life is half and half now bright and joyous as a song of herricks then chill and bare as funeralminded blair as fickle as a female in hysterics if i could make you cry i would nt try if you have hidden smiles id like to find them and that although as well i ought to know the lips of laughter have a skull behind them yet when i think we may be on the brink of having freedoms banner to dispose of all crimsonhued because the nation would insist on cutting its own precious nose off i feel indeed as if we rather need a sermon such as preachers tie a text on if freedom dies because a ballot lies she earns her grave t is time to call the sexton but if a fight can make the matter right here are we classmates thirty men of mettle were strong and tough weve lived nigh long enough what if the nation gave it us to settle the tale would read like that illustrious deed when curtius took the leap the gap that filled in thus fivescore years good friends as it appears at last this people split on hayes and tilden one half cried see the choice is s j t and one half swore as stoutly it was t other both drew the knife to save the nations life by wholesale vivisection of each other then rose in mass that monumental class hold hold they cried give us give us the daggers content content exclaimed with one consent the gaunt exrebels and the carpetbaggers fifteen each side the combatants divide so nicely balanced are their predilections and first of all a teardrop each lets fall a tribute to their obsolete affections man facing man the sanguine strife began jack jim and joe against tom dick and harry each several pair its own account to square till both were down or one stood solitary and the great fight raged furious all the night till every integer was made a fraction reader wouldst know what history has to show as net result of the above transaction whole coattails four stray fragments several score a heap of spectacles a deaf mans trumpet six lawyers briefs seven pockethandkerchiefs twelve canes wherewith the owners used to stump it odd rubbershoes old gloves of different hues tax bills unpaid and several empty purses and saved from harm by some protecting charm a printed page with smiths immortal verses trifles that claim no very special name some useful others chiefly ornamental pins buttons rings and other trivial things with various wrecks capillary and dental also one flag t was nothing but a rag and what device it bore it little matters red white and blue but rent all through and through union forever torn to shreds and tatters they fought so well not one was left to tell which got the largest share of cuts and slashes when heroes meet both sides are bound to beat they telescoped like cars in railroad smashes so the great split that baffled human wit and might have cost the lives of twenty millions as all may see that know the rule of three was settled just as well by these civilians as well just so not worse not better no next morning found the nation still divided since all were slain the inference is plain they left the point they fought for undecided if not quite true as i have told it you this tale of mutual extermination to minds perplexed with threats of what comes next perhaps may furnish food for contemplation to cut mens throats to help them count their votes is asinine nay worse ascidian folly blindness like that would scare the mole and bat and make the liveliest monkey melancholy i say once more as i have said before if voting for our tildens and our hayeses means only fight then liberty good night pack up your ballotbox and go to blazes unfurl your bloodred flags you murderous hags you petroleuses of paris fierce and foamy well sell our stock in plymouths blasted rock pull up our stakes and migrate to dahomey the last survivor yes the vacant chairs tell sadly we are going going fast and the thought comes strangely oer me who will live to be the last when the twentieth centurys sunbeams climb the faroff eastern hill with his ninety winters burdened will he greet the morning still will he stand with harvards nurslings when they hear their mothers call and the old and young are gathered in the many alcoved hall will he answer to the summons when they range themselves in line and the young mustachioed marshal calls out class of methinks i see the column as its lengthened ranks appear in the sunshine of the morrow of the nineteen hundredth year through the yard t is creeping winding by the walls of dusky red what shape is that which totters at the long processions head who knows this ancient graduate of fourscore years and ten what place he held what name he bore among the sons of men so speeds the curious question its answer travels slow t is the last of sixty classmates of seventy years ago his figure shows but dimly his face i scarce can see theres something that reminds me it looks like is it he he who no voice may whisper what wrinkled brow shall claim the wreath of stars that circles our last survivors name will he be some veteran minstrel left to pipe in feeble rhyme all the stories and the glories of our gay and golden time or some quiet voiceless brother in whose lonely loving breast fond memory broods in silence like a dove upon her nest will it be some old emeritus who taught so long ago the boys that heard him lecture have heads as white as snow or a pious painful preacher holding forth from year to year till his colleague got a colleague whom the young folks flocked to hear will it be a rich old merchant in a squaretied white cravat or selectman of a village in a prehistoric hat will his dwelling be a mansion in a marblefronted row or a homestead by a hillside where the huckleberries grow i can see our one survivor sitting lonely by himself all his college textbooks round him ranged in order on their shelf there are classic interliners filled with learnings choicest pith each cum notis variorum quas recensuit doctus smith physics metaphysics logic mathematics all the lot every wisdom crammed octavo he has mastered and forgot with the ghosts of dead professors standing guard beside them all and the room is fall of shadows which their lettered backs recall how the past spreads out in vision with its far receding train like a long embroidered arras in the chambers of the brain from opening manhoods morning when first we learned to grieve to the fond regretful moments of our sorrowsaddened eve what early shadows darkened our idle summers joy when death snatched roughly from us that lovely brighteyed boy the years move swiftly onwards the deadly shafts fall fast till all have dropped around him lo there he stands the last their faces flit before him some rosyhued and fair some strong in iron manhood some worn with toil and care their smiles no more shall greet him on cheeks with pleasure flushed the friendly hands are folded the pleasant voices hushed my picture sets me dreaming alas and can it be those two familiar faces we never more may see in every entering footfall i think them drawing near with every door that opens i say at last they re here the willow bends unbroken when angry tempests blow the stately oak is levelled and all its strength laid low so fell that tower of manhood undaunted patient strong white with the gathering snowflakes who faced the storm so long and he what subtle phrases their varying light must blend to paint as each remembers our manyfeatured friend his wit a flash auroral that laughed in every look his talk a sunbeam broken on the ripples of a brook or fed from thousand sources a fountains glittering jet or careless handfuls scattered of diamond sparks unset ah sketch him paint him mould him in every shape you will he was himself the only the one unpictured still farewell our skies are darkened and yet the stars will shine we ll close our ranks together and still fall into line till one is left one only to mourn for all the rest and heaven bequeath their memories to him who loves us best the archbishop and gil blas a modernized version i dont think i feel much older im aware im rather gray but so are many young folks i meet em every day i confess i m more particular in what i eat and drink but ones taste improves with culture that is all it means i think can you read as once you used to well the printing is so bad no young folks eyes can read it like the books that once we had are you quite as quick of hearing

looks shaky when i sign for dividends dont you stoop a little walking it s a way i ve always had i have always been roundshouldered ever since i was a lad dont you hate to tie your shoestrings yes i own it that is true dont you tell old stories over i am not aware i do dont you stay at home of evenings dont you love a cushioned seat in a corner by the fireside with your slippers on your feet dont you wear warm fleecy flannels dont you muffle up your throat dont you like to have one help you when youre putting on your coat dont you like old books youve dogseared you cant remember when dont you call it late at nine oclock and go to bed at ten how many cronies can you count of all you used to know who called you by your christian name some fifty years ago how look the prizes to you that used to fire your brain youve reared your moundhow high is it above the level plain you ve drained the brimming golden cup that made your fancy reel youve slept the giddy potion off now tell us how you feel youve watched the harvest ripening till every stem was cropped you ve seen the rose of beauty fade till every petal dropped youve told your thought you ve done your task youve tracked your dial round i backing down thank heaven not yet im hale and brisk and sound and good for many a tussle as you shall live to see my shoes are not quite ready yet dont think youre rid of me old parr was in his lusty prime when he was older far and where will you be if i live to beat old thomas parr ah well i know at every age life has a certain charm youre going come permit me please i beg youll take my arm i take your arm why take your arm i d thank you to be told i m old enough to walk alone but not so very old the shadows how many have gone was the question of old ere time our bright ring of its jewels bereft alas for too often the deathbell has tolled and the question we ask is how many are left bright sparkled the wine there were fifty that quaffed for a decade had slipped and had taken but three how they frolicked and sung how they shouted and laughed like a school full of boys from their benches set free there were speeches and toasts there were stories and rhymes the hall shook its sides with their merriments noise as they talked and lived over the collegeday times no wonder they kept their old name of the boys the seasons moved on in their rhythmical flow with mornings like maidens that pouted or smiled with the bud and the leaf and the fruit and the snow and the yearbooks of time in his alcoves were piled there were forty that gathered where fifty had met some locks had got silvered some lives had grown sere but the laugh of the laughers was lusty as yet and the song of the singers rose ringing and clear still flitted the years there were thirty that came the boys they were still and they answered their call there were foreheads of care but the smiles were the same and the chorus rang loud through the garlanded hall the hourhand moved on and they gathered again there were twenty that joined in the hymn that was sung but ah for our songbird we listened in vain the crystalline tones like a seraphs that rung how narrow the circle that holds us tonight how many the loved ones that greet us no more as we meet like the stragglers that come from the fight like the mariners flung from a wreck on the shore we look through the twilight for those we have lost the stream rolls between us and yet they seem near already outnumbered by those who have crossed our band is transplanted its home is not here they smile on us still is it only a dream while fondly or proudly their names we recall they beckon they come they are crossing the stream lo the shadows the shadows room room for them all benjamin peirce astronomer mathematician for him the architect of all unroofed our planets starlit hall through voids unknown to worlds unseen his clearer vision rose serene with us on earth he walked by day his midnight path how far away we knew him not so well who knew the patient eyes his soul looked through for who his untrod realm could share of us that breathe this mortal air or camp in that celestial tent whose fringes gild our firmament how vast the workroom where he brought the viewless implements of thought the wit how subtle how profound that natures tangled webs unwound that through the clouded matrix saw the crystal planes of shaping law through these the sovereign skill that planned the fathers care the masters hand to him the wandering stars revealed the secrets in their cradle sealed the faroff frozen sphere that swings through ether zoned with lucid rings the orb that rolls in dim eclipse wide wheeling round its long ellipse his name urania writes with these and stamps it on her pleiades we knew him not ah well we knew the manly soul so brave so true the cheerful heart that conquered age the childlike silverbearded sage no more his tireless thought explores the azure sea with golden shores rest wearied frame i the stars shall keep a loving watch where thou shalt sleep farewell the spirit needs must rise so long a tenant of the skies rise to that home all worlds above whose sun is god whose light is love in the twilight not bedtime yet the nightwinds blow the stars are out full well we know the nurse is on the stair with hand of ice and cheek of snow and frozen lips that whisper low come children it is time to go my peaceful couch to share no years a wakeful heart can tire not bedtime yet come stir the fire and warm your dear old hands kind mother earth we love so well has pleasant stories yet to tell before we hear the curfew bell still glow the burning brands not bedtime yet we long to know what wonders time has yet to show what unborn years shall bring what ship the arctic pole shall reach what lessons science waits to teach what sermons there are left to preach what poems yet to sing what next we ask and is it true the sunshine falls on nothing new as israels king declared was ocean ploughed with harnessed fire were nations coupled with a wire did tarshish telegraph to tyre how hiram would have stared and what if shebas curious queen who came to see and to be seen or something new to seek and swooned as ladies sometimes do at sights that thrilled her through and through had heard as she was coming to a locomotives shriek and seen a rushing railway train as she looked out along the plain from davids lofty tower a mile of smoke that blots the sky and blinds the eagles as they fly behind the cars that thunder by a score of leagues an hour see to my fiat lux respond this little slumbering firetipped wand one touch it bursts in flame steal me a portrait from the sun one look and to the picture done are these old tricks king solomon we lying moderns claim could you have spectroscoped a star if both those mothers at your bar the cruel and the mild the young and tender old and tough had said divide youre right though rough did old judea know enough to etherize the child these births of time our eyes have seen with but a few brief years between what wonder if the text for other ages doubtless true for coming years will never do whereof we all should like a few if but to see what next if such things have been such may be who would not like to live and see if heaven may so ordain what waifs undreamed of yet in store the waves that roll forevermore on lifes long beach may east ashore from out the mistclad main will earth to pagan dreams return to find from miserys painted urn that all save hope has flown of book and church and priest bereft the rock of ages vainly cleft lifes compass gone its anchor left left lost in depths unknown shall faith the trodden path pursue the crux ansata wearers knew who sleep with folded hands where like a naked lidless eye the staring nile rolls wandering by those mountain slopes that climb the sky above the drifting sands or shall a nobler faith return its fanes a purer gospel learn with holier anthems ring and teach us that our transient creeds were but the perishable seeds of harvests sown for larger needs that ripening years shall bring well let the present do its best we trust our maker for the rest as on our way we plod our souls full dressed in fleshly suits love air and sunshine flowers and fruits the daisies better than their roots beneath the grassy sod not bedtime yet the fullblown flower of all the year this evening hour with friendships flame is bright life still is sweet the heavens are fair though fields are brown and woods are bare and many a joy is left to share before we say goodnight and when our cheerful evening past the nurse long waiting comes at last ere on her lap we lie in wearied natures sweet repose at peace with all her waking foes our lips shall murmur ere they close goodnight and not goodby a lovingcup song come heap the fagots ere we go again the cheerful hearth shall glow we ll have another blaze my boys when clouds are black and snows are white then christmas logs lend ruddy light they stole from summer days my boys they stole from summer days and let the lovingcup go round the cup with blessed memories crowned that flows wheneer we meet my boys no draught will hold a drop of sin if love is only well stirred in to keep it sound and sweet my boys to keep it sound and sweet give me to pin upon my breast the blossoms twain i love the best a rosebud and a pink my boys their leaves shall nestle next my heart their perfumed breath shall own its part in every health we drink my boys in every health we drink the breathing blossoms stir my blood methinks i see the lilacs bud and hear the bluebirds sing my boys why not yon lusty oak has seen full tenscore years yet leaflets green peep out with every spring my boys peep out with every spring old time his rusty scythe may whet the unmowed grass is glowing yet beneath the sheltering snow my boys and if the crazy dotard ask is love worn out is life a task well bravely answer no my boys we ll bravely answer no for lifes bright taper is the same love tipped of old with rosy flame that heavens own altar lent my boys to glow in every cup we fill till lips are mute and hearts are still till life and love are spent my boys till life and love are spent the girdle of friendship she gathered at her slender waist the beauteous robe she wore its folds a golden belt embraced one rosehued gem it bore the girdle shrank its lessening round still kept the shining gem but now her flowing locks it bound a lustrous diadem and narrower still the circlet grew behold a glittering band its roseate diamond set anew her necks white column spanned suns rise and set the straining clasp the shortened links resist yet flashes in a bracelets grasp the diamond on her wrist at length the round of changes past the thieving years could bring the jewel glittering to the last still sparkles in a ring so link by link our friendships part so loosen break and fall a narrowing zone the loving heart lives changeless through them all the lyre of anacreon the minstrel of the classic lay of love and wine who sings still found the fingers run astray that touched the rebel strings of cadmus he would fain have sung of atreus and his line but all the jocund echoes rung with songs of love and wine ah brothers i would fain have caught some fresher fancys gleam my truant accents find unsought the old familiar theme love love but not the sportive child with shaft and twanging bow whose random arrows drove us wild some threescore years ago not eros with his joyous laugh the urchin blind and bare but love with spectacles and staff and scanty silvered hair our heads with frosted locks are white our roofs are thatched with snow but red in chilling winters spite our hearts and hearthstones glow our old acquaintance time drops in and while the running sands their golden thread unheeded spin he warms his frozen hands stay winged hours too swift too sweet and waft this message oer to all we miss from all we meet on lifes fastcrumbling shore say that to old affection true we hug the narrowing chain that binds our hearts alas how few the links that yet remain the fatal touch awaits them all that turns the rocks to dust from year to year they break and fall they break but never rust say if one note of happier strain this wornout harp afford one throb that trembles not in vain their memory lent its chord say that when fancy closed her wings and passion quenched his fire love love still echoed from the strings as from anacreons lyre the old tune thirtysixth variation this shred of song you bid me bring is snatched from fancys embers ah when the lips forget to sing the faithful heart remembers too swift the wings of envious time to wait for dallying phrases or woven strands of labored rhyme to thread their cunning mazes a word a sigh and lo how plain its magic breath discloses our lifes long vista through a lane of threescore summers roses one language years alone can teach its roots are young affections that feel their way to simplest speech through silent recollections that tongue is ours how few the words we need to know a brother as simple are the notes of birds yet well they know each other this freezing month of ice and snow that brings our lives together lends to our year a living glow that warms its wintry weather so let us meet as eve draws nigh and life matures and mellows till nature whispers with a sigh goodnight my dear old fellows the broken circle i stood on sarums treeless plain the waste that careless nature owns lone tenants of her bleak domain loomed huge and gray the druid stones upheaved in many a billowy mound the sealike naked turf arose where wandering flocks went nibbling round the mingled graves of friends and foes the briton roman saxon dane this windy desert roamed in turn unmoved these mighty blocks remain whose story none that lives may learn erect half buried slant or prone these awful listeners blind and dumb hear the strange tongues of tribes unknown as wave on wave they go and come who are you giants whence and why i stand and ask in blank amaze my soul accepts their mute reply a mystery as are you that gaze a silent orpheus wrought the charm from riven rocks their spoils to bring a nameless titan lent his arm to range us in our magic ring but time with still and stealthy stride that climbs and treads and levels all that bids the loosening keystone slide and topples down the crumbling wall time that unbuilds the quarried past leans on these wrecks that press the sod they slant they stoop they fall at last and strew the turf their priests have trod no more our altars wreath of smoke floats up with mornings fragrant dew the fires are dead the ring is broke where stood the many stand the few my thoughts had wandered far away borne off on memorys outspread wing to where in deepening twilight lay the wrecks of friendships broken ring ah me of all our goodly train how few will find our banquet hall yet why with coward lips complain that this must lean and that must fall cold is the druids altarstone its vanished flame no more returns but ours no chilling damp has known unchanged unchanging still it burns so let our broken circle stand a wreck a remnant yet the same while one last loving faithful hand still lives to feed its altarflame the angelthief time is a thief who leaves his tools behind him he comes by night he vanishes at dawn we track his footsteps but we never find him strong locks are broken massive bolts are drawn and all around are left the bars and borers the splitting wedges and the prying keys such aids as serve the softshod vaultexplorers to crack wrench open rifle as they please ah these are tools which heaven in mercy lends us when gathering rust has clenched our shackles fast time is the angelthief that nature sends us to break the cramping fetters of our past mourn as we may for treasures he has taken poor as we feel of hoarded wealth bereft more precious are those implements forsaken found in the wreck his ruthless hands have left some lever that a caskets hinge has broken pries off a bolt and lo our souls are free each year some open sesame is spoken and every decade drops its masterkey so as from year to year we count our treasure our loss seems less and larger look our gains times wrongs repaid in more than even measure we lose our jewels but we break our chains after the curfew the play is over while the light yet lingers in the darkening hall i come to say a last goodnight before the final exeunt all we gathered once a joyous throng the jovial toasts went gayly round with jest and laugh and shout and song we made the floors and walls resound we come with feeble steps and slow a little band of four or five left from the wrecks of long ago still pleased to find ourselves alive alive how living too are they whose memories it is ours to share spread the long tables full array there sits a ghost in every chair one breathing form no more alas amid our slender group we see with him we still remained the class without his presence what are we the hand we ever loved to clasp that tireless hand which knew no rest loosed from affections clinging grasp lies nerveless on the peaceful breast the beaming eye the cheering voice that lent to life a generous glow whose every meaning said rejoice we see we hear no more below the air seems darkened by his loss earths shadowed features look less fair and heavier weighs the daily cross his willing shoulders helped us bear why mourn that we the favored few whom grasping time so long has spared lifes sweet illusions to pursue the common lot of age have shared in every pulse of friendships heart there breeds unfelt a throb of pain one hour must rend its links apart though years on years have forged the chain so ends the boys a lifelong play we too must hear the prompters call to fairer scenes and brighter day farewell i let the curtain fall poems from the autocrat of the breakfasttable the chambered nautilus this is the ship of pearl which poets feign sails the unshadowed main the venturous bark that flings on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings in gulfs enchanted where the siren sings and coral reefs lie bare where the cold seamaids rise to sun their streaming hair its webs of living gauze no more unfurl wrecked is the ship of pearl and every chambered cell where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell before thee lies revealed its irised ceiling rent its sunless crypt unsealed year after year beheld the silent toil that spread his lustrous coil still as the spiral grew he left the past years dwelling for the new stole with soft step its shining archway through built up its idle door stretched in his lastfound home and knew the old no more thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee child of the wandering sea cast from her lap forlorn from thy dead lips a clearer note is born than ever triton blew from wreathed horn while on mine ear it rings through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings build thee more stately mansions o my soul as the swift seasons roll leave thy lowvaulted past let each new temple nobler than the last shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast till thou at length art free leaving thine outgrown shell by lifes unresting sea sun and shadow as i look from the isle oer its billows of green to the billows of foamcrested blue yon bark that afar in the distance is seen half dreaming my eyes will pursue now dark in the shadow she scatters the spray as the chaff in the stroke of the flail now white as the seagull she flies on her way the sun gleaming bright on her sail yet her pilot is thinking of dangers to shun of breakers that whiten and roar how little he cares if in shadow or sun they see him who gaze from the shore he looks to the beacon that looms from the reef to the rock that is under his lee as he drifts on the blast like a windwafted leaf oer the gulfs of the desolate sea thus drifting afar to the dimvaulted caves where life and its ventures are laid the dreamers who gaze while we battle the waves may see us in sunshine or shade yet true to our course though the shadows grow dark well trim our broad sail as before and stand by the rudder that governs the bark nor ask how we look from the shore musa o my lost beauty hast thou folded quite thy wings of morning light beyond those iron gates where life crowds hurrying to the haggard fates and age upon his mound of ashes waits to chill our fiery dreams hot from the heart of youth plunged in his icy streams leave me not fading in these weeds of care whose flowers are silvered hair have i not loved thee long though my young lips have often done thee wrong and vexed thy heaventuned ear with careless song ah wilt thou yet return bearing thy rosehued torch and bid thine altar burn come to me i will flood thy silent shrine with my souls sacred wine and heap thy marble floors as the wild spicetrees waste their fragrant stores in leafy islands walled with madrepores and lapped in orient seas when all their feathery palms toss plumelike in the breeze come to me thou shalt feed on honeyed words sweeter than song of birds no wailing bulbuls throat no melting dulcimers melodious note when oer the midnight wave its murmurs float thy ravished sense might soothe with flow so liquidsoft with strain so velvetsmooth thou shalt be decked with jewels like a queen sought in those bowers of green where loop the clustered vines and the closeclinging dulcamara twines pure pearls of maydew where the moonlight shines and summers fruited gems and coral pendants shorn from autumns berried stems sit by me drifting on the sleepy waves or stretched by grassgrown graves whose gray highshouldered stones carved with old names lifes timeworn roll disowns lean lichenspotted oer the crumbled bones still slumbering where they lay while the sad pilgrim watched to scare the wolf away spread oer my couch thy visionary wing still let me dream and sing dream of that winding shore where scarlet cardinals bloomfor me no more the stream with heaven beneath its liquid floor and clustering nenuphars sprinkling its mirrored blue like goldenchaliced stars come while their balms the lindenblossoms shed come while the rose is red while blueeyed summer smiles on the green ripples round yon sunken piles washed by the moonwave warm from indian isles and on the sultry air the chestnuts spread their palms like holy men in prayer oh for thy burning lips to fire my brain with thrills of wild sweet pain on lifes autumnal blast like shrivelled leaves youths passionflowers are cast once loving thee we love thee to the last behold thy newdecked shrine and hear once more the voice that breathed forever thine a parting health to j l motley yes we knew we must lose him though friendship may claim to blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame though fondly at parting we call him our own t is the whisper of love when the bugle has blown as the rider that rests with the spur on his heel as the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel as the archer that stands with his shaft on the string he stoops from his toil to the garland we bring what pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom while the tapestry lengthens the lifeglowing dyes that caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies in the alcoves of death in the charnels of timd where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime there are triumphs untold there are martyrs unsung there are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue let us hear the proud story which time has bequeathed from lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed let him summon its tyrants and tell us their doom though he sweep the black past like van tromp with his broom the dream flashes by for the westwinds awake on pampas on prairie oer mountain and lake to bathe the swift bark like a seagirdled shrine with incense they stole from the rose and the pine so fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed when the dead summers jewels were trampled and crushed the true knight of learning the world holds him dear love bless him joy crown him god speed his career what we all think that age was older once than now in spite of locks untimely shed or silvered on the youthful brow that babes make love and children wed that sunshine had a heavenly glow which faded with those good old days when winters came with deeper snow and autumns with a softer haze that mother sister wife or child the best of women each has known were schoolboys ever half so wild how young the grandpapas have grown that but for this our souls were free and but for that our lives were blest that in some season yet to be our cares will leave us time to rest wheneer we groan with ache or pain some common ailment of the race though doctors think the matter plain that ours is a peculiar case that when like babes with fingers burned we count one bitter maxim more our lesson all the world has learned and men are wiser than before that when we sob oer fancied woes the angels hovering overhead count every pitying drop that flows and love us for the tears we shed that when we stand with tearless eye and turn the beggar from our door they still approve us when we sigh ah had i but one thousand more though temples crowd the crumbled brink oerhanging truths eternal flow their tablets bold with what we think their echoes dumb to what we know that one unquestioned text we read all doubt beyond all fear above nor crackling pile nor cursing creed can burn or blot it god is love spring has come intra muros the

maids oh might i vole to some umbrageous clump depart be off excede evade erump the deacons masterpiece or the wonderful onehoss shay a logical story have you heard of the wonderful onehoss shay that was built in such a logical way it ran a hundred years to a day and then of a sudden it ah but stay i ll tell you what happened without delay searing the parson into fits frightening people out of their wits have you ever heard of that i say seventeen hundred and fiftyfive georgius secundus was then alive snuffy old drone from the german hive that was the year when lisbontown saw the earth open and gulp her down and braddocks army was done so brown left without a scalp to its crown it was on the terrible earthquakeday that the deacon finished the onehoss shay now in building of chaises i tell you what there is always somewhere a weakest spot in hub tire felloe in spring or thill in panel or crossbar or floor or sill in screw bolt thoroughbrace lurking still find it somewhere you must and will above or below or within or without and that s the reason beyond a doubt that a chaise breaks down but does nt wear out but the deacon swore as deacons do with an i dew vum or an i tell yeou he would build one shay to beat the taown n the keounty n all the kentry raoun it should be so built that it couldn break daown fur said the deacon t s mighty plain thut the weakes place mus stan the strain n the way t fix it uz i maintain is only jest t make that place uz strong uz the rest so the deacon inquired of the village folk where he could find the strongest oak that couldnt be split nor bent nor broke that was for spokes and floor and sills he sent for lancewood to make the thills the crossbars were ash from the straightest trees the panels of whitewood that cuts like cheese but lasts like iron for things like these the hubs of logs from the settlers ellum last of its timber they could nt sell em never an axe had seen their chips and the wedges flew from between their lips their blunt ends frizzled like celerytips step and propiron bolt and screw spring tire axle and linchpin too steel of the finest bright and blue thoroughbrace bisonskin thick and wide boot top dasher from tough old hide found in the pit when the tanner died that was the way he put her through there said the deacon naow she ll dew do i tell you i rather guess she was a wonder and nothing less colts grew horses beards turned gray deacon and deaconess dropped away children and grandchildren where were they but there stood the stout old onehoss shay as fresh as on lisbonearthquakeday eighteen hundred it came and found the deacons masterpiece strong and sound eighteen hundred increased by ten hahnsum kerridge they called it then eighteen hundred and twenty came running as usual much the same thirty and forty at last arrive and then come fifty and fiftyfive first of november fiftyfive this morning the parson takes a drive now small boys get out of the way here comes the wonderful onehoss shay little of all we value here wakes on the morn of its hundredth year without both feeling and looking queer in fact there s nothing that keeps its youth so far as i know but a tree and truth this is a moral that runs at large take it you re welcome no extra charge first of november the earthquakeday there are traces of age in the onehoss shay a general flavor of mild decay but nothing local as one may say there couldnt be for the deacons art had made it so like in every part that there was nt a chance for one to start for the wheels were just as strong as the thills and the floor was just as strong as the sills and the panels just as strong as the floor and the whippletree neither less nor more and the backcrossbar as strong as the fore and spring and axle and hub encore and yet as a whole it is past a doubt in another hour it will be worn out drawn by a rattailed ewenecked bay huddup said the parson off went they the parson was working his sundays text had got to fifthly and stopped perplexed at what the moses was coming next all at once the horse stood still close by the meetnhouse on the hill first a shiver and then a thrill then something decidedly like a spill and the parson was sitting upon a rock at half past nine by the meetnhouse clock just the hour of the earthquake shock what do you think the parson found when he got up and stared around the poor old chaise in a heap or mound as if it had been to the mill and ground you see of course if you re not a dunce how it went to pieces all at once all at once and nothing first just as bubbles do when they burst end of the wonderful onehoss shay logic is logic thats all i say parson turells legacy or the presidents old armchair a mathematical story facts respecting an old armchair at cambridge is kept in the college there seems but little the worse for wear that s remarkable when i say it was old in president holyokes day one of his boys perhaps you know died at one hundred years ago he took lodgings for rain or shine under green bedclothes in know old cambridge hope you do born there dont say so i was too born in a house with a gambrelroof standing still if you must have proof gambrel gambrel let me beg youll look at a horses hinder leg first great angle above the hoof that s the gambrel hence gambrelroof nicest place that ever was seen colleges red and common green sidewalks brownish with trees between sweetest spot beneath the skies when the cankerworms dont rise when the dust that sometimes flies into your mouth and ears and eyes in a quiet slumber lies not in the shape of umbaked pies such as barefoot children prize a kind of harbor it seems to be facing the flow of a boundless sea rows of gray old tutors stand ranged like rocks above the sand rolling beneath them soft and green breaks the tide of bright sixteen one wave two waves three waves four sliding up the sparkling floor then it ebbs to flow no more wandering off from shore to shore with its freight of golden ore pleasant place for boys to play better keep your girls away hearts get rolled as pebbles do which countless fingering waves pursue and every classic beach is strown with heartshaped pebbles of bloodred stone but this is neither here nor there im talking about an old armchair you ve heard no doubt of parson turell over at medford he used to dwell married one of the mathers folk got with his wife a chair of oak funny old chair with seat like wedge sharp behind and broad front edge one of the oddest of human things turned all over with knobs and rings but heavy and wide and deep and grand fit for the worthies of the land chief justice sewall a cause to try in or cotton mather to sit and lie in parson turell bequeathed the same to a certain student smith by name these were the terms as we are told saide smith saide chaire to have and holde when he doth graduate then to passe to ye oldest youth in ye senior classe on payment of naming a certain sum by him to whom ye chaire shall come he to ye oldest senior next and soe forever thus runs the text but one crown lesse then he gave to claime that being his debte for use of same smith transferred it to one of the browns and took his money five silver crowns brown delivered it up to moore who paid it is plain not five but four moore made over the chair to lee who gave him crowns of silver three lee conveyed it unto drew and now the payment of course was two drew gave up the chair to dunn all he got as you see was one dunn released the chair to hall and got by the bargain no crown at all and now it passed to a second brown who took it and likewise claimed a crown when brown conveyed it unto ware having had one crown to make it fair he paid him two crowns to take the chair and ware being honest as all wares be he paid one potter who took it three four got robinson five got dix johnson primus demanded six and so the sum kept gathering still till after the battle of bunkers hill when paper money became so cheap folks would nt count it but said a heap a certain richards the books declare a m in ive looked with care through the triennial name not there this person richards was offered then eightscore pounds but would have ten nine i think was the sum he took not quite certain but see the book by and by the wars were still but nothing had altered the parsons will the old armchair was solid yet but saddled with such a monstrous debt things grew quite too bad to bear paying such sums to get rid of the chair but dead mens fingers hold awful tight and there was the will in black and white plain enough for a child to spell what should be done no man could tell for the chair was a kind of nightmare curse and every season but made it worse as a last resort to clear the doubt they got old governor hancock out the governor came with his lighthorse troop and his mounted truckmen all cockahoop halberds glittered and colors flew french horns whinnied and trumpets blew the yellow fifes whistled between their teeth and the bumblebee bassdrums boomed beneath so he rode with all his band till the president met him cap in hand the governor hefted the crowns and said a will is a will and the parsons dead the governor hefted the crowns said he there is your pint and here s my fee these are the terms you must fulfil on such conditions i break the will the governor mentioned what these should be just wait a minute and then you ll see the president prayed then all was still and the governor rose and broke the will about those conditions well now you go and do as i tell you and then youll know once a year on commencement day if you ll only take the pains to stay youll see the president in the chair likewise the governor sitting there the president rises both old and young may hear his speech in a foreign tongue the meaning whereof as lawyers swear is this can i keep this old armchair and then his excellency bows as much as to say that he allows the vicegub next is called by name he bows like t other which means the same and all the officers round em bow as much as to say that they allow and a lot of parchments about the chair are handed to witnesses then and there and then the lawyers hold it clear that the chair is safe for another year god bless you gentlemen learn to give money to colleges while you live dont be silly and think youll

hall long live the gay servant that laughs for us all down down with the tyrant that masters us all poems from the professor at the breakfasttable under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes are shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone shall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and gray old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mass at last the rootlets of the trees shall find the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow hymn of trust o love divine that stooped to share our sharpest pang our bitterest tear on thee we cast each earthborn care we smile at pain while thou art near though long the weary way we tread and sorrow crown each lingering year no path we shun no darkness dread our hearts still whispering thou art near when drooping pleasure turns to grief and trembling faith is changed to fear the murmuring wind the quivering leaf shall softly tell us thou art near on thee we fling our burdening woe o love divine forever dear content to suffer while we know living and dying thou art near a sunday hymn lord of all being throned afar thy glory flames from sun and star centre and soul of every sphere yet to each loving heart how near sun of our life thy quickening ray sheds on our path the glow of day star of our hope thy softened light cheers the long watches of the night our midnight is thy smile withdrawn our noontide is thy gracious dawn our rainbow arch thy mercys sign all save the clouds of sin are thin lord of all life below above whose light is truth whose warmth is love before thy everblazing throne we ask no lustre of our own grant us thy truth to make us free and kindling hearts that burn for thee till all thy living altars claim one holy light one heavenly flame the crooked footpath ah here it is the sliding rail that marks the old remembered spot the gap that struck our schoolboy trail the crooked path across the lot it left the road by school and church a pencilled shadow nothing more that parted from the silverbirch and ended at the farmhouse door no line or compass traced its plan with frequent bends to left or right in aimless wayward curves it ran but always kept the door in sight the gabled porch with woodbine green the broken millstone at the sill though many a rood might stretch between the truant child could see them still no rocks across the pathway lie no fallen trunk is oer it thrown and yet it winds we know not why and turns as if for tree or stone perhaps some lover trod the way with shaking knees and leaping heart and so it often runs astray with sinuous sweep or sudden start or one perchance with clouded brain from some unholy banquet reeled and since our devious steps maintain his track across the trodden field nay deem not thus no earthborn will could ever trace a faultless line our truest steps are human still to walk unswerving were divine truants from love we dream of wrath oh rather let us trust the more through all the wanderings of the path we still can see our fathers door iris her book i pray thee by the soul of her that bore thee by thine own sisters spirit i implore thee deal gently with the leaves that lie before thee for iris had no mother to infold her nor ever leaned upon a sisters shoulder telling the twilight thoughts that nature told her she had not learned the mystery of awaking those chorded keys that soothe a sorrows aching giving the dumb heart voice that else were breaking yet lived wrought suffered lo the pictured token why should her fleeting daydreams fade unspoken like daffodils that die with sheaths unbroken she knew not love yet lived in maiden fancies walked simply clad a queen of high romances and talked strange tongues with angels in her trances twinsouled she seemed a twofold nature wearing sometimes a flashing falcon in her daring then a poor mateless dove that droops despairing

saints and thou by mortal sorrows riven save me oh save me shall i die forgiven and then ah god but nay it little matters look at the wasted seeds that autumn scatters the myriad germs that nature shapes and shatters if she had well she longed and knew not wherefore had the world nothing she might live to care for no second self to say her evening prayer for she knew the marble shapes that set

harmless gift of pleasing feature saying unsaddened this shall soon be faded and doublehued the shining tresses braided and all the sunlight of the morning shaded this her poor book is full of saddest follies of tearful smiles and laughing melancholies with summer roses twined and wintry hollies in the strange crossing of uncertain chances somewhere beneath some maidens teardimmed glances may fall

safely true and oer the presents parching ways the verse distils like evening dew but speak in words of living power they fall like drops of scalding rain that plashed before the burning shower swept

the opening of the piano in the little southern parlor of the house you may have seen with the gambrelroof and the gable looking westward to the green at the side toward the sunset with the window on its right stood the londonmade piano i am dreaming of tonight ah me i how i remember the evening when it came what a cry of eager voices what a group of cheeks in flame when the wondrous box was opened that had come from over seas with its smell of masticvarnish and its flash of ivory keys then the children all grew fretful in the restlessness of joy for the boy would push his sister and the sister crowd the boy till the father asked for quiet in his grave paternal way but the mother hushed the tumult with the words now mary play for the dear soul knew that music was a very sovereign balm she had sprinkled it over sorrow and seen its brow grow calm in the days of slender harpsichords with tapping tinkling quills or carolling to her spinet with its thin metallic thrills so mary the household minstrel who always loved to please sat down to the new clementi and struck the glittering keys hushed were the childrens voices and every eye grew dim as floating from lip and finger arose the vesper hymn catharine child of a neighbor curly and rosyred wedded since and a widow something like ten years dead hearing a gush of music such as none before steals from her mothers chamber and peeps at the open door just as the jubilate in threaded whisper dies open it open it lady the little maiden cries for she thought t was a singing creature caged in a box she heard open it open it lady

lily from the lake cold as a coiling watersnake rain me sweet odors on the air and wheel me up my indian chair and spread some book not overwise flat out before my sleepy eyes who knows it not this dead recoil of weary fibres stretched with toil the pulse that flutters faint and low when summers seething breezes blow o nature bare thy loving breast and give thy child one hour of rest one little hour to lie unseen beneath thy scarf of leafy green so curtained by a singing pine its murmuring voice shall blend with mine till lost in dreams my faltering lay in sweeter music dies away de sauty an

voice go seek thine earthborn sisters thus the voice that all obey the sad and silent three these only while the hosts of heaven rejoice smile never ask them what their sorrows be and when the secret of their griefs they tell look on them with thy mild halfhuman eyes say what thou wast on earth thou knowest well so shall they cease from unavailing sighs the angel why thus apart the swiftwinged herald spake sit ye with silent lips and unstrung lyres while the trisagions blending chords awake in shouts of joy from all the heavenly choirs first spirit chide not thy sisters thus the answer came children of earth our halfweaned nature clings to earths fond memories and her whispered name untunes our quivering lips our saddened strings for there we loved and where we love is home home that our feet may leave but not our hearts though oer us shine the jasperlighted dome the chain may lengthen but it never parts sometimes a sunlit sphere comes rolling by and then we softly whisper can it be and leaning toward the silvery orb we try to hear the music of its murmuring sea to catch perchance some flashing glimpse of green or breathe some wildwood fragrance wafted through the opening gates of pearl that fold between the blinding splendors and the changeless blue the angel nay sister nay a single healing leaf plucked from the bough of yon twelvefruited tree would soothe such anguish deeper stabbing grief has pierced thy throbbing heart the first spirit ah woe is me i from my clinging babe was rudely torn his tender lips a loveless bosom pressed can i forget him in my life new born oh that my darling lay upon my breast the angel and thou the second spirit i was a fair and youthful bride the kiss of love still burns upon my cheek he whom i worshipped ever at my side him through the spirit realm in vain i seek sweet faces turn their beaming eyes on mine ah not in these the wishedfor look i read still for that one dear human smile i pine thou and none other is the lovers creed the angel and whence thy sadness in a world of bliss where never parting comes nor mourners tear art thou too dreaming of a mortals kiss amid the seraphs of the heavenly sphere the third spirit nay tax not me with passions wasting fire when the swift message set my spirit free blind helpless lone i left my grayhaired sire my friends were many he had none save me i left him orphaned in the starless night alas for him no cheerful mornings dawn i wear the ransomed spirits robe of white yet still i hear him moaning she is gone the angel ye know me not sweet sisters all in vain ye seek your lost ones in the shapes they wore the flower once opened may not bud again the fruit once fallen finds the stem no more child lover sire yea all things loved below fair pictures damasked on a vapors fold fade like the roseate flush the golden glow when the bright curtain of the day is rolled i was the babe that slumbered on thy breast and sister mine the lips that called thee bride mine were the silvered locks thy hand caressed that faithful hand my faltering footsteps guide each changing form frail vesture of decay the soul unclad forgets it once hath worn stained with the travel of the weary day and shamed with rents from every wayside thorn to lie an infant in thy fond embrace to come with loves warm kisses back to thee to show thine eyes thy grayhaired fathers face not heaven itself could grant this may not be then spread your folded wings and leave to earth the dust once breathing ye have mourned so long till love new risen owns his heavenly birth and sorrows discords sweeten into song fantasia the young girls poem kiss mine eyelids beauteous morn blushing into life newborn lend me violets for my hair and thy russet robe to wear and thy ring of rosiest hue set in drops of diamond dew kiss my cheek thou noontide ray from my love so far away let thy splendor streaming down turn its pallid lilies brown till its darkening shades reveal where his passion pressed its seal kiss my lips thou lord of light kiss my lips a soft goodnight westward sinks thy golden car leave me but the evening star and my solace that shall be borrowing all its light from thee aunt tabitha the young girls poem whatever i do and whatever i say aunt tabitha tells me that is nt the way when she was a girl forty summers ago aunt tabitha tells me they never did so dear aunt if i only would take her advice but i like my own way and i find it so nice and besides i forget half the things i am told but they all will come back to me when i am old if a youth passes by it may happen no doubt he may chance to look in as i chance to look out she would never endure an impertinent stare it is horrid she says and i must nt sit there a walk in the moonlight has pleasures i own but it is nt quite safe to be walking alone so i take a lads arm just for safety you know but aunt tabitha tells me they did nt do so how wicked we are and how good they were then they kept at arms length those detestable men what an era of virtue she lived in but stay were the men all such rogues in aunt tabithas day if the men were so wicked i ll ask my papa how he dared to propose to my darling mamma was he like the rest of them goodness who knows and what shall i say if a wretch should propose i am thinking if aunt knew so little of sin what a wonder aunt tabithas aunt must have been and her grandaunt it scares me how shockingly sad that we girls of today are so frightfully bad a martyr will save us and nothing else can let me perish to rescue some wretched young man though when to the altar a victim i go aunt tabitha ll tell me she never did so windclouds and stardrifts from the young astronomers poem i ambition another clouded night the stars are hid the orb that waits my search is hid with them patience why grudge an hour a month a year to plant my ladder and to gain the round that leads my footsteps to the heaven of fame where waits the wreath my sleepless midnights won not the stained laurel such as heroes wear that withers when some stronger conquerors heel treads down their shrivelling trophies in the dust but the fair garland whose undying green not time can change nor wrath of gods or men with quickened heartbeats i shall hear tongues that speak my praise but better far the sense that in the unshaped ages buried deep in the dark mines of unaccomplished time yet to be stamped with mornings royal die and coined in golden days in those dim years i shall be reckoned with the undying dead my name emblazoned on the fiery arch unfading till the stars themselves shall fade then as they call the roll of shining worlds sages of race unborn in accents new shall count me with the olympian ones of old whose glories kindle through the midnight sky here glows the god of battles this recalls the lord of ocean and yon faroff sphere the sire of him who gave his ancient name to the dim planet with the wondrous rings here flames the queen of beautys silver lamp and there the moongirt orb of mighty jove but this unseen through all earths ions past a youth who watched beneath the western star sought in the darkness found and shewed to men linked with his name thenceforth and evermore so shall that name be syllabled anew in all the tongues of all the tribes of men i that have been through immemorial years dust in the dust of my forgotten time shall live in accents shaped of bloodwarm breath yea rise in mortal semblance newly born in shining stone in undecaying bronze and stand on high and look serenely down on the new race that calls the earth its own is this a cloud that blown athwart my soul wears a false seeming of the pearly stain where worlds beyond the world their mingling rays blend in soft white a cloud that born of earth would cheat the soul that looks for light from heaven must every coralinsect leave his sign on each poor grain he lent to build the reef as babels builders stamped their sunburnt clay or deem his patient service all in vain what if another sit beneath the shade of the broad elm i planted by the way what if another heed the beacon light i set upon the rock that wrecked my keel have i not done my task and served my kind nay rather act thy part unnamed unknown and let fame blow her trumpet through the world with noisy wind to swell a fools renown joined with some truth he stumbled blindly oer or coupled with some single shining deed that in the great account of all his days will stand alone upon the bankrupt sheet his pitying angel shows the clerk of heaven the noblest service comes from nameless hands and the best servant does his work unseen who found the seeds of fire and made them shoot fed by his breath in buds and flowers of flame who forged in roaring flames the ponderous stone and shaped the moulded metal to his need who gave the dragging car its rolling wheel and tamed the steed that whirls its circling round all these have left their work and not their names why should i murmur at a fate like theirs this is the heavenly light the pearly stain was but a windcloud drifting oer the stars ii regrets brief glimpses of the bright celestial spheres false lights false shadows vague uncertain gleams pale vaporous mists wan streaks of lurid flame the climbing of the upwardsailing cloud the sinking of the downwardfalling star all these are pictures of the changing moods borne through the midnight stillness of my soul here am i bound upon this pillared rock prey to the vulture of a vast desire that feeds upon my life i burst my bands and steal a moments freedom from the beak the clinging talons and the shadowing plumes then comes the false enchantress with her song thou wouldst not lay thy forehead in the dust like the base herd that feeds and breeds and dies lo the fair garlands that i weave for thee unchanging as the belt orion wears bright as the jewels of the sevenstarred crown the spangled stream of berenices hair and so she twines the fetters with the flowers around my yielding limbs and the fierce bird stoops to his quarry then to feed his rage of ravening hunger i must drain my blood and let the dewdrenched poisonbreeding night steal all the freshness from my fading cheek and leave its shadows round my caverned eyes all for a line in some unheeded scroll all for a stone that tells to gaping clowns here lies a restless wretch beneath a clod where squats the jealous nightmare men call fame i marvel not at him who scorns his kind and thinks not sadly of the time foretold when the old hulk we tread shall be a wreck a slag a cinder drifting through the sky without its crew of fools we live too long and even so are not content to die but load the mould that covers up our bones with stones that stand like beggars by the road and show deaths grievous wound and ask for tears write our great books to teach men who we are sing our fine songs that tell in artful phrase the secrets of our lives and plead and pray for alms of memory with the after time those few swift seasons while the earth shall wear its leafy summers ere its core grows cold and the moist life of all that breathes shall die or as the newborn seer perchance more wise would have us deem before its growing mass pelted with stardust stoned with meteorballs heats like a hammered anvil till at last man and his works and all that stirred itself of its own motion in the fiery glow turns to a flaming vapor ani our orb shines a new sun for earths that shall be born i am as old as egypt to myself brother to them that squared the pyramids by the same stars i watch i read the page where every letter is a glittering world with them who looked from shinars claybuilt towers ere yet the wanderer of the midland sea had missed the fallen sister of the seven i dwell in spaces vague remote unknown save to the silent few who leaving earth quit all communion with their living time i lose myself in that ethereal void till i have tired my wings and long to fill my breast with denser air to stand to walk with eyes not raised above my fellowmen sick of my unwalled solitary realm i ask to change the myriad lifeless worlds i visit as mine own for one poor patch of this dull spheroid and a little breath to shape in word or deed to serve my kind was ever giants dungeon dug so deep was ever tyrants fetter forged so strong was eer such deadly poison in the draught the false wife mingles for the trusting fool as he whose willing victim is himself digs forges mingles for his captive soul iii sympathies the snows that glittered on the disk of mars have melted and the planets fiery orb rolls in the crimson summer of its year but what to me the summer or the snow of worlds that throb with life in forms unknown if life indeed be theirs i heed not these my heart is simply human all my care for them whose dust is fashioned like mine own these ache with cold and hunger live in pain and shake with fear of worlds more full of woe there may be others worthier of my love but such i know not save through these i know there are two veils of language hid beneath whose sheltering folds we dare to be ourselves and not that other self which nods and smiles and babbles in our name the one is prayer lending its licensed freedom to the tongue that tells our sorrows and our sins to heaven the other verse that throws its spangled web around our naked speech and makes it bold i whose best prayer is silence sitting dumb in the great temple where i nightly serve him who is throned in light have dared to claim the poets franchise though i may not hope to wear his garland hear me while i tell my story in such form as poets use but breathed in fitful whispers as the wind sighs and then slumbers wakes and sighs again thou vision floating in the breathless air between me and the fairest of the stars i tell my lonely thoughts as unto thee look not for marvels of the scholars pen in my rude measure i can only show a slendermargined unillumined page and trust its meaning to the flattering eye that reads it in the gracious light of love ah wouldst thou clothe thyself in breathing shape and nestle at my side my voice should lend whateer my verse may lack of tender rhythm to make thee listen i have stood entranced when with her fingers wandering oer the keys the white enchantress with the golden hair breathed all her soul through some unvalued rhyme some flower of song that long had lost its bloom lo its dead summer kindled as she sang the sweet contralto like the ringdoves coo thrilled it with brooding fond caressing tones and the pale minstrels passion lived again tearful and trembling as a dewy rose the wind has shaken till it fills the air with light and fragrance such the wondrous charm a song can borrow when the bosom throbs that lends it breath so from the poets lips his verse sounds doubly sweet for none like him feels every cadence of its wavelike flow he lives the passion over while he reads that shook him as he sang his lofty strain and pours his life through each resounding line as ocean when the stormy winds are hushed still rolls and thunders through his billowy caves iv master and scholar let me retrace the record of the years that made me what i am a man most wise but overworn with toil and bent with age sought me to be his scholar me run wild from books and teachers kindled in my soul the love of knowledge led me to his tower showed me the wonders of the midnight realm his hollow sceptre ruled or seemed to rule taught me the mighty secrets of the spheres trained me to find the glimmering specks of light beyond the unaided sense and on my chart to string them one by one in order due as on a rosary a saint his beads i was his only scholar i became the echo to his thought whateer he knew was mine for asking so from year to year w e wrought together till there came a time when i the learner was the master half of the twinned being in the domecrowned tower minds roll in paths like planets they revolve this in a larger that a narrower ring but round they come at last to that same phase that selfsame light and shade they showed before i learned his annual and his monthly tale his weekly axiom and his daily phrase i felt them coming in the laden air and watched them laboring up to vocal breath even as the firstborn at his fathers board knows ere he speaks the too familiar jest is on its way by some mysterious sign forewarned the click before the striking bell he shrivelled as i spread my growing leaves till trust and reverence changed to pitying care he lived for me in what he once had been but i for him a shadow a defence the guardian of his fame his guide his staff leaned on so long he fell if left alone i was his eye his ear his cunning hand love was my spur and longing after fame but his the goading thorn of sleepless age that sees its shortening span its lengthening shades that clutches what it may with eager grasp and drops at last with empty outstretched hands all this he dreamed not he would sit him down thinking to work his problems as of old and find the star he thought so plain a blur the columned figures labyrinthine wilds without my comment blind and senseless scrawls that vexed him with their riddles he would strive and struggle for a while and then his eye would lose its light and over all his mind the cold gray mist would settle and erelong the darkness fell and i was left alone v alone alone no climber of an alpine cliff no arctic venturer on the waveless sea feels the dread stillness round him as it chills the heart of him who leaves the slumbering earth to watch the silent worlds that crowd the sky alone and as the shepherd leaves his flock to feed upon the hillside he meanwhile finds converse in the warblings of the pipe himself has fashioned for his vacant hour so have i grown companion to myself and to the wandering spirits of the air that smile and whisper round us in our dreams thus have i learned to search if i may know the whence and why of all beneath the stars and all beyond them and to weigh my life as in a balance poising good and ill against each other asking of the power that flung me forth among the whirling worlds if i am heir to any inborn right or only as an atom of the dust that every wind may blow whereer it will vi questioning i am not humble i was shown my place clad in such robes as nature had at hand took what she gave not chose i know no shame no fear for being simply what i am i am not proud i hold my every breath at natures mercy i am as a babe borne in a giants arms he knows not where each several heartbeat counted like the coin a miser reckons is a special gift as from an unseen hand if that withhold its bounty for a moment i am left a clod upon the earth to which i fall something i find in me that well might claim the love of beings in a sphere above this doubtful twilight world of right and wrong something that shows me of the selfsame clay that creeps or swims or flies in humblest form had i been asked before i left my bed of shapeless dust what clothing i would wear i would have said more angel and less worm but for their sake who are even such as i of the same mingled blood i would not choose to hate that meaner portion of myself which makes me brother to the least of men i dare not be a coward with my lips who dare to question all things in my soul some men may find their wisdom on their knees some prone and grovelling in the dust like slaves let the meek glowworm glisten in the dew i ask to lift my taper to the sky as they who hold their lamps above their heads trusting the larger currents up aloft rather than crossing eddies round their breast threatening with every puff the flickering blaze my life shall be a challenge not a truce this is my homage to the mightier powers to ask my boldest question undismayed by muttered threats that some hysteric sense of wrong or insult will convulse the throne where wisdom reigns supreme and if i err they all must err who have to feel their way as bats that fly at noon for what are we but creatures of the night dragged forth by day who needs must stumble and with stammering steps spell out their paths in syllables of pain thou wilt not hold in scorn the child who dares look up to thee the father dares to ask more than thy wisdom answers from thy hand the worlds were cast yet every leaflet claims from that same hand its little shining sphere of starlit dew thine image the great sun girt with his mantle of tempestuous flame glares in midheaven but to his noontide blaze the slender violet lifts its lidless eye and from his splendor steals its fairest hue its sweetest perfume from his scorching fire vii worship from my lone turret as i look around oer the green meadows to the ring of blue from slope from summit and from halfhid vale the sky is stabbed with daggerpointed spires their gilded symbols whirling in the wind their brazen tongues proclaiming to the world here truth is sold the only genuine ware see that it has our trademark you will buy poison instead of food across the way the lies of this or that each several name the standards blazon and the battlecry of some truegospel faction and again the token of the beast to all beside and grouped round each i see a huddling crowd alike in all things save the words they use in love in longing hate and fear the same whom do we trust and serve we speak of one and bow to many athens still would find the shrines of all she worshipped safe within our tall barbarian temples and the thrones that crowned olympus mighty as of old the god of music rules the sabbath choir the lyric muse must leave the sacred nine to help us please the dilettantes ear plutus limps homeward with us as we leave the portals of the temple where we knelt and listened while the god of eloquence hermes of ancient days but now disguised in sable vestments with that other god somnus the son of erebus and nox fights in unequal contest for our souls the dreadful sovereign of the under world still shakes his sceptre at us and we hear the baying of the triplethroated hound eros is young as ever and as fair the lovely goddess born of oceans foam these be thy gods o israel who is he the one ye name and tell us that ye serve whom ye would call me from my lonely tower to worship with the manyheaded throng is it the god that walked in edens grove in the cool hour to seek our guilty sire the god who dealt with abraham as the sons of that old patriarch deal with other men the jealous god of moses one who feels an image as an insult and is wroth with him who made it and his child unborn the god who plagued his people for the sin of their adulterous king beloved of him the same who offers to a chosen few the right to praise him in eternal song while a vast shrieking world of endless woe blends its dread chorus with their rapturous hymn is this the god ye mean or is it he who heeds the sparrows fall whose loving heart is as the pitying fathers to his child whose lesson to his children is forgive whose plea for all they know not what they do viii manhood i claim the right of knowing whom i serve else is my service idle he that asks my homage asks it from a reasoning soul to crawl is not to worship we have learned a drill of eyelids bended neck and knee hanging our prayers on hinges till we ape the flexures of the manyjointed worm asia has taught her allahs and salaams to the worlds children we have grown to men we who have rolled the sphere beneath our feet to find a virgin forest as we lay the beams of our rude temple first of all must frame its doorway high enough for man to pass unstooping knowing as we do that he who shaped us last of living forms has long enough been served by creeping things reptiles that left their footprints in the sand of old seamargins that have turned to stone and men who learned their ritual we demand to know him first then trust him and then love when we have found him worthy of our love tried by our own poor hearts and not before he must be truer than the truest friend he must be tenderer than a womans love a father better than the best of sires kinder than she who bore us though we sin oftener than did the brother we are told we poor illtempered mortals must forgive though seven times sinning threescore times and ten this is the new worlds gospel be ye men try well the legends of the childrens time ye are the chosen people god has led your steps across the desert of the deep as now across the desert of the shore mountains are cleft before you as the sea before the wandering tribe of israels sons still onward rolls the thunderous caravan its coming printed on the western sky a cloud by day by night a pillared flame your prophets are a hundred unto one of them of old who cried thus saith the lord they told of cities that should fall in heaps but yours of mightier cities that shall rise where yet the lonely fishers spread their nets where hides the fox and hoots the midnight owl the tree of knowledge in your garden grows not single but at every humble door its branches lend you their immortal food that fills you with the sense of what ye are no servants of an altar hewed and carved from senseless stone by craft of human hands rabbi or dervish brahmin bishop bonze but masters of the charm with which they work to keep your hands from that forbidden tree ye that have tasted that divinest fruit look on this world of yours with opened eyes y e are as gods nay makers of your gods each day ye break an image in your shrine and plant a fairer image where it stood where is the moloch of your fathers creed whose fires of torment burned for span long babes fit object for a tender mothers love why not it was a bargain duly made for these same infants through the suretys act intrusted with their all for earth and heaven by him who chose their guardian knowing well his fitness for the task this even this was the true doctrine only yesterday as thoughts are reckoned and to day you hear in words that sound as if from human tongues those monstrous uncouth horrors of the past that blot the blue of heaven and shame the earth as would the saurians of the age of slime awaking from their stony sepulchres and wallowing hateful in the eye of day ix rights what am i but the creature thou hast made what have i save the blessings thou hast lent what hope i but thy mercy and thy love who but myself shall cloud my soul with fear whose hand protect me from myself but thine i claim the rights of weakness i the babe call on my sire to shield me from the ills that still beset my path not trying me with snares beyond my wisdom or my strength he knowing i shall use them to my harm and find a tenfold misery in the sense that in my childlike folly i have sprung the trap upon myself as vermin use drawn by the cunning bait to certain doom who wrought the wondrous charm that leads us on to sweet perdition but the selfsame power that set the fearful engine to destroy his wretched offspring as the rabbis tell and hid its yawning jaws and treacherous springs in such a show of innocent sweet flowers it lured the sinless angels and they fell ah he who prayed the prayer of all mankind summed in those few brief words the mightiest plea for erring souls before the courts of heaven save us from being tempted lest we fall if we are only as the potters clay made to be fashioned as the artist wills and broken into shards if we offend the eye of him who made us it is well such love as the insensate lump of clay that spins upon the swiftrevolving wheel bears to the hand that shapes its growing form such love no more will be our hearts return to the great masterworkman for his care or would be save that this our breathing clay is intertwined with fine innumerous threads that make it conscious in its framers hand and this he must remember who has filled these vessels with the deadly draught of life life that means death to all it claims our love must kindle in the ray that streams from heaven a faint reflection of the light divine the sun must warm the earth before the rose can show her inmost heartleaves to the sun he yields some fraction of the makers right who gives the quivering nerve its sense of pain is there not something in the pleading eye of the poor brute that suffers which arraigns the law that bids it suffer has it not a claim for some remembrance in the book that fills its pages with the idle words spoken of men or is it only clay bleeding and aching in the potters hand yet all his own to treat it as he will and when he will to cast it at his feet shattered dishonored lost forevermore my dog loves me but could he look beyond his earthly master would his love extend to him who hush i will not doubt that he is better than our fears and will not wrong the least the meanest of created things he would not trust me with the smallest orb that circles through the sky he would not give a meteor to my guidance would not leave the coloring of a cloudlet to my hand he locks my beating heart beneath its bars and keeps the key himself he measures out the draughts of vital breath that warm my blood winds up the springs of instinct which uncoil each in its season ties me to my home my race my time my nation and my creed so closely that if i but slip my wrist out of the band that cuts it to the bone men say he hath a devil he has lent all that i hold in trust as unto one by reason of his weakness and his years not fit to hold the smallest shred in fee of those most common things he calls his own and yet my rabbi tells me he has left the care of that to which a million worlds filled with unconscious life were less than naught has left that mighty universe the soul to the weak guidance of our baby hands let the foul fiends have access at their will taking the shape of angels to our hearts our hearts already poisoned through and through with the fierce virus of ancestral sin turned us adrift with our immortal charge to wreck ourselves in gulfs of endless woe if what my rabbi tells me is the truth why did the choir of angels sing for joy heaven must be compassed in a narrow space and offer more than room enough for all that pass its portals but the underworld the godless realm the place where demons forge their fiery darts and adamantine chains must swarm with ghosts that for a little while had worn the garb of flesh and being heirs of all the dulness of their stolid sires and all the erring instincts of their tribe natures own teaching rudiments of sin fell headlong in the snare that could not fail to trap the wretched creatures shaped of clay and cursed with sense enough to lose their souls brother thy heart is troubled at my word sister i see the cloud is on thy brow he will not blame me he who sends not peace but sends a sword and bids us strike amain at errors gilded crest where in the van of earths great army mingling with the best and bravest of its leaders shouting loud the battlecries that yesterday have led the host of truth to victory but today are watchwords of the laggard and the slave he leads his dazzled cohorts god has made this world a strife of atoms and of spheres with every breath i sigh myself away and take my tribute from the wandering wind to fan the flame of lifes consuming fire so while my thought has life it needs must burn and burning set the stubblefields ablaze where all the harvest long ago was reaped and safely garnered in the ancient barns but still the gleaners groping for their food go blindly feeling through the closeshorn straw while the young reapers flash their glittering steel where later suns have ripened nobler grain x truths the time is racked with birthpangs every hour brings forth some gasping truth and truth newborn looks a misshapen and untimely growth the terror of the household and its shame a monster coiling in its nurses lap that some would strangle some would only starve but still it breathes and passed from hand to hand and suckled at a hundred halfclad breasts comes slowly to its stature and its form calms the rough ridges of its dragonscales changes to shining locks its snaky hair and moves transfigured into angel guise welcomed by all that cursed its hour of birth and folded in the same encircling arms that cast it like a serpent from their hold if thou wouldst live in honor die in peace have the fine words the marbleworkers learn to carve so well upon thy funeralstone and earn a fair obituary dressed in all the manycolored robes of praise be deafer than the adder to the cry of that same foundling truth until it grows to seemly favor and at length has won the smiles of hardmouthed men and lightlipped dames then snatch it from its meagre nurses breast fold it in silk and give it food from gold so shalt thou share its glory when at last it drops its mortal vesture and revealed in all the splendor of its heavenly form spreads on the startled air its mighty wings alas how much that seemed immortal truth that heroes fought for martyrs died to save reveals its earthborn lineage growing old and limping in its march its wings unplumed its heavenly semblance faded like a dream here in this painted casket just unsealed lies what was once a breathing shape like thine once loved as thou art loved there beamed the eyes that looked on memphis in its hour of pride that saw the walls of hundredgated thebes and all the mirrored glories of the nile see how they toiled that allconsuming time might leave the frame immortal in its tomb filled it with fragrant balms and odorous gums that still diffuse their sweetness through the air and wound and wound with patient fold on fold the flaxen bands thy hand has rudely torn perchance thou yet canst see the faded stain of the sad mourners tear xi idols but what is this the sacred beetle bound upon the breast of the blind heathen snatch the curious prize give it a place among thy treasured spoils fossil and relic corals encrinites the fly in amber and the fish in stone the twisted circlet of etruscan gold medal intaglio poniard poisonring place for the memphian beetle with thine hoard am longer than thy creed has blest the world this toy thus ravished from thy brothers breast was to the heart of mizraim as divine as holy as the symbol that we lay on the still bosom of our whiterobed dead and raise above their dust that all may know here sleeps an heir of glory loving friends with tears of trembling faith and choking sobs and prayers to those who judge of mortal deeds wrapped this poor image in the cerements fold that isis and osiris friends of man might know their own and claim the ransomed soul an idol man was born to worship such an idol is an image of his thought sometimes he carves it out of gleaming stone and sometimes moulds it out of glittering gold or rounds it in a mighty frescoed dome or lifts it heavenward in a lofty spire or shapes it in a cunning frame of words or pays his priest to make it day by day for sense must have its god as well as soul a newborn dian calls for silver shrines and egypts holiest symbol is our own the sign we worship as did they of old when isis and osiris ruled the world let us be true to our most subtle selves we long to have our idols like the rest think when the men of israel had their god encamped among them talking with their chief leading them in the pillar of the cloud and watching oer them in the shaft of fire they still must have an image still they longed for somewhat of substantial solid form whereon to hang their garlands and to fix their wandering thoughts and gain a stronger hold for their uncertain faith not yet assured if those same meteors of the day and night were not mere exhalations of the soil are we less earthly than the chosen race are we more neighbors of the living god than they who gathered manna every morn reaping where none had sown and heard the voice of him who met the highest in the mount and brought them tables graven with his hand yet these must have their idol brought their gold that starbrowed apis might be god again yea from their ears the women brake the rings that lent such splendors to the gypsy brown of sunburnt cheeks what more could woman do to show her pious zeal they went astray but nature led them as it leads us all we too who mock at israels golden calf and scoff at egypts sacred scarabee would have our amulets to clasp and kiss and flood with rapturous tears and bear with us to be our dear companions in the dust such magic works an image in our souls man is an embryo see at twenty years his bones the columns that uphold his frame not yet cemented shaft and capital mere fragments of the temple incomplete at twoscore threescore is he then full grown nay still a child and as the little maids dress and undress their puppets so he tries to dress a lifeless creed as if it lived and change its raiment when the world cries shame we smile to see our little ones at play so grave so thoughtful with maternal care nursing the wisps of rags they call their babes does he not smile who sees us with the toys we call by sacred names and idly feign to be what we have called them he is still the father of this helpless nurserybrood whose second childhood joins so close its first that in the crowding hurrying years between we scarce have trained our senses to their task before the gathering mist has dimmed our eyes and with our hollowed palm we help our ear and trace with trembling hand our wrinkled names and then begin to tell our stories oer and see not hear the whispering lips that say you know your father knew him this is he tottering and leaning on the hirelings arm and so at length disrobed of all that clad the simple life we share with weed and worm go to our cradles naked as we came xii love what if a soul redeemed a spirit that loved while yet on earth and was beloved in turn and still remembered every look and tone of that dear earthly sister who was left among the unwise virgins at the gate itself admitted with the bridegrooms train what if this spirit redeemed amid the host of chanting angels in some transient lull of the eternal anthem heard the cry of its lost darling whom in evil hour some wilder pulse of nature led astray and left an outcast in a world of fire condemned to be the sport of cruel fiends sleepless unpitying masters of the skill to wring the maddest ecstasies of pain from wornout souls that only ask to die would it not long to leave the bliss of heaven bearing a little water in its hand to moisten those poor lips that plead in vain with him we call our father or is all so changed in such as taste celestial joy they hear unmoved the endless wail of woe the daughter in the same dear tones that hushed her cradle slumbers she who once had held a babe upon her bosom from its voice hoarse with its cry of anguish yet the same no not in ages when the dreadful bird stamped his huge footprints and the fearful beast strode with the flesh about those fossil bones we build to mimic life with pygmy hands not in those earliest days when men ran wild and gashed each other with their knives of stone when their low foreheads bulged in ridgy brows and their flat hands were callous in the palm with walking in the fashion of their sires grope as they might to find a cruel god to work their will on such as human wrath had wrought its worst to torture and had left with rage unsated white and stark and cold could hate have shaped a demon more malign than him the dead men mummied in their creed and taught their trembling children to adore made in his image sweet and gracious souls dear to my heart by natures fondest names is not your memory still the precious mould that lends its form to him who hears my prayer thus only i behold him like to them longsuffering gentle ever slow to wrath if wrath it be that only wounds to heal ready to meet the wanderer ere he reach the door he seeks forgetful of his sin longing to clasp him in a fathers arms and seal his pardon with a pitying tear four gospels tell their story to mankind and none so full of soft caressing words that bring the maid of bethlehem and her babe before our teardimmed eyes as his who learned in the meek service of his gracious art the tones which like the medicinal balms that calm the sufferers anguish soothe our souls oh that the loving woman she who sat so long a listener at her masters feet had left us marys gospel all she heard too sweet too subtle for the ear of man mark how the tenderhearted mothers read the messages of love between the lines of the same page that loads the bitter tongue of him who deals in terror as his trade with threatening words of wrath that scorch like flame they tell of angels whispering round the bed of the sweet infant smiling in its dream of lambs enfolded in the shepherds arms of him who blessed the children of the land where crystal rivers feed unfading flowers of cities goldenpaved with streets of pearl of the white robes the winged creatures wear the crowns and harps from whose melodious strings one long sweet anthem flows forevermore we too had human mothers even as thou whom we have learned to worship as remote from mortal kindred wast a cradled babe the milk of woman filled our branching veins she lulled us with her tender nurserysong and folded round us her untiring arms while the first unremembered twilight yeas shaped us to conscious being still we feel her pulses in our own too faintly feel would that the heart of woman warmed our creeds not from the sadeyed hermits lonely cell not from the conclave where the holy men glare on each other as with angry eyes they battle for gods glory and their own till sick of wordy strife a show of hands fixes the faith of ages yet unborn ah not from these the listening soul can hear the fathers voice that speaks itself divine love must be still our master till we learn what he can teach us of a womans heart we know

filled their cups with dew thy slender voice with rippling trill the budding april bowers would fill nor passed its joyous tones away when april rounded into may thy life shall hail no second dawn sing little bird the spring is gone and i remember welladay thy fullblown summer roundelay as when behind a broidered screen some holy maiden sings unseen with answering notes the woodland rung and every treetop found a tongue how deep the shade the groves how fair sing little bird the woods are bare the summers throbbing chant is done and mute the choral antiphon the birds have left the shivering pines to flit among the trellised vines or fan the air with scented plumes amid the lovesick orangeblooms and thou art here alone alone sing little bird the rest have flown the snow has capped yon distant hill at morn the running brook was still from driven herds the clouds that rise are like the smoke of sacrifice erelong the frozen sod shall mock the ploughshare changed to stubborn rock the brawling streams shall soon be dumb sing little bird the frosts have come fast fast the lengthening shadows creep the songless fowls are half asleep the air grows chill the setting sun may leave thee ere thy song is done the pulse that warms thy breast grow cold thy secret die with thee untold the lingering sunset still is bright sing little bird t will soon be night dorothy q a family portrait i cannot tell the story of dorothy q more simply in prose than i have told it in verse but i can add something to it dorothy was the daughter of judge edmund quincy and the niece of josiah quincy junior the young patriot and orator who died just before the american revolution of which he was one of the most eloquent and effective promoters the son of the latter josiah quincy the first mayor of boston bearing that name lived to a great age one of the most useful and honored citizens of his time the canvas of the painting was so much decayed that it had to be replaced by a new one in doing which the rapier thrust was of course filled up grandmothers mother her age i guess thirteen summers or something less girlish bust but womanly air smooth square forehead with uprolled hair lips that lover has never kissed taper fingers and slender wrist hanging sleeves of stiff brocade so they painted the little maid on her hand a parrot green sits unmoving and broods serene hold up the canvas full in view look theres a rent the light shines through dark with a centurys fringe of dust that was a redcoats rapierthrust such is the tale the lady old dorothys daughters daughter told who the painter was none may tell one whose best was not over well hard and dry it must be confessed flat as a rose that has long been pressed yet in her cheek the hues are bright dainty colors of red and white and in her slender shape are seen hint and promise of stately mien look not on her with eyes of scorn dorothy q was a lady born ay since the galloping normans came englands annals have known her name and still to the threebilled rebel town dear is that ancient names renown for many a civic wreath they won the youthful sire and the grayhaired son o damsel dorothy dorothy q strange is the gift that i owe to you such a gift as never a king save to daughter or son might bring all my tenure of heart and hand all my title to house and land mother and sister and child and wife and joy and sorrow and death and life what if a hundred years ago those closeshut lips had answered no when forth the tremulous question came that cost the maiden her norman name and under the folds that look so still the bodice swelled with the bosoms thrill should i be i or would it be one tenth another to nine tenths me soft is the breath of a maidens yes not the light gossamer stirs with less but never a cable that holds so fast through all the battles of wave and blast and never an echo of speech or song that lives in the babbling air so long there were tones in the voice that whispered then you may hear today in a hundred men o lady and lover how faint and far your images hover and here we are solid and stirring in flesh and bone edwards and dorothys all their own a goodly record for time to show of a syllable spoken so long ago shall i bless you dorothy or forgive for the tender whisper that bade me live it shall be a blessing my little maid i will heal the stab of the redcoats blade and freshen the gold of the tarnished frame and gild with a rhyme your household name so you shall smile on us brave and bright as first you greeted the mornings light and live untroubled by woes and fears through a second youth of a hundred years the organblower devoutest of my sunday friends the patient organblower bends i see his figure sink and rise forgive me heaven my wandering eyes a moment lost the next half seen his head above the scanty screen still measuring out his deep salaams through quavering hymns and panting psalms no priest that prays in gilded stole to save a rich mans mortgaged soul no sister fresh from holy vows so humbly stoops so meekly bows his large obeisance puts to shame the proudest genuflecting dame whose easter bonnet low descends with all the grace devotion lends o brother with the supple spine how much we owe those bows of thine without thine arm to lend the breeze how vain the finger on the keys though all unmatched the players skill those thousand throats were dumb and still anothers art may shape the tone the breath that fills it is thine own six days the silent memnon waits behind his temples folded gates but when the seventh days sunshine falls through rainbowed windows on the walls he breathes he sings he shouts he fills the quivering air with rapturous thrills the roof resounds the pillars shake and all the slumbering echoes wake the preacher from the bibletext with weary words my soul has vexed some stranger fumbling far astray to find the lesson for the day he tells us truths too plainly true and reads the service all askew why why the mischief cant he look beforehand in the servicebook but thou with decent mien and face art always ready in thy place thy strenuous blast whateer the tune as steady as the strong monsoon thy only dread a leathery creak or small residual extra squeak to send along the shadowy aisles a sunlit wave of dimpled smiles not all the preaching o my friend comes from the churchs pulpit end not all that bend the knee and bow yield service half so true as thou one simple task performed aright with slender skill but all thy might where honest labor does its best and leaves the player all the rest this manydiapasoned maze through which the breath of being strays whose music makes our earth divine has work for mortal hands like mine my duty lies before me lo the lever there take hold and blow and he whose hand is on the keys will play the tune as he shall please at the pantomime the house was crammed from roof to floor heads piled on heads at every door half dead with augusts seething heat i crowded on and found my seat my patience slightly out of joint my temper short of boilingpoint not quite at hate mankind as such nor yet at love them overmuch amidst the throng the pageant drew were gathered hebrews not a few blackbearded swarthy at their side dark jewelled women orienteyed if scarce a christian hopes for grace who crowds one in his narrow place what will the savage victim do whose ribs are kneaded by a jew next on my left a breathing form wedged up against me close and warm the beak that crowned the bistred face betrayed the mould of abrahams race that coalblack hair that smokebrown hue ah cursed unbelieving jew i started shuddering to the right and squeezed a second israelite then woke the evil brood of rage that slumber tongueless in their cage i stabbed in turn with silent oaths the hooknosed kite of carrion clothes the snaky usurer him that crawls and cheats beneath the golden balls moses and levi all the horde spawn of the race that slew its lord up came their murderous deeds of old the grisly story chaucer told and many an ugly tale beside of children caught and crucified i heard the ducatsweating thieves beneath the ghettos slouching eaves and thrust beyond the tented green the lepers cry unclean unclean the show went on but ill at ease my sullen eye it could not please in vain my conscience whispered shame who but their maker is to blame i thought of judas and his bribe and steeled my soul against their tribe my neighbors stirred i looked again full on the younger of the twain a fresh young cheek whose olive hue the mantling blood shows faintly through locks dark as midnight that divide and shade the neck on either side soft gentle loving eyes that gleam clear as a starlit mountain stream so looked that other child of shem the maidens boy of bethlehem and thou couldst scorn the peerless blood that flows immingled from the flood thy scutcheon spotted with the stains of norman thieves and pirate danes the new worlds foundling in thy pride scowl on the hebrew at thy side and lo the very semblance there the lord of glory deigned to wear i see that radiant image rise the flowing hair the pitying eyes the faintly crimsoned cheek that shows the blush of sharons opening rose thy hands would clasp his hallowed feet whose brethren soil thy christian seat thy lips would press his garments hem that curl in wrathful scorn for them a sudden mist a watery screen dropped like a veil before the scene the shadow floated from my soul and to my lips a whisper stole thy prophets caught the spirits flame from thee the son of mary came with thee the father deigned to dwell peace be upon thee israel rewritten after the fire while far along the eastern sky i saw the flags of havoc fly as if his forces would assault the sovereign of the starry vault and hurl him back the burning rain that seared the cities of the plain i read as on a crimson page the words of israels sceptred sage for riches make them wings and they do as an eagle fly away o vision of that sleepless night what hue shall paint the mocking light that burned and stained the orient skies where peaceful morning loves to rise as if the sun had lost his way and dawned to make a second day above how red with fiery glow how dark to those it woke below on roof and wall on dome and spire flashed the false jewels of the fire girt with her belt of glittering panes and crowned with starrygleaming vanes our northern queen in glory shone with newborn splendors not her own and stood transfigured in our eyes a victim decked for sacrifice the cloud still hovers overhead and still the midnight sky is red as the lost wanderer strays alone to seek the place he called his own his devious footprints sadly tell how changed the pathways known so well the scene how new the tale how old ere yet the ashes have grown cold again i read the words that came writ in the rubric of the flame hower we trust to mortal things each hath its pair of folded wings though long their terrors rest unspread their fatal plumes are never shed at last at last they spread in flight and blot the day and blast then night hope only hope of all that clings around us never spreads her wings love though he break his earthly chain still whispers he will come again but faith that soars to seek the sky shall teach our halffledged souls to fly and find beyond the smoke and flame the cloudless azure whence they came a ballad of the boston teaparty read at a meeting of the massachusetts historical society no never such a draught was poured since hebe served with nectar the bright olympians and their lord her overkind protector since father noah squeezed the grape and took to such behaving as would have shamed our grandsire ape before the days of shaving no neer was mingled such a draught in palace hall or arbor as freemen brewed and tyrants quaffed that night in boston harbor the western warclouds crimson stained the thames the clyde the shannon full many a sixfoot grenadier the flattened grass had measured and many a mother many a year her tearful memories treasured fast spread the tempests darkening pall the mighty realms were troubled the storm broke loose but first of all the boston teapot bubbled an evening party only that no formal invitation no goldlaced coat no stiff cravat no feast in contemplation no silkrobed dames no fiddling band no flowers no songs no dancing a tribe of red men axe in hand behold the guests advancing how fast the stragglers join the throng from stall and workshop gathered the lively barber skips along and leaves a chin halflathered the smith has flung his hammer down the horseshoe still is glowing the truant tapster at the crown has left a beercask flowing the coopers boys have dropped the adze and trot behind their master up run the tarry shipyard lads the crowd is hurrying faster out from the millponds purlieus gush the streams of whitefaced millers and down their slippery alleys rush the lusty young forthillers the ropewalk lends its prentice crew the tories seize the omen ay boys youll soon have work to do for englands rebel foemen king hancock adams and their gang that fire the mob with treason when these we shoot and those we hang the town will come to reason on on to where the teaships ride and now their ranks are forming a rush and up the dartmouths side the mohawk band is swarming see the fierce natives what a glimpse of paint and fur and feather as all at once the fullgrown imps light on the deck together a scarf the pigtails secret keeps a blanket hides the breeches and out the cursed cargo leaps and overboard it pitches o woman at the evening board so gracious sweet and purring so happy while the tea is poured so blest while spoons are stirring what martyr can compare with thee the mother wife or daughter that night instead of best bohea condemned to milk and water ah little dreams the quiet dame who plies with rock and spindle the patient flax how great a flame yon little spark shall kindle the lurid morning shall reveal a fire no king can smother where british flint and boston steel have clashed against each other old charters shrivel in its track his worships bench has crumbled it climbs and clasps the unionjack its blazoned pomp is humbled the flags go down on land and sea like corn before the reapers so burned the fire that brewed the tea that boston

tealeaf savor our old northenders in their spray still taste a hyson flavor and freedoms teacup still oerflows with ever fresh libations to cheat of slumber all her foes and cheer the wakening nations nearing the snowline slow toiling upward from the misty vale i leave the bright enamelled zones below no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow their lingering sweetness load the morning gale few are the slender flowerets scentless pale that on their iceclad stems all trembling blow along the margin of unmelting snow yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail white realm of peace above the flowering line welcome thy frozen domes thy rocky spires oer thee undimmed the moongirt planets shine on thy majestic altars fade the fires that filled the air with smoke of vain desires and all the

gathered to greet the echoes are longing that word to repeat it springs to the lips that are waiting to part for its syllables spell themselves first in the heart its accents may vary its sound may be strange but it bears a kind message that nothing can change the dwellers by neva its meaning can tell for the smile its interpreter shows it full well that word how it gladdened the pilgrim yore as he stood in the snow on the desolate shore when the shout of the sagamore startled his ear in the phrase of the saxon t was music to hear ah little could samoset offer our sire the cabin the corncake the seat by the fire he had nothing to give the poor lord of the land but he gave him a welcome his heart in his hand the tribe of the sachem has melted away but the word that he spoke is remembered today and the page that is red with the record of shame the teardrops have whitened round samosets name the word that he spoke to the pilgrim of old may sound like a tale that has often been told but the welcome we speak is as fresh as the dew as the kiss of a lover that always is new ay guest of the nation each roof is thine own through all the broad continents starbannered zone from the shore where the curtain of morn is uprolled to the billows that flow through the gateway of gold the snowcrested mountains are calling aloud nevada to ural speaks out of the cloud and shasta shouts forth from his throne in the sky to the stormsplintered summits the peaks of altai you must leave him they say till the summer is green both shores are his home though the waves roll between and then well return him

sunset sea waits with outspread arms for thee open wide ye gates of gold to the dragons bannerfold builders of the mighty wall bid your mountain barriers fall so may the girdle of the sun bind the

hoangho at the banquet to the japanese embassy august we welcome you lords of the land of the sun the voice of the many sounds feebly through one ah would t were a voice of more musical tone but the dogstar is here and the songbirds have flown and what shall i sing that can cheat you of smiles ye heralds of peace from the orient isles if only the jubilee why did you wait you are welcome but oh youre a little too late we have greeted our brothers of ireland and france round the fiddle of strauss we have joined in the dance we have lagered herr saro that finelooking man and glorified godfrey whose name it is dan what a pity weve missed it and youve missed it too we had a day ready and waiting for you wed have shown you provided of course you had come you d have heard no you would nt because it was dumb and then the great organ the choruss shout like the mixture teetotalers call cold without a mingling of elements strong but not sweet and the drum just referred to that couldnt be beat the shrines of our pilgrims are not like your own where white fusiyama lifts proudly its cone the snowmantled mountain we see on the fan that cools our hot cheeks with a breeze from japan but ours the wide temple where worship is free as the wind of the prairie the wave of the sea you may build your own altar wherever you will for the roof of that temple is over you still one dome overarches the starbannered shore you may enter the popes or the puritans door or pass with the buddhist his gateway of bronze for a priest is but man be he bishop or bonze and the lesson we teach with the sword and the pen is to all of gods children we also are men if you wrong us we smart if you prick us we bleed if you love us no quarrel with color or creed youll find us a wellmeaning freespoken crowd goodnatured enough but a little too loud to be sure there is always a bit of a row when we choose our tycoon and especially now youll take it all calmly we want you to see what a peaceable fight such a contest can be and of one thing be certain however it ends you will find that our voters have chosen your friends if the horse that stands saddled is first in the race you will greet your old friend with the weed in his face and if the white hat and the white house agree youll find h g really as loving as he but oh what a pity once more i must say that we could not have joined in a japanese day such greeting we give you tonight as we can long life to our brothers and friends of japan the lord of the mountain looks down from his crest as the banner of morning unfurls in the west the eagle was always the friend of the sun you are welcome the song of the cagebird is done bryants seventieth birthday november o evenhanded nature we confess this life that men so honor love and bless has filled thine olden measure not the less we count the precious seasons that remain strike not the level of the golden grain but heap it high with years that earth may gain what heaven can lose for heaven is rich in song do not all poets dying still prolong their broken chants amid the seraph throng where blind no more ionias bard is seen and englands heavenly minstrel sits between the mantuan and the wancheeked florentine this was the first sweet singer in the cage of our closewoven life a newborn age claims in his vesper song its heritage spare us oh spare us long our hearts desire moloch who calls our children through the fire leaves us the gentle master of the lyre we count not on the dial of the sun the hours the minutes that his sands have run rather as on those flowers that one by one from earliest dawn their ordered bloom display till evenings planet with her guiding ray leads in the blind old mother of the day we reckon by his songs each song a flower the long long daylight numbering hour by hour each breathing sweetness like a bridal bower his morning glory shall we eer forget his noontides fullblown lily coronet his evening primrose has not opened yet nay even if creeping time should hide the skies in midnight from his centuryladen eyes darkened like his who sang of paradise would not some hidden songbud open bright as the resplendent cactus of the night that floods the gloom with fragrance and with light how can we praise the verse whose music flows with solemn cadence and majestic close pure as the dew that filters through the rose how shall we thank him that in evil days he faltered never nor for blame nor praise nor hire nor party shamed his earlier lays but as his boyhood was of manliest hue so to his youth his manly years were true all dyed in royal purple through and through he for whose touch the lyre of heaven is strung needs not the flattering toil of mortal tongue let not the singer grieve to die unsung marbles forget their message to mankind in his own verse the poet still we find in his own page his memory lives enshrined as in their amber sweets the smothered bees as the fair cedar fallen before the breeze lies selfembalmed amidst the mouldering trees poets like youngest children never grow out of their mothers fondness nature so holds their soft hands and will not let them go till at the last they track with even feet her rhythmic footsteps and their pulses beat twinned with her pulses and their lips repeat the secrets she has told them as their own thus is the inmost soul of nature known and the rapt minstrel shares her awful throne o lover of her mountains and her woods her bridal chambers leafy solitudes where love himself with tremulous step intrudes her snows fall harmless on thy sacred fire far be the day that claims thy sounding lyre to join the music of the angel choir yet since lifes amplest measure must be filled since throbbing hearts must be forever stilled and all must fade that evening sunsets gild grant father ere he close the mortal eyes that see a nations reeking sacrifice its smoke may vanish from these blackened skies then when his summons comes since come it must and looking heavenward with unfaltering trust he wraps his drapery round him for the dust his last fond glance will show him oer his head the northern fires beyond the zenith spread in lambent glory blue and white and red the southern cross without its bleeding load the milky way of peace all freshly strowed and every whitethroned star fixed in its lost abode a farewell to agassiz how the mountains talked together looking down upon the weather when they heard our friend had planned his little trip among the andes how theyll bare their snowy scalps to the climber of the alps when the cry goes through their passes here comes the great agassiz yes im tall says chimborazo but i wait for him to say so thats the only thing that lacks he must see me cotopaxi ay ay the firepeak thunders and he must view my wonders im but a lonely crater till i have him for spectator the mountain hearts are yearning the lavatorches burning the rivers bend to meet him the forests bow to greet him it thrills the spinal column of fossil fishes solemn and glaciers crawl the faster to the feet of their old master heaven keep him well and hearty both him and all his party from the sun that broils and smites from the centipede that bites from the hailstorm and the thunder from the vampire and the condor from the gust upon the river from the sudden earthquake shiver from the trip of mule or donkey from the midnight howling monkey from the stroke of knife or dagger from the puma and the jaguar from the horrid boaconstrictor that has scared us in the pictur from the indians of the pampas who would dine upon their grampas from every beast and vermin that to think of sets us squirmin from every snake that tries on the traveller his pison from every pest of natur likewise the alligator and from two things left behind him be sure theyll try to find him the taxbill and assessor heaven keep the great professor may he find with his apostles that the land is full of fossils that the waters swarm with fishes shaped according to his wishes that every pool is fertile in fancy kinds of turtle new birds around him singing new insects never stinging with a million novel data about the articulata and facts that strip off all husks from the history of mollusks and when with loud te deum he returns to his museum may he find the monstrous reptile that so long the land has kept ill by grant and sherman throttled and by father abraham bottled all specked and streaked and mottled with the scars of murderous battles where he clashed the iron rattles that gods and men he shook at for all the world to look at god bless the great professor and madam too god bless her bless him and all his band on the sea and on the land bless them head and heart and hand till their glorious raid is oer and they touch our ransomed shore then the welcome of a nation with its shout of exultation shall awake the dumb creation and the shapes of buried aeons join the living creatures poeans till the fossil echoes roar while the mighty megalosaurus leads the palaeozoic chorus god bless the great professor and the land his proud possessor bless them now and evermore at a dinner to admiral farragut july now smiling friends and shipmates all since half our battle s won a broadside for our admiral load every crystal gun stand ready till i give the word you wont have time to tire and when that glorious name is heard then hip hurrah and fire bow foremost sinks the rebel craft our eyes not sadly turn and see the pirates huddling aft to drop their raft astern soon oer the seaworms destined prey the lifted wave shall close so perish from the face of day all freedoms banded foes but ah what splendors fire the sky what glories greet the morn the stormtost banner streams on high its heavenly hues newborn its red fresh dyed in heroes blood its peaceful white more pure to float unstained oer field and flood while earth and seas endure all shapes before the driving blast must glide from mortal view black roll the billows of the past behind the presents blue fast fast are lessening in the light the names of high renown van tromps proud besom fades from sight and nelsons half hull down scarce one tall frigate walks the sea or skirts the safer shores of all that bore to victory our stout old commodores hull bainbridge porter where are they the waves their answer roll still bright in memorys sunset ray god rest each gallant soul a brighter name must dim their light with more than noontide ray the seaking of the river fight the conqueror of the bay now then the broadside cheer on cheer to greet him safe on shore health peace and many a bloodless year to fight his battles oer at a dinner to general grant july when treason first began the strife that crimsoned sea and shore the nation poured her hoarded life on freedoms threshingfloor from field and prairie east and west from coast and hill and plain the sheaves of ripening manhood pressed thick as the bearded grain rich was the harvest souls as true as ever battle tried but fiercer still the conflict grew the floor of death more wide ah who forgets that dreadful day whose blot of grief and shame four bitter years scarce wash away in seas of blood and flame vain vain the nations lofty boasts vain all her sacrifice give me a man to lead my hosts o god in heaven she cries while battle whirls his crushing flail and plies his winnowing fan thick flies the chaff on every gale she cannot find her man bravely they fought who failed to win our leaders battlescarred fighting the hosts of hell and sin but devils die always hard blame not the broken tools of god that helped our sorest needs through paths that martyr feet have trod the conquerors steps he leads but now the heavens grow black with doubt the ravens fill the sky friends plot within foes storm without hark that despairing cry where is the heart the hand the brain to dare to do to plan the bleeding nation shrieks in vain she has not found her man a little echo stirs the air some tale whateer it be of rebels routed in their lair along the tennessee the little echo spreads and grows and soon the trump of fame has taught the nations friends and foes the man on horsebacks name so well his warlike wooing sped no fortress might resist his billetsdoux of lisping lead the bayonets in his fist with kisses from his cannons mouth he made his passion known till vicksburg vestal of the south unbound her virgin zone and still whereer his banners led he conquered as he came the trembling hosts of treason fled before his breath of flame and fames still gathering echoes grew till high oer richmonds towers the starry fold of freedom flew and all the land was ours welcome from fields where valor fought to feasts where pleasure waits a nation gives you smiles unbought at all her opening gates forgive us when we press your hand your warworn features scan god sent you to a bleeding land our nation found its man to h w longfellow before his departure for europe may our poet who has taught the western breeze to waft his songs before him oer the seas will find them wheresoeer his wanderings reach borne on the spreading tide of english speech twin with the rhythmic waves that kiss the farthest beach where shall the singing bird a stranger be that finds a nest for him in every tree how shall he travel who can never go where his own voice the echoes do not know where his own garden flowers no longer learn to grow ah gentlest soul how gracious how benign breathes through our troubled life that voice of thine filled with a sweetness born of happier spheres that wins and warms that kindles softens cheers that calms the wildest woe and stays the bitterest tears forgive the simple words that sound like praise the mist before me dims my gilded phrase our speech at best is half alive and cold and save that tenderer moments make us bold our whitening lips would close their truest truth untold we who behold our autumn sun below the scorpions sign against the archers bow know well what parting means of friend from friend after the snows no freshening dews descend and what the frost has marred the sunshine will not mend so we all count the months the weeks the days that keep thee from us in unwonted ways grudging to alien hearths our widowed time and one has shaped a breath in artless rhyme

stand to reason for one to order salmon brought unless that fish is sometimes caught and also is in season our luck of late is shocking bad in fact the latest catch we had we kept the matter shady but hauling in our nets alack we found no salmon but a sack that held your honored lady allah is great the caliph said my poor zuleika you are dead i once took interest in you perhaps my lord youd like to

rulers stormy breast whom hurrying care pursues and brings a sense of peace and rest like slippers after shoes and what are all the prizes won to youths enchanted view and what is all the man has done

time like the old time there is no time like the old time when you and i were young when the buds of april blossomed and the birds of springtime sung the gardens brightest glories by summer suns are nursed but oh the sweet sweet violets the flowers that opened first there is no place like the old place where you and i were born where we lifted first our eyelids on the splendors of the morn from the milkwhite breast that warmed us from the clinging arms that bore where the dear eyes glistened oer us that will look on us no more there is no friend like the old friend who has shared our morning days no greeting like his welcome no homage like his praise fame is the scentless sunflower with gaudy crown of gold but friendship is the breathing rose with sweets in every fold there is no love like the old love that we courted in our pride though our leaves are falling falling and were fading side by side there are blossoms all around us with the colors of our dawn and we live in borrowed sunshine when the daystar is withdrawn there are no times like the old times they shall never be forgot there is no place like the old place keep green the dear old spot there are no friends like our old friends may heaven prolong their lives there are no loves like our old loves god bless our loving wives a hymn of peace sung at the jubilee june to the music of sellers american hymn angel of

embers when at eighty one remembers all the achings and the quakings of the times that tried mens souls when i talk of whig and tory when i tell the rebel story to you the words are ashes but to me theyre burning coals i had heard the muskets rattle of the april running battle lord percys hunted soldiers i can see their redcoats still but a deadly chill comes oer me as the day looms up before me when a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of bunkers hill t was a peaceful summers morning when the first thing gave us warning was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore child says grandma what s the matter what is all this noise and clatter have those scalping indian devils come to murder us once more poor old soul my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking to hear her talk of indians when the guns began to roar she had seen the burning village and the slaughter and the pillage when the mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door then i said now dear old granny dont you fret and worry any for ill soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play there cant be mischief in it so i wont be gone a minute for a minute then i started i was gone the livelong day no time for bodicelacing or for lookingglass grimacing down my hair went as i hurried tumbling halfway to my heels god forbid your ever knowing when theres blood around her flowing how the lonely helpless daughter of a quiet household feels in the street i heard a thumping and i knew it was the stumping of the corporal our old neighbor on that wooden leg he wore with a knot of women round him it was lucky i had found him so i followed with the others and the corporal marched before they were making for the steeple the old soldier and his people the pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair just across the narrow river oh so close it made me shiver stood a fortress on the hilltop that but yesterday was bare not slow our eyes to find it well we knew who stood behind it though the earthwork hid them from us and the stubborn walls were dumb here were sister wife and mother looking wild upon each other and their lips were white with terror as they said the hour has come the morning slowly wasted not a morsel had we tasted and our heads were almost splitting with the cannons deafening thrill when a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately it was prescott one since told me he commanded on the hill every womans heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure with the banyan buckled round it standing up so straight and tall like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure through the storm of shells and cannonshot he walked around the wall at eleven the streets were swarming for the redcoats ranks were forming at noon in marching order they were moving to the piers how the bayonets gleamed and glistened as we looked far down and listened to the trampling and the drumbeat of the belted grenadiers at length the men have started with a cheer it seemed fainthearted in their scarlet regimentals with their knapsacks on their backs and the reddening rippling water as after a seafights slaughter round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks so they crossed to the other border and again they formed in order and the boats came back for soldiers came for soldiers soldiers still the time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting at last theyre moving marching marching proudly up the hill we can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing now the front rank fires a volley they have thrown away their shot for behind their earthwork lying all the balls above them flying our people need not hurry so they wait and answer not then the corporal our old cripple he would swear sometimes and tipple he had heard the bullets whistle in the old french war before calls out in words of jeering just as if they all were hearing and his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor oh fire away ye villains and earn king georges shillins but ye ll waste a ton of powder afore a rebel falls you may bang the dirt and welcome theyre as safe as danl malcolm ten foot beneath the gravestone that youve splintered with your balls in the hush of expectation in the awe and trepidation of the dread approaching moment we are wellnigh breathless all though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing we are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall just a glimpse the air is clearer they are nearer nearer nearer when a flash a curling smokewreath then a crash the steeple shakes the deadly truce is ended the tempests shroud is rended like a morning mist it gathered like a thundercloud it breaks oh the sight our eyes discover as the blueblack smoke blows over the redcoats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay here a scarlet heap is lying there a headlong crowd is flying like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray then we cried the troops are routed they are beat it cant be doubted god be thanked the fight is over ah the grim old soldiers smile tell us tell us why you look so we could hardly speak we shook so are they beaten are they beaten are they beaten wait a while oh the trembling and the terror for too soon we saw our error they are baffled not defeated we have driven them back in vain and the columns that were scattered round the colors that were tattered toward the sullen silent fortress turn their belted breasts again all at once as we are gazing lo the roofs of charlestown blazing they have fired the harmless village in an hour it will be down the lord in heaven confound them rain his fire and brimstone round them the robbing murdering redcoats that would burn a peaceful town they are marching stern and solemn we can see each massive column as they near the naked earthmound with the slanting walls so steep have our soldiers got fainthearted and in noiseless haste departed are they panicstruck and helpless are they palsied or asleep now the walls theyre almost under scarce a rod the foes asunder not a firelock flashed against them up the earthwork they will swarm but the words have scarce been spoken when the ominous calm is broken and a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm so again with murderous slaughter pelted backwards to the water fly pigots running heroes and the frightened braves of howe and we shout at last theyre done for its their barges they have run for they are beaten beaten beaten and the battle s over now and we looked poor timid creatures on the rough old soldiers features our lips afraid to question but he knew what we would ask not sure he said keep quiet once more i guess they ll try it heres damnation to the cutthroats then he handed me his flask saying gal youre looking shaky have a drop of old jamaiky i m afeard there ll be more trouble afore the job is done so i took one scorching swallow dreadful faint i felt and hollow standing there from early morning when the firing was begun all through those hours of trial i had watched a calm clock dial as the hands kept creeping creeping they were creeping round to four when the old man said theyre forming with their bagonets fixed for storming it s the deathgrip thats a coming they will try the works once more with brazen trumpets blaring the flames behind them glaring the deadly wall before them in close array they come still onward upward toiling like a dragons fold uncoiling like the rattlesnakes shrill warning the reverberating drum over heaps all torn and gory shall i tell the fearful story how they surged above the breastwork as a sea breaks over a deck how driven yet scarce defeated our wornout men retreated with their powderhorns all emptied like the swimmers from a wreck it has all been told and painted as for me they say i fainted and the woodenlegged old corporal stumped with me down the stair when i woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted on the floor a youth was lying his bleeding breast was bare and i heard through all the flurry send for warren hurry hurry tell him heres a soldier bleeding and he ll come and dress his wound ah we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow how the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground who the youth was what his name was where the place from which he came was who had brought him from the battle and had left him at our door he could not speak to tell us but t was one of our brave fellows as the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore for they all thought he was dying as they gathered round him crying and they said oh how theyll miss him and what will his mother do then his eyelids just unclosing like a childs that has been dozing he faintly murmured mother and i saw his eyes were blue why grandma how you re winking ah my child it sets me thinking of a story not like this one well he somehow lived along so we came to know each other and i nursed him like a mother till at last he stood before me tall and rosychecked and strong and we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather please to tell us what his name was just your own my little dear theres his picture copley painted we became so well acquainted that in short thats why i m grandma and you children all are here at the atlantic dinner december i suppose its myself that youre making allusion to and bringing the sense of dismay and confusion to of course some must speak they are always selected to but pray whats the reason that i am expected to im not fond of wasting my breath as those fellows do that want to be blowing forever as bellows do their legs are uneasy but why will you jog any that long to stay quiet beneath the mahogany why why call me up with your battery of flatteries you say he writes poetry that s what the matter is it costs him no trouble a pen full of ink or two and the poem is done in the time of a wink or two as for thoughts never mind take the ones that lie uppermost and the rhymes used by milton and byron and tupper most the lines come so easy at one end he jingles em at the other with capital letters he shingles em why the thing writes itself and before hes half done with it he hates to stop writing he has such good fun with it ah that is the way in which simple ones go about and draw a fine picture of things they dont know about we all know a kitten but come to a catamount the beast is a stranger when grown up to that amount a stranger we rather prefer should nt visit us a felis whose advent is far from felicitous the boy who can boast that his trap has just got a mouse must nt draw it and write underneath hippopotamus or say unveraciously this is an elephant dont think let me beg these examples irrelevant what they mean is just this that a thing to be painted well should always be something with which were acquainted well you call on your victim for things he has plenty of those copies of verses no doubt at least twenty of his desk is crammed full for he always keeps writing em and reading to friends as his way of delighting em i tell you this writing of verses means business it makes the brain whirl in a vortex of dizziness you think they are scrawled in the languor of laziness i tell you theyre squeezed by a spasm of craziness a fit half as bad as the staggering vertigos that seize a poor fellow and down in the dirt he goes and therefore it chimes with the words etytology that the sons of apollo are great on apology for the writing of verse is a struggle mysterious and the gayest of rhymes is a matter thats serious for myself im relied on by friends in extremities and i dont mind so much if a comfort to them it is t is a pleasure to please and the straw that can tickle us is a source of enjoyment though slightly ridiculous i am up for a something and since i ve begun with it i must give you a toast now before i have done with it let me pump at my wits as they pumped the cochituate that moistened it may be the very last bit you ate success to our publishers authors and

has lost still father in thy love we trust forgive us if we mourn the saddening hour that laid in dust his robe of flesh outworn ii how long the wreckstrewn journey seems to reach the faroff past that woke his youth from peaceful dreams with freedoms trumpetblast along her classic hillsides rung the paynims battlecry and like a redcross knight he sprung for her to live or die no trustier service claimed the wreath for spartas bravest son no truer soldier sleeps beneath the mound of marathon yet not for him the warriors grave in front of angry foes to lift to shield to help to save the holier task he chose he touched the eyelids of the blind and lo the veil withdrawn as oer the midnight of the mind he led the light of dawn he asked not whence the fountains roll no travellers foot has found but mapped the desert of the soul untracked by sight or sound what prayers have reached the sapphire throne by silent fingers spelt for him who first through depths unknown his doubtful pathway felt who sought the slumbering sense that lay close shut with bolt and bar and showed awakening thought the ray of reasons morning star whereer he moved his shadowy form the sightless orbs would seek and

easy as lying if youll listen to me while the art i unfold heres a book full of words one can choose as he fancies as a painter his tint as a workman his tool just think all the poems and plays and romances were drawn out of this like the fish from a pool you can wander at will through its syllabled mazes and take all you want not a copper they cost what is there to hinder your picking out phrases for an epic as clever as paradise lost dont mind if the index of sense is at zero use words that run smoothly whatever they mean leander and lilian and lillibullero are much the same thing in

colors to lay on it cant have fatigued him no not in the least a dash here and there with a haphazard crayon and there stands the wrinkledskinned baggylimbed beast just so with your verse t is as easy

the lyre it comes if at all like the sibyls convulsion and touches the brain with a finger of fire so perhaps after all its as well to be quiet if youve nothing you think is worth saying in prose as

crooks his knees at first with cautious step sedate as if he dragged a coach of state hes not a colt he knows full well that time is weight and sure to tell no horse so sturdy but he fears the handicap of twenty years as through the throng on either hand the old horse nears the judges stand beneath his jockeys featherweight he warms a little to his gait and now and then a step is tried that hints of something like a stride go through his ear the summons stung as if a battletrump had rung the slumbering instincts long unstirred start at the old familiar word it thrills like flame through every limb what mean his twenty years to him the savage blow his rider dealt fell on his hollow flanks unfelt the spur that pricked his staring hide unheeded tore his bleeding side alike to him are spur and rein he steps a fiveyearold again before the quarter pole was past old hiram said hes going fast long ere the quarter was a half the chuckling crowd had ceased to laugh tighter his frightened jockey clung as in a mighty stride he swung the gravel flying in his track his neck stretched out his ears laid back his tail extended all the while behind him like a rattail file off went a shoe away it spun shot like a bullet from a gun the quaking jockey shapes a prayer from scraps of oaths he used to swear he drops his whip he drops his rein he clutches fiercely for a mane hell lose his hold he

fresh and jaunty her wardrobe as i blush to tell already seemed but quite too scanty her gems were sold her sandals gone she always would be rash and flighty her winter garments all in pawn alas for

aphrodites dove the pattern of the fan was given no wonder that it breathes of love and wafts the perfumed gales of heaven before this new pandoras gift in slavery womans tyrant kept her but now he kneels her glove to lift the fan is mightier than the sceptre the tap it gives how arch and sly the breath it wakes how fresh and grateful behind its shield how soft the sigh the whispered tale of

as the red men do borrow some title this is not the place that christens men your highness and your grace we tried such names as these awhile you know but left them off a century ago his majesty weve had enough of that besides that needs a crown he wears a hat what if to make the nicer ears content we say his honesty the president sir we believed you honest truthful brave when to your hands their precious trust we gave and we have found you better than we knew braver and not less honest not less true so every heart has opened every hand tingles with welcome and through all the land all voices greet you in one broad acclaim healer of strife has earth a nobler name what phrases mean you do not need to learn we must be civil and they serve our turn your most obedient humble means means what something the wellbred signer just is not yet there are tokens sir you must believe there is one language never can deceive the lover knew it when the maiden smiled the mother knows it when she clasps

eyes your welcome waits you there north south east west from all and everywhere the ship of state a sentiment this sentiment was read on the same occasion as the family record which immediately follows it the latter poem is the dutiful tribute of a son to his father and his fathers ancestors residents of woodstock from its first settlement the ship of state above her skies are blue but still she rocks a little it is true and there are passengers whose faces white show they dont feel as happy as they might yet on the whole her crew are quite content since its wild fury the typhoon has spent and willing if her pilot thinks it best to head a little nearer south by west and this they feel the ship came too near wreck in the long quarrel for the quarterdeck now when she glides serenely on her way the shallows past where dread explosives lay the stiff obstructives churlish game to try let sleeping dogs and still torpedoes lie and so i give you all the ship of state freedoms last venture is her priceless freight god speed her keep her bless her while she steers amid the breakers of unsounded years lead her through dangers paths with even keel and guide the honest hand that holds her wheel woodstock conn july a family record woodstock conn july not to myself this breath of vesper song not to these patient friends this kindly throng not to this hallowed morning though it be our summer christmas freedoms jubilee when every summit topmast steeple tower that owns her empire spreads her starry flower its bloodstreaked leaves in heavens benignant dew washed clean from every crimson stain they knew no not to these the passing thrills belong that steal my breath to hush themselves with song these moments all are memorys i have come to speak with lips that rather should be dumb for what are words at every step i tread the dust that wore the footprints of the dead but for whose life my life had never known this faded vesture which it calls its own here sleeps my fathers sire and they who gave that earlier life here found their peaceful grave in days gone by i sought the hallowed ground climbed yon long slope the sacred spot i found where all unsullied lies the winter snow where all ungathered springs pale violets blow and tracked from stone to stone the saxon name that marks the blood i need not blush to claim blood such as warmed the pilgrim sons of toil who held from god the charter of the soil i come an alien to your hills and plains yet feel your birthright tingling in my veins mine are this changing prospects sun and shade in fullblown summers bridal pomp arrayed mine these fair hillsides and the vales between mine the sweet streams that lend their brightening green i breathed your air the sunlit landscape smiled i touch your soil it knows its childrens child throned in my heart your heritage is mine i claim it all by memorys right divine waking i dream before my vacant eyes in long procession shadowy forms arise far through the vista of the silent years i see a venturous band the pioneers who let the sunlight through the forests gloom who bade the harvest wave the garden bloom hark loud resounds the barearmed settlers axe see where the stealthy panther left his tracks as fierce as stealthy creeps the skulking foe with stonetipped shaft and sinewcorded bow soon shall he vanish from his ancient reign leave his last cornfield to the coming train quit the green margin of the wave he drinks for haunts that hide the wildcat and the lynx but who the youth his glistening axe that swings to smite the pine that shows a hundred rings his features something in his look i find that calls the semblance of my race to mind his name my own and that which goes before the same that once the loved disciple bore young brave discreet the father of a line whose voiceless lives have found a voice in mine thinned by unnumbered currents though they be thanks for the ruddy drops i claim from thee the seasons pass the roses come and go snows fall and melt the waters freeze and flow the boys are men the girls grown tall and fair have found their mates a gravestone here and there tells where the fathers lie the silvered hair of some bent patriarch yet recalls the time that saw his feet the northern hillside climb a pilgrim from the pilgrims far away the godly men the dwellers by the bay on many a hearthstone burns the cheerful fire the schoolhouse porch the heavenward pointing spire proclaim in letters every eye can read knowledge and faith the new worlds simple creed hush t is the sabbaths silencestricken morn no feet must wander through the tasselled corn no merry children laugh around the door no idle playthings strew the sanded floor the law of moses lays its awful ban on all that stirs here comes the tithingman at last the solemn hour of worship calls slowly they gather in the sacred walls man in his strength and age with knotted staff and boyhood aching for its weekday laugh the toilworn mother with the child she leads the maiden lovely in her golden beads the popish symbols round her neck she wears but on them counts her lovers not her prayers those youths in homespun suits and ribboned queues whose hearts are beating in the highbacked pews the pastor rises looks along the seats with searching eye each wonted face he meets asks heavenly guidance finds the chapters place that tells some tale of israels stubborn race gives out the sacred song all voices join for no quartette extorts their scanty coin then while both hands their blackgloved palms display lifts his gray head and murmurs let us pray and pray he does as one that never fears to plead unanswered by the god that hears what if he dwells on many a fact as though some things heaven knew not which it ought to know thanks god for all his favors past and yet tells him theres something he must not forget such are the prayers his people love to hear see how the deacon slants his listening ear what look once more nay surely there i trace the hinted outlines of a wellknown face not those the lips for laughter to beguile yet round their corners lurks an embryo smile the same on other lips my childhood knew that scarce the sabbaths mastery could subdue him too my lineage gives me leave to claim the good grave man that bears the psalmists name and still in ceaseless round the seasons passed spring piped her carol autumn blew his blast babes waxed to manhood manhood shrunk to age lifes wornout players tottered off the stage the few are many boys have grown to men since putnam dragged the wolf from pomfrets den our newold woodstock is a thriving town brave are her children faithful to the crown her soldiers steel the savage redskin knows their blood has crimsoned his canadian snows and now once more along the quiet vale rings the dread call that turns the mothers pale full well they know the valorous heat that runs in every pulsebeat of their loyal sons who would not bleed in good king georges cause when englands lion shows his teeth and claws with glittering firelocks on the village green in proud array a martial band is seen you know what names those ancient rosters hold whose belts were buckled when the drumbeat rolled but mark their captain tell us who is he on his brown face that same old look i see yes from the homesteads still retreat he came whose peaceful owner bore the psalmists name the same his own well israels glorious king who struck the harp could also whirl the sling breathe in his song a penitential sigh and smite the sons of amalek hip and thigh these shared their task one deaconed out the psalm one slashed the scalping hellhounds of calm the praying fathers pious work is done now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son on many a field he fought in wilds afar see on his swarthy cheek the bullets scar there hangs a murderous tomahawk beneath without its blade a knifes embroidered sheath save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt his scalp had dangled at their owners belt but not for him such fate he lived to see the bloodier strife that made our nation free to serve with willing toil with skilful hand the warworn saviors of the bleeding land his wasting life to others needs he gave sought rest in home and found it in the grave see where the stones lifes brief memorials keep the tablet telling where he fell on sleep watched by a winged cherubs rayless eye a scroll above that says we all must die those saddening lines beneath the nightthoughts lent so stands the soldiers surgeons monument ah at a glance my filial eye divines the scholar son in those remembered lines the scholar son his hand my footsteps led no more the dim unreal past i tread o thou whose breathing form was once so dear whose cheering voice was music to my ear art thou not with me as my feet pursue the village paths so well thy boyhood knew along the tangled margin of the stream whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream or climb the hill or thread the wooded vale or seek the wave where gleams yon distant sail or the old homesteads narrowed bounds explore where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more where one last relic still remains to tell here stood thy home the memoryhaunted well whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine changed at my lips to sacramental wine art thou not with me as i fondly trace the scanty records of thine honored race call up the forms that earlier years have known and spell the legend of each slanted stone with thoughts of thee my loving verse began not for the critics curious eye to scan not for the many listeners but the few whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns still to my lips thy cherished name returns could i but feel thy gracious presence near amid the groves that once to thee were dear could but my trembling lips with mortal speech thy listening ear for one brief moment reach how vain the dream the pallid voyagers track no sign betrays he sends no message back no word from thee since evenings shadow fell on thy cold forehead with my long farewell now from the margin of the silent sea take my last offering ere i cross to thee the iron gate and other poems the iron gate read at the breakfast given in honor of dr holmess seventieth birthday by the publishers of the atlantic monthly boston december where is this patriarch you are kindly greeting not unfamiliar to my ear his name nor yet unknown to many a joyous meeting in days long vanished is he still the same or changed by years forgotten and forgetting dulleared dimsighted slow of speech and thought still oer the sad degenerate present fretting where all goes wrong and nothing as it ought old age the graybeard well indeed i know him shrunk tottering bent of aches and ills the prey in sermon story fable picture poem oft have i met him from my earliest day in my old aesop toiling with his bundle his load of sticks politely asking death who comes when called for would he lug or trundle his fagot for him he was scant of breath and sad ecclesiastes or the preacher has he not stamped the image on my soul in that last chapter where the wornout teacher sighs oer the loosened cord the broken bowl yes long indeed ive known him at a distance and now my lifted doorlatch shows him here i take his shrivelled hand without resistance and find him smiling as his step draws near what though of gilded baubles he bereaves us dear to the heart of youth to manhoods prime think of the calm he brings the wealth he leaves us the hoarded spoils the legacies of time altars once flaming still with incense fragrant passions uneasy nurslings rocked asleep hopes anchor faster wild desire less vagrant lifes flow less noisy but the stream how deep still as the silver cord gets worn and slender its lightened taskwork tugs with lessening strain hands get more helpful voices grown more tender soothe with their softened tones the slumberous brain youth longs and manhood strives but age remembers sits by the rakedup ashes of the past spreads its thin hands above the whitening embers that warm its creeping lifeblood till the last dear to its heart is every loving token that comes unbidden ere its pulse grows cold ere the last lingering ties of life are broken its labors ended and its story told ah while around us rosy youth rejoices for us the sorrowladen breezes sigh and through the chorus of its jocund voices throbs the sharp note of miserys hopeless cry as on the gauzy wings of fancy flying from some far orb i track our watery sphere home of the struggling suffering doubting dying the silvered globule seems a glistening tear but nature lends her mirror of illusion to win from saddening scenes our agedimmed eyes and misty daydreams blend in sweet confusion the wintry landscape and the summer skies so when the iron portal shuts behind us and life forgets us in its noise and whirl visions that shunned the glaring noonday find us and glimmering starlight shows the gates of pearl i come not here your morning hour to sadden a limping pilgrim leaning on his staff i who have never deemed it sin to gladden this vale of sorrows with a wholesome laugh if word of mine anothers gloom has brightened through my dumb lips the heavensent message came if hand of mine anothers task has lightened it felt the guidance that it dares not claim but o my gentle sisters o my brothers these thicksown snowflakes hint of toils release these feebler pulses bid me leave to others the tasks once welcome evening asks for peace time claims his tribute silence now is golden let me not vex the too long suffering lyre though to your love untiring still beholden the curfew tells me cover up the fire and now with grateful smile and accents cheerful and warmer heart than look or word can tell in simplest phrase these traitorous eyes are tearful thanks brothers sisters children and farewell vestigia quinque retrorsum an academic poem read at the commencement dinner of the alumni of harvard university june while fond sad memories all around us throng silence were sweeter than the sweetest song yet when the leaves are green and heaven is blue the choral tribute of the grove is due and when the lengthening nights have chilled the skies we fain would hear the songbird ere be flies and greet with kindly welcome even as now the lonely minstrel on his leafless bough this is our golden year its golden day its bridal memories soon must pass away soon shall its dying music cease to ring and every year must loose some silver string till the last trembling chords no longer thrill hands all at rest and hearts forever still a few gray heads have joined the forming line we hear our summons class of twentynine close on the foremost and alas how few are these the boys our dear old mother knew sixty brave swimmers twenty something more have passed the stream and reached this frosty shore how near the banks these fifty years divide when memory crosses with a single stride t is the first year of stern old hickory s rule when our good mother lets us out of school half glad half sorrowing it must be confessed to leave her quiet lap her bounteous breast armed with our dainty ribbontied degrees pleased and yet pensive exiles and a bs look back o comrades with your faded eyes and see the phantoms as i bid them rise

grinding logic gave our wits their edge ticknor with honeyed voice and courtly grace and willard larynxed like a double bass and channing with his bland superior look cool as a moonbeam on a frozen brook while the pale student shivering in his shoes sees from his theme the turgid rhetoric ooze and the born soldier fate decreed to wreak his martial manhood on a class in greek popkin how that explosive name recalls the grand old busby of our ancient halls such faces looked from skippons grim platoons such figures rode with iretons stout dragoons he gave his strength to learnings gentle charms but every accent sounded shoulder arms names empty names save only here and there some whitehaired listener dozing in his chair starts at the sound he often used to hear and upward slants his sundaysermon ear and we our blooming manhood we regain smiling we join the long commencement train one point first battled in discussion hot shall we wear gowns and settled we will not how strange the scene that noisy boydebate where embryospeakers learn to rule the state this broadbrowed youth sedate and sobereyed shall wear the ermined robe at taneys side and he the stripling smooth of face and slight whose slender form scarce intercepts the light shall rule the bench where parsons gave the law and sphinxlike sat uncouth majestic shaw ah many a star has shed its fatal ray on names we loved our brothers where are they nor these alone our hearts in silence claim names not less dear unsyllabled by fame how brief the space and yet it sweeps us back far far along our newborn historys track five strides like this the sachem rules the land the indian wigwams cluster where we stand the second lo a scene of deadly strife a nation struggling into infant life not yet the fatal game at yorktown won where failing empire fired its sunset gun langdon sits restless in the ancient chair harvards grave head these echoes heard his prayer when from yon mansion dear to memory still the

reign god has no temple here lift up your eyes behold these pictured walls look where the flood of western glory falls through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes in ruby saffron azure emerald

waiting to be freed on lifes last leaf with tranquil eye shall read by the pale glimmer of the torch reversed not finis but the end of volume first my aviary through my north window in the wintry weather my airy oriel on the river shore i watch the seafowl as they flock together where late the boatman flashed his dripping oar the gull high floating like a sloop unladen lets the loose water waft him as it will the duck roundbreasted as a rustic maiden paddles and plunges busy busy still i see the solemn gulls in council sitting on some broad icefloe pondering long and late while overhead the homebound ducks are flitting and leave the tardy conclave in debate those weighty questions in their breasts revolving whose deeper meaning science never learns till at some reverend elders look dissolving the speechless senate silently adjourns but when along the waves the shrill northeaster shrieks through the laboring coasters shrouds beware the pale bird kindling like a christmas feaster when some wild chorus shakes the vinous air flaps from the leaden wave in fierce rejoicing feels heavens dumb lightning thrill his torpid nerves now on the blast his whistling plumage poising now wheeling whirling in fantastic curves such is our gull a gentleman of leisure less fleshed than feathered bagged youll find him such his virtue silence his employment pleasure not bad to look at and not good for much what of our duck he has some highbred cousins his grace the canvasback my lord the brant anas and anser both served up by dozens at bostons rocher halfway to nahant as for himself he seems alert and thriving grubs up a living somehow what who knows crabs mussels weeds look quick there s one just diving flop splash his white breast glistens down he goes and while he s under just about a minute i take advantage of the fact to say his fishy carcase has no virtue in it the gunning idiots worthless hire to pay shrewd is our bird not easy to outwit him sharp is the outlook of those pinhead eyes still he is mortal and a shot may hit him one cannot always miss him if he tries he knows you sportsmen from suburban alleys stretched under seaweed in the treacherous punt knows every lazy shiftless lout that sallies forth to waste powder as he says to hunt i watch you with a patient satisfaction well pleased to discount your predestined luck the float that figures in your sly transaction will carry back a goose but not a duck look theres a young one dreaming not of danger sees a flat log come floating down the stream stares undismayed upon the harmless stranger ah were all strangers harmless as they seem habet a leaden shower his breast has shattered vainly he flutters not again to rise his soft white plumes along the waves are scattered helpless the wing that braved the tempest lies he sees his comrades high above him flying to seek their nests among the island reeds strong is their flight all lonely he is lying washed by the crimsoned water as he bleeds o thou who carest for the falling sparrow canst thou the sinless sufferers pang forget or is thy dread accountbooks page so narrow its one long column scores thy creatures debt poor gentle guest by nature kindly cherished a world grows dark with thee in blinding death one little gasp thy universe has perished wrecked by the idle thief who stole thy breath is this the whole sad story of creation lived by its breathing myriads oer and oer one glimpse of day then black annihilation a sunlit passage to a sunless shore give back our faith ye mysterysolving lynxes robe us once more in heavenaspiring creeds happier was dreaming egypt with her sphinxes the stony convent with its cross and beads how often gazing where a bird reposes rocked on the wavelets drifting with the tide i lose myself in strange metempsychosis and float a seafowl at a seafowls side from rain hail snow in feathery mantle muffled cleareyed stronglimbed with keenest sense to hear my mate soft murmuring who with plumes unruffled whereer i wander still is nestling near the great blue hollow like a garment oer me space all unmeasured unrecorded time while seen with inward eye moves on before me thoughts pictured train in wordless pantomime a voice recalls me from my window turning i find myself a plumeless biped still no beak no claws no sign of wings discerning in fact with nothing birdlike but my quill on the threshold introduction to a collection of poems bydifferent authors an usher standing at the door i show my white rosette a smile of welcome nothing more will pay my trifling debt why should i bid you idly wait like lovers at the swinging gate can i forget the wedding guest the veteran of the sea in vain the listener smites his breast there was a ship cries he poor fasting victim stunned and pale he needs must listen to the tale he sees the gilded throng within the sparkling goblets gleam the music and the merry din through every window stream but there he shivers in the cold till all the crazy dream is told not mine the graybeards glittering eye that held his captive still to hold my silent prisoners by and let me have my will nay i were like the threeyears child to think you could be so beguiled my verse is but the curtains fold that hides the painted scene the mist by mornings ray unrolled that veils the meadows green the cloud that needs must drift away to show the rose of opening day see from the tinkling rill you hear in hollowed palm i bring these scanty drops but ah how near the founts that heavenward spring thus open wide the gates are thrown and founts and flowers are all your own to george peabody danvers bankrupt our pockets inside out empty of words to speak his praises worcester and webster up the spout dead broke of laudatory phrases yet why with flowery speeches tease with vain superlatives distress him has language better words than these the friend of all his race god bless him a simple prayer but words more sweet by human lips were never uttered since adam left the country seat where angel wings around him fluttered the old look on with teardimmed eyes the children cluster to caress him and every voice unbidden cries the friend of all his race god bless him at the papyrus club a lovely show for eyes to see i looked upon this morning a brighthued feathered company of natures own adorning but ah those minstrels would not sing a listening ear while i lent the lark sat still and preened his wing the nightingale was silent i longed for what they gave me not their warblings sweet and fluty but grateful still for all i got i

perfume of youth in each exquisite strain the home of my childhood comes back as a vision hark hark a soft chord from its songhaunted room t is a morning of may when the air is elysian the syringa in

false to his vow let erin remember the echoes are calling through the vale of avoca the waters are rolled the exile laments while the nightdews falling the morning of life dawns again as of old but ah those warm lovesongs of fresh adolescence around us such raptures celestial they flung that it seemed as if paradise breathed its quintessence through the seraphtoned lips of the maiden that sung long hushed are the chords that my boyhood enchanted as when the smooth wave by the angel was stirred yet still with their music is memory haunted and oft in my dreams are their melodies heard i feel like

we view them together the song of the minstrels whose record we scan one fresh as the breeze blowing over the heather one sweet as the breath from an odalisques fan ah passion can glow mid a palaces splendor the cage does not alter the song of the bird and the curtain of silk has known whispers as tender as ever the blossoming hawthorn has heard no fear lest the step of the softslippered graces

children of the forest strayed greets the bright morning in its bridal dress and spreads its arms the gladsome dawn to bless is it an idle dream that nature shares our joys our griefs our pastimes and our cares is there no summons when at mornings call the sable vestments of the darkness fall does not meek evenings lowvoiced ave blend with the soft vesper as its notes ascend is there no whisper in the perfumed air when the sweet bosom of the rose is bare does not the sunshine call us to rejoice is there no meaning in the stormclouds voice no silent message when from midnight skies heaven looks upon us with its myriad eyes or shift the mirror say our dreams diffuse oer lifes pale landscape their celestial hues lend heaven the rainbow it has never known and robe the earth in glories not its

they knew what need of idle fancy to adorn our mothers birthplace on her birthday morn hers are the blossoms of eternal spring from these green boughs her newfledged birds take wing these echoes hear their earliest carols sung in this old nest the brood is ever young if some tired wanderer resting from his flight amid the gay young choristers alight these gather round him mark his faded plumes that faintly still the faroff grove perfumes and listen wondering if some feeble note yet lingers quavering in his weary throat i whose fresh voice yon redfaced temple knew what tune is left me fit to sing to you ask not the grandeurs of a labored song but let my easy couplets slide along much could i tell you that you know too well much i remember but i will not tell age brings experience graybeards oft are wise but oh how sharp a youngsters ears and eyes my cheek was bare of adolescent down when first i sought the academic town slow rolls the coach along the dusty road big with its filial and parental load the frequent hills the lonely woods are past the schoolboys chosen home is reached at last i see it now the same unchanging spot the swinging gate the little garden plot the narrow yard the rock that made its floor the flat pale house the knockergarnished door the small trim parlor neat decorous chill the strange new faces kind but grave and still two creased with age or what i then called age lifes volume open at its fiftieth page one a shy maidens pallid placid sweet as the first snowdrop which the sunbeams greet one the last nurslings slight she was and fair her smooth white forehead warmed with auburn hair last came the virgin hymen long had spared whose daily cares the grateful household shared strong patient humble her substantial frame stretched the chaste draperies i forbear to name brave but with effort had the schoolboy come to the cold comfort of a strangers home how like a dagger to my sinking heart came the dry summons it is time to part goodby goooodby one fond maternal kiss homesick as death was ever pang like this too young as yet with willing feet to stray from the tame fireside glad to get away too old to let my watery grief appear and what so bitter as a swallowed tear one figure still my vagrant thoughts pursue first boy to greet me ariel where are you imp of all mischief heaven alone knows how you learned it all are you an angel now or tottering gently down the slope of years your face grown sober in the vale of tears forgive my freedom if you are breathing still if in a happier world i know you will you were a schoolboy what beneath the sun so like a monkey i was also one strange sure enough to see what curious shoots the nursery raises from the studys roots in those old days the very very good took up more room a little than they should something too much ones eyes encountered then of serious youth and funeralvisaged men the solemn elders saw lifes mournful half heaven sent this boy whose mission was to laugh drollest of buffos natures odd protest a catbird squealing in a blackbirds nest kind faithful nature while the soureyed scot her cheerful smiles forbidden or forgot talks only of his preacher and his kirk hears fivehour sermons for his sunday work praying and fasting till his meagre face gains its due length the genuine sign of grace an ayrshire mother in the land of knox her embryo poet in his cradle rocks nature long shivering in her dim eclipse steals in a sunbeam to those baby lips so to its home her banished smile returns and scotland sweetens with the song of burns the morning came i reached the classic hall a clockface eyed me staring from the wall beneath its hands a printed line i read youth is lifes seedtime so the clockface said some took its counsel as the sequel showed sowed their wild oats and reaped as they had sowed how all comes back the upward slanting floor the masters thrones that flank the central door the long outstretching alleys that divide the rows of desks that stand on either side the staring boys a face to every desk bright dull pale blooming common picturesque grave is the masters look his forehead wears thick rows of wrinkles prints of worrying cares uneasy lie the heads of all that rule his most of all whose kingdom is a school supreme he sits before the awful frown that bends his brows the boldest eye goes down not more submissive israel heard and saw at sinais foot the giver of the law less stern he seems who sits in equal mate on the twin throne and shares the empires weight around his lips the subtle life that plays steals quaintly forth in many a jesting phrase a lightsome nature not so hard to chafe pleasant when pleased roughhandled not so safe some tingling memories vaguely i recall but to forgive him god forgive us all one yet remains whose wellremembered name pleads in my grateful heart its tender claim his was the charm magnetic the bright look that sheds its sunshine on the dreariest book a loving soul to every task he brought that sweetly mingled with the lore he taught sprung from a saintly race that never could from youth to age be anything but good his few brief years in holiest labors spent earth lost too soon the treasure heaven had lent kindest of teachers studious to divine some hint of promise in my earliest line these faint and faltering words thou canst not hear throb from a heart that holds thy memory dear as to the travellers eye the varied plain shows through the window of the flying train a mingled landscape rather felt than seen a gravelly bank a sudden flash of green a tangled wood a glittering stream that flows through the cleft summit where the cliff once rose all strangely blended in a hurried gleam rock wood waste meadow village hillside stream so as we look behind us life appears seen through the vista of our bygone years yet in the dead pasts shadowfilled domain some vanished shapes the hues of life retain unbidden oft before our dreaming eyes from the vague mists in memorys path they rise so comes his blooming image to my view the friend of joyous days when life was new hope yet untamed the blood of youth unchilled no blank arrear of promise unfulfilled lifes flower yet hidden in its sheltering fold its pictured canvas yet to be unrolled his the frank smile i vainly look to greet his the warm grasp my clasping hand should meet how would our lips renew their schoolboy talk our feet retrace the old familiar walk for thee no more earths cheerful morning shines through the green fringes of the tented pines ah me is heaven so far thou canst not hear or is thy viewless spirit hovering near a fair young presence bright with mornings glow the freshcheeked boy of fifty years ago yes fifty years with all their circling suns behind them all my glance reverted runs where now that time remote its griefs its joys where are its grayhaired men its brighthaired boys where is the patriarch time could hardly tire the good old wrinkled immemorial squire an honest treasurer like a blackplumed swan not every day our eyes may look upon where the tough champion who with calvins sword in wordy conflicts battled for the lord where the grave scholar lonely calm austere whose voice like music charmed the listening ear whose light rekindled like the morning star still shines upon us through the gates ajar where the still solemn weary sadeyed man whose careworn face nfy wandering eyes would scan his features wasted in the lingering strife with the pale foe that drains the students life where my old friend the scholar teacher saint whose creed some hinted showed a speck of taint he broached his own opinion which is not lightly to be forgiven or forgot some riddles point i scarce remember now homoi perhaps where they said homoou if the unlettered greatly wish to know where lies the difference betwixt oi and o those of the curious who have time may search among the stale conundrums of their church beneath his roof his peaceful life i shared and for his modes of faith i little cared i taught to judge mens dogmas by their deeds long ere the days of indiarubber creeds why should we look one common faith to find where one in every score is colorblind if here on earth they know not red from green will they see better into things unseen once more to times old graveyard i return and scrape the moss from memorys pictured urn who in these days when all things go by steam recalls the stagecoach with its fourhorse team its sturdy driver who remembers him or the old landlord saturnine and grim who left our hilltop for a new abode and reared his signpost farther down the road still in the waters of the dark shawshine do the young bathers splash and think theyre clean do pilgrims find their way to indian ridge or journey onward to the faroff bridge and bring to younger ears the story back of the broad stream the mighty merrimac are there still truant feet that stray beyond these circling bounds to pomps or haggetts pond or where the legendary name recalls the forests earlier tenant deerjump falls yes every nook these youthful feet explore just as our sires and grand sires did of yore so all lifes opening paths where nature led their fathers feet the childrens children tread roll the round centurys fivescore years away call from our storied past that earliest day when great eliphalet i can see him now big name big frame big voice and beetling brow then young eliphalet ruled the rows of boys in homespun gray or oldworld corduroys and save for fashions whims the benches show the selfsame youths the very boys we know time works strange marvels since i trod the green and swung the gates what wonders i have seen but come what will the sky itself may fall as things of course the boy accepts them all the prophets chariot drawn by steeds of flame for daily use our travelling millions claim the face we love a sunbeam makes our own no more the surgeon hears the sufferers groan what unwrit histories wrapped in darkness lay till shovelling schliemann bared them to the day your richelieu says and says it well my lord the pen is sometimes mightier than the sword great is the goosequill say we all amen sometimes the spade is mightier than the pen it shows where babels terraced walls were raised the slabs that cracked when nimrods palace blazed unearths mycenee rediscovers troy calmly he listens that immortal boy a new prometheus tips our wands with fire a mightier orpheus strains the whispering wire whose lightning thrills the lazy winds outrun and hold the hours as joshua stayed the sun so swift in truth we hardly find a place for those dim fictions known as time and space still a new miracle each year supplies see at his work the chemist of the skies who questions sirius in his tortured rays and steals the secret of the solar blaze hush while the windowrattling bugles play the nations airs a hundred miles away that wicked phonograph hark how it swears turn it again and make it say its prayers and was it true then what the story said of oxfords friar and his brazen head while wondering science stands herself perplexed at each days miracle and asks what next the immortal boy the coming heir of all springs from his desk to urge the flying ball cleaves with his bending oar the glassy waves with sinewy arm the dashing current braves the same bright creature in these haunts of ours that eton shadowed with her antique towers boy where is he the longlimbed youth inquires whom his rough chin with manly pride inspires ah when the ruddy cheek no longer glows when the bright hair is white as winter snows when the dim eye has lost its lambent flame sweet to his ear will be his schoolboy name nor think the difference mighty as it seems between lifes morning and its evening dreams fourscore like twenty has its tasks and toys in earths wide schoolhouse all are girls and boys brothers forgive my wayward fancy who can guess beforehand what his pen will do too light my strain for listeners such as these whom graver thoughts and soberer speech shall please is he not here whose breath of holy song has raised the downcast eyes of faith so long are they not here the strangers in your gates for whom the wearied ear impatient waits the largebrained scholars whom their toils release the bannered heralds of the prince of peace such was the gentle friend whose youth unblamed in years long past our studentbenches claimed whose name illumined on the sacred page lives in the labors of his riper age such he whose record times destroying march leaves uneffaced on zions springing arch not to the scanty phrase of measured song cramped in its fetters names like these belong one ray they lend to gild my slender line their praise i leave to sweeter lips than mine homes of our sires where learnings temple rose while vet they struggled with their banded foes as in the west thy centurys sun descends one parting gleam its dying radiance lends darker and deeper though the shadows fall from the gray towers on doubting castles wall though pope and pagan rearray their hosts and her new armor youthful science boasts truth for whose altar rose this holy shrine shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine no past shall chain her with its rusted vow no jews phylactery bind her christian brow but faith shall smile to find her sister free and nobler manhood draw its life from thee long as the arching skies above thee spread as on thy groves the dews of heaven are shed with currents widening still from year to year and deepening channels calm untroubled clear flow the twin streamlets from thy sacred hill pierias fount and siloams shaded rill the silent melody bring me my broken harp he said we both are wrecks but as ye will though all its ringing tones have fled their echoes linger round it still it had some golden strings i know but that was long how long ago i cannot see its tarnished gold i cannot hear its vanished tone scarce can my trembling fingers hold the pillared frame so long their own we both are wrecks a while ago it had some silver strings i know but on them time too long has played the solemn strain that knows no change and where of old my fingers strayed the chords they find are new and strange yes iron strings i know i know we both are wrecks of long ago we both are wrecks a shattered pair strange to ourselves in times disguise what say ye to the lovesick air that brought the tears from marians eyes ay trust me under breasts of snow hearts could be melted long ago or will ye hear the stormsongs crash that from his dreams the soldier woke and bade him face the lightning flash when battles cloud in thunder broke wrecks nought but wrecks the time was when we two were worth a thousand men and so the broken harp they bring with pitying smiles that none could blame alas theres not a single string of all that filled the tarnished frame but see like children overjoyed his fingers rambling through the void i clasp thee ay mine ancient lyre nay guide my wandering fingers there they love to dally with the wire as isaac played with esaus hair hush ye shall hear the famous tune that marian called the breath of june and so they softly gather round rapt in his tuneful trance he seems his fingers move but not a sound a silence like the song of dreams there ye have heard the air he cries that brought the tears from marians eyes ah smile not at his fond conceit nor deem his fancy wrought in vain to him the unreal sounds are sweet no discord mars the silent strain scored on lifes latest starlit page the voiceless melody of age sweet are the lips of all that sing when natures music breathes unsought but never yet could voice or string so truly shape our tenderest thought as when by lifes decaying fire our fingers sweep the stringless lyre our home our country for the semicentennial celebration of the settlement of cambridge mass december your home was mine kind natures gift my love no years can chill in vain their flakes the stormwinds sift the snowdrop hides beneath the drift a living blossom still mute are a hundred longfamed lyres hushed all their golden strings one lay the coldest bosom fires one song one only never tires while sweetvoiced memory sings no spot so lone but echo knows that dear familiar strain in tropic isles on arctic snows through burning lips its music flows and rings its fond refrain from pisas tower my straining sight roamed wandering leagues away when lo a frigates banner bright the starry blue the red the white in far livornos bay hot leaps the lifeblood from my heart forth springs the sudden tear the ship that rocks by yonder mart is of my land my life a part home home sweet home is here fades from my view the sunlit scene my vision spans the waves i see the elmencircled green the tower the steeple and between the field of ancient graves there runs the path my feet would tread when first they learned to stray there stands the gambrel roof that spread its quaint old angles oer my head when first i saw the day the sounds that met my boyish ear my inward sense salute the woodnotes wild i loved to hear the robins challenge sharp and clear the breath of evenings flute the faces loved from cradle days unseen alas how long as fond remembrance round them plays touched with its softening moonlight rays through fancys portal throng and see as if the opening skies some angel form had spared us wingless mortals to surprise the little maid with lightblue eyes white necked and golden haired so rose the picture full in view i paint in feebler song such power the seamless banner knew of red and white and starry blue for exiles banished long oh boys dear boys who wait as men to guard its heavenbright folds blest are the eyes that see again that banner seamless now as then the fairest earth beholds sweet was the tuscan air and soft in that unfading hour and fancy leads my footsteps oft up the round galleries high aloft on pisas threatening tower and still in memorys holiest shrine i read with pride and joy for me those stars of empire shine that empires dearest home is mine i am a cambridge boy poem at the centennial anniversary dinner of the massachusetts medical society june three paths there be where learnings favored sons trained in the schools which hold her favored ones follow their several stars with separate aim each has its honors each its special claim bred in the fruitful cradle of the east first as of oldest lineage comes the priest the lawyer next in wordy conflict strong full armed to battle for the right or wrong last he whose calling finds its voice in deeds frail natures helper in her sharpest needs each has his gifts his losses and his gains each his own share of pleasures and of pains no lifelong aim with steadfast eye pursued finds a smooth pathway all with roses strewed trouble belongs to man of woman born tread where he may his foot will find its thorn of all the guests at lifes perennial feast who of her children sits above the priest for him the broidered robe the carven seat pride at his beck and beauty at his feet for him the incense fumes the wine is poured himself a god adoring and adored his the first welcome when our hearts rejoice his in our dying ear the latest voice font altar grave his steps on all attend our staff our stay our all but heavenly friend where is the meddling hand that dares to probe the secret grief beneath his sable robe how grave his port how every gesture tells here truth abides here peace forever dwells vex not his lofty soul with comments vain faith asks no questions silence ye profane alas too oft while all is calm without the stormy spirit wars with endless doubt this is the mocking spectre scarce concealed behind traditions bruised and battered shield he sees the sleepless critic age by age scrawl his new readings on the hallowed page the wondrous deeds that priests and prophets saw dissolved in legend crystallized in law and on the soil where saints and martyrs trod altars new builded to the unknown god his shrines imperilled his evangels torn he dares not limp but ah how sharp his thorn yet while gods herald questions as he reads the outworn dogmas of his ancient creeds drops from his ritual the exploded verse blots from its page the athanasian curse though by the critics dangerous art perplexed his holy life is heavens unquestioned text that shining guidance doubt can never mar the pillars flame the light of bethlehems star strong is the moral blister that will draw laid on the conscience of the man of law whom blindfold justice lends her eyes to see truth in the scale that holds his promised fee what has not every lie its truthful side its honest fraction not to be denied per contra ask the moralist in sooth has not a lie its share in every truth then what forbids an honest man to try to find the truth that lurks in every lie and just as fairly call on truth to yield the lying fraction in its breast concealed so the worst rogue shall claim a ready friend his modest virtues boldly to defend and he who shows the record of a saint see himself blacker than the devil could paint what struggles to his captive soul belong who loves the right yet combats for the wrong who fights the battle he would fain refuse and wins well knowing that he ought to lose who speaks with glowing lips and look sincere in spangled words that make the worse appear the better reason who behind his mask hides his true self and blushes at his task what quips what quillets cheat the inward scorn that mocks such triumph has he not his thorn yet stay thy judgment were thy life the prize thy death the forfeit would thy cynic eyes see fault in him who bravely dares defend the cause forlorn the wretch without a friend nay though the rightful side is wisdoms choice wrong has its rights and claims a champions voice let the strong arm be lifted for the weak for the dumb lips the fluent pleader speak when with warm rebel blood our street was dyed who took unawed the hated hirelings side no greener civic wreath can adams claim no brighter page the youthful quincys name how blest is he who knows no meaner strife than arts long battle with the foes of life no doubt assails him doing still his best and trusting kindly nature for the rest no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise that wraps his breast and tells him that he lies he comes the languid sufferer lifts his head and smiles a welcome from his weary bed he speaks what music like the tones that tell past is the hour of danger all is well how can he feel the petty stings of grief whose cheering presence always brings relief what ugly dreams can trouble his repose who yields himself to soothe anothers woes hour after hour the busy day has found the good physician on his lonely round mansion and hovel low and lofty door he knows his journeys every path explore where the cold blast has struck with deadly chill the sturdy dweller on the stormswept hill where by the stagnant marsh the sickening gale has blanched the poisoned tenants of the vale where crushed and maimed the bleeding victim lies where madness raves where melancholy sighs and where the solemn whisper tells too plain that all his science all his art were vain how sweet his fireside when the day is done and cares have vanished with the setting sun evening at last its hour of respite brings and on his couch his weary length he flings soft be thy pillow servant of mankind lulled by an opiate art could never find sweet be thy slumber thou hast earned it well pleasant thy dreams clang goes the midnight bell darkness and storm the home is far away that waits his coming ere the break of day the snowclad pines their wintry plumage toss doubtful the frozen stream his road must cross deep lie the drifts the slanted heaps have shut the hardy woodman in his mountain hut why should thy softer frame the tempest brave hast thou no life no health to lose or save look read the answer in his patient eyes for him no other voice when suffering cries deaf to the gale that all around him blows a feeble whisper calls him and he goes or seek the crowded city summers heat glares burning blinding in the narrow street still noisome deadly sleeps the envenomed air unstirred the yellow flag that says beware tempt not thy fate one little moments breath bears on its viewless wing the seeds of death thou at whose door the gilded chariots stand whose dearbought skill unclasps the misers hand turn from thy fatal quest nor cast away that life so precious let a meaner prey feed the destroyers hunger live to bless those happier homes that need thy care no less smiling he listens has he then a charm whose magic virtues peril can disarm no safeguard his no amulet he wears too well he knows that nature never spares her truest servant powerless to defend from her own weapons her unshrinking friend he dares the fate the bravest well might shun nor asks reward save only heavens well done such are the toils the perils that he knows days without rest and nights without repose yet all unheeded for the love he bears his art his kind whose every grief he shares harder than these to know how small the part natures proud empire yields to striving art how as the tide that rolls around the sphere laughs at the mounds that delving arms uprear spares some few roods of oozy earth but still wastes and rebuilds the planet at its will comes at its ordered season night or noon led by the silver magnet of the moon so lifes vast tide forever comes and goes unchecked resistless as it ebbs and flows hardest of all when art has done her best to find the cuckoo brooding in her nest the shrewd adventurer fresh from parts unknown kills off the patients science thought her own towns from a nostrumvender get their name fences and walls the cureall drug proclaim plasters and pads the willing world beguile fair lydia greets us with astringent smile munchausens fellowcountryman unlocks his new pandoras globuleholding box and as king george inquired with puzzled grin how how the devil get the apple in so we ask how with wonderopening eyes such pygmy pills can hold such giant lies yes sharp the trials stern the daily tasks that suffering nature from her servant asks his the kind office dainty menials scorn his path how hard at every step a thorn what does his saddening restless slavery buy what save a right to live a chance to die to live companion of disease and pain to die by poisoned shafts untimely slain answer from hoary eld majestic shades from memphian courts from delphic colonnades speak in the tones that persias despot heard when nations treasured every golden word the wandering echoes wafted oer the seas from the far isle that held hippocrates and thou best gift that pergamus could send imperial rome her noblest caesars friend master of masters whose unchallenged sway not bold vesalius dared to disobey ye who while prophets dreamed of dawning times taught your rude lessons in salernos rhymes and ye the nearer sires to whom we owe the better share of all the best we know in every land an evergrowing train since wakening science broke her rusted chain speak from the past and say what prize was sent to crown the toiling years so freely spent list while they speak in lifes uneven road our willing hands have eased our brothers load one forehead smoothed one pang of torture less one peaceful hour a sufferers couch to bless the smile brought back to fevers parching lips the light restored to reason in eclipse lifes treasure rescued like a burning brand snatched from the dread destroyers wasteful hand such were our simple records day by day for gains like these we wore our lives away in toilsome paths our daily bread we sought but bread from heaven attending angels brought pain was our teacher speaking to the heart mother of pity nurse of pitying art our lesson learned we reached the peaceful shore where the pale sufferer asks our aid no more these gracious words our welcome our reward ye served your brothers ye have served your lord rhymes of a lifetime from the first gleam of morning to the gray of peaceful evening lo a life unrolled in woven pictures all its changes told its lights its shadows every flitting ray till the long curtain falling dims the day steals from the dials disk the sunlights gold and all the graven hours grow dark and cold where late the glowing blaze of noontide lay ah the warm blood runs wild in youthful veins let me no longer play with painted fire new songs for newborn days i would not tire the listening ears that wait for fresher strains in phrase newmoulded newforged rhythmic chains with plaintive measures from a wornout lyre august before the curfew at my fireside alone beneath the darkened sky with saddened heart and unstrung lyre i heap the spoils of years gone by and leave them with a longdrawn sigh like driftwood brands that glimmering lie before the ashes hide the fire let not these slow declining days the rosy light of dawn outlast still round my lonely hearth it plays and gilds the east with borrowed rays while memorys mirrored sunset blaze flames on the windows of the past march at the saturday club this is our place of meeting opposite that towered and pillared building look at it kings chapel in the second georges day rebellion stole its regal name away stone chapel sounded better but at last the poisoned name of our provincial past had lost its ancient venom then once more stone chapel was kings chapel as before so let rechristened north street when it can bring back the days of marlborough and queen anne next the old church your wandering eye will meet a granite pile that stares upon the street our civic temple slanderous tongues have said its shape was modelled from st botolphs head lofty but narrow jealous passersby say boston always held her head too high turn halfway round and let your look survey the white facade that gleams across the way the manywindowed building tall and wide the palaceinn that shows its northern side in grateful shadow when the sunbeams beat the granite wall in summers scorching heat this is the place whether its name you spell tavern or caravansera or hotel would i could steal its echoes you should find such store of vanished pleasures brought to mind such feasts the laughs of many a jocund hour that shook the mortar from king georges tower such guests what famous names its record boasts whose owners wander in the mob of ghosts such stories every beam and plank is filled with juicy wit the joyous talkers spilled ready to ooze as once the mountain pine the floors are laid with oozed its turpentine a month had flitted since the club had met the day came round i found the table set the waiters lounging round the marble stairs empty as yet the double row of chairs i was a full half hour before the rest alone the banquetchambers single guest so from the tables side a chair i took and having neither company nor book to keep me waking by degrees there crept a torpor over me in short i slept loosed from its chain along the wreckstrown track of the dead years my soul goes travelling back my ghosts take on their robes of flesh it seems dreaming is life nay life less life than dreams so real are the shapes that meet my eyes they bring no sense of wonder no surprise no hint of other than an earthborn source all seems plain daylight everything of course how dim the colors are how poor and faint this palette of weak words with which i paint here sit my friends if i could fix them so as to my eyes they seem my page would glow like a queens missal warm as if the brush of titian or velasquez brought the flush of life into their features ay de mi if syllables were pigments you should see such breathing portraitures as never man found in the pitti or the vatican here sits our poet laureate if you will long has he worn the wreath and wears it still dead nay not so and yet they say his bust looks down on marbles covering royal dust kings by the grace of god or natures grace dead no alive i see him in his place fullfeatured with the bloom that heaven denies her children pinched by cold new england skies too often while the nurserys happier few win from a summer cloud its roseate hue kind softvoiced gentle in his eye there shines the ray serene that filled evangelines modest he seems not shy content to wait amid the noisy clamor of debate the lookedfor moment when a peaceful word smooths the rough ripples louder tongues have stirred in every tone i mark his tender grace and all his poems hinted in his face what tranquil joy his friendly presence gives how could i think him dead he lives he lives there at the tables further end i see in his old place our poets visavis the great professor strong broadshouldered square in lifes rich noontide joyous debonair his social hour no leaden care alloys his laugh rings loud and mirthful as a boys that lusty laugh the puritan forgot what ear has heard it and remembers not how often halting at some wide crevasse amid the windings of his alpine pass high up the cliffs the climbing mountaineer listening the faroff avalanche to hear silent and leaning on his steelshod staff has heard that cheery voice that ringing laugh from the rude cabin whose nomadic walls creep with the moving glacier as it crawls how does vast nature lead her living train in ordered sequence through that spacious brain as in the primal hour when adam named the newborn tribes that young creation claimed how will her realm be darkened losing thee her darling whom we call our agassiz but who is he whose massive frame belies the maiden shyness of his downcast eyes who broods in silence till by questions pressed some answer struggles from his laboring breast an artist nature meant to dwell apart locked in his studio with a human heart tracking its eaverned passions to their lair and all its throbbing mysteries laying bare count it no marvel that he broods alone over the heart he studies t is his own so in his page whatever shape it wear the essex wizards shadowed self is there the great romancer hid beneath his veil like the stern preacher of his sombre tale virile in strength yet bashful as a girl prouder than hester sensitive as pearl from his mild throng of worshippers released our concord delphi sends its chosen priest prophet or poet mystic sage or seer by every title always welcome here why that ethereal spirits frame describe you know the racemarks of the brahmin tribe the spare slight form the sloping shoulders droop the calm scholastic mien the clerkly stoop the lines of thought the sharpened features wear carved by the edge of keen new england air list for he speaks as when a king would choose the jewels for his bride he might refuse this diamond for its flaw find that less bright than those its fellows and a pearl less white than fits her snowy neck and yet at last the fairest gems are chosen and made fast in golden fetters so with light delays he seeks the fittest word to fill his phrase nor vain nor idle his fastidious quest his chosen word is sure to prove the best where in the realm of thought whose air is song does he the buddha of the west belong he seems a winged franklin sweetly wise born to unlock the secrets of the skies and which the nobler calling if t is fair terrestrial with celestial to compare to guide the stormclouds elemental flame or walk the chambers whence the lightning came amidst the sources of its subtile fire and steal their effluence for his lips and lyre if lost at times in vague aerial flights none treads with firmer footstep when he lights a soaring nature ballasted with sense wisdom without her wrinkles or pretence in every bible he has faith to read and every altar helps to shape his creed ask you what name this prisoned spirit bears while with ourselves this fleeting breath it shares till angels greet him with a sweeter one in heaven on earth we call him emerson i start i wake the vision is withdrawn its figures fading like the stars at dawn crossed from the roll of life their cherished names and memorys pictures fading in their frames yet life is lovelier for these transient gleams of buried friendships blest is he who dreams our dead singer h w l pride of the sister realm so long our own we claim with her that spotless fame of thine white as her snow and fragrant as her pine ours was thy birthplace but in every zone some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown breathes perfume from its blossoms that entwine whereer the dewdrops fall the sunbeams shine on lifes long path with tangled cares oergrown can art thy truthful counterfeit command the silverhaloed features tranquil mild soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled give warmth and pressure to the marble hand seek the lost rainbow in the sky it spanned farewell sweet singer heaven reclaims its child carved from the block or cast in clinging mould will grateful memory fondly try her best the mortal vesture from decay to wrest his look shall greet us calm but ah how cold no breath can stir the brazen draperys fold no throb can heave the statues stony breast he is not here but risen will stand confest in all we miss in all our eyes behold how nature loved him on his placid brow thoughts ample dome she set the sacred sign that marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine nor asked a leaflet from the laurels bough that envious time might clutch or disallow to prove her chosen minstrels song divine on many a saddened hearth the evening fire burns paler as the childrens hour draws near that joyous hour his song made doubly dear and tender memories touch the faltering choir he sings no more on earth our vain desire aches for the voice we loved so long to hear in dorian flutenotes breathing soft and clear the sweet contralto that could never tire deafened with listening to a harsher strain the maenads scream the stark barbarians cry still for those soothing loving tones we sigh oh for our vanished orpheus once again the shadowy silence hears us call in vain his lips are hushed his song shall never die two poems to harriet beecher stowe on her seventieth birthday june i at the summit sister we bid you welcome we who stand on the high tableland we who have climbed lifes slippery alpine slope and rest still leaning on the staff of hope looking along the silent mer de glace leading our footsteps where the dark crevasse yawns in the frozen sea we all must pass sister we clasp your hand rest with

captive british hearts whether his shrewdness made their statesmen halt or if his learning found their dons at fault or if his virtue was a strange surprise or if his wit flung stardust in their eyes

weeds among the fairer growths remember still song comes of grace and not of human will we get a jarring note when most we try then strike the chord we know not how or why our stately verse with too aspiring art oft overshoots and fails to reach the heart while the rude rhyme one human throb endears turns grief to smiles and softens mirth to tears kindest of critics ye whose fingers read from

autumn crowned the hundredth circle of his yearly round when as we meet today our fathers met that joyous gathering who can eer forget when harvards nurslings scattered far and wide through mart and village lakes and oceans side came with one impulse one fraternal throng and crowned the hours with banquet speech and song once more revived in fancys magic glass i see in state the long procession pass tall courtly leader as by right divine winthrop our winthrop rules the marshalled line still seen in front as on that faroff day his ribboned baton showed the columns way not all are gone who marched in manly pride and waved their truncheons at their leaders side gray lowell dixwell who his empire shared these to be with us envious time has spared few are the faces so familiar then our eyes still meet amid the haunts of men scarce one of all the living gathered there whose unthinned locks betrayed a silver hair greets us today and yet we seem the same as our own sires and grandsires save in name there are the patriarchs looking vaguely round for classmates faces hardly known if found see the cold brow that rules the busy mart close at its side the pallid son of art whose purchased skill with borrowed meaning clothes and stolen hues the smirking face he loathes here is the patient scholar in his looks you read the titles of his learned books what classic lore those spidery crowsfeet speak what problems figure on that wrinkled cheek for never thought but left its stiffened trace its fossil footprint on the plastic face as the swift record of a raindrop stands fixed on the tablet of the hardening sands on every face as on the written page each year renews the autograph of age one trait alone may wasting years defy the fire still lingering in the poets eye while hope the siren sings her sweetest strain non omnis moriar is its proud refrain sadly we gaze upon the vacant chair he who should claim its honors is not there otis whose lips the listening crowd enthrall that press and pack the floor of bostons hall but kirkland smiles released from toil and care since the silk mantle younger shoulders wear quincys whose spirit breathes the selfsame fire that filled the bosom of his youthful sire who for the altar bore the kindled torch to freedoms temple dying in its porch three grave professions in their sons appear whose words well studied all well pleased will hear palfrey ordained in varied walks to shine statesman historian critic and divine solid and square behold majestic shaw a mass of wisdom and a mine of law warren whose arm the

oer slumbering lakes see in the impress which the body wears how its imperial might the soul declares the foreheads large expansion lofty wide that locks unsilvered vainly strive to hide the lines of thought that plough the sober cheek lips that betray their wisdom ere they speak in tones like answers from dodonas grove an eye like junos when she frowns on jove i look and wonder will he be content this man this monarch for the purple meant the meaner duties of his tribe to share clad in the garb that common mortals wear ah wild ambition spread thy restless wings beneath whose plumes the hidden cestrum stings thou whose bold flight would leave earths vulgar crowds and like the eagle soar above the clouds must feel the pang that fallen angels know when the red lightning strikes thee from below less bronze more silver mingles in the mould of him whom next my roving eyes behold his more the scholars than the statesmans face proclaims him born of academic race weary his look as if an aching brain left on his brow the frozen prints of pain his voice farreaching grave sonorous owns a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires glows with a heat that every bosom fires such everett seems no chancesown wild flower knows the fullblown charms of cultures double rose alas how soon by deaths unsparing frost its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost two voices only two to earth belong of all whose accents met the listening throng winthrop alike for speech and guidance framed on that proud day a twofold duty claimed one other yet

sung that saucy song which even in memory turns my soul aghast felix audacia was the verdict cast what were the glory of these festal days shorn of their grand illuminations blaze night comes at last with all her starry train to find a light in every glittering pane from harvards windows see the sudden flash old massachusetts glares through every sash from wall to wall the kindling splendors run till all is glorious as the noonday sun how to the scholars mind each object brings what some historian tells some poet sings the good gray teacher whom we all revered loved honored laughed at and by freshmen feared as from old harvard where its light began from hall to hall the clustering splendors ran took down his wellworn eschylus and read lit by the rays a thousand tapers shed how the swift herald crossed the leagues between mycenaes monarch and his faithless queen and thus he read my verse but ill displays the attic picture clad in modern phrase on idas summit flames the kindling pile and lemnos answers from his rocky isle from athos next it climbs the reddening skies thence where the watchtowers of macistus rise the sentries of mesapius in their turn bid the dry heath in high piled masses burn cithoerons crag the crimson billows stain far aegiplanctus joins the fiery train thus the swift courier through the pathless night has gained at length the arachnoean height whence the glad tidings borne on wings offlame ilium has fallen reach the royal dame so ends the day before the midnight stroke the lights expiring cloud the air with smoke while these the toil of younger

its golden letters tell this dust once breathing changed its joyous life for toil and hunger wounds and mortal strife love friendship learnings all prevailing charms for the cold bivouac and the clash of arms the cause of freedom won a race enslaved called back to manhood and a nation saved these sons of harvard falling ere their prime leave their proud memory to the coming time while in their

toil and find a fragrance in their midnight oil but let a purblind mortal dare the task the embryo future of itself to ask the world reminds him with a scornful laugh that times have changed since prospero broke his staff could all the wisdom of the schools foretell the dismal hour when lisbon shook and fell or name the shuddering night that toppled down our sisters pride beneath whose mural

learn those hidden truths our heaventaught eyes discern yet vain is knowledge with her mystic wand to pierce the cloudy screen and read beyond once to the silent stars the fates were known to us they tell no secrets but their own at israels altar still we humbly bow but where oh where are israels prophets now where is the sibyl with her hoarded leaves where is the charm the weird enchantress weaves no croaking raven turns the auspex pale no reeking altars tell the morrows tale the measured footsteps of the fates are dumb unseen unheard unheralded they come prophet and priest and all their following fail who then is left to rend the futures veil who but the poet he whose nicer sense no film can baffle with its slight defence whose finer vision marks the waves that stray felt but unseen beyond the violet ray who while the stormwind waits its darkening shroud foretells the tempest ere he sees the cloud stays not for time his secrets to reveal but reads his message ere he breaks the seal so mantuas bard foretold the coming day ere bethlehems infant in the manger lay the promise trusted to a mortal tongue found listening ears before the angels sung so while his load the creeping

opened scroll is spread blank to all eyes save his who dimly sees the shadowy future told in words like these how strange the prospect to my sight appears changed by the busy hands of fifty years full well i know our oceansalted charles filling and emptying through the sands and marls that wall his restless stream on either bank not all unlovely when the sedges rank lend their coarse veil the sable ooze to hide that bares its blackness with the ebbing tide in other shapes to my illumined eyes those ragged margins of our stream arise through walls of stone the sparkling waters flow in clearer depths the golden sunsets glow on purer waves the lamps of midnight gleam that silver oer the unpolluted stream along his shores what stately temples rise what spires what turrets print the shadowed skies our smiling mother sees her broad domain spread its tall roofs along the western plain those blazoned windows blushing glories tell of grateful hearts that loved her long and well yon gilded dome that glitters in the sun was dives gift alas his only one these buttressed walls enshrine a bankers name that hallowed chapel hides a misers shame their wealth they left their memory cannot fade though age shall crumble every stone they laid great lord of millions let me call thee great since countless servants at thy bidding wait richesse oblige no mortal must be blind to all but self or look at human kind laboring and suffering all its want and woe through sheets of crystal as a pleasing show that makes life happier for the chosen few duty for whom is something not to do when thy last page of life at length is filled what shall thine heirs to keep thy memory build will piles of stone in auburns mournful shade save from neglect the spot where thou art laid nay deem not thus the sauntering strangers eye will pass unmoved thy columned tombstone by no memory wakened not a teardrop shed thy name uncared for and thy date unread but if thy record thou indeed dost prize bid from the soil some stately temple rise some hall of learning some memorial shrine with names long honored to associate thine so shall thy fame outlive thy shattered bust when all around thee slumber in the dust thus englands henry lives in etons towers saved from the spoil oblivions gulf devours our later records with as fair a fame have wreathed each uncrowned benefactors name the walls they reared the memories still retain that churchyard marbles try to keep in vain in vain the delving antiquary tries to find the tomb where generous harvard lies here here his lasting monument is found where every spot is consecrated ground oer stoughtons dust the crumbling stone decays fast fade its lines of lapidary praise there the wild bramble weaves its ragged nets there the dry lichen spreads its gray rosettes still in yon walls his memory lives unspent nor asks a braver nobler monument thus hollis lives and holden honored praised and good sir matthew in the halls they raised thus live the worthies of these later times who shine in deeds less brilliant grouped in rhymes say shall the muse with faltering steps retreat or dare these names in rhythmic form repeat why not as boldly as from homers

high in beauteous garlands dressed those honored names that grace our later day weld matthews sever thayer austin gray sears phillips lawrence hemenway to the list add sanders sibley all the muse has missed once more i turn to read the pictured page bright with the promise of the coming age ye unborn sons of children yet unborn whose youthful eyes shall greet that faroff morn blest are those eyes that all undimmed behold the sights so longed for by the wise of old from higharched alcoves through resounding halls clad in full robes majestic science calls tireless unsleeping still at natures feet whateer she utters fearless to repeat her lips at last from every cramp released that israels prophet caught from egypts priest i see the statesman firm sagacious bold for lifes long conflict cast in amplest mould not his to clamor with the senseless throng that shouts unshamed our party right or wrong but in the patriots neverending fight to side with truth who changes wrong to right i see the scholar in that wondrous time men women children all can write in rhyme these four brief lines addressed to youth inclined to idle rhyming in his notes i find who writes in verse that should have writ in prose is like a traveller walking on his toes happy the rhymester who in time has found the heels he lifts were made to touch the ground i see gray teachers on their work intent their lavished lives in endless labor spent had closed at last in age and penury wrecked martyrs not burned but frozen in neglect save for the generous hands that stretched in aid of wornout servants left to die half paid ah many a year will pass i thought ere we such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt that cold republics hasten to forget i see the priest if such a name he bears who without pride his sacred vestment wears and while the symbols of his tribe i seek thus my first impulse bids me think and speak let not the mitre englands prelate wears next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares though low before it courtly christians bow leave its red mark on younger englands brow we love we honor the maternal dame but let her priesthood wear a modest name while through the waters of the pilgrims bay a newborn mayflower shows her keels the way too old grew britain for her mothers beads must we be necklaced with her childrens creeds welcome alike in surplice or in gown the loyal lieges of the heavenly crown we greet with cheerful not submissive mien a sister church but not a mitred queen a few brief flutters and the unwilling muse who feared the flight she hated to refuse shall fold the wings whose gayer plumes are shed here where at first her halffledged pinions spread well i remember in the long ago how in the forest shades of fontainebleau strained through a fissure in a rocky cell one crystal drop with measured cadence fell still as of old forever bright and clear the fissured cavern drops its wonted tear and wondrous virtue simple folk aver lies in that teardrop of la roche qui pleure of old i wandered by the rivers side between whose banks the mighty waters glide where vast niagara hurrying to its fall builds and unbuilds its evertumbling wall oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar of battling floods and feel the trembling shore as the huge torrent girded for its leap with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep not less distinct from memorys pictured urn the gray old rock the leafy woods return robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear and once again with quickened sense i hear through the low murmur of the leaves that stir the tinkling teardrop of la roche qui pleure so when the third ripe century stands complete as once again the sons of harvard meet rejoicing numerous as the seashore sands drawn from all quarters farthest distant lands where through the reeds the scaly saurian steals where cold alaska feeds her floundering seals where plymouth glorying wears her iron crown where sacramento sees the suns go down nay from the cloisters whence the refluent tide wafts their pale students to our mothers side mid all the tumult that the day shall bring while all the echoes shout and roar and ring these tinkling lines oblivions easy prey once more emerging to the light of day not all unpleasing to the listening ear shall wake the memories of this bygone year heard as i hear the measured drops that flow from the gray rock of wooded fontainebleau yet ere i leave one loving word for all those fresh young lives that wait our mothers call one gift is yours kind natures richest dower youth the fair bud that holds lifes opening flower full of high hopes no coward doubts enchain with all the future throbbing in its brain and mightiest instincts which the beating heart fills with the fire its burning waves impart o joyous youth whose glory is to dare thy foot firm planted on the lowest stair thine eye uplifted to the loftiest height where fame stands beckoning in the rosy light thanks for thy flattering tales thy fond deceits thy loving lies thy cheerful smiling cheats natures rash promise every day is broke a thousand acorns breed a single oak the myriad blooms that make the orchard gay in barren beauty throw their lives away yet shall we quarrel with the sap that yields the painted blossoms which adorn the fields when the fair orchard wears its mayday suit of pinkwhite petals for its scanty fruit thrice happy hours in hopes illusion dressed in fancys cradle nurtured and caressed though rich the spoils that ripening years may bring to thee the dewdrops of the orient cling not all the dyestuffs from the vats of truth can match the rainbow on the robes of youth dear unborn children to our mothers trust we leave you fearless when we lie in dust while oer these walls the christian banner waves from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves while oer those portals veritas you read no church shall bind you with its human creed take from the past the best its toil has won but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed quit the old paths that error loved to tread and a new wreath of living blossoms seek a narrower pathway up a loftier peak lose not your reverence but unmanly fear leave far behind you all who enter here as once of old from idas lofty height the flaming signal flashed across the night so harvards beacon sheds its unspent rays till every watchtower shows its kindling blaze caught from a spark and fanned by every gale a brighter radiance gilds the roofs of yale amherst and williams bid their flambeaus shine and bowdoin answers through her groves of pine oer princetons sands the far reflections steal where mighty edwards stamped his iron heel nay on the hill where old beliefs were bound fast as if styx had girt them nine times round bursts such a light that trembling souls inquire if the whole church of calvin is on fire well may they ask for what so brightly burns as a dry creed that nothing ever learns thus link by link is knit the flaming chain lit by the torch of harvards hallowed plain thy son thy servant dearest mother mine lays this poor offering on thy holy shrine an

common december during the transit of venus i love all sights of earth and skies from flowers that glow to stars that shine the comet and the penny show all curious things above below hold each in turn my wandering eyes i claim the christian pagans line humani nihil even so and is not human life divine when soft the western breezes blow and strolling youths meet sauntering maids i love to watch the stirring trades beneath the vallombrosa shades our muchenduring elms bestow the vender and his rhetorics flow that lambent stream of liquid lies the bait he dangles from his line the gudgeon and his goldwashed prize i halt before the blazoned sign that bids me linger to admire the drama time can never tire the little hero of the hunch with iron arm and soul of fire and will that works his fierce desire untamed unscared unconquered punch my ear a pleasing torture finds in tones the withered sibyl grinds the dame sans mercis broken strain whom i erewhile perchance have known when orleans filled the bourbon throne a siren singing by the seine but most i love the tube that spies the orbs celestial in their march that shows the comet as it whisks its tail across the planets disks as if to blind their bloodshot eyes or wheels so close against the sun we tremble at the thought of risks our little spinning ball may run to pop like corn that children parch from summer something overdone and roll a cinder through the skies grudge not today the scanty fee to him who farms the firmament to whom the milky way is free who holds the wondrous crystal key the silent open sesame that science to her sons has lent who takes his toll and lifts the bar that shuts the road to sun and star if venus only comes to time and prophets say she must and shall today will hear the tinkling chime of many

how to dress and takes his doublets from the press and halts between the old and new please heaven he wear his suit of blue or don at least his ragged cloak with rents that show the azure through i go the patient crowd to join that round the tube my eyes discern the last newcomer of the file and wait and wait a weary while and gape and stretch and shrug and smile for each his place must fairly earn hindmost and foremost in his turn till hitching onward pace by pace i gain at last the envied place and pay the white exiguous coin the sun and i are face to face he glares at me i stare at him and lo my straining eye has found a little spot that black and round lies near the crimsoned fireorbs rim o blessed beauteous evening star well named for her whom earth adores the lady of the dovedrawn car i know thee in thy white simar but veiled in black a rayless spot blank as a careless scribblers blot stripped of thy robe of silvery flame the stolen robe that night restores when day has shut his golden doors i see thee yet i know thee not and canst thou call thyself the same a black round spot and that is all and such a speck our earth would be if he who looks upon the stars through the red atmosphere of mars could see our little creeping ball across the disk of crimson crawl as i our sister planet see and art thou then a world like ours flung from the orb that whirled our own a molten pebble from its zone how must thy burning sands absorb the firewaves of the blazing orb thy chain so short thy path so near thy flamedefying creatures hear the maelstroms of the photosphere and is thy bosom decked with flowers that steal their bloom from scalding showers and bast thou cities domes and towers and life and love that makes it dear and death that fills thy tribes with fear lost in my dream my spirit soars through paths the wandering angels know my allpervading thought explores the azure oceans lucent shores i leave my mortal self below as up the starlit stairs i climb and still the widening view reveals in endless rounds the circling wheels that build the horologe of time new spheres new suns new systems gleam the voice no earthborn echo hears steals softly on my ravished ears i hear them singing as they shine a mortals voice dissolves my dream my patient neighbor next in line hints gently there are those who wait o guardian of the starry gate what coin shall pay this debt of mine too slight thy claim too small the fee that bids thee turn the potent key the tuscans hand has placed in thine forgive my own the small affront the insult of the proffered dime take it o friend since this thy wont but still shall faithful memory be a bankrupt debtor unto thee and pay thee with a grateful rhyme ave prelude to illustrated poems full well i know the frozen hand has come that smites the songs of grove and garden dumb and chills sad autumns last chrysanthemum yet would i find one blossom if i might ere the dark loom that weaves the robe of white hides all the wrecks of summer out of sight sometimes in dim novembers narrowing day when all the seasons pride has passed away as mid the blackened stems and leaves we stray we spy in sheltered nook or rocky cleft a starry disk the hurrying winds have left of all its blooming sisterhood bereft some pansy with its wondering baby eyes poor wayside nursling fixed in blank surprise at the rough welcome of unfriendly skies or golden daisy will it dare disclaim the lions tooth to wear this gentler name or bloodred salvia with its lips aflame the storms have stripped the lily and the rose still on its cheek the flush of summer glows and all its heartleaves kindle as it blows so had i looked some bud of song to find the careless winds of autumn left behind with these of earlier seasons growth to bind ah me my skies are dark with sudden grief a flower lies faded on my garnered sheaf yet let the sunshine gild this virgin leaf the joyous blessed sunshine of the past still with me though the heavens are overcast the

and thrush and nightingale shall sip and skimming swallows dip and strange shy wanderers fold their lustrous plumes fragrant from bowers that lent their sweet perfumes where paestums rose or persias lilac blooms here from his cloud the eagle stoop to drink at the full basins brink and whet his beak against its rounded lip his glossy feathers glistening as they drip here shall the dreaming poet linger long far from his listening throng nor lute nor lyre his trembling hand shall bring here no frail muse shall imp her crippled wing no faltering minstrel strain his throat to sing these hallowed

trees in all the woods were men and each and every blade of grass a pen if every leaf on every shrub and tree turned to a sheet of foolscap every sea were changed to ink and all earths living tribes had nothing else to do but act as scribes and for ten thousand ages day and night the human race should write and write and write till all the pens and paper were used up and the huge inkstand was an

hanged them high no use no use what cares a witch for a hangmans noose they buried them deep but they wouldnt lie still for cats and witches are hard to kill they swore they shouldnt and wouldnt die books said they did but they lie they lie a couple of hundred years or so they had knocked about in the world below when an essex deacon dropped in to call and a homesick feeling seized them all for he came from a place they knew full well and many a tale he had to tell they longed to visit the haunts of men to see the old dwellings they knew again and ride on their broomsticks all around their wide domain of unhallowed ground in essex county theres many a roof well known to him of the cloven hoof the small square windows are full in view which the midnight hags went sailing through on their welltrained broomsticks mounted high seen like shadows against the sky crossing the track of owls and bats hugging before them their coalblack cats well did they know those gray old wives the sights we see in our daily drives shimmer of lake and shine of sea brownes bare hill with its lonely tree it was nt then as we see it now with one scant scalplock to shade its brow dusky nooks in the essex woods dark dim dantelike solitudes where the treetoad watches the sinuous snake glide through his forests of fern and brake ipswich river its old stone bridge far off andovers indian ridge and many a scene where history tells some shadow of bygone terror dwells of normans woe with its tale of dread of the screeching woman of marblehead the fearful story that turns men pale dont bid me tell it my speech would fail who would not will not if he can bathe in the breezes of fair cape ann rest in the bowers her bays enfold loved by the sachems and squaws of old home where the white magnolias bloom sweet with the bayberrys chaste perfume hugged by the woods and kissed by the sea where is the eden like to thee for that couple of hundred years or so there had been no peace in the world below the witches still grumbling it is nt fair come give us a taste of the upper air we ve had enough of your sulphur springs and the evil odor that round them clings we long for a drink that is cool and nice great buckets of water with wenham ice weve served you well upstairs you know you re a good old fellow come let us go i dont feel sure of his being good but he happened to be in a pleasant mood as fiends with their skins full sometimes are hed been drinking with roughs at a boston bar so what does he do but up and shout to a graybeard turnkey let em out to mind his orders was all he knew the gates swung open and out they flew where are our broomsticks the beldams cried here are your broomsticks an imp replied they ve been in the place you know so long they smell of brimstone uncommon strong but theyve gained by being left alone just look and youll see how tall theyve grown and where is my cat a vixen squalled yes where are our cats the witches bawled and began to call them all by name as fast as they called the cats they came there was bobtailed tommy and longtailed tim and walleyed jacky and greeneyed jim and splayfoot benny and slimlegged beau and skinny and squally and jerry and joe and many another that came at call it would take too long to count them all all black one could hardly tell which was which but every cat knew his own old witch and she knew hers as hers knew her ah didnt they curl their tails and purr no sooner the withered hags were free than out they swarmed for a midnight spree i couldnt tell all they did in rhymes but the essex people had dreadful times the swampscott fishermen still relate how a strange seamonster stole their bait how their nets were tangled in loops and knots and they found dead crabs in their lobsterpots poor danvers grieved for her blasted crops and wilmington mourned over mildewed hops a blight played havoc with beverly beans it was all the work of those hateful queans a dreadful panic began at prides where the witches stopped in their midnight rides and there rose strange rumors and vague alarms mid the peaceful dwellers at beverly farms now when the boss of the beldams found that without his leave they were ramping round he called they could hear him twenty miles from chelsea beach to the misery isles the deafest old granny knew his tone without the trick of the telephone come here you witches come here says he at your games of old without asking me ill give you a little job to do that will keep you stirring you godless crew they came of course at their masters call the witches the broomsticks the cats and all he led the hags to a railway train the horses were trying to drag in vain now then says he youve had your fun and here are the cars youve got to run the driver may just unhitch his team we dont want horses we dont want steam you may keep your old black cats to hug but the loaded train youve got to lug since then on many a car you ll see a broomstick plain as plain can be on every stick theres a witch astride the string you see to her leg is tied she will do a mischief if she can but the string is held by a careful man and whenever the evilminded witch would cut some caper he gives a twitch as for the hag you cant see her but hark you can hear her black cats purr and now and then as a car goes by you may catch a gleam from her wicked eye often youve looked on a rushing train but just what moved it was not so plain it couldnt be those wires above for they could neither pull nor shove where was the motor that made it go you couldnt guess but now you know remember my rhymes when you ride again on the rattling rail by the broomstick train tartarus while in my simple gospel creed that god is love so plain i read shall dreams of heathen birth affright my pathway through the coming night ah lord of life though spectres pale fill with their threats the shadowy vale with thee my faltering steps to aid how can i dare to be afraid shall mouldering page or fading scroll outface the charter of the soul shall priesthoods palsied arm protect the wrong our human hearts reject and smite the lips whose shuddering cry proclaims a cruel creed a lie the wizards rope we disallow was justice once is murder now is there a world of blank despair and dwells the omnipresent there does he behold with smile serene the shows of that unending scene where sleepless hopeless anguish lies and ever dying never dies say does he hear the sufferers groan and is that child of wrath his own o mortal wavering in thy trust lift thy pale forehead from the dust the mists that cloud thy darkened eyes fade ere they reach the oerarching skies when the blind heralds of despair would bid thee doubt a fathers care look up from earth and read above on heavens blue tablet god is love at the turn of the road the glory has passed from the goldenrods plume the purplehued asters still linger in bloom the birch is bright yellow the sumachs are red the maples like torches aflame overhead but what if the joy of the summer is past and winters wild herald is blowing his blast for me dull november is sweeter than may for my love is its sunshine she meets me today will she come will the ringdove return to her nest will the needle swing back from the east or the west at the stroke of the hour she will be at her gate a friend may prove laggard love never comes late do i see her afar in the distance not yet too early too early she could not forget when i cross the old bridge where the brook overflowed she will flash full in sight at the turn of the road i pass the low wall where the ivy entwines i tread the brown pathway that leads through the pines i haste by the boulder that lies in the field where her promise at parting was lovingly sealed will she come by the hillside or round through the wood will she wear her brown dress or her mantle and hood the minute draws near but her watch may go wrong my heart will be asking what keeps her so long why doubt for a moment more shame if i do why question why tremble are angels more true she would come to the lover who calls her his own though she trod in the track of a whirling cyclone i crossed the old bridge ere the minute had passed i looked lo my love stood before me at last her eyes how they sparkled her cheeks how they glowed as we met face to face at the turn of the road in vita minerva vex not the muse with idle prayers she will not hear thy call she steals upon thee unawares or seeks thee not at all soft as the moonbeams when they sought endymions fragrant bower she parts the whispering leaves of thought to show her fullblown flower for thee her wooing hour has passed the singing birds have flown and winter comes with icy blast to chill thy buds unblown yet though the woods no longer thrill as once their arches rung sweet echoes hover round thee still of songs thy summer sung live in thy past await no more the rush of heavensent wings earth still has music left in store while memory sighs and sings readings over the teacups five stories and a sequel to my old readers you know the teacups that congenial set which round the teapot you have often met the grave dictator him you knew of old knew as the shepherd of another fold grayer he looks less youthful but the same as when you called him by a different name near him the mistress whose experienced skill has taught her duly every cup to fill weak strong cool lukewarm hot as you can pour no sweetening sugared two lumps one lump more next the professor whose scholastic phrase at every turn the teachers tongue betrays trying so hard to make his speech precise the captious listener finds it overnice nor be forgotten our annexes twain nor he the owner of the squinting brain which while its curious fancies we pursue oft makes us question are we crackbrained too along the board our growing list extends as one by one we count our clustering friends the youthful doctor waiting for his share of fits and fevers when his crown gets bare in strong dark lines our squarenibbed pen should draw the lordly presence of the man of law our bashful tutor claims a humbler place a lighter touch his slender form to trace mark the fair lady he is seated by some say he is her lover some deny watch them together time alone can show if deadripe friendship turns to love or no where in my list of phrases shall i seek the fitting words of number five to speak such task demands a readier pen than mine what if i steal the tutors valentine why should i call her gracious winning fair why with the loveliest of her sex compare those varied charms have many a muse inspired at last their worn superlatives have tired wit beauty sweetness each alluring grace all these in honeyed verse have found their place i need them not two little words i find which hold them all in happiest form combined no more with baffled language will i strive all in one breath i utter number five now count our teaspoons if you care to learn how many tinkling cups were served in turn add all together you will find them ten our young musician joined us now and then our bright delilah you must needs recall the comely handmaid youngest of us all need i remind you how the little maid came at a pinch to our professors aid trimmed his long locks with unrelenting shears and eased his looks of half a score of years sometimes at table as you well must know the stream of talk will all at once run low the air seems smitten with a sudden chill the wit grows silent and the gossip still this was our poets chance the hour of need when rhymes and stories we were used to read one day a whisper round the teacups stole no scrap of paper in the silver bowl our poets corner may i not expect my kindly reader still may recollect what not a line to keep our souls alive spoke in her silvery accents number five no matter something we must find to read find it or make it yes we must indeed now i remember i have seen at times some curious stories in a book of rhymes how certain secrets long in silence sealed in after days were guessed at or revealed those stories doubtless some of you must know they all were written many a year ago but an old story be it false or true twice told well told is twice as good as new wait but three sips and i will go myself and fetch the book of verses from its shelf no time was lost in finding what she sought gone but one moment lo the book is brought now then professor fortune has decreed that you this evening shall be first to read lucky for us that listen for in fact who reads this poem must know how to act right well she knew that in his greener age he had a mighty hankering for the stage the patient audience had not long to wait pleased with his chance he smiled and took the bait through his wild hair his coaxing fingers ran he spread the page before him and began the bankers secret the bankers dinner is the stateliest feast the town has heard of for a year at least the sparry lustres shed their broadest blaze damask and silver catch and spread the rays the florists triumphs crown the daintier spoil won from the sea the forest or the soil the steaming hothouse yields its largest pines the sunless vaults unearth their oldest wines with one admiring look the scene survey and turn a moment from the bright display of all the joys of earthly pride or power what gives most life worth living in an hour when victory settles on the doubtful fight and the last foeman wheels in panting flight no thrill like this is felt beneath the sun lifes sovereign moment is a battle won but say what next to shape a senates choice by the strong magic of the masters voice to ride the stormy tempest of debate that whirls the wavering fortunes of the state third in the list the happy lovers prize is won by honeyed words from womens eyes if some would have it first instead of third so let it be i answer not a word the fourth sweet readers let the thoughtless half have its small shrug and inoffensive laugh let the grave quarter wear its virtuous frown the stern halfquarter try to scowl us down but the last eighth the choice and sifted few will hear my words and pleased confess them true among the great whom heaven has made to shine how few have learned the art of arts to dine nature indulgent to our daily need kindhearted mother taught us all to feed but the chief art how rarely nature flings this choicest gift among her social kings say man of truth has life a brighter hour than waits the chosen guest who knows his power he moves with ease itself an angel charm lifts with light touch my ladys jewelled arm slides to his seat half leading and half led smiling but quiet till the grace is said then gently kindles while by slow degrees creep softly out the little arts that please bright looks the cheerful language of the eye the neat crisp question and the gay reply talk light and airy such as well may pass between the rested fork and lifted glass with play like this the earlier evening flies till rustling silks proclaim the ladies rise his hour has come he looks along the chairs as the great duke surveyed his iron squares thats the young traveller is nt much to show fast on the road but at the table slow next him you see the author in his look his forehead lined with wrinkles like a book wrote the great history of the ancient huns holds back to fire among the heavy guns oh theres our poet seated at his side beloved of ladies soft ceruleaneyed poets are prosy in their common talk as the fast trotters for the most part walk and theres our welldressed gentleman who sits by right divine no doubt among the wits who airs his tailors patterns when he walks the man that often speaks but never talks why should he talk whose presence lends a grace to every table where he shows his face he knows the manual of the silver fork can name his claret if he sees the cork remark that whitetop was considered fine but swear the juno is the better wine is not this talking ask quintilians rules if they say no the town has many fools pause for a moment for our eyes behold the plain unsceptred king the man of gold the thrice illustrious threefold millionnaire mark his slowcreeping dead metallic stare his eyes dull glimmering like the balancepan that weighs its guinea as he weighs his man whos next an artist in a satin tie whose ample folds defeat the curious eye and there s the cousin must be asked you know looks like a spinster at a babyshow hope he is cool they set him next the door and likes his place between the gap and bore next comes a congressman distinguished guest we dont count him they asked him with the rest and then some white cravats with wellshaped ties and heads above them which their owners prize of all that cluster round the genial board not one so radiant as the banquets lord some say they fancy but they know not why a shade of trouble brooding in his eye nothing perhaps the rooms are overhot yet see his cheek the dullred burning spot taste the brown sherry which he does not pass ha that is brandy see him fill his glass but not forgetful of his feasting friends to each in turn some lively word he sends see how he throws his baited lines about and plays his men as anglers play their trout a question drops among the listening crew and hits the traveller pat on timbuctoo were on the niger somewhere near its source not the least hurry take the rivers course through kissi foota kankan bammakoo bambarra sego so to timbuctoo thence down to youri stop him if we can we cant fare worse wake up the congressman the congressman once on his talking legs stirs up his knowledge to its thickest dregs tremendous draught for dining men to quaff nothing will choke him but a purpling laugh a word a shout a mighty roar t is done extinguished lassoed by a treacherous pun a laugh is priming to the loaded soul the scattering shots become a steady roll broke by sharp cracks that run along the line the light artillery of the talkers wine the kindling goblets flame with golden dews the hoarded flasks their tawny fire diffuse and the rhines breastmilk gushes cold and bright pale as the moon and maddening as her light with crimson juice the thirsty southern sky sucks from the hills where buried armies lie so that the dreamy passion it imparts is drawn from heroes bones and lovers hearts but lulls will come the flashing soul transmits its gleams of light in alternating fits the shower of talk that rattled down amain ends in small patterings like an aprils rain with the dry sticks all bonfires are begun bring the first fagot proser number one the voices halt the game is at a stand now for a solo from the masterhand t is but a story quite a simple thing an aria touched upon a single string but every accent comes with such a grace the stupid servants listen in their place each with his waiter in his lifted hands still as a wellbred pointer when he stands a query checks him is he quite exact this from a grizzled squarejawed man of fact the sparkling story leaves him to his fate crushed by a witness smothered with a date as a swift river sown with many a star runs brighter rippling on a shallow bar the smooth divine suggests a graver doubt a neat quotation bowls the parson out then sliding gayly from his own display he laughs the learned dulness all away so with the merry tale and jovial song the jocund evening whirls itself along till the last chorus shrieks its loud encore and the white neckcloths vanish through the door one savage word the menials know its tone and slink away the master stands alone well played by breathe not what were best unheard his goblet shivers while he speaks the word if wine tells truth and so have said the wise it makes me laugh to think how brandy lies bankrupt tomorrow millionnaire today the farce is over now begins the play the spring he touches lets a panel glide an iron closet harks beneath the slide bright with such treasures as a search might bring from the deep pockets of a truant king two diamonds eyeballs of a god of bronze bought from his faithful priest a pious bonze a string of brilliants rubies three or four bags of old coin and bars of virgin ore a jewelled poniard and a turkish knife noiseless and useful if we come to strife gone as a pirate flies before the wind and not one tear for all he leaves behind from all the love his better years have known fled like a felon ah but not alone the chariot flashes through a lanterns glare oh the wild eyes the storm of sable hair still to his side the broken heart will cling the bride of shame the wife without the ring hark the deep oath the wail of frenzied woe lost lost to hope of heaven and peace below he kept his secret but the seed of crime bursts of itself in gods appointed time the lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide one never blamed nor wept she only died none knew his lot though idle tongues would say he sought a lonely refuge far away and there with borrowed name and altered mien he died unheeded as he lived unseen the moral market had the usual chills of virtue suffering from protested bills the white cravats to friendships memory true sighed for the past surveyed the future too their sorrow breathed in one expressive line gave pleasant dinners who has got his wine the reader paused the teacups knew his ways he like the rest was not averse to praise voices and hands united every one joined in approval number three well done now for the exiles story if my wits are not at fault his curious record fits neatly as sequel to the tale weve heard not wholly wild the fancy nor absurd that this our island hermit well might be that storys hero fled from over sea come number seven we would not have you strain the fertile powers of that inventive brain read us the exiles secret theres enough of dreamlike fiction and fantastic stuff in the strange web of mystery that invests the lonely isle where sea birds build their nests lies naught but lies so number seven began no harm was known of that secluded man he lived alone who would nt if he might and leave the rogues and idiots out of sight a foolish story still ill do my best the house was real dont believe the rest how could a ruined dwelling last so long without its legends shaped in tale and song who was this man of whom they tell the lies perhaps why not napoleon in disguise so some said kidnapped from his ocean coop brought to this island in a coasting sloop meanwhile a sham napoleon in his place played nap and saved sir hudson from disgrace such was one story others used to say no not napoleon it was marshal ney shot yes no doubt but not with balls of lead but balls of pith that never shoot folks dead he wandered round lived south for many a year at last came north and fixed his dwelling here choose which you will of all the tales that pile their mingling fables on the treecrowned isle who wrote this modest version i suppose that truthful teacup our dictator knows made up of various legends it would seem the sailors yarn the crazy poets dream such tales as this by simple souls received at first are stared at and at last believed from threads like this the grave historians try to weave their webs and never know they lie hear then the fables that have gathered round the lonely home an exiled stranger found the exiles secret ye that have faced the billows and the spray of good st botolphs islandstudded bay as from the gliding bark your eye has scanned the beaconed rocks the wavegirt hills of sand have ye not marked one elmoershadowed isle round as the dimple chased in beautys smile a stain of verdure on an azure field set like a jewel in a battered shield fixed in the narrow gorge of oceans path peaceful it meets him in his hour of wrath when the mailed titan scourged by hissing gales writhes in his glistening coat of clashing scales the stormbeat island spreads its tranquil green calm as an emerald on an angry queen so fair when distant should be fairer near a boat shall waft us from the outstretched pier the breeze blows fresh we reach the islands edge our shallop rustling through the yielding sedge no welcome greets us on the desert isle those elms farshadowing hide no stately pile yet these green ridges mark an ancient road and to the traces of a fair abode the long gray line that marks a gardenwall and heaps of fallen beams firebranded all who sees unmoved a ruin at his feet the lowliest home where human hearts have beat its hearthstone shaded with the bistre stain a centurys showery torrents wash in vain its starving orchard where the thistle blows and mossy trunks still mark the broken rows its chimneyloving poplar oftenest seen next an old roof or where a roof has been its knotgrass plantain all the social weeds mans mute companions following where he leads its dwarfed pale flowers that show their straggling heads sown by the wind from grasschoked gardenbeds its woodbine creeping where it used to climb its roses breathing of the olden time all the poor shows the curious idler sees as lifes thin shadows waste by slow degrees till naught remains the saddening tale to tell save homes last wrecks the cellar and the well and whose the home that strews in black decay the one greenglowing island of the bay some darkbrowed pirates jealous of the fate that seized the strangled wretch of nixs mate some forgers skulking in a borrowed name whom tyburns dangling halter yet may claim some waneyed exiles wealth and sorrows heir who sought a lone retreat for tears and prayer some brooding poets sure of deathless fame had not his epic perished in the flame or some gray wooers whom a girlish frown chased from his solid friends and sober town or some plain tradesmans fond of shade and ease who sought them both beneath these quiet trees why question mutes no question can unlock dumb as the legend on the dighton rock one thing at least these ruined heaps declare they were a shelter once a man lived there but where the charred and crumbling records fail some breathing lips may piece the halftold tale no man may live with neighbors such as these though girt with walls of rock and angry seas and shield his home his children or his wife his ways his means his vote his creed his life from the dread sovereignty of ears and eyes and the small member that beneath them lies they told strange things of that mysterious man believe who will deny them such as can why should we fret if every passing sail had its old seaman talking on the rail the deepsunk schooner stuffed with eastern lime slow wedging on as if the waves were slime the knifeedged clipper with her ruffled spars the pawing steamer with her inane of stars the bullbrowed galliot butting through the stream the widesailed yacht that slipped along her beam the deckpiled sloops the pinched chebaccoboats the frigate black with thunderfreighted throats all had their talk about the lonely man and thus in varying phrase the story ran his name had cost him little care to seek plain honest brief a decent name to speak common not vulgar just the kind that slips with least suggestion from a strangers lips his birthplace england as his speech might show or his hale cheek that wore the redstreaks glow his mouth sharpmoulded in its mirth or scorn there came a flash as from the milky corn when from the ear you rip the rustling sheath and the white ridges show their even teeth his stature moderate but his strength confessed in spite of broadcloth by his ample breast fullarmed thickhanded one that had been strong and might be dangerous still if things went wrong he lived at ease beneath his elmtrees shade did naught for gain yet all his debts were paid rich so t was thought but careful of his store had all he needed claimed to have no more but some that lingered round the isle at night spoke of strange stealthy doings in their sight of creeping lonely visits that he made to nooks and corners with a torch and spade some said they saw the hollow of a cave one given to fables swore it was a grave whereat some shuddered others boldly cried those prowling boatmen lied and knew they lied they said his house was framed with curious cares lest some old friend might enter unawares that on the platform at his chambers door hinged a loose square that opened through the floor touch the black silken tassel next the bell down with a crash the flapping trapdoor fell three stories deep the falling wretch would strike to writhe at leisure on a boarders pike by day armed always doublearmed at night his tools lay round him wake him such as might a carbine hung beside his india fan his hand could reach a turkish ataghan pistols with quaintcarved stocks and barrels gilt crossed a long dagger with a jewelled hilt a slashing cutlass stretched along the bed all this was what those lying boatmen said then some were full of wondrous stories told of great oak chests and cupboards full of gold of the wedged ingots and the silver bars that cost old pirates ugly sabrescars how his laced wallet often would disgorge the freshfaced guinea of an english george or sweated ducat palmed by jews of yore or double joe or portuguese moidore and how his finger wore a rubied ring fit for the whitenecked playgirl of a king but these fine legends told with staring eyes met with small credence from the old and wise why tell each idle guess each whisper vain enough the scorched and cindered beams remain he came a silent pilgrim to the west some oldworld mystery throbbing in his breast close to the thronging mart he dwelt alone he lived he died the rest is all unknown stranger whose eyes the shadowy isle survey as the black steamer dashes through the bay why ask his buried secret to divine he was thy brother speak and tell us thine silence at first a kind of spellbound pause then all the teacups tinkled their applause when that was hushed no sound the stillness broke till once again the softvoiced lady spoke the lovers secret surely that must need the youngest voice our table holds to read which of our two annexes shall we choose either were charming neither will refuse but choose we must what better can we do than take the younger of the youthful two true to the primal instinct of her sex why that means me half whispered each annex what if it does the voiceless question came that set those pale new england cheeks aflame our oldworld scholar may have ways to teach of oxford english britains purest speech she shall be youngest youngest for today our dates well fix hereafter as we may all rights reserved the words we know so well that guard the claims of books which never sell the british maiden bowed a pleased assent her two long ringlets swinging as she bent the glistening eyes her eager soul looked through betrayed her lineage in their saxon blue backward she flung each too obtrusive curl and thus began the roselipped english girl the lovers secret what ailed young lucius art had vainly tried to guess his ill and found herself defied the augur plied his legendary skill useless the fair young roman languished still his chariot took him every cloudless day along the pincian hill or appian way they rubbed his wasted limbs with sulphurous oil oozed from the faroff orients heated soil they led him tottering down the steamy path where bubbling fountains filled the thermal bath borne in his litter to egerias cave they washed him shivering in her icy wave they sought all curious herbs and costly stones they scraped the moss that grew on dead mens bones they tried all cures the votive tablets taught scoured every place whence healing drugs were brought oer thracian hills his breathless couriers ran his slaves waylaid the syrian caravan at last a servant heard a stranger speak a new chirurgeons name a clever greek skilled in his art from pergamus he came to rome but lately galen was the name the greek was called a man with piercing eyes who must be cunning and who might be wise he spoke but little if they pleased he said he d wait awhile beside the sufferers bed so by his side he sat serene and calm his very accents soft as healing balm not curious seemed but every movement spied his sharp eyes searching where they seemed to glide asked a few questions what he felt and where a pain just here a constant beating there who ordered bathing for his aches and ails charmis the waterdoctor from marseilles what was the last prescription in his case a draught of wine with powdered chrysoprase had he no secret grief he nursed alone a pause a little tremor

crassus was missed next morning by his set next week the fishers found him in their net she with the others paced the ample hall fairest alas and saddest of them all at length the greek declared with puzzled face some strange enchantment mingled in the case and naught would serve to act as countercharm save a warm bracelet from a maidens arm not every maidens many might be tried which not in vain experience must decide were there no damsels willing to attend and do such service for a suffering friend the message passed among the waiting crowd first in a whisper then proclaimed aloud some wore

bravo annex they shouted every one not mrs kembles self had better done quite so she stammered in her awkward way not just the thing but something she must say the teaspoon chorus tinkled to its close when from his chair the man of law arose called by her voice whose mandate all obeyed and took the open volume she displayed tall stately strong his form begins to own some slight exuberance in its central zone that comely fulness of the growing girth which fifty summers lend the sons of earth a smooth round disk about whose margin stray above the temples glistening threads of gray strong deepcut grooves by toilsome decades wrought on brow and mouth the battlefields of thought a voice that lingers in the listeners ear grave calm farreaching every accent clear those tones resistless many a foreman knew that shaped their verdict ere the twelve withdrew a statesmans forehead athletes throat and jaw such the proud semblance of the man of law his eye just lighted on the printed leaf held as a practised pleader holds his brief one whispered softly from behind his cup he does not read his book is wrong side up he knows the story that it holds by heart so like his own how well hell act his part then all were silent not a rustling fan stirred the deep stillness as the voice began the statesmans secret who of all statesmen is his countrys pride her councils prompter and her leaders guide he speaks the nation holds its breath to hear he nods and shakes the sunset hemisphere born where the primal fount of nature springs by the rude cradles of her throneless kings in his proud eye her royal signet flames by his own lips her monarch she proclaims why name his countless triumphs whom to meet is to be famous envied in defeat the keen debaters trained to brawls and strife who fire one shot and finish with the knife tried him but once and cowering in their shame ground their hacked blades to strike at meaner game the lordly chief his partys central stay whose lightest word a hundred votes obey found a new listener seated at his side looked in his eye and felt himself defied flung his rash gauntlet on the startled floor met the allconquering fought and ruled no more see where he moves what eager crowds attend what shouts of thronging multitudes ascend if this is life to mark with every hour the purple deepening in his robes of power to see the painted fruits of honor fall thick at his feet and choose among them all to hear the sounds that shape his spreading name peal through the myriad organstops of fame stamp the lone isle that spots the seamans chart and crown the pillared glory of the mart to count as peers the few supremely wise who mark their planet in the angels eyes if this is life what savage man is he who strides alone beside the sounding sea alone he wanders by the murmuring shore his thoughts as restless as the waves that roar looks on the sullen sky as stormybrowed as on the waves yon tempestbrooding cloud heaves from his aching breast a wailing sigh sad as the gust that sweeps the clouded sky ask him his griefs what midnight demons plough the lines of torture on his lofty brow unlock those marble lips and bid them speak the mystery freezing in his bloodless cheek his secret hid beneath a flimsy word one foolish whisper that ambition heard and thus it spake behold yon gilded chair the worlds one vacant throne thy plate is there ah fatal dream what warning spectres meet in ghastly circle round its shadowy seat yet still the tempter murmurs in his ear the maddening taunt he cannot choose but hear meanest of slaves by gods and men accurst he who is second when he might be first climb with bold front the ladders topmost round or chain thy creeping footsteps to the ground illustrious dupe have those majestic eyes lost their proud fire for such a vulgar prize art thou the last of all mankind to know that partyfights are won by aiming low thou stamped by nature with her royal sign that partyhirelings hate a look like thine

influence every listener owns where all the woman finds herself expressed and heavens divinest effluence breathes confessed such was the breath that wooed our ravished ears sweet as the voice a dreaming vestal hears soft as the murmur of a brooding dove it told the mystery of a mothers love the mothers secret how sweet the sacred legend if unblamed in my slight verse such holy things are named of marys secret hours of hidden joy silent but pondering on her wondrous boy ave maria pardon if i wrong those heavenly words that shame my earthly song the choral host had closed the angels strain sung to the listening watch on bethlehems plain and now the shepherds hastening on their way sought the still hamlet where the infant lay they passed the fields that gleaning ruth toiled oer they saw afar the ruined threshingfloor where moabs daughter homeless and forlorn found boaz slumbering by his heaps of corn and some remembered how the holy scribe skilled in the lore of every jealous tribe traced the warm blood of jesses royal son to that fair alien bravely wooed and won so fared they on to seek the promised sign that marked the anointed heir of davids line at last by forms of earthly semblance led they found the crowded inn the oxens shed no pomp was there no glory shone around on the coarse straw that strewed the reeking ground one dim retreat a flickering torch betrayed in that poor cell the lord of life was laid the wondering shepherds told their breathless tale of the bright choir that woke the sleeping vale told how the skies with sudden glory flamed told how the shining multitude proclaimed joy joy to earth behold the hallowed morn in davids city christ the lord is born glory to god let angels shout on high goodwill to men the listening earth reply they spoke with hurried words and accents wild calm in his cradle slept the heavenly child no trembling word the mothers joy revealed one sigh of rapture and her lips were sealed unmoved she saw the rustic train depart but kept their words to ponder in her heart twelve years had passed the boy was fair and tall growing in wisdom finding grace with all the maids of nazareth as they trooped to fill their balanced urns beside the mountain rill the gathered matrons as they sat and spun spoke in soft words of josephs quiet son no voice had reached the galilean vale of starled kings or awestruck shepherds tale in the meek studious child they only saw the future rabbi learned in israels law beyond the hills that girt the village green save when at midnight oer the starlit sands snatched from the steel of herods murdering bands a babe close folded to his mothers breast through edoms wilds he sought the sheltering west then joseph spake thy boy hath largely grown weave him fine raiment fitting to be shown fair robes beseem the pilgrim as the priest goes he not with us to the holy feast and mary culled the flaxen fibres white till eve she spun she spun till morning light the thread was twined its parting meshes through from hand to hand her restless shuttle flew till the full web was wound upon the beam loves curious toil a vest without a seam they reach the holy place fulfil the days to solemn feasting given and grateful praise at last they turn and far moriahs height melts in the southern sky and fades from sight all day the dusky caravan has flowed in devious trails along the winding road for many a step their homeward path attends and all the sons of abraham are as friends evening has come the hour of rest and joy hush hush that whisper where is marys boy oh weary hour oh aching days that passed filled with strange fears each wilder than the last the soldiers lance the fierce centurions sword the crushing wheels that whirl some roman lord the midnight crypt that sucks the captives breath the blistering sun on hinnoms vale of death thrice on his cheek had rained the morning light thrice on his lips the mildewed kiss of night crouched by a sheltering columns shining plinth or stretched beneath the odorous terebinth at last in desperate mood they sought once more the temples porches searched in vain before they found him seated with the ancient men the grim old rufflers of the tongue and pen their bald heads glistening as they clustered near their gray beards slanting as they turned to hear lost in halfenvious wonder and surprise that lips so fresh should utter words so wise and mary said as one who tried too long tells all her grief and half her sense of wrong what is this thoughtless thing which thou hast done lo we have sought thee sorrowing o my son few words he spake and scarce of filial tone strange words their sense a mystery yet unknown then turned with them and left the holy hill to all their mild commands obedient still the tale was told to nazareths sober men and nazareths matrons told it oft again the maids retold it at the fountains side the youthful shepherds doubted or denied it passed around among the listening friends with all that fancy adds and fiction lends till newer marvels dimmed the young renown of josephs son who talked the rabbis down but mary faithful to its lightest word kept in her heart the sayings she had heard till the dread morning rent the temples veil and shuddering earth confirmed the wondrous tale youth fades love droops the leaves of friendship fall a mothers secret hope outlives them all hushed was the voice but still its accents thrilled the throbbing hearts its lingering sweetness filled the simple story which a tear repays asks not to share the noisy breath of praise a trancelike stillness scarce a whisper heard no tinkling teaspoon in its saucer stirred a deepdrawn sigh that would not be suppressed a sob a lifted kerchief told the rest come now dictator so the lady spoke you too must fit your shoulder to the yoke youll find theres something doubtless if you look to serve your purpose so now take the book ah my dear lady you must know full well story god bless

sweeping equatorial pries through every worldsown corner of the skies to the far orb that so remotely strays our midnight darkness is its noonday blaze in vain the climbing soul of creeping man metes

unanswered cry are all these worlds that speed their circling flight dumb vacant soulless baubles of the night warmed with gods smile and wafted by his breath to weave in ceaseless round the dance of

reveal one awful word beneath the futures seal what thou shalt tell us grant us strength to bear what thou withholdest is thy single care not for ourselves the present clings too fast moored to the mighty anchors of the past but when with angry snap some cable parts the sound reechoing in our startled hearts when through the wall that clasps the harbor round and shuts the raving ocean from its bound shattered and rent by sacrilegious hands the first mad billow leaps upon the sands then to the futures awful page we turn and what we question hardly dare to learn still let us hope for while we seem to tread the timeworn pathway of the nations dead though sparta laughs at all our warlike deeds and buried athens claims our stolen creeds though rome a spectre on her broken throne beholds our

haste shall spot with banditcrime our destined empire snatched before its time wait wait undoubting for the winds have caught from our bold speech the heritage of thought no marble form that sculptured truth can wear vies with the image shaped in viewless air and thought unfettered grows through speech to deeds as the broad forest marches in its seeds what though we perish ere the day is

the oldest portfolio from the collegian illustrated annuals etc nescit vox missa reverti horat ars poetica ab lis qua non adjuvant quam mollissime oportet pedem referre quintillian l vi c these verses have always been printed in my collected poems and as the best of them may bear a single reading i allow them to appear but in a less conspicuous position than the other productions a chick before his shell is off his back is hardly a fair subject for severe criticism if one has written anything worth preserving his first efforts may be objects of interest and curiosity other young authors may take encouragement from seeing how tame how feeble how commonplace were the rudimentary attempts of the halffledged poet if the boy or youth had anything in him there will probably be some sign of it in the midst of his imitative mediocrities and ambitious failures these first verses of mine written before i was sixteen have little beyond a common academy boys ordinary performance yet a kindly critic said there was one line which showed a poetical quality the boiling ocean trembled into calm one of these poems the reader may guess which won fair words from thackeray the spectre pig was a wicked suggestion which came into my head after reading danas buccaneer nobody seemed to find it out and i never mentioned it to the venerable poet who might not have been pleased with the parody this is enough to say of these unvalued copies of verses first verses phillips academy andover mass or translation from the eneid book i the god looked out upon the troubled deep waked into tumult from its placid sleep the flame of anger kindles in his eye as the wild waves ascend the lowering sky he lifts his head above their awful height and to the distant fleet directs his sight now borne aloft upon the billows crest struck by the bolt or by the winds oppressed and well he knew that junos vengeful ire frowned from those clouds and sparkled in that fire on rapid pinions as they whistled by he calls swift zephyrus and eurus nigh is this your glory in a noble line to leave your confines and to ravage mine whom i but let these troubled waves subside another tempest and i quell your pride go bear our message to your masters ear that wide as ocean i am despot here let him sit monarch in his barren caves i wield the trident and control the waves he said and as the gathered vapors break the swelling ocean seemed a peaceful lake to lift their ships the graceful nymphs essayed and the strong trident lent its powerful aid the dangerous banks are sunk beneath the main and the light chariot skims the unruffled plain as when sedition fires the public mind and maddening fury leads the rabble blind the blazing torch lights up the dread alarm rage points the steel and fury nerves the arm then if some reverend sage appear in sight they stand they gaze and check their headlong flight he turns the current of each wandering breast and hushes every passion into rest thus by the power of his imperial arm the boiling ocean trembled into calm with flowing reins the father sped his way and smiled serene upon rekindled day the meeting of the dryads written after a general pruning of the trees around harvard college a little poem on a similar occasion may be found in the works of swift from which perhaps the idea was borrowed although i was as much surprised as amused to meet with it some time after writing the following lines it was not many centuries since when gathered on the moonlit green beneath the tree of liberty a ring of weeping sprites was seen the freshmans lamp had long been dim the voice of busy day was mute and tortured melody had ceased her sufferings on the evening flute they met not as they once had met to laugh oer many a jocund tale but every pulse was beating low and every cheek was cold and pale there rose a fair but faded one who oft had cheered them with her song she waved a mutilated arm and silence held the listening throng sweet friends the gentle nymph began from opening bud to withering leaf one common lot has bound us all in every change of joy and grief while all around has felt decay we rose in everliving prime with broader shade and fresher green beneath the crumbling step of time when often by our feet has past some biped natures walking whim say have we trimmed one awkward shape or lopped away one crooked limb go on fair science soon to thee shall nature yield her idle boast her vulgar fingers formed a tree but thou halt trained it to a post go paint the birchs silver rind and quilt the peach with softer down up with the willows trailing threads off with the sunflowers radiant crown go plant the lily on the shore and set the rose among the waves and bid the tropic bud unbind its silken zone in arctic caves bring bellows for the panting winds hang up a lantern by the moon and give the nightingale a fife and lend the eagle a balloon i cannot smile the tide of scorn that rolled through every bleeding vein comes kindling fiercer as it flows back to its burning source again again in every quivering leaf that moments agony i feel when limbs that spurned the northern blast shrunk from the sacrilegious steel a curse upon the wretch who dared to crop us with his felon saw may every fruit his lip shall taste lie like a bullet in his maw in every julep that he drinks may gout and bile and headache be and when he strives to calm his pain may colic mingle with his tea may nightshade cluster round his path and thistles shoot and brambles cling may blistering ivy scorch his veins and dogwood burn and nettles sting on him may never shadow fall when fever racks his throbbing brow and his last shilling buy a rope to hang him on my highest bough she spoke the mornings herald beam sprang from the bosom of the sea and every mangled sprite returned in sadness to her wounded tree the mysterious visitor there was a sound of hurrying feet a tramp on echoing stairs there was a rush along the aisles it was the hour of prayers and on like oceans midnight wave the current rolled along when suddenly a stranger form was seen amidst the throng he was a dark and swarthy man that uninvited guest a faded coat of bottlegreen was buttoned round his breast there was not one among them all could say from whence he came nor beardless boy nor ancient man could tell that strangers name all silent as the sheeted dead in spite of sneer and frown fast by a grayhaired seniors side he sat him boldly down there was a look of horror flashed from out the tutors eyes when all around him rose to pray the stranger did not rise a murmur broke along the crowd the prayer was at an end with ringing heels and measured tread a hundred forms descend through sounding aisle oer grating stair the long procession poured till all were gathered on the seats around the commons board that fearful stranger down he sat unasked yet undismayed and on his lip a rising smile of scorn or pleasure played he took his hat and hung it up with slow but earnest air he stripped his coat from off his back and placed it on a chair then from his nearest neighbors side a knife and plate he drew and reaching out his hand again he took his teacup too how fled the sugar from the bowl how sunk the azure cream they vanished like the shapes that float upon a summers dream a long long draught an outstretched hand and crackers toast and tea they faded from the strangers touch like dew upon the sea then clouds were dark on many a brow fear sat upon their souls and in a bitter agony they clasped their buttered rolls a whisper trembled through the crowd who could the stranger be and some were silent for they thought a cannibal was he what if the creature should arise for he was stout and tall and swallow down a sophomore coat crowsfoot cap and all all sullenly the stranger rose they sat in mute despair he took his hat from off the peg his coat from off the chair four freshmen fainted on the seat six swooned upon the floor yet on the fearful being passed and shut the chapel door there is full many a starving man that walks in bottle green but never more that hungry one in commons hall was seen yet often at the sunset hour when tolls the evening bell the freshman lingers on the steps that frightful tale to tell the toadstool there s a thing that grows by the fainting flower and springs in the shade of the ladys bower the lily shrinks and the rose turns pale when they feel its breath in the summer gale and the tulip curls its leaves in pride and the blueeyed violet starts aside but the lily may flaunt and the tulip stare for what does the honest toadstool care she does not glow in a painted vest and she never blooms on the maidens breast but she comes as the saintly sisters do in a modest suit of a quaker hue and when the stars in the evening skies are weeping dew from their gentle eyes the toad comes out from his hermit cell the tale of his faithful love to tell oh there is light in her lovers glance that flies to her heart like a silver lance his breeches are made of spotted skin his jacket is tight and his pumps are thin in a cloudless night you may hear his song as its pensive melody floats along and if you will look by the moonlight fair the trembling form of the toad is there and he twines his arms round her slender stem in the shade of her velvet diadem but she turns away in her maiden shame and will not breathe on the kindling flame he sings at her feet through the livelong night and creeps to his cave at the break of light and whenever he comes to the air above his throat is swelling with baffled love the spectre pig a ballad it was the stalwart butcher man that knit his swarthy brow and said the gentle pig must die and sealed it with a vow and oh it was the gentle pig lay stretched upon the ground and ah it was the cruel knife his little heart that found they took him then those wicked men they trailed him all along they put a stick between his lips and through his heels a thong and round and round an oaken beam a hempen cord they flung and like a mighty pendulum all solemnly he swung now say thy prayers thou sinful man and think what thou hast done and read thy catechism well thou bloodyminded one for if his sprite should walk by night it better were for thee that thou wert mouldering in the ground or bleaching in the sea it was the savage butcher then that made a mock of sin and swore a very wicked oath he did not care a pin it was the butchers youngest son his voice was broke with sighs and with his pockethandkerchief he wiped his little eyes all young and ignornt was he but innocent and mild and in his soft simplicity out spoke the tender child oh father father list to me the pig is deadly sick and men have hung him by his heels and fed him with a stick it was the bloody butcher then that laughed as he would die yet did he soothe the sorrowing child and bid him not to cry oh nathan nathan whats a pig that thou shouldst weep and wail come bear thee like a butchers child and thou shalt have his tail it was the butchers daughter then so slender and so fair that sobbed as it her heart would break and tore her yellow hair and thus she spoke in thrilling tone fast fell the teardrops big ah woe is me alas alas the pig the pig the pig then did her wicked fathers lips make merry with her woe and call her many a naughty name because she whimpered so ye need not weep ye gentle ones in vain your tears are shed ye cannot wash his crimson hand ye cannot soothe the dead the bright sun folded on his breast his robes of rosy flame and softly over all the west the shades of evening came he slept and troops of murdered pigs were busy with his dreams loud rang their wild unearthly shrieks wide yawned their mortal seams the clock struck twelve the dead hath heard he opened both his eyes and sullenly he shook his tail to lash the feeding flies one quiver of the hempen cord one struggle and one bound with stiffened limb and leaden eye the pig was on the ground and straight towards the sleepers house his fearful way he wended and hooting owl and hovering bat on midnight wing attended back flew the bolt up rose the latch and open swung the door and little mincing feet were heard pat pat along the floor two hoofs upon the sanded floor and two upon the bed and they are breathing side by side the living and the dead now wake now wake thou butcher man what makes thy cheek so pale take hold take hold thou dost not fear to clasp a spectres tail untwisted every winding coil the shuddering wretch took hold all like an icicle it seemed so tapering and so cold thou comst with me thou butcher man he strives to loose his grasp but faster than the clinging vine those twining spirals clasp and open open swung the door and fleeter than the wind the shadowy spectre swept before the butcher trailed behind fast fled the darkness of the night and morn rose faint and dim they called full loud they knocked full long they did not waken him straight straight towards that oaken beam a trampled pathway ran a ghastly shape was swinging there it was the butcher man to a caged lion poor conquered monarch though that haughty glance still speaks thy courage unsubdued by time and in the grandeur of thy sullen tread lives the proud spirit of thy burning clime fettered by things that shudder at thy roar torn from thy pathless wilds to pace this narrow floor thou wast the victor and all nature shrunk before the thunders of thine awful wrath the steelarmed hunter viewed thee from afar fearless and trackless in thy lonely path the famished tiger closed his flaming eye and crouched and panted as thy step went by thou art the vanquished and insulting man bars thy broad bosom as a sparrows wing his nerveless arms thine iron sinews bind and lead in chains the deserts fallen king are these the beings that have dared to twine their feeble threads around those limbs of thine so must it be the weaker wiser race that wields the tempest and that rides the sea even in the stillness of thy solitude must teach the lesson of its power to thee and thou the terror of the trembling wild must bow thy savage strength the mockery of a child the star and the waterlily the sun stepped down from his golden throne and lay in the silent sea and the lily had folded her satin leaves for a sleepy thing was she what is the lily dreaming of why crisp the waters blue see see she is lifting her varnished lid her white leaves are glistening through the rose is cooling his burning cheek in the lap of the breathless tide the lily hath sisters fresh and fair that would lie by the roses side he would love her better than all the rest and he would be fond and true but the lily unfolded her weary lids and looked at the sky so blue remember remember thou silly one how fast will thy summer glide and wilt thou wither a virgin pale or flourish a blooming bride oh the rose is old and thorny and cold and he lives on earth said she but the star is fair and he lives in the air and he shall my bridegroom be but what if the stormy cloud should come and ruffle the silver sea would he turn his eye from the distant sky to smile on a thing like thee oh no fair lily he will not send one ray from his faroff throne the winds shall blow and the waves shall flow and thou wilt be left alone there is not a leaf on the mountaintop nor a drop of evening dew nor a golden sand on the sparkling shore nor a pearl in the waters blue that he has not cheered with his fickle smile and warmed with his faithless beam and will he be true to a pallid flower that floats on the quiet stream alas for the lily she would not heed but turned to the skies afar and bared her breast to the trembling ray that shot from the rising star the cloud came over the darkened sky and over the waters wide she looked in vain through the beating rain and sank in the stormy tide illustration of a picture a spanish girl in reverie she twirled the string of golden beads that round her neck was hung my grandsires gift the good old man loved girls when he was young and bending lightly oer the cord and turning half away with something like a youthful sigh thus spoke the maiden gray well one may trail her silken robe and bind her locks with pearls and one may wreathe the woodland rose among her floating curls and one may tread the dewy grass and one the marble floor nor halfhid bosom heave the less nor broidered corset more some years ago a darkeyed girl was sitting in the shade theres something brings her to my mind in that young dreaming maid and in her hand she held a flower a flower whose speaking hue said in the language of the heart believe the giver true and as she looked upon its leaves the maiden made a vow to wear it when the bridal wreath was woven for her brow she watched the flower as day by day the leaflets curled and died but he who gave it never came to claim her for his bride oh many a summers morning glow has lent the rose its ray and many a winters drifting snow has swept its bloom away but she has kept that faithless pledge to this her winter hour and keeps it still herself alone and wasted like the flower her pale lip quivered and the light gleamed in her moistening eyes i asked her how she liked the tints in those castilian skies she thought them misty t was perhaps because she stood too near she turned away and as she turned i saw her wipe a tear a roman aqueduct the sunbrowned girl whose limbs recline when noon her languid hand has laid hot on the green flakes of the pine beneath its narrow disk of shade as through the flickering noontide glare she gazes on the rainbow chain of arches lifting once in air the rivers of the romans plain say does her wandering eye recall the mountaincurrents icy wave or for the dead one tear let fall whose founts are broken by their grave from stone to stone the ivy weaves her braided tracerys winding veil and lacing stalks and tangled leaves nod heavy in the drowsy gale and lightly floats the pendent vine that swings beneath her slender bow arch answering arch whose rounded line seems mirrored in the wreath below how patient nature smiles at fame the weeds that strewed the victors way feed on his dust to shroud his name green where his proudest towers decay see through that channel empty now the scanty rain its tribute pours which cooled the lip and laved the brow of conquerors from a hundred shores thus bending oer the nations bier whose wants the captive earth supplied the dew of memorys passing tear falls on the arches of her pride from a bachelors private journal sweet mary i have never breathed the love it were in vain to name though round my heart a serpent wreathed i smiled or strove to smile the same once more the pulse of nature glows with faster throb and fresher fire while music round her pathway flows like echoes from a hidden lyre and is there none with me to share the glories of the earth and sky the eagle through the pathless air is followed by one burning eye ah no the cradled flowers may wake again may flow the frozen sea from every cloud a star may break there conies no second spring to me go ere the painted toys of youth are crushed beneath the tread of years ere visions have been chilled to truth and hopes are washed away in tears go for i will not bid thee weep too soon my sorrows will be thine and evenings troubled air shall sweep the incense from the broken shrine if heaven can hear the dying tone of chords that soon will cease to thrill the prayer that heaven has heard alone may bless thee when those chords are still la grisette as clemence when i saw thee last trip down the rue de seine and turning when thy form had past i said we meet again i dreamed not in that idle glance thy latest image came and only left to memorys trance a shadow and a name the few strange words my lips had taught thy timid voice to speak their gentler signs which often brought fresh roses to thy cheek the trailing of thy long loose hair bent oer my couch of pain all all returned more sweet more fair oh had we met again i walked where saint and virgin keep the vigil lights of heaven i knew that thou hadst woes to weep and sins to be forgiven i watched where genevieve was laid i knelt by marys shrine beside me low soft voices prayed alas but where was thine and when the morning sun was bright when wind and wave were calm and flamed in thousandtinted light the rose of notre dame i wandered through the haunts of men from boulevard to quai till frowning oer saint etienne the pantheons shadow lay in vain in vain we meet no more nor dream what fates befall and long upon the strangers shore my voice on thee may call when years have clothed the line in moss that tells thy name and days and withered on thy simple cross the wreaths of perelachaise our yankee girls let greener lands and bluer skies if such the wide earth shows with fairer cheeks and brighter eyes match us the star and rose the winds that lift the georgians veil or wave circassias curls waft to their shores the sultans sail who buys our yankee girls the gay grisette whose fingers touch loves thousand chords so well the dark italian loving much but more than one can tell and englands fairhaired blueeyed dame who binds her brow with pearls ye who have seen them can they shame our own sweet yankee girls and what if court or castle vaunt its children loftier born who heeds the silken tassels flaunt beside the golden corn they ask not for the dainty toil of ribboned knights and earls the daughters of the virgin soil our freeborn yankee girls by every hill whose stately pines wave their dark arms above the home where some fair being shines to warm the wilds with love from barest rock to bleakest shore where farthest sail unfurls that stars and stripes are streaming oer god bless our yankee girls linconnue is thy name mary maiden fair such should methinks its music be the sweetest name that mortals bear were best befitting thee and she to whom it once was given was half of earth and half of heaven i hear thy voice i see thy smile i look upon thy folded hair ah while we dream not they beguile our hearts are in the snare and she who chains a wild birds wing must start not if her captive sing so lady take the leaf that falls to all but thee unseen unknown when evening shades thy silent walls then read it all alone in stillness read in darkness seal forget despise but not reveal stanzas strange that one lightly whispered tone is far far sweeter unto me than all the sounds that kiss the earth or breathe along the sea but lady when thy voice i greet not heavenly music seems so sweet i look upon the fair blue skies and naught but empty air i see but when i turn me to thin eyes it seemeth unto me ten thousand angels spread their wings within those little azure rings the lily bath the softest leaf that ever western breeze bath fanned but thou shalt have the tender flower so i may take thy hand that little hand to me doth yield more joy than all the broidered field o lady there be many things that seem right fair below above but sure not one among them all is half so sweet as love let us not pay our vows alone but join two altars both in one lines by a clerk oh i did love her dearly and gave her toys and rings and i thought she meant sincerely when she took my pretty things but her heart has grown as icy as a fountain in the fall and her love that was so spicy it did not last at all i gave her once a locket it was filled with my own hair and she put it in her pocket with very special care but a jeweller has got it he offered it to me and another that is not it around her neck i see for my cooings and my billings i do not now complain but my dollars and my shillings will never come again they were earned with toil and sorrow but i never told her that and now i have to borrow and want another hat think think thou cruel emma when thou shalt hear my woe and know my sad dilemma that thou hast made it so see see my beaver rusty look look upon this hole this coat is dim and dusty oh let it rend thy soul before the gates of fashion i daily bent my knee but i sought the shrine of passion and found my idol thee though never love intenser had bowed a soul before it thine eye was on the censer and not the hand that bore it the philosopher to his love dearest a look is but a ray reflected in a certain way a word whatever tone it wear is but a trembling wave of air a touch obedience to a clause in natures pure material laws the very flowers that bend and meet in sweetening others grow more sweet the clouds by day the stars by night inweave their floating locks of light the rainbow heavens own foreheads braid is but the embrace of sun and shade oh in the hour when i shall feel those shadows round my senses steal when gentle eyes are weeping oer the clay that feels their tears no more then let thy spirit with me be or some sweet angel likest thee how few that love us have we found how wide the world that girds them round like mountain streams we meet and part each living in the others heart our course unknown our hope to be yet mingled in the distant sea but ocean coils and heaves in vain bound in the subtle moonbeams chain and love and hope do but obey some cold capricious planets ray which lights and leads the tide it charms to deaths dark caves and icy arms alas one narrow line is drawn that links our sunset with our dawn in mist and shade lifes morning rose and clouds are round it at its close but ah no twilight beam ascends to whisper where that evening ends the poets lot what is a poets love to write a girl a sonnet to get a ring or some such thing and fustianize upon it what is a poets fame sad hints about his reason and sadder praise from garreteers to be returned in season where go the poets lines answer ye evening tapers ye auburn locks ye golden curls speak from your folded papers child of the ploughshare smile boy of the counter grieve not though muses round thy trundlebed their broidered tissue weave not the poets future holds no civic wreath above him nor slated roof nor varnished chaise nor wife nor child to love him maid of the village inn who workest woe on satin the grass in black the graves in green the epitaph in latin trust not to them who say in stanzas they adore thee oh rather sleep in churchyard clay with urn and cherub oer thee to a blank sheet of paper wanvisaged thing thy virgin leaf to me looks more than deadly pale unknowing what may stain thee yet a poem or a tale who can thy unborn meaning scan can seer or sibyl read thee now no seek to trace the fate of man writ on his infant brow love may light on thy snowy cheek and shake his edenbreathing plumes then shalt thou tell how lelia smiles or angelina blooms satire may lift his bearded lance forestalling times slowmoving scythe and scattered on thy little field disjointed bards may writhe perchance a vision of the night some grizzled spectre gaunt and thin or sheeted corpse may stalk along or skeleton may grin if it should be in pensive hour some sorrowmoving theme i try ah maiden how thy tears will fall for all i doom to die but if in merry mood i touch thy leaves then shall the sight of thee sow smiles as thick on rosy lips as ripples on the sea the weekly press shall gladly stoop to bind thee up among its sheaves the daily steal thy shining ore to gild its leaden leaves thou hast no tongue yet thou canst speak till distant shores shall hear the sound thou hast no life yet thou canst breathe fresh life on all around thou art the arena of the wise the noiseless battleground of fame the sky where halos may be wreathed around the humblest name take then this treasure to thy trust to win some idle readers smile then fade and moulder in the dust or swell some bonfires pile to the portrait of a gentleman in the athenieum gallery it may be so perhaps thou hast a warm and loving heart i will not blame thee for thy face poor devil as thou art that thing thou fondly deemst a nose unsightly though it be in spite of all the cold worlds scorn it may be much to thee those eyes among thine elder friends perhaps they pass for blue no matter if a man can see what more have eyes to do thy mouth that fissure in thy face by something like a chin may be a very useful place to put thy victual in i know thou hast a wife at home i know thou hast a child by that subdued domestic smile upon thy features mild that wife sits fearless by thy side that cherub on thy knee they do not shudder at thy looks they do not shrink from thee above thy mantel is a hook a portrait once was there it was thine only ornament alas that hook is bare she begged thee not to let it go she begged thee all in vain she wept and breathed a trembling prayer to meet it safe again it was a bitter sight to see that picture torn away it was a solemn thought to think what all her friends would say and often in her calmer hours and in her happy dreams upon its longdeserted hook the absent portrait seems thy wretched infant turns his head in melancholy wise and looks to meet the placid stare of those unbending eyes i never saw thee lovely one perchance i never may it is not often that we cross such people in our way but if we meet in distant years or on some foreign shore sure i can take my bible oath ive seen that face before the ballad of the oysterman it was a tall young oysterman lived by the riverside his shop was just upon the bank his boat was on the tide the daughter of a fisherman that was so straight and slim lived over on the other bank right opposite to him it was the pensive oysterman that saw a lovely maid upon a moonlight evening a sitting in the shade he saw her wave her handkerchief as much as if to say i m wide awake young oysterman and all the folks away then up arose the oysterman and to himself said he i guess i ll leave the skiff at home for fear that folks should see i read it in the storybook that for to kiss his dear leander swam the hellespont and i will swim this here and he has leaped into the waves and crossed the shining stream and he has clambered up the bank all in the moonlight gleam oh there were kisses sweet as dew and words as soft as rain but they have heard her fathers step and in he leaps again out spoke the ancient fisherman oh what was that my daughter t was nothing but a pebble sir i threw into the water and what is that pray tell me love that paddles off so fast its nothing but a porpoise sir that s been a swimming past out spoke the ancient fisherman now bring me my harpoon ill get into my fishingboat and fix the fellow soon down fell that pretty innocent as falls a snowwhite lamb her hair drooped round her pallid cheeks like seaweed on a clam alas for those two loving ones she waked not from her swound and he was taken with the cramp and in the waves was drowned but fate has metamorphosed them in pity of their woe and now they keep an oystershop for mermaids down below a noontide lyric the dinnerbell the dinnerbell is ringing loud and clear through hill and plain through street and lane it echoes far and near from curtained hall and whitewashed stall wherever men can hide like bursting waves from ocean caves they float upon the tide i smell the smell of roasted meat i hear the hissing fry the beggars know where they can go but where oh where shall i at twelve oclock men took my hand at two they only stare and eye me with a fearful look as if i were a bear the poet lays his laurels down and hastens to his greens the happy tailor quits his goose to riot on his beans the weary cobbler snaps his thread the printer leaves his pi his very devil hath a home but what oh what have i methinks i hear an angel voice that softly seems to say pale stranger all may yet be well then wipe thy tears away erect thy head and cock thy hat and follow me afar and thou shalt have a jolly meal and charge it at the bar i hear the voice i go i go prepare your meat and wine they little heed their future need who pay not when they dine give me today the rosy bowl give me one golden dream tomorrow kick away the stool and dangle from the beam the hot season the folks that on the first of may wore winter coats and hose began to say the first of june good lord how hot it grows at last two fahrenheits blew up and killed two children small and one barometer shot dead a tutor with its ball now all day long the locusts sang among the leafless trees three new hotels warped inside out the pumps could only wheeze and ripe old wine that twenty years had cobwebbed oer in vain came spouting through the rotten corks like jolys best champagne the worcester locomotives did their trip in half an hour the lowell cars ran forty miles before they checked the power roll brimstone soon became a drug and locofocos fell all asked for ice but everywhere saltpetre was to sell plump men of mornings ordered tights but ere the scorching noons their candlemoulds had grown as loose as cossack pantaloons the dogs ran mad men could not try if water they would choose a horse fell dead he only left four redhot rusty shoes but soon the people could not bear the slightest hint of fire allusions to caloric drew a flood of savage ire the leaves on heat were all torn out from every book at school and many blackguards kicked and caned because they said keep cool the gaslight companies were mobbed the bakers all were shot the penny press began to talk of lynching doctor nott and all about the warehouse steps were angry men in droves crashing and splintering through the doors to smash the patent stoves the abolition men and maids were tanned to such a hue you scarce could tell them from their friends unless their eyes were blue and when i left society had burst its ancient guards and brattle street and temple place were interchanging cards a portrait a still sweet placid moonlight face and slightly nonchalant which seems to claim a middle place between ones love and aunt where childhoods star has left a ray in womans sunniest sky as morning dew and blushing day on fruit and blossom lie and yet and yet i cannot love those lovely lines on steel they beam too much of heaven above earths darker shades to feel perchance some early weeds of care around my heart have grown and brows unfurrowed seem not fair because they mock my own alas when edens gates were sealed how oft some sheltered flower breathed oer the wanderers of the field like their own bridal bower yet saddened by its loveliness and humbled by its pride earths fairest child they could not bless it mocked them when they sighed an evening thought written at sea if sometimes in the dark blue eye or in the deep red wine or soothed by gentlest melody still warms this heart of mine yet something colder in the blood and calmer in the brain have whispered that my youths bright flood ebbs not to flow again if by helvetias azure lake or arnos yellow stream each star of memory could awake as in my first young dream i know that when mine eye shall greet the hillsides bleak and bare that gird my home it will not meet my childhoods sunsets there oh when loves first sweet stolen kiss burned on my boyish brow was that young forehead worn as this was that flushed cheek as now were that wild pulse and throbbing heart like these which vainly strive in thankless strains of soulless art to dream themselves alive alas the morning dew is gone gone ere the full of day lifes iron fetter still is on its wreaths all torn away happy if still some casual hour can warm the fading shrine too soon to chill beyond the power of love or song or wine the wasp and the hornet the two proud sisters of the sea in glory and in doom well may the eternal waters be their broad unsculptured tomb the wind that rings along the wave the clear unshadowed sun are torch and trumpet oer the brave whose last green wreath is won no strangerhand their banners furled no victors shout they heard unseen above them ocean curled safe by his own pale bird the gnashing billows heaved and fell wild shrieked the midnight gale far far beneath the morning swell were pennon spar and sail the land of freedom sea and shore are guarded now as when her ebbing waves to victory bore fair barks and gallant men oh many a ship of prouder name may wave her starry fold nor trail with deeper light of fame the paths they swept of old qui vive qui vive the sentrys musket rings the channelled bayonet gleams high oer him like a ravens wings the broad tricolored banner flings its shadow rustling as it swings pale in the moonlight beams pass on while steelclad sentries keep their vigil oer the monarchs sleep thy bare unguarded breast asks not the unbroken bristling zone that girds yon sceptred tremblers throne pass on and take thy rest qui vive how oft the midnight air that startling cry has borne how oft the evening breeze has fanned the banner of this haughty land oer mountain snow and desert sand ere yet its folds were torn through jenas carnage flying red or tossing oer marengos dead or curling on the towers where austrias eagle quivers yet and suns the ruffled plumage wet with battles crimson showers qui vive and is the sentrys cry the sleepless soldiers hand are these the painted folds that fly and lift their emblems printed high on morning mist and sunset sky the guardians of a land no if the patriots pulses sleep how vain the watch that hirelings keep the idle flag that waves when conquest with his iron heel
