carolyn keene stay tuned for danger chapter one вђњnancy youвђre driving me nuts would you please finish that sundae our plane leaves in an hourвђќ bess marvin looked longingly at her friendвђs dessert then she pulled a pink beret over her straw blond hair and reached for the matching pink jacket that was hanging on the back of her chair nancy drew looked at bess her blue eyes sparkling with amusement вђњtake it easy bess weвђre five minutes from the airport georgeвђll get us there in plenty of timeвђќ nancy and bess were flying to new york city to visit nancyвђs aunt eloise drew and george was dropping them off it was early so they had decided to stop for ice cream near the airport вђњadmit it bessвђќ george fayne said with a laugh throwing an arm around her cousinвђs shoulders вђњyouвђre just jealous because nancyвђs eating that fantastic splendiferous mouthwateringвђвђќ вђњmmmm and itвђs sooo goodвђќ nancy said licking her lips вђњquit teasing you guysвђќ bess muttered вђњi swear i gain weight just looking at something that fatteningвђќ вђњit does look goodвђќ george said wistfully agreeing she and bess were cousins as well as best friends but they couldnвђt have been more different with her tall athletic figure her dark hair and eyes and her levelheaded approach to life george was her cousinвђs opposite in every way вђњwhen you two get back from new york weвђve got to come here againвђќ george said вђњyou can fill me in on your trip and by then iвђll be able to order something disgustingly rich and gooey just like those banana splits we had at that wonderful restaurant rumpelmayerвђsвђќ george sighed вђњi wish i were going with youвђќ вђњiвђll never understand youвђќ said bess вђњhow can you pass up a chance to go to new york the most glamorous city in the world just so you can run in some stupid race whatвђs the big dealвђќ вђњdonвђt be dumb bess iвђve been training for this race for months it may only be the river heights marathon but itвђs important to meвђќ вђњyummmвђќ nancy savored one last mouthful of ice cream before putting down her spoon вђњokay iвђm readyвђќ she said with a toss of her reddish gold hair bess eyed the remains of nancyвђs sundae hungrily вђњnoвђќ she told herself вђњi refuse to blow my diet before we even get to new york i mean you never know who i might meetвђќ she said looking at her friends вђњin new york anythingвђs possibleвђќ nancy and george exchanged knowing smiles bess was sure to find cute guys in the big apple just as she did in river heights вђњwell if i know nancyвђќ george said вђњyou two will probably wind up in the middle of an adventure remember the last time we were in new york we didnвђt even have time to go shoppingвђќ george was right intrigue and mystery seemed to find nancy wherever she went at eighteen she was already a rising star in the world of detectives вђњno wayвђќ nancy protested вђњthis time iвђm just going to be a tourist iвђm going to spend some time with my aunt eloise do some shopping see a broadway showвђвђќ вђњa broadway show are you kidding there are at least six that iвђm dying to seeвђќ bess exclaimed вђњhey you twoвђќ nancy declared looking at her watch вђњnow we had better hurryвђќ and with that the three girls paid their bill and filed out of the ice cream shop вђњhere we areвђќ bess said staring up at the elegant old apartment building вђњthis street always looks like a movie set of вђold new yorkвђ to me like itвђs a hundred years old at leastвђќ it was true nancy thought the street had oldworld charm from the tall gingko trees with their fanlike leaves to the oldfashioned gas lamps along the sidewalk that fronted the many brownstone buildings вђњdid i tell you my aunt bought her apartment last year whenвђ oh look there she isвђќ nancy cried waving to her aunt who was coming out the front door tall and elegant eloise drew was a female version of nancyвђs father carson they had the same lustrous brown hair and aristocratic features вђњnancyвђќ eloise cried hugging her niece warmly and planting a kiss on her cheek вђњiвђm so happy to see you and bessвђќ she said taking nancyвђs friend warmly by the hand вђњhow good it is to see you again how was your tripвђќ eloise asked as they entered the building вђњkind of boringвђќ bess admitted with a smile вђњwonderfully uneventful is more like itвђќ nancy said in the elevator up to eloiseвђs secondfloor apartment вђњiвђve been so busy lately that it was great just to sit down and leaf through a magazineвђќ вђњwell here we areвђќ eloise said pushing open the door to her apartment вђњiвђve redecorated a bit since you were here the last timeвђќ the apartment was spacious and homey bright sunlight splashed across the walls which were papered in a dainty flowery print вђњi love what youвђve doneвђќ bess exclaimed enthusiastically as they were passing through the living room she paused to look out the window вђњi had forgotten there were trees in the backyardвђќ вђњin new york we call it a courtyard unfortunately though as you probably remember your room faces the streetвђќ nancyвђs aunt led them across a small hallway to a cozy bedroom вђњdonвђt worry the street is usually pretty quietвђќ just then a fire engine came careening down the block its siren blasting eloise waited for it to pass before adding вђњquiet for the city that isвђќ the room was all ready for the two girls both beds were freshly made with light blue comforters and two sets of fluffy white towels were neatly folded on top of the modern oak bureau eloise slid open a pair of white louvered doors revealing a nearly empty closet вђњhere you are ladiesвђќ she announced вђњand after youвђve unpacked weвђll have a snack for dinner i thought we could go to my favorite chinese restaurantвђќ вђњsuperвђќ nancy said looking over at bess who seemed enthusiastic вђњas long as thereвђs no mystery involved iвђm game for anythingвђќ вђњwellвђвђќ nancyвђs aunt said hesitantly вђњi wouldnвђt go so far as to say вђno mysteryвђ nancy i was going to save it for later but since you brought it up вђќ вђњoh no i donвђt want to hear another word iвђm here for a weekвђs vacation and thatвђs thatвђќ nancy flung herself on the bed and covered her head with a pillow вђњokay okayвђќ eloise shrugged вђњi only thought youвђd be interested because it has to do with a tv show вђќ she stared absently at the ceiling showing no emotion вђњwhat tv showвђќ bess asked nancyвђs aunt didnвђt answer вђњcome on nancy ask her iвђve got to knowвђќ nancy peeked out from under her pillow looking back and forth from bess to eloise вђњokay aunt eloiseвђќ she muttered вђњi give in what showвђќ вђњwell let me start at the beginningвђќ the older woman replied sitting down next to nancy вђњyesterday i happened to tell my downstairs neighbor you were coming to stay with me her name is mattie jensen and sheвђs anвђвђќ вђњthe mattie jensen of вђdannerвђs dreamвђвђќ eloise nodded and bess nearly fainted with excitement вђњi donвђt believe it mattie jensen is your neighbor is she as beautiful in real life as she is on tv is she anything like serena livingstoneвђќ вђњhey waitвђќ nancy propped herself up on one elbow looking bewildered вђњyou guys are way ahead of me whoвђs serena livingstoneвђќ bess looked at nancy as if she had just arrived from mars вђњthatвђs mattie jensenвђs character on вђdannerвђs dreamвђ gosh nancy youвђre really out of it you at least know who rory danner is donвђt youвђќ nancy shook her head вђњhis real name is rick arlen he and mattie are the stars of the showвђќ eloise explained вђњanyway i told her that youвђre a detective and she got very excitedвђќ вђњwell is sheвђќ bess persisted nancy and eloise looked at her puzzled вђњas beautiful in real life i mean and as together as serenaвђќ вђњohвђќ eloise laughed вђњwell letвђs see if anything iвђd say sheвђs more beautiful in person as for togetherвђwell mattieвђs a sweet girl but sheвђs very emotional i guess you could say she has an artistic temperamentвђќ eloise turned back to her niece вђњanyway she was really hoping you would stop by the set it seems some strange things have been happening to rick arlen she said she could get both of you guest passes for tomorrow morning if youвђre willing that isвђќ вђњif weвђre willing of course we areвђќ bess declared вђњi canвђt believe iвђm going to visit the set of вђdannerвђs dreamвђ wait till george hears about this sheвђs as crazy about rick arlen as i amвђќ вђњdonвђt tell me george watches вђdannerвђs dreamвђ tooвђќ nancy cried in surprise george was always either training for some athletic event or lost in the pages of a book how could she have time to watch daytime tv вђњher mother tapes it for herвђќ bess explained вђњeverybody watches serena and rory theyвђre the hottest couple on the soapsвђќ вђњi think i have heard of them actually he was featured in chatter magazine last month rightвђќ nancy asked bess nodded вђњblond hair dazzling blue eyes muscles out to hereвђќ she said indicating large biceps вђњneed i say moreвђќ вђњi get the pictureвђќ nancy replied вђњbut i promised myselfвђno

вђњmattie said you could show up at the studio around tenвђќ вђњall rightвђќ bess exclaimed her light blue eyes dancing вђњnow iвђve just got to decide what to wear tomorrowвђќ вђњiвђd rather check out that snack you were talking about aunt eloiseвђќ вђњwait a minuteвђќ cried bess вђњiвђm coming iвђm coming iвђll pick out my clothes laterвђќ nancy had to laugh bess was so excited she just hoped that mattie jensen was as prone to exaggeration as aunt eloise had said she was if so how much of a mystery could there really be вђњare you sure this skirt fitsвђќ bess asked she and nancy had just walked through the huge glass doors of worldwide broadcasting вђњyou look fabulousвђќ nancy assured her friend all morning bess had been fussing in front of the mirror getting ready for their visit to the set of вђњbannerвђs dreamвђќ and the results were definitely worth the work in her soft suede skirt tights and ankle boots bess looked like a star herself вђњokay peopleвђќ a voice behind them shouted вђњwe go in here make sure your guest pass is visibleвђќ nancy turned and saw a group of about thirty people push through the same glass doors she and bess had just entered вђњitвђs okay harryвђќ the tour guide in a navy blue uniform called to the security guard вђњtheyвђre with meвђќ вђњwhere you going вђdannerвђs dreamвђвђќ the guard asked вђњyou guessed itвђќ replied the tour guide вђњitвђs going to be a zoo in there todayвђќ the guard muttered вђњbut whateverвђ management must know what theyвђre doing take them into studio one joeвђќ вђњwell if i were serena iвђd kill himвђќ nancy heard a woman in the tour group say вђњi mean who does that rory danner think he isвђќ вђњthey may have to kill himвђќ her companion replied вђњi heard heвђs leaving the show at the end of the seasonвђќ вђњnoвђќ вђњyes didnвђt you read the star sentinel last week he wants to break his contract to make a movieвђќ вђњwell if you ask me rick arlen has gotten too big for his britchesвђќ the first woman said вђњwe fans count you knowвђњ at the rear of the group was a large man in an old sweatshirt he was shifting from foot to foot and muttering вђњyouвђll find out rory youвђre not that greatвђќ at last they all disappeared through a set of swinging doors вђњboy they sure seem angryвђќ nancy remarked вђњthatвђs nothingвђќ the security guard said вђњever since arlen decided he was leaving the show seems like everybody hates him i wouldnвђt want to be him right now no sireeвђќ he shook his head вђњcan i help you girlsвђќ he finally asked вђњweвђre here to see mattie jensenвђќ nancy said politely вђњsheвђs expecting usвђќ the guard checked his book вђњmiss drew and miss marvinвђќ he asked вђњletвђs seeвђten oвђclock sheвђs probably just going into makeup itвђs down the hall and around to your right first left after the producerвђs officeвђќ thanking him the girls made their way through the set of swinging doors that led into a long hallway the noisy tour group had gone directly onto the set but nancy and bess continued on looking for the makeup room вђњthis must be the hall he meansвђќ said nancy вђњmaybe weвђll pass the casting directorвђs officeвђќ bess whispered following her just then two young secretaries stepped into the hall ahead of them вђњwell i think he has a good pointвђќ one was saying to the other вђњhe may have a point but thatвђs still no way to talk to people even if he is the producerвђќ feelings seem to be running high everywhere nancy thought suddenly she grabbed bess by the wrist and signaled for her to be quiet they stopped by an open door with a sign that read william pappas producer they couldnвђt see in or be seen inside a man was shouting probably into a phone since no one responded to him вђњiвђve told you before he canвђt do this to me i donвђt care if he is rick arlen if he leaves this show heвђll never work again nobodyвђnobodyвђbreaks a contract with me iвђll kill him before i let him work for someone elseвђќ chapter two вђњi canвђt believe he feels that strongly about rick arlenвђќ bess whispered angrily nancy peered into the office taking care to remain hidden william pappasвђs face was flushed with anger as he stared at the phone he had just slammed down he fumbled in his pocket for a cigar вђњactors theyвђre all alike no classвђnone at allвђќ he muttered to himself then he rose and shouted to a timidlooking girl in an inner adjacent office вђњget the writers on the phone and tell them i want a rory danner death sceneвђthe more realistic the better that idiot doesnвђt deserve to live after what heвђs put me through and whereвђs my danish you know i canвђt think before iвђve had my second coffeeвђќ вђњcome onвђќ nancy said in bessвђs ear вђњletвђs get out of hereвђќ they hurried down the long hallway without looking back вђњgosh nancyвђќ bess announced after theyвђd rounded a corner and were safely out of sight вђњiвђll bet heвђs the one whoвђs causing all the troubleвђќ вђњi donвђt know bess maybe he has an artistic temperament too remember what my aunt said about mattie jensenвђќ bessвђs attention however was caught by something else вђњ вђmakeupвђ here we areвђќ bess placed her hand over her heart вђњi canвђt believe iвђm about to walk through that door and meet mattie jensen how do i look are you sure this skirt is okayвђќ nancy couldnвђt help laughing вђњyouвђre too muchвђќ she said teasingly вђњit still looks great but if youвђre so uncomfortable why did you wear itвђќ вђњbecause it looks greatвђyou just said so yourselfвђќ taking a deep breath bess knocked on the door вђњcome inвђќ someone called out bess immediately recognized the voice of her favorite soap opera character inside mattie jensen was sitting in a large barberstyle chair her famous auburn curls were wrapped in purple curlers and her porcelain skin was scrubbed clean not a hint of makeup anywhere but she still looked incredibly beautiful and her green eyes sparkled вђњmattie jjensenвђќ bess sputtered вђњyou must be nancy drewвђќ mattie replied she held out a manicured hand and gave bess a warm smile вђњno iвђm bess marvin sheвђs nancyвђќ вђњoh of courseвђќ mattie corrected herself taking nancyвђs hand вђњitвђs great to meet both of youвђќ вђњthanks same hereвђќ nancy answered вђњnancy bess iвђd like you to meet kay wills sheвђs our makeup artist and one of the great ones without her iвђd be lostвђќ вђњcome on mattie donвђt be so modestвђќ kay rolled her eyes at the girls and began dotting ivory base on mattieвђs forehead вђњwith looks like yours youвђll never be lostвђќ вђњwell looks arenвђt everything are theyвђќ mattie sighed holding her head still as kay blended in the foundation вђњtry telling that to your leading manвђќ kay sniffed continuing to work вђњpoor rickвђќ mattie murmured вђњheвђs so misunderstood and now all this awful stuff is happening to him nancy maybe youвђll be able to helpвђќ nancy leaned against the wall вђњto be honest ms jensen iвђm in new york on vacation i really donвђt want to get involved in anything complicatedвђќ вђњplease call me mattie and youвђve got to help him nancy itвђs a matter of life and deathвђќ вђњyou know youвђre a lot more upset than he is mattieвђќ kay put in вђњas far as i can tell he loves the attention no matter how negative it isвђќ nancy was puzzled вђњif you tell me whatвђs going on maybe i could give you a few suggestionsвђќ she offered after all she told herself giving advice was different from actually getting involved вђњdidnвђt eloise tell youвђќ mattie asked frantically her luminous eyes filling with tears вђњsomeone is trying to kill rickвђќ вђњdonвђt cryвђќ kay ordered dabbing mattieвђs eyes with a tissue вђњyouвђll ruin your makeupвђќ вђњsorry itвђs just so upsettingвђќ вђњmaybe you should start at the beginningвђќ nancy said taking an empty chair next to mattie вђњit began with the chocolateвђќ mattie explained leaning forward kay chased after her face with a powder puff вђњa box of it came in with the rest of the fan mail one day rick is a maniac for chocolate so he opened the box and ate one right away it was so bitter that for a minute he thought heвђd been poisoned after a while though when he didnвђt keel over he figured it was just a practical joke we all did but then a letter arrived it said something like вђscared you didnвђt i good because this was just a dress rehearsalвђ about two days later a watch came in the mail it was set at five to midnight and there was a note attached that said вђyour timeвђs running outвђ you see somebody is trying to kill himвђќ mattie was practically standing up in her chair kay gently pushed her back down and began working on her eyes вђњtake it easy honвђќ she said matteroffactly вђњmaybe this is a stupid questionвђќ nancy ventured вђњbut has anybody called the policeвђќ kay laughed вђњif we called the police every time we got a nasty letter around here weвђd be calling them every day you should see some of the fan mailвђќ mattie wheeled around in her chair вђњbut this is different these arenвђt just nasty letters theyвђre real threats the trouble is nobody is taking them seriouslyвђќ вђњnot even rickвђќ nancy asked вђњespecially not rickвђќ mattie said huffily вђњhe thinks nothing will ever hurt him as far as heвђs concerned the whole thing is the work of a single loony fan out for kicks iвђm the only one whoвђs really worried and thatвђs why i need your helpвђќ вђњsheвђll help you wonвђt you nancyвђќ bess said not really asking the question вђњweвђll stay here as long as it takesвђќ nancy smiled wryly bess would have promised anything if it meant she could spend more time with her idols вђњbut bessвђќ she said protesting вђњwe have a lot of sightseeing planned andвђвђќ just then the door flew open and rick arlen burst in bess gasped he really was even more gorgeous in person a lock of blond hair had fallen over his forehead and he impatiently brushed it away he was holding up a blackandwhite glossy photograph of himself the photo had been scratched almost beyond recognition вђњmattieвђќ he said thrusting the picture into her hands вђњitвђs happened again look at thisвђќ mattie looked at the photo and at the message scrawled beneath it вђњ вђif you wonвђt be mine you wonвђt be anybodyвђsвђ вђќ she read she looked up at nancy вђњyou see what i meanвђќ вђњat least itвђs an old pictureвђќ rick said trying to make a joke вђњitвђs not even very good actuallyвђќ bess was standing absolutely frozen staring moronically at rick noticing her obvious interest mattie hastily introduced the girls to rick but it was clear that his mind was on other things he hardly noticed them вђњwhoever did this has some nerveвђќ he was saying вђњimagine tearing up my face like thatвђќ вђњplease rickвђќ mattie begged вђњif you wonвђt call the police will you at least tell security about thisвђќ вђњcome on nowвђќ he said waving away her concern вђњwhat are they going to do about it shake their heads and wring their hands thatвђs what anyhow itвђs probably just old man pappas trying to scare meвђќ вђњrickвђќ mattie gasped вђњyou donвђt really thinkвђвђќ вђњi donвђt know what to thinkвђќ he muttered with a shrug вђњall i know is that weвђre scheduled to be on the set in five minutes for dress rehearsal and i havenвђt got time for nonsense like thisвђќ rick turned toward the door jaw set eyes ablaze he was the picture of that perfect romantic rebel rory danner вђњsee you on the set mattie oh and nice meeting you girlsвђќ he gave bess and nancy a cursory nod as he left the room вђњwhat a hunkвђќ bess whispered hoarsely вђњoh nancy youвђve just got to take this case just think what might happen to rick if you donвђtвђќ вђњbess sick as it might be sending hate mail is not a felonyвђќ вђњpleaseвђќ mattie said breaking in вђњsomethingвђs very wrong here iвђm sure of it iвђd feel so much better if youвђd at least stay and watch this morningвђs dress rehearsalвђќ nancy looked from mattie to bess and back again there was no way they would let her say no besides she reasoned watching a soap rehearsal was kind of like sightseeing wasnвђt it вђњokay weвђll stayвђќ she agreed вђњoh nancyвђќ mattie cried happily вђњyou wonвђt regret this i promiseвђќ nancy hoped not but she couldnвђt get rid of the depressing feeling that for the hundredth time a relaxing vacation was about to be ruined on their way to the set nancy filled mattie in on what she and bess had overheard outside pappasвђs office вђњthose two are really on the outs these daysвђќ mattie said вђњever since rick got that film deal and gave his notice itвђs as though a war has been declared between them i canвђt really blame mr pappas though the showвђs ratings depend on rick if he goes вђdannerвђs dreamвђ could be in big trouble and that means trouble for all of usвђќ вђњhmmmвђќ nancy thought for a moment вђњso itвђs not just mr pappas whoвђs down on rickвђќ вђњoh no in fact lately itвђs been rick against the worldвђќ she stopped вђњwell here we areвђќ mattie pushed against a vacuumsealed door with a whoosh it opened and the three of them walked onto the set nancy and bess gazed around the massive studio in straight rows rooms that had three walls but no ceilings were set up rows of klieg lights hung on suspended bars above the lights was a narrow catwalk and above that total darkness on the ground level the activity was incredible hundreds of cables wound across the floor and several huge cameras were mounted on dollies each one was surrounded by people on the set of the danner living room where the first scene was about to be shot set dressers were putting the final touches on the scenery and in the middle of it all stood rick arlen kay was fussing over his makeup and he was going over his lines with a script girl but in case he or anyone forgot a line a teleprompter stood in either corner of the room all an actor had to do was cast a glance at one of them and read his lines from the screen nancy and bess were struck by the strangeness and complexity of it all they looked dazed as mattie motioned them to a spot on the floor where they could watch the rehearsal and still be out of the way then she disappeared behind the walls of a set вђњcan you believe thisвђќ bess whispered excitedly вђњcould somebody tell rick to get on the set pleaseвђќ a beautiful blackhaired woman barked impatiently into a small megaphone вђњiвђm right here lillian dearвђќ rick purred sarcastically вђњwhat would you likeвђќ вђњi hope you bothered to memorize your linesвђќ she snapped вђњyes love i didвђќ he cooed вђњthatвђs what you always sayвђќ she said trying too hard to keep the anger out of her voice вђњyou shouldnвђt need a teleprompter rick youвђre a big boy and a professionalвђќ вђњif youвђre referring to that one small incident lillian youвђll also recall that i received a death threat that morning it wasnвђt exactly my best dayвђќ suddenly a voice boomed over the setвђs sound system вђњlillian back off will youвђќ вђњwhoвђs thatвђќ nancy wondered out loud a bearded stagehand who was walking by with a line of cables answered her вђњthatвђs luther parks the director heвђs up thereвђќ the stagehand pointed to a plexiglas booth above the door at the back of the room вђњhe watches the rehearsal on a bank of tvs up there and then chooses which camera shots theyвђll useвђќ вђњand whoвђs lillianвђќ nancy asked вђњready to roll ladies and gentlemenвђќ the directorвђs voice interrupted them вђњletвђs have quiet on the set pleaseвђќ вђњplaces everyoneвђќ the stage manager yelled вђњcharlie are we locked upвђќ the man at the door nodded a bright red light went on above him вђњthat light means weвђre shootingвђќ the same stagehand explained in a soft whisper with a quick smile he was gone in the silence of the huge studio nancy could feel the crackling of tension for a split second no one moved then rick appeared on the set and sat down on the beige sofa in the danner living room with his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees he looked just like the tortured rory danner brooding over his life then mattie playing the cool and dignified serena appeared in the living room doorway вђњroryвђќ she called out softly вђњmay i come inвђќ rick looked up but then dropped his head back into his hands вђњi donвђt want to see you serenaвђќ he growled вђњjust get out and leave me aloneвђќ mattie stood by the door cold as ice вђњrory i have to talk to youвђright nowвђќ the cameras rolled in for a closeup just then nancy noticed a faint shadow moving back and forth on the back wall of the set she glanced up to see what was causing it high overhead she saw a klieg light wobbling wildly on its track horrified nancy watched as it broke off the bar with a sickening snap and hurtled downward it was heading right for rick chapter three nancy stood up and dove across the set landing on top of rick the sofa beneath them toppled over backward everyone watched in frozen terror as the heavy lamp hit the floor where the couch had been shattering into a thousand pieces moments later pandemonium broke out as the cast and crew gathered around the scene of the disaster mattie rushed up to nancy and rick who were still in a heap on the floor gasping for breath вђњrick you couldвђve been killedвђќ mattie cried the stage manager was calling for everyone to remain calm on the set and bess tried to push her way through a group of stagehands she stretched looking to see if nancy and rick were okay вђњwhat in the world is going on around hereвђќ william pappas hurried onto the set pushing people aside as he went вђњthis is all i need our insurance rates are high enough as it isвђќ he muttered angrily вђњis anybody hurtвђќ вђњnopeвђќ rick replied from his position on the floor вђњi was just rescued by this beautiful creatureвђќ he looked up at nancy with a grateful smile вђњhello gorgeous where have you been all my lifeвђќ nancy turned red to the roots of her hair as she scrambled off rick and onto her feet brushing herself off she started to push her way through the crowd of onlookers she had to find bess вђњwaitвђќ rick called after her вђњdonвђt leave me nowвђќ with that a group of stagehands who were standing nearby broke out in nervous laughter just then nancy felt a hand on her shoulder it was mattie вђњthank heavens you were here if you hadnвђt gotten to rick so quickly вђќ she shivered turning to the crowd she called out вђњeveryone iвђd like you to meet nancy drew sheвђs my guest todayвђќ everyone clapped and mattie smiled weakly вђњand now iвђm going to call security maybe theyвђll believe that someone really is after rickвђќ and with a toss of her pretty head she stepped off the set headed for the intercom behind the scenery вђњwell dear thatвђs one way to meet a starвђќ lillian observed caustically glaring at nancy вђњwait just a minuteвђвђќ nancy began but then she decided it would be better not to say anything lillian might not be the friendliest person sheвђd ever met but the last thing nancy wanted was to make an enemy at the beginning beginning of what nancy asked herself an investigation was there really anything to investigate after all she reasoned accidents do happen dodging lillianвђs pointed remark nancy excused herself and made her way over to the corner of the set rick was there chatting with bess вђњah my saviorвђќ he said when he saw nancy but her quick frown made it clear that she wasnвђt going to fall for his lines вђњhey girlsвђќ rick suggested вђњwhy donвђt the three of us go back to my dressing room we can have a soda and get to know each other a little better while theyвђre cleaning up this messвђќ вђњoh weвђd love toвђќ crooned bess elbowing nancy in the ribs she prompted her friend вђњwouldnвђt weвђќ вђњi guess that would be all rightвђќ nancy shrugged until security had finished looking around no one would be allowed near the scene of the accident anyway and maybe she could use the time to find out a little more about rick arlen вђњby the way who was that womanвђlillian somebodyвђwho was so angry at you earlierвђќ nancy asked him as they headed down the empty corridor вђњher name is lillian weissвђќ he hissed making the name sound snakelike вђњsheвђs the assistant director while luther is up in the booth playing god sheвђs his watchdogвђќ вђњsounds like sheвђs not your favorite personвђќ вђњsheвђs not but then lillianвђs just a nobody around here i donвђt let her get to meвђsheвђs not worth even thinking aboutвђќ just then they came to a door with a polished brass star on it and rickвђs name above the star вђњcome into my parlor said the spider to the flyвђќ he quipped lightly he ushered them in and closed the door quietly behind them the bright lights in the dressing room blinded nancy for a moment when she stepped in вђњi love this roomвђitвђs so warm and bright this is the place i go to get away from the craziness out thereвђќ he pointed toward the door вђњletвђs see nowвђќ he mumbled вђњiвђd offer you a chocolate but iвђm afraid theyвђre a little bitter but can i get you something to drinkвђќ rick opened a small refrigerator bess pushed a lock of blond hair behind her ear before she said вђњokay um a diet soda for meвђќ вђњpour vousвђќ he asked turning to nancy вђњthe same thanksвђќ вђњyouвђre a very smart girl and brave too would you care to marry meвђќ rick had taken nancyвђs hand gently in his own and now he offered her a bouquet of imaginary flowers with the other nancy pulled her hand away and looked at him вђњi have a boyfriend sorryвђќ she said apologizing вђњahвђiвђm crushed well thenвђќ he purred instantly turning to bess and taking her hand вђњhow about you would you marry meвђќ bessвђs eyes twinkled mischievously вђњokay youвђre onвђќ вђњoh you only like me for my looksвђќ rick complained nancy saw him catch a quick glimpse of himself in the mirror before he gazed back at bess appreciatively вђњbut then youвђre not too bad yourselfвђќ bess blushed she seemed to melt into the dressing table as rick stared at her rick arlen obviously knew how to flirt nancy observed and bess was definitely being taken in вђњwellвђќ said nancy trying to break the spell вђњfor a guy who just barely escaped a terrible accident youвђre in an incredibly good moodвђќ вђњof course of course i amвђќ rick said agreeably as he poured the sodas вђњi was lucky thatвђs the best way to be if youвђre going to be in an accident donвђt you agree but then iвђve always been a lucky guy i mean i just met you two didnвђt iвђќ вђњsome people donвђt think the things that have been happening to you lately are accidentsвђќ nancy said rick sank into a plush chair and looked at her impatiently вђњsome people are also frightened of their own shadows look when youвђre a tv star you have to expect a little craziness it comes with the territory along with a lot of good things too has anyone ever told you that youвђre beautifulвђќ he added offhandedly to bess she almost swooned into his costume rack sheвђs really eating this up nancy thought bess actually seemed to take rickвђs baloney seriously вђњlook iвђd better get back to the setвђќ nancy said putting down her soda вђњsecurity should have had a good look around by now and i want to find out exactly what happened are you coming bessвђќ she asked вђњis it okay if i meet you back there in a little whileвђќ bess responded вђњdonвђt worry about bess hereвђќ rick put in with a grin вђњiвђll take care of herвђќ that was just what nancy was afraid of pushing through the thick soundproof door nancy stepped back onto the set immediately she saw mattie trying to break up a fight one of the men was william pappas nancy hadnвђt seen the other man before he was slim handsome and at that moment his eyes were ablaze with anger вђњit was an accidentвђќ pappas was shouting вђњtechnicians are only human now if youвђll get off my back iвђll find out who was responsible and deal with that person i canвђt do anything if youвђre going to stand here and scream at me all dayвђќ вђњyou still donвђt get it do youвђќ the other man shouted back вђњmattie could have been killed in there and i promise you if so much as a hair on my clientвђs head is ever hurt your network will be facing the biggest lawsuit the world has ever seen come on mattieвђќ he grabbed mattieвђs arm and marched toward the door nancy ducked behind a piece of scenery and continued to watch вђњdwayne please calm downвђќ mattie protested вђњno one was trying to hurt me i was nowhere near the accidentвђќ вђњitвђs the networkвђs responsibility to protect you from things like this mattie look at those shards of glass what if one of them had cut your face your career would be ruinedвђќ вђњnobody is going to get hurt dwayneвђќ pappas said calmer now вђњthis is never going to happen again now will you please get out of here so we can clean up this mess and get on with the showвђќ as dwayne stalked off nancy heard pappas remark to mattie вђњitвђs just my luck that that idiot agent was here today the last thing i need is a nervous nellie on the set the day the roof falls in no offense mattie but the man is a complete fool excuse me please will youвђќ as pappas breezed by her nancy grabbed mattieвђs elbow and they followed him the producer walked immediately over to the chief of security and began asking questions nancy and mattie got as close as they could without being noticed and listened intently вђњit looks like an accident plain and simple mr pappasвђќ the security man was saying вђњthank youвђќ pappas muttered then he strode directly over to where the lighting technicians were gathered вђњwhich one of you was responsible for checking the lights this weekвђќ he asked вђњi wasвђќ admitted one of the men unhappily it was the man with the beard who had talked to nancy and bess earlier вђњbut they checked out fine in fact just this morningвђвђќ вђњwhatвђs your nameвђќ asked pappas darkly вђњuh macpherson mr pappas butвђвђќ вђњyouвђre fired macpherson stop by the front office and pick up your severance pay i donвђt ever want to see you around here again understandвђќ before the man could say another word pappas was gone mattie and nancy looked at each other вђњyouвђve got to believe meвђќ mattie whispered urgently вђњthat was no accident iвђm sure of itвђќ nancy sighed if security thought it was an accident it probably was still вђњi think iвђll take a look around myself you never knowвђќ there wasnвђt much to see all the glass from the broken light had been swept into a pile in the corner and the light itself was in pieces against the wall each piece had been tagged for reference security seemed to have done a thorough job nancy was about to give up and go back to rickвђs dressing room but decided to take a last look around as she walked over to the back wall of the living room a flash of something metallic caught her eye and she bent to the floor there almost completely hidden from view was a piece of metal with a bolt attached one edge of the metal was shiny as if it had been scraped or cut nancy walked over to the lighting technician who was gloomily gathering his things together вђњexcuse meвђќ she said вђњbutвђcould i ask you a questionвђќ the man turned around and looked at her for a moment вђњoh hi i remember you youвђre the girl who saved rickвђs lifeвђќ he said with a smile вђњi guess i should thank you iвђd have been in real trouble if heвђd gotten hurtвђќ вђњyou donвђt have to thank meвђќ nancy waved him off вђњbut you could tell me what this isвђќ she showed him the bolt sheвђd found вђњwhy thatвђs a cclamp theyвђre used to hold the lights on the barвђќ вђњdoes it look odd to you is there anything strange about itвђќ macpherson studied the clamp briefly вђњone endвђs been sawedвђќ he gasped вђњalmost clean through the rest looks like it snapped off this must beвђ but ifвђвђќ вђњjust what i was thinkingвђќ nancy said agreeing вђњthat was no accident this morning the light was rigged so it would fall somebody tried to kill rick arlenвђand almost succeededвђќ chapter four вђњdo you believe me nowвђќ mattie was on the verge of tears as she pleaded with the chief of security she and nancy had just shown him the broken clamp вђњiвђve been telling people for weeks that someone was after rick but nobody believed me youвђve got to believe me nowвђќ вђњnow mattieвђќ pappas said patting his leading lady on the arm вђњletвђs not get hysterical and blow this out of proportionвђќ вђњwell iвђll beвђќ the security man muttered as he examined the cclamp вђњwhere exactly did you say you found this young ladyвђќ вђњby the back wall of the setвђќ nancy replied вђњwell it proves the light was sabotaged no doubt about itвђќ вђњthis is just what i needвђќ pappas muttered in frustration вђњi donвђt have enough problems without someone sabotaging my showвђќ вђњmr pappas who actually has access to this stageвђќ the chief wanted to know вђњwell the crew and the actors of course nobody else really maybe an occasional guest but they all register at the front deskвђќ вђњwasnвђt there a tour group in here earlier todayвђќ nancy asked pappas snapped his fingers вђњrightвђќ вђњand some of them were mad at rory danner tooвђќ nancy said вђњyou donвђt suppose some crazy fan could haveвђвђќ pappas shook his head вђњthereвђre a lot of nuts out there mr pappasвђќ the chief said вђњall it takes is one person who canвђt tell fantasy from realityвђќ вђњthat settles itвђќ pappas exclaimed вђњfrom now on this set is closed to anyone not directly involved in the showвђќ yelling across the studio pappas repeated his order for everyone to hear вђњthat means no guests no agents no mothers fathers sisters or brothers i want this set sealed tighter than a pharaohвђs tomb вђњnow weвђll take a couplehour break and then back to work if you need anything iвђll be in my officeвђќ after pappas walked away nancy turned toward mattie вђњthank goodness he gave us a breakвђќ she told nancy вђњiвђve got to go restвђќ rubbing her eyes she added вђњsee you later and thanks again for saving rickвђs lifeвђќ flashing nancy a grateful smile mattie walked off the set since the set was closed to guests nancy and bess had to leave nancy began to make her way back toward rickвђs dressing room to collect bess but she soon realized she must have gone through the wrong door or made a wrong turn somewhere one long corridor led to another and for a moment nancy didnвђt know which way to turn then the sound of a door slowly opening caught her attention instinctively knowing that she shouldnвђt be there nancy moved back into a recessed doorway and waited silently nancy could just see lillian weiss nervously looking both ways before stepping into the hall once the door was closed behind her lillian seemed to relax nancyвђs heart was in her throat as she realized lillian was heading straight for her nancy opened the door behind her and slammed it making it sound as if she had just come through that door she stepped out into the corridor вђњwell wellвђќ lillian said greeting nancy with a snarl вђњis our fair rescuer lost and helplessвђќ вђњyes i guess i am i was looking for rickвђs dressing room actuallyвђќ nancy told her well it was almost the truth вђњcontinue down this corridor and make your first leftвђќ lillian snapped вђњand by the way it was nice knowing you iвђm sure now that pappas has closed the set you wonвђt be around anymore too bad iвђm sure you were rickвђs favorite little bodyguardвђќ with a smug smile lillian continued down the hall and disappeared around a corner the room that lillian had come out of turned out to be the prop room after making sure she was alone nancy ventured inside at first she was overwhelmed by what she saw the room was huge with several long aisles stacked from floor to ceiling making an incredible clutter were thousands upon thousands of itemsвђanything that could ever possibly be needed on the set of the show as organized as the room seemed to be with everything numbered and labeled there was no way to keep it all neat dust covered some of the items that hadnвђt been used recently and nancy felt her nose begin to itch there seemed to be nobody there but when nancy sneezed she heard a rustling in a far corner a copy of the daily news moved and a grizzled head poked out from under it the old man had a mop of unruly white hair flowing out from an ancient orange cap вђњwhoвђs thereвђќ a crackly voice called вђњiвђm awake iвђm awake on the job all the time yessir what can i do for youвђќ nancy couldnвђt help smiling at the wizened old man he wore red suspenders which held up a pair of baggy gray pants and he was covered with as much dust as everything else in the room nancy would have almost believed that he had been sleeping there uninterrupted for years вђњsorry i must have opened the wrong doorвђќ she said apologizing вђњoh itвђs good to have a little companyвђќ the man said вђњthis week has been just kitchen stuff and living room knickknacks day after day iвђve been sitting here reading my paper all week without seeing a soulвђќ вђњbut wasnвђt the assistant director in here just a moment agoвђќ nancy said вђњwho lillian nah havenвђt seen lillian in ages the only time she ever came into the prop room was to complain that a butcher knife didnвђt look sharp enough i had to put a little oil on it to give it that threatening gleam when the camera panned in on it thatвђs an old prop manвђs trick you knowвђќ вђњachooвђќ nancy couldnвђt help sneezing again вђњare you sure no one was in here earlierвђќ she asked again persisting вђњabsolutely one hundred percent young lady and nobody gets anything by meвђќ thatвђs what you think nancy thought as she said goodbye to the prop man as she stepped back into the corridor and made her way to rickвђs dressing room nancyвђs mind was in a whirl maybe one of the fans from the tour group had tampered with the klieg light she supposed it was possible but even so something funny was definitely going on what had lillian been doing in the prop room and why was she so hostile nancy was determined to find out and that meant she had to get onto the set again the next day and do some more checking around here i am she said to herself as she turned a corner and saw the familiar door with the star on it wait till i tell bess what i found a moment later after a quick knock she threw open the door smiling broadly what she saw made her stop dead bess was in rickвђs arms and they looked about a split second away from a kiss too steamy for tv chapter five вђњnancyвђќ bess cried awkwardly trying to disentangle herself from rickвђs embrace nancy looked from a blushing bess to rick and back вђњiвђm sorry to interrupt butвђвђќ вђњitвђs not what you thinkвђќ bess said interrupting her as she tossed her blond hair over her shoulder and straightened her collar вђњrick just asked me to help him rehearse thatвђs allвђќ вђњsheвђs very talentedвђќ rick said putting his arm around bessвђs waist and drawing her closer вђњwell i just came to tell you that pappas closed the set to all visitorsвђќ nancy said looking at bess but bess wasnвђt about to let anything ruin her day вђњnancy youвђll never guess what rick has offered to doвђќ вђњitвђs really nothingвђќ rick said protesting вђњnothingвђќ bess replied her eyes dancing with excitement вђњyou call taking me all over the city in a limousine nothingвђќ вђњwell i already have the limousineвђќ rick shrugged modestly вђњheвђs going to give me a personal tour of the city on saturday would you believe heвђs never been on top of the empire state buildingвђќ вђњhow can you live in new york and not visit the empire state buildingвђќ nancy asked вђњactually a lot of new yorkers have never been thereвђќ he explained вђњwe always say weвђre going to go someday but somehow we never get around to it itвђll be a real treat for meвђќ bess continued to gaze at the handsome tv star nancy couldnвђt help worrying that her friend might be getting in over her head вђњbess arenвђt you forgetting that rick might be in danger i donвђt know if itвђs such a great idea for you to be alone with him you knowвђќ вђњdonвђt be sillyвђќ rick laughed wiping his makeup off with a thick cloth вђњi can take care of both of us listen iвђve got an even better ideaвђwhy donвђt you come too iвђm sure i could round up a friend for youвђќ вђњthatвђs greatвђќ bess cried happily turning to nancy вђњokay count me inвђќ nancy agreed spending the day with rick was one way to keep an eye on him and on bess вђњcome on bessвђќ she said taking her friend by the elbow вђњweвђd better leave the set nice meeting you rickвђќ nancy turned to the door but bess wasnвђt quite finished talking to rick вђњwell iвђm sorry we have to go so soon but weвђre definitely on for saturday arenвђt weвђќ she asked вђњi can hardly wait loveвђќ he replied blowing her a kiss вђњtill then вђparting is such sweet sorrowвђ вђќ as soon as she closed the door bess stood stockstill for a moment then she leaned on the wall in a daze вђњdid you hear he called me вђloveвђ вђќ вђњi heardвђќ nancy replied uneasily вђњoh nancyвђќ bess cooed вђњheвђs so wonderful not at all conceited like some big stars probably are just think i have a date with the rick arlen meвђbess marvin regular person do you know how many girls would kill for a date with the star of вђdannerвђs dreamвђвђќ вђњyeahвђвђќ nancy said only half paying attention she was wondering who was trying to kill rick arlenвђand why вђњwe were standing there watching this intense scene i mean it was so quiet you could hear your heart beatingвђќ bess was going over the whole day as nancyвђs aunt emptied a package of white mushrooms into her food processor вђњand then well the light just snapped right in front of our eyes right nancyвђќ nancy looked up from the microwave where she was getting ready to bake three potatoes вђњuhhuhвђќ she agreed вђњand nancy saved the day you should have seen herвђќ bess said continuing вђњi donвђt know how she reacted so fast the light only missed him by a few inches and rick is amazing he wasnвђt even afraid he said it was all in a dayвђs work can you believe itвђќ eloiseвђs eyes clouded over with worry вђњiвђm not sure i want you two poking around in a place where they have accidents like thatвђќ she said shaking her head nancy looked over at bess and put her finger on her lips but bess didnвђt pick up on it вђњoh noвђќ bess went on вђњit wasnвђt an accident nancy found the evidenceвђsomebody tampered with the lightвђќ вђњnancyвђќ aunt eloise exclaimed вђњdo you mean to say mattie was right to suspect something was wrong oh dear please be careful i donвђt want you getting hurtвђќ bess laughed and shook her head вђњdonвђt worry rick says itвђs just some crazy fan trying to scare him now that theyвђve closed the set iвђm sure there wonвђt be any more troubleвђќ just then the phone rang вђњhelloвђќ eloise answered вђњoh yes mattie weвђre here come on upвђќ replacing the receiver she said вђњi hope itвђs all right if mattie joins us i should have asked you firstвђќ вђњitвђs fine with meвђќ bess cried happily nancy went to the vegetable bin and took out another potato after rinsing it she popped it into the microwave вђњthatвђs itвђќ eloise said вђњdinner in ten minutesвђќ in a few minutes there was a knock on the door and nancy went to open it вђњhi everybodyвђќ mattie called as she breezed into the apartment with a bouquet of spring flowers nancy was amazed at how carefree mattie seemed вђњoh iвђm so happy youвђre on the caseвђќ she cried embracing nancy warmly вђњi know nothing bad can happen to rick nowвђќ nancy frowned slightly everyone seemed to think rick arlen was safe including rick himself she wasnвђt at all convinced вђњdid you hear about your niece this morningвђs heroineвђќ mattie said going over to kiss eloise and hand her the flowers вђњyou werenвђt exaggerating when you told me how brave she wasвђќ eloise reddened and looked over at nancy вђњdonвђt get the wrong ideaвђќ she warned вђњiвђm proud of you but that doesnвђt mean i approve of your taking unnecessary risks please be carefulвђќ вђњi willвђќ nancy promised dinner was ready and the four of them gathered around the large oak table in the dining area вђњmarinated steak smells great and i donвђt mind saying so myselfвђќ eloise remarked вђњi may not be the greatest cook but every once in a while i do all rightвђќ вђњi can testify personally that sheвђs a fantastic cookвђќ mattie said with a laugh after they ate and chatted for a while mattie turned more serious and asked вђњso nancy what do you think was it someone from the tour group who tampered with the lightвђќ вђњwell some people seem to think thatвђќ nancy answered вђњbut from what i can tell his fans arenвђt the only ones whoвђre angry at rick there are other peopleвђpeople who see him every day pappas for instance or lillian weiss maybe others tooвђќ вђњhah you donвђt know the half of itвђќ mattie said вђњthere isnвђt a person on that set who rick hasnвђt alienated at one time or anotherвђќ вђњreally whyвђќ nancy wondered вђњoh rickвђs justвђ heвђs talented handsome and rich some people would hate him just for that but heвђs also walked over a lot of people to get where he is heвђs used a lot of people broken a lot of heartsвђвђќ she sighed deeply was one of those broken hearts mattieвђs nancy wondered the actress seemed so fragile and sad when she talked about rick вђњi wish i could point to just one person and say thatвђs the oneвђ but rick has made a lot of enemiesвђќ mattie shook her head and reached for her glass of mineral water вђњpeople resent his successвђќ bess commented вђњhe was telling me about that today about how jealous people are of him how they all want something from himвђќ вђњohвђќ mattie said turning to face bess вђњyou two were talking togetherвђќ вђњuhhuhвђќ bess said happily вђњwe found out we have a lot in commonвђќ вђњi seeвђќ mattie said looking down at her plate вђњwait a minuteвђќ bess said slowly вђњyou two arenвђt going out or anything are youвђќ вђњoh noвђќ mattie quickly replied вђњthat is not anymoreвђќ so mattie was one of those broken hearts nancy thought вђњoh phewвђќ bess breathed a sigh of relief вђњi wouldnвђt want to steal somebody elseвђs boyfriend or anything you see heвђs asked me out for saturdayвђќ вђњheвђhe asked you outвђќ mattie whispered her eyes grew incredibly wide and her mouth fell open вђњyesвђќ nancy interjected soothingly вђњand iвђm going along too itвђs perfect donвђt you think that way i can keep an eye on rickвђќ вђњi seeвђќ mattie looked somewhat calmed by nancyвђs explanation still she turned to bess with a sudden compelling stare вђњjust be careful pleaseвђќ she said warning her вђњyou donвђt know rick the way i doвђyou donвђt know how dangerous he can beвђќ chapter six вђњlisten bessвђвђќ mattie relaxed her stare a bit trying hard not to look so severe вђњi really donвђt want to upset you but honestly rick can really love them and leave them maybe itвђs because deep down inside heвђs very unsure of himself or maybe heвђs become too successful too fast andвђ sometimes i wonder if he can really handle itвђќ вђњrick unsure of himselfвђќ bess shook her head in disbelief вђњiвђm sorry mattie i donвђt think you know the real rickвђќ вђњmaybe not but iвђve known him a long time we did summer stock together years ago he was different then warm and sincere in the past few years heвђs really changed he can be so cold now even cruelвђќ вђњwell maybe he just hasnвђt met the right girl yetвђќ bess suggested вђњwait a minuteвђќ nancy interrupted вђњmattie why are you so concerned about a man youвђve just told us is cold cruel and steps on peopleвђќ вђњoh i donвђt knowвђќ mattie answered softly вђњi guess i still think of him as a friend even if it didnвђt work out between usвђќ looking over at nancy imploringly she added вђњrick would never admit it but iвђm sure that way down deep heвђs scared iвђd just feel so much better if you were on the set tomorrowвђќ bess rolled her eyes and got up from the table nancy watched her go she hoped bess knew what she was doing where rick was concerned вђњiвђd like to be there myselfвђќ nancy replied turning back to mattie вђњbut now that the setвђs closed to visitorsвђвђќ вђњwait a minuteвђќ mattie cried her eyes shimmered with excitement вђњi just got a brilliant idea weвђre shooting a hospital scene tomorrow and iвђll bet i could get you and bess jobs as extras what do you think will you do itвђќ across the kitchen bess couldnвђt help jumping up and down with excitement вђњthat would be fantasticвђќ nancy thought for a moment вђњare you sure you could do itвђќ вђњalmost sure here let me call the casting director eloise do you have a phone book handyвђќ nancyвђs aunt brought the book over as bess loaded the dishwasher вђњjust imagine nancy appearing oh my favorite soapвђќ вђњweвђre in luckвђќ mattie announced hanging up the phone a few minutes later вђњshe says you two can be nurses just report to the studio at seven sharp and go straight to the costume room as soon as you get thereвђќ вђњbut what if people recognize usвђќ nancy wondered out loud вђњoh they wonвђt recognize youвђќ mattie laughed and stood up to leave вђњno one ever looks at the extras besides when youвђre on camera youвђll probably have wigs and uniforms on you probably wonвђt even recognize yourselvesвђќ вђњyou know nancyвђќ bess said after mattie had gone вђњno matter what anyone says iвђve read that a lot of big stars started out as extras you never knowвђthis could be my lucky breakвђќ bess and nancy had reported to the studio at seven the next morning after the dry blocking in which they learned what they were to do they reported to makeup and wardrobe now standing on pedestals as two wardrobe people finished their final fittings for the dress rehearsal bess and nancy couldnвђt help giggling вђњyouвђre really a knockout as a brunette nancyвђќ bess said nancy looked over at her friend who was wearing an identical uniform she had a white nurseвђs cap over her bright red wig and nancy had never seen her look more excited вђњyour dress rehearsal will be third ladiesвђќ a production assistant told them вђњafter the big love scene which is the second report to lillian you know where to stand and what to do from the first rehearsal so break a leg oh if you want to catch rick and mattie in rehearsal you can rory and serena are going to have a big scene itвђs supposed to be pretty hot stuffвђќ bess immediately dashed down the corridor to the set determined not to miss a word of mattie and rickвђs scene it was all nancy could do to keep up with her watching the cast and crew gather around the set of serena livingstoneвђs living room nancy could feel their edginess the neardisaster of the day before had obviously gotten to everyone even though the set was closed to outsiders nancy could tell that nobody felt truly safe the only person who seemed at ease was rick flashing a smile at bess as he walked onto the set he looked as if he were on top of the world he took his place in the middle of the set and slowly rick arlen seemed to fade away when the director finally called вђњactionвђќ he had become rory danner in the scene rory was supposed to tell serena that heвђd be hers forever if she would have him even though it was an intense scene nancy noticed that rick was reading nearly all his lines from the teleprompter but then with all the excitement the day before she reasoned he probably hadnвђt had time to memorize them mattie was having trouble with her lines too she had excused herself early the night before to go home and work but obviously she didnвђt remember much although she was really throwing herself into the scene nancy noticed that she too kept glancing over at her teleprompter to check her lines вђњshould i leave serena is that what you wantвђќ rick asked pacing in front of mattie nervously вђњno rory donвђt go i love youвђќ serena said her voice was quivering and her emerald eyes were full of tears вђњiвђve always loved you even when you didnвђt want meвђќ вђњcutвђќ came the directorвђs voice вђњmattie i need you to cool it a little if you start the scene at such a high emotional pitch we wonвђt have anywhere to goвђќ вђњright lutherвђќ mattie nodded up to the directorвђs booth вђњokay everyone take it from вђshould i leaveвђ вђќ lillian ordered вђњshould i leave serena is that what you wantвђќ rick said вђњno rory donвђt go i love you iвђve always loved you even when you didnвђt want meвђќ they were into it by then mattie and rick were utterly convincing making everyone who was watching really believe they were desperately in love bess had tears in her eyes as she watched them move slowly toward each other finally serena collapsed in roryвђs arms вђњhere comes her big speechвђќ lillian muttered under her breath to nobody in particular вђњwatch her screw it upвђќ вђњoh rory i want to do so many things with youвђќ mattie whispered hoarsely вђњi want to take walks in the rain with you i want to sit with you under the stars on a deserted beach i want to dance with you to sing with you toвђвђќ mattie suddenly fell silent she stood as if frozen her eyes fixed on the teleprompter her beautiful face a terrible white then as everyone looked on in horror she let out a bloodcurdling scream and slumped slowly to the floor chapter seven вђњmattie mattieвђќ вђњwhat happenedвђќ вђњis she all rightвђќ вђњdonвђt touch herвђќ everyone gathered around mattie who was lying on the floor after what seemed forever her eyes began to flutter open she looked dazed mattie struggled to her feet with rickвђs help the look in her eyes only grew wilder вђњlookвђќ she cried pointing to the teleprompter her monologue had been changed it read вђњi want to dance with you to sing with you to murder you yes your time is up rick arlen iвђm going to kill you iвђm going to watch you die a horrible death and iвђm going to laughвђќ вђњwhat in the name ofвђ what is thisвђќ pappas yelled вђњget me the teleprompter operator i want to talk to her right nowвђќ вђњiвђm here mr pappasвђќ a short redhaired girl spoke up вђњwould you care to explain thisвђќ he asked arching his eyebrows вђњwell sir i uhвђi really canвђt explain itвђќ the girl stammered вђњi got here early to type in the scene and i was at the keyboard all morning the only time i left was to take a phone call and i know i wasnвђt gone for more than a minute because when i picked up the phone there was no one there iвђi didnвђt thinkвђвђќ вђњexactly you didnвђt thinkвђќ pappas shot the operator a harsh look вђњyouвђre fired and whoeverвђs job it was to keep strangers off this set youвђre fired tooвђќ then to the frightened cast and crew he said вђњiвђll fire every last one of you if i have to this nonsense has got to stopвђќ nancy watched the producer from the sidelines he seemed genuinely concerned but what if it was all an act what if beneath all his theatrics there was something completely different going on something much more calculatedвђand sinister she noticed lillian weiss too lillian was off in a corner trying to be inconspicuous but nothing could hide the pleased look on her face she was loving every minute of all this вђњokay everybodyвђќ lutherвђs voice boomed from the directorвђs booth вђњlunch break and when we come back letвђs try to get this show back on schedule shall weвђќ вђњcalm down mattie youвђre not going to let some practical joker ruin your day are youвђќ rick opened the front door of the studio for them and mattie bess and nancy filed past him onto the sidewalk вђњcome onвђќ he added with a grin вђњlet me treat you all to lunchвђwhile iвђm still alive that isвђќ вђњstop it stop pretending everythingвђs fineвђќ mattie turned on him her green eyes flashing вђњyouвђve got to be terrified why donвђt you just come out and admit itвђќ вђњme terrified donвђt be ridiculousвђthey canвђt kill me the world needs me besides itвђd spoil the ratings if i diedвђќ вђњoh i could just punch youвђќ mattie growled вђњand iвђll pay for my own lunch thank youвђќ вђњwhatever you sayвђќ rick shrugged вђњiвђll just have to treat bessвђand nancy of course right ladiesвђќ bess and nancy said nothing embarrassed by the way rick was taunting mattie nancy started to walk off by herself вђњhey look whoвђs hereвђќ said rick his attention caught by a man at the studio door вђњitвђs the president of the losersвђ league himself hi dwayneвђќ dwayne casper mattieвђs agent rushed up to them pointedly ignoring rickвђs remark nancy stopped and observed the scene at a short distance from the others вђњmattieвђќ he cried throwing his arms around her вђњi was bringing some of your new head shots to the front office and i heard what happened itвђs absolutely outrageous are you all right darlingвђќ вђњoh i suppose soвђќ mattie replied softly shaking free of his embrace вђњit was awfully upsetting butвђвђќ вђњbut nothingвђќ dwayne said interrupting вђњyouвђre in danger and i wonвђt have itвђќ вђњkeep your shirt on casperвђќ rick said with a scornful laugh вђњthis nut is supposedly after me not mattie why donвђt you leave us alone and go hover over some of your other clients if you have any that isвђќ вђњrickвђќ mattie cried sharply вђњitвђs all right mattie he doesnвђt bother me as long as youвђre all rightвђвђќ вђњiвђm fine dwayne please donвђt worry about meвђќ mattie smiled at him warmly вђњhonestвђќ вђњyeah donвђt worry old buddy iвђll take care of mattieвђќ rick said trying to assure him вђњoh iвђm sure you willвђќ dwayne sneered then he turned to mattie and took her by the hand looking deeply into her eyes вђњi want you to promise to call me if thereвђs any more trouble on the setвђќ mattie nodded then dwayne walked off throwing a nasty look over his shoulder at rick вђњfor peteвђs sake mattieвђќ rick muttered before dwayne was out of earshot вђњwhen are you going to dump that jerk and get yourself a real agentвђќ вђњoh dwayneвђs not so badвђќ mattie answered watching the man disappear вђњremember he took me on as a client when nobody else would even give me an interviewвђќ вђњbut youвђve come a long way since then youвђre a star now you should have a major agency representing youвђќ he said as they started walking to catch up with nancy вђњi donвђt know somehow iвђd feel like a rat if i left dwayneвђќ вђњall i know is a major agency could get you a lot more work and more money and a girl with your talent deserves the bestвђќ seeing he was getting nowhere rick threw up his hands вђњall right i wonвђt say another word you know how i feel thoughвђќ he stopped in front of an expensivelooking restaurant вђњhere we are serena nurse sanford nurse johnson would you care to have lunch with meвђќ he said opening the restaurant door for them вђњitвђs saturday morning and time for another edition of вђsoap opera weeklyвђ where we bring you the latest on your favorite shows and introduce you to the starsвђќ the television announcer was saying as bess shook nancyвђs shoulder вђњwake up nancy drewвђќ bess said mimicking the announcer вђњcome on the alarm went off ten minutes ago your auntвђs still sleeping so i wheeled the tv in here rickвђs going to be on вђsoap opera weeklyвђ this morning we can watch while we get dressedвђќ вђњmumpfhвђвђќ nancy mumbled burying her head under the pillow was it really morning already she and bess and her aunt eloise had had such a great time the night before theyвђd gone to see soft shoe the broadway musical smash of the season the show was wonderful but theyвђd stopped for a bite to eat afterward by the time they got home it was almost one in the morning flipping over and squinting at the tv nancy saw shots of different soap opera stars as the upbeat theme song played in the background вђњour special вђsoap opera weeklyвђ guest today is the star of вђdannerвђs dreamвђвђќ the announcer said вђњwill he and serena livingstone finally tie the knot this time mr sex appeal himself rick arlen will be here with us in just a few minutes but firstвђвђќ the commercial came on and nancy realized there was no way she was going to get back to sleep not with bess rummaging around the room tossing one outfit after another on the bed and saying things like вђњwhat do you think nancy the pink or the yellowвђќ pulling herself up onto her elbows nancy yawned and looked out the window it was a glorious day outsideвђwarm and sunny a perfect day for seeing the sights she thought happily вђњheвђs on heвђs onвђќ bess shouted a few minutes later nancy turned from the closet and saw rick he was seated casually across from the interviewer waving and nodding as the audience clapped and cheered cleverly refusing to give away any of the showвђs carefully guarded secrets rick did admit that he was considering leaving the show at the end of the season to star in a movie the audience groaned then applauded вђњtell us about the real rick arlenвђќ the interviewer prompted вђњcould we be hearing wedding bells soonвђќ laughing rick made an old joke about the gossip columns having him engaged to three different girls вђњbut then you never can tellвђќ he added slyly blowing a kiss to a вђњspecial lady out thereвђќ вђњhe means meвђќ bess cried happily вђњi donвђt think so thatвђs just talk bess he could mean anybodyвђor nobodyвђќ bess shot her friend an angry scowl and nancy decided to back off after the interview with rick the show moved on to an update of that networkвђs daytime and evening soap operasвђ bess snapped the tv off then вђњhe said heвђd be here in an hour i canвђt waitвђќ bess scooped up her makeup and headed for the bathroom вђњhey i wonder who heвђll bring for you nancy i mean any friend of rickвђs is probably cute but i wonder what heвђll be likeвђќ an hour later the apartment intercom buzzed signaling the arrival of rick and his limousine bess checked herself in the mirror one last time she looked terrific in an oversize cotton cardigan and flowing skirt and flats вђњnot badвђќ she pronounced вђњcome on nancyвђќ with that she flew down the steps of the brownstone to the waiting limousine вђњnot bad at allвђќ nancy admitted looking admiringly at rickвђs limo the uniformed driver ushered them into the backseat where rick was waiting вђњgood morning girlsвђќ he said brightly вђњwelcome to my abode on the roadвђќ the first order of business was to pick up rickвђs friend a guy named gilbert frost вђњheвђs an old pal from acting schoolвђќ rick explained вђњyouвђll love himвђќ bess threw nancy a meaningful look but nancy just sighed and looked out the window there was no way that she was going to fall for any of rick arlenвђs friendsвђnot when she was in love with ned nickerson of course ned would understand her being on this dateвђshe had to go someoneвђs life was in jeopardy at the corner of twentythird street and park avenue south she noticed a skinny guy in jeans and running shoes leaning against a streetlight he looked totally normal except that he was wearing big blackrimmed glasses and a false nose вђњwhatвђќ nancy mumbled as the limo stopped in front of him the man swept down in a low courtly bow вђњhey there gilвђќ rick laughed opening the door вђњgirls iвђd like you to meet gilbert frost say hello gilbertвђќ вђњhello gilbertвђќ the guy mimicked sliding into the plush limo bess was giggling uncontrollably and nancy couldnвђt help smiling as rickвђs friend took off his glasses revealing another pair underneath finally they pulled back into traffic and nancy got a good look at gilbert without his getup on he was pretty cute he had glossy black hair and warm brown eyes that twinkled with laughter вђњgil is going to be the next host at the comedy basementвђќ rick said вђњhe does standupвђќ вђњi also do sit up and grow upвђќ gil announced everyone groaned throwing a proprietary arm around bessвђs shoulder rick instructed the driver to take them to fortysecond street and the hudson river вђњtoday weвђre going to do all those corny things you see in old movies about new yorkвђќ rick said вђњlike go on a boat trip around manhattan and to the top of the empire state building bess is a very oldfashioned girlвђќ he explained to his friend вђњrick arlen i am notвђќ bess protested secretly though she was flattered by his remark by the time they got to the west side pier the four of them were relaxed and having a great time before leaving the limo rick put on sunglasses and an old hat that way most of his face was covered вђњjust normal precautionsвђќ he insisted вђњthese go everywhere with me otherwise the fansвђwell iвђm sure you can imagineвђќ вђњi think you look adorable like thatвђќ gilbert said rick punched his friend lightly on the arm and they all piled out of the car вђњso gil how did you get involved in show businessвђќ nancy asked while they waited on deck for the cruise to start вђњoh now weвђre going way backвђto the day little freddie gilbert was born in illinois in a log cabinвђ no no just kidding how did i get involved in show business you ask thank goodness someone cares besides my motherвђќ in spite of his nonstop chatter and putdown humor nancy decided she liked gil he seemed a little lonely somehow and afraid to be just himself but instinct told her he had a good heart вђњyou see my real name is fred gilbert i had to change it after i got to new york there already was a fred gilbert out there in the show business stratosphere and so gilbert frost was born but he had the wrong nose so i changed that too and then i had to darken my hair by the time i was finished the same club owners who used to tell me to get lost were dying to sign me what can i tell you itвђs a crazy business maybe someday iвђll even make enough to pay my rent and if iвђm really lucky i might even hit it big like old rick hereвђќ вђњiвђm sure you willвђќ nancy said looking up the view from the boat was spectacularвђthe skyline sparkled in the noon sun but as the boat trip continued and they finally circled the northern tip of manhattan nancy couldnвђt help feeling that something was wrong all through the ride she had been keeping an eye on rick and she noticed other people were watching him too nancy saw two women look at him jab each other and whisper and a child tugged on his fatherвђs sleeve and pointed toward rick a portly man was also watching him although he pretended to be looking at something else as the boat swung into the final leg of the tour nancy recognized the portly man he had been the one cursing rory danner on the tour of the set just two days before вђњattention ladies and gentlemen we will be docking in a few minutes please disembark via the white stairs on the port side of the boat thatвђs the left to all you landlubbersвђќ the tour guide instructed вђњthatвђs him thatвђs rick arlenвђќ a young woman suddenly shrieked an excited murmur went through the crowd and everyone turned to look at rick вђњtake the hat off rory we know itвђs youвђќ a woman called out goodnaturedly the group laughed and rick cooperated вђњah my fansвђќ he smiled and waved вђњyouвђre the greatestвђall of you i love you madlyвђќ вђњrick may i have your autographвђќ a woman cried happily everyone crowded around him and began rifling through their bags for pens too вђњwrite one for my niece rickвђќ вђњoh mr arlen thank youвђќ rick was standing by the guardrail signing the backs of envelopes napkins address books and matchbook covers suddenly the man who had been on the studio tour lunged forward his eyes wild his voice like thunder вђњyou killed jill rowan and now you want to destroy serena livingstone well i wonвђt let you iвђm not going to let filth like you near her youвђre going to die rory dannerвђright nowвђќ with that the man lunged for rick sending him halfway over the rail he was about to plunge into the river chapter eight leaping for rick nancy and gilbert grabbed him just in time and pulled him safely back over the rail nancy felt a pair of hamlike hands on her shoulders she turned to face the assailant and delivered a swift kick to his left shin then she seized his hand and flipped him head over heels onto the deck the shipвђs crew then held him pinned against the deck until the ship had docked and the police arrived followed by a couple of reporters вђњokay fella letвђs goвђќ a police officer said leading the man to a patrol car вђњyouвђll feel a lot better after a nice long restвђќ вђњi killed rory danner and the world will be a better place for itвђќ the man exclaimed вђњhe was filth filthвђќ вђњsure sureвђќ another police officer said agreeing вђњyou can tell the doctor all about itвђќ as their limo pulled out of the parking lot the crowd cheered rick he was leaning out the window smiling and waving вђњthank you everyoneвђќ he called he slipped back into the car вђњwell thank goodness thatвђs over and thank you gil and nancyвђќ turning to bess he added вђњyou certainly know how to pick your friends loveвђќ gil still seemed a bit shaken вђњyou know rick the way you were hanging over the edge there i thought you were historyвђќ he shuddered вђњiвђm going to sign up for karate lessons next week i want to be prepared for fameвђќ вђњletвђs just put the whole thing behind us okay now itвђs time to celebrateвђќ rick grinned devilishly вђњwhy not go for the best driverвђtake us to trump towerвђќ later riding up the escalator from the lobby of the brassandmarble palace bess and nancy looked around in wonder the place was amazing вђњthis makes the river heights mall look like a momandpop storeвђќ nancy whispered she looked all around her as they rose ever higher through the glittering atrium вђњtell me about itвђќ bess said enthusiastically вђњrick i canвђt believe people actually live in this buildingвђќ вђњthey doвђќ he assured her вђњthere are apartments here that sell for millionsвђќ вђњseriouslyвђќ bess couldnвђt believe it вђњwhat do they have solid gold faucetsвђќ вђњalmostвђќ gil replied вђњyouвђd be amazed at what people spend their money onвђќ вђњcappuccino anyoneвђќ rick broke in cheerfully they had just come to an attractive cafe on an upper level soon they were all sitting around a table sipping cups of the strong italian coffee вђњyou know what being here makes me realizeвђќ bess was saying вђњiвђve realized that iвђd make a great millionaireвђќ вђњi think youвђd make a lovely one tooвђќ rick said flirting вђњin fact i saw something in a shop across the way that i think you should have be right backвђќ a minute later rick came back to the table holding a silk scarf printed in pastel geometric shapes it matched bessвђs outfit perfectly вђњoh rickвђќ she exclaimed вђњitвђs beautifulвђќ вђњwear it and think of meвђќ he murmuredвђќ вђњso everyone are you ready to scale the heights itвђs such a clear beautiful dayвђwhat do you say we catch the view from the empire state buildingвђќ вђњsounds greatвђќ bess was beaming anything rick said would have sounded great to her вђњi used to sell souvenirs at the observatoryвђќ gil threw in вђњthat was when i still worked for a livingвђќ he straightened up and helped nancy from her chair вђњmadameвђќ he said вђњyour chariot awaits that is rickвђs chariot awaitsвђќ he said correcting himself by the time they reached thirtyfourth street and made their way up to the top the sun had slipped much closer to the horizon rick and bess their arms around each otherвђs waists stood at the observatoryвђs edge gazing into the distance gil had stopped to chat with his old coworkers at the souvenir shop so nancy wandered off by herself up that high the wind cut like a knife seeming to come from all directions it blew nancyвђs hair wildly around her as she stared down at the magical city the noise from the street sounded like a low moan up there almost human and full of sadness it made nancy shudder for a moment as she looked out over the city below her she felt a growing sense of dread the police had arrested the deranged fan that afternoon but she was still worried in the late afternoon sun nancy had a sudden powerful feeling that someone else was after rick someone who was not only crazy but also clever determined and deadly nancy felt an icy shiver go through her someone was waiting down on the streetвђshe was sure of itвђwaiting to end rick arlenвђs life bess scooped up one last mouthful of chocolate mousse pie and sighed contentedly вђњwhat a dinner iвђm in heavenвђќ вђњnot badвђќ gil agreed glancing around at the glass walls of tavern on the green positioned on the edge of central park the view out the windows of the restaurant was of trees decorated with tiny white lights the park looked like an enchanted fairyland in direct contrast to the city around it when the check came rick picked it up вђњwhatвђs money for if not to treat friendsвђќ he asked placing a gold credit card on the small black lacquered tray the waiter had brought вђњwhat a dayвђќ bess remarked happily вђњwhat a night too iвђve had such a fabulous time today rick thanks to youвђќ rick looked genuinely pleased as he took her hand in his вђњthereвђs just one more thing iвђd like to do i could use a little exercise after this dinner and itвђs such a great nightвђwhy donвђt we take a walk beside the parkвђќ bessвђs eyes were twinkling with delight rick seemed to be having a hard time saying good night to her вђњa walk sounds wonderfulвђќ nancy said вђњgood weвђre onвђќ gil agreed stepping out onto the sidewalk along the park rick and bess linked arms they were completely caught up in each other as they giggled and joked walking ahead of the other two nancy watched them carefully as she half listened to gil who was telling her the rest of his life story вђњthen i realized i had to change my materialвђќ he was saying вђњnobody goes for rubberchicken jokes anymore so i began writing myself a whole new act вђќ nancy couldnвђt help worrying about bess she was heading for trouble nancy was sure of that even if rick was sincere how could it last they lived miles from each other and a broken heart was the last thing bess needed the sound of a speeding car made nancy spin around a taxicab jumped its lane and screeched diagonally across the street suddenly a broken heart was the least of bessвђs troubles the outofcontrol cab was headed onto the sidewalk aimed straight at rickвђand bess chapter nine вђњwatch outвђќ nancy screamed racing up to pull bess away from the oncoming taxi she managed to get just close enough to grab her friendвђs arm as the taxi swerved onto the sidewalk it barely missed the stunned bess before jumping the curb back onto the street and careening away bess stood absolutely still in the middle of the sidewalk вђњnancy am i okayвђќ she asked in a dazed voice вђњyour shirt is torn but i think youвђre fineвђќ suddenly bess looked around frantically вђњrick whereвђs rickвђќ вђњright hereвђќ he answered they all turned and saw rickвђs head poking out from behind a tree вђњsee i told you it would take a silver bullet to get me not even a scratchвђќ he added proudly showing them his arms and legs вђњdonвђt tell mme that was just an accidentвђќ gil stammered running a hand nervously through his hair вђњhe never even hit the brakesвђќ вђњheвђs right rickвђќ bess seemed quite shaken now вђњmaybe thereвђs more than one crazy fan after youвђќ nancy bit her lip and thought for a moment this latest incident confirmed her worst fears she knew now that the crude attempt on rickвђs life on the boat trip was just a sideshow the main event was still to come gil was still shaking вђњwell i donвђt know about you folksвђќ he said вђњbut iвђve had about all the excitement i can take for one day next time we get together rick remind me to take out extra insuranceвђќ вђњhey calm down itвђs the price of life in the fast lane thatвђs allвђќ rick laughed nervously вђњcome on iвђll give you a lift home on my way downtown bessвђќ turning to bess he pulled her gently to him and gave her a lingering kiss they walked back to the limo and nancy and gil climbed in nancy turned her head away embarrassed while bess and rick stood on the sidewalk they were whispering probably about what had just happened nancy frowned things looked bad very bad indeed it was as if bess hadnвђt even noticed that she and rick had almost been killed вђњitвђs just a feeling i get ned but itвђs a strong one somethingвђs very wrong hereвђќ nancy flung herself down on the dark blue sofa and filled her boyfriend ned nickerson in on everything that had happened since sheвђd arrived in new york вђњi only wish you werenвђt so far awayвђќ she sighed wistfully вђњsame hereвђќ ned agreed вђњi miss youвђќ вђњi miss you too and i could really use your help on this caseвђќ вђњcan i do anything from hereвђќ вђњhonestly i donвђt think so except share a little of your wonderful insight iвђm completely baffled by the whole thing right nowвђќ вђњsounds like you need some onthescene help iвђd be on the next flight but i have a big paper due i do want you to promise not to take any unnecessary chances thoughвђќ вђњcome on ned you know me iвђm always very carefulвђќ nancy said teasing him вђњyes i know thatвђs why i want you to keep a low profile i want you to be in one piece the next time i see youвђќ nancy blew a kiss into the phone and said goodbye after she hung up she smiled sadly if only ned were able to meet her in new york just then the front doorbell rang nancy went to open it and before her stood mattie jensen her rich auburn hair was pulled up in a ponytail and she was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt she looked almost as young as nancy вђњhiya kiddoвђќ the actress said bubbling вђњeloise told me she was going to the ballet tonight so i thought you guys might want a little companyвђќ how could anyone as beautiful and successful as mattie jensen be all alone at ten oвђclock on a saturday night nancy wondered it didnвђt seem possible but there she was sheвђs lonely nancy realized вђњsure come on inвђќ she said вђњbess is in the showerвђќ вђњhey i read about what happened to you today on the boat trip after everything heвђs been through rick must be glad they caught the guy they said the man tried to throw him overboardвђќ вђњhmmhmmвђќ nancy replied wishing she could have shared mattieвђs sense of relief вђњthey said the guy was released from a mental institution a few weeks agoвђќ вђњi didnвђt hear that but from the way he was acting вђќ nancyвђs voice trailed off вђњoh nancy iвђm so relieved now iвђll finally be able to sleep at nightвђќ mattie smiled softly but nancy just turned away вђњwhatвђs the matter nancy are you still upsetвђќ nancy heaved an enormous sigh вђњmattie i hate to say this i know youвђre not going to like it but i donвђt think the man they arrested today is the person weвђre afterвђќ вђњbutвђbut they said heвђd been stalking rick for weeksвђќ вђњhe may have been but i donвђt think heвђs the one who tampered with the light and sent the chocolatesвђќ mattie gazed at nancy in amazement then she nodded вђњokay tell me why you think it isnвђt the same personвђќ вђњtwo reasons for starters someone tried to run rick over tonightвђќ вђњnoвђќ mattie exclaimed вђњiвђm afraid so donвђt try to tell rick thatвђhe insists it was a hitandrun accident but i was there mattie the cab never blew its horn never slowed downвђand the license plate was covered over with mud this all may be circumstantial evidence but still вђќ mattie was silent taking it all in вђњand thenвђќ nancy said continuing вђњthereвђs the photograph of rick the one that was all scratched up it wasnвђt just a publicity shot the kind he might autograph for a fan there was a rгsumг of all the shows heвђs been in stapled to the back of it correct me if iвђm wrong but actors donвђt just give out their rгsumгs to the general public do theyвђќ вђњno of course not but lots of people would have themвђќ вђњlike who a producerвђќ вђњsure when an actor auditions for a job he always brings a picture and rгsumгвђќ she said sitting down вђњpappas would have them so would the director and lillian of course his agent would have hundreds i suppose even dwayne might have a few left unless he cleaned out his files recentlyвђќ mattie stared at the wall with a faraway look вђњbut dwayne is harmless iвђm sureвђвђќ вђњwait why dwayne i thought rick said he was with international managementвђќ вђњyes but when rick was first in new york dwayne was his agent the summer i first met both of them we were in an acting company doing shakespeare in oregon we were so sure of ourselvesвђќ she mused вђњanyway that fall we set out for new york and the вђbig timeвђ rick and i did all right but dwayne who was trying to make it as an actor still ran into trouble getting parts he was the wrong type somehow so he decided to open a talent agency instead he really got our careers moving tooвђќ just then bess stepped into the room a terry bathrobe wrapped around her вђњi thought i heard somebody hi mattieвђќ she chirped вђњdid nancy tell you about our day kind of wild huhвђќ вђњi read about part of it in the paperвђќ mattie said вђњit wasвђвђќ the telephone rang interrupting her вђњthatвђs probably for meвђќ bess said as she dove for the phone вђњoh hiвђќ she purred into the receiver вђњyes i thought you mightвђ really hmmmвђвђќ suddenly bess turned a deep crimson and let out a wild giggle вђњumm just a minuteвђќ she said вђњi think iвђll take this in the other roomвђќ carefully putting the receiver on its side bess gestured wildly at nancy and then the phone вђњitвђs rickвђќ she whispered excitedly вђњhang up for me okayвђќ with that she ran into the bedroom nancy turned to mattie she was pale and her glamorous face was drawn tight staring vacantly toward the bedroom her enormous eyes began to fill with tears nancy replaced the receiver вђњmattie вђќ she murmured gently вђњyou still love him donвђt youвђќ mattie collapsed back into her chair вђњyes i do heaven knows whyвђќ she answered вђњjust a habit i guess iвђve loved him since i first saw him weвђve been through a lot togetherвђќ nancy put her hand comfortingly on mattieвђs arm as they listened to bess giggling happily in the other room nancy could feel mattieвђs grief if a girl were talking with ned like that sheвђd be crushed too вђњbut thenвђќ mattie said with a sad smile вђњrick obviously doesnвђt feel the same way well iвђd better go i might as well get some sleep weвђre still having brunch tomorrow morning rightвђќ nancy nodded and walked mattie to the door watching as she went down the stairs to her garden apartment just as the actress was about to disappear nancy remembered what she had been thinking before the phone rang вђњmattie waitвђќ she called the actress looked up from the stairwell вђњyesвђќ вђњhow could i get into dwayne casperвђs office iвђd just like to take a look aroundвђќ вђњwellвђќ said mattie her brow wrinkling as she thought вђњi suppose you could set up an appointment and say you were an aspiring actress you could even say we did a show together onceвђќ вђњthat might work i donвђt think he ever noticed me before whenever i saw him i wasnвђt near you or him but i donвђt have any pictures or rгsumгsвђќ she reminded mattie вђњoh thatвђs okayвђќ mattie assured her вђњjust tell him youвђre new in town ask him for adviceвђhe loves that dwayneвђs really good with newcomers and heвђll be flattered that you came to him for guidance if you call first thing monday morning and say i told you to call i guarantee youвђll get in but i promise you dwayne is harmless i should knowвђweвђve been friends for yearsвђќ вђњi hope youвђre right but if dwayneвђs got anything to do with this iвђve got to find out and mattieвђќ she said softly вђњdonвђt worry about bess i know her she falls in and out of love all the time sheвђll get over rick as soon as she gets back home youвђll seeвђќ mattie stared into the distance trying to hide her feelings вђњmaybeвђќ she murmured softly giving nancy a strange look she disappeared down the stairwell to her apartment nancy could hear her door close behind her that night tossing and turning in her bed nancy couldnвђt sleep her eyes kept popping open and sheвђd lie still and stare at the ceiling while her mind was in high gear and she worked through detail after detail if only they added up rick arlen she could picture his handsome face with that winning grin of his and those sparkling azure eyes someone wanted him dead but who rick might not win any popularity contests among the people who knew him best but only one person hated him enough to want him dead it took a very clever person to conceal such powerful hatred so successfully nancy tried to imagine who it might be but there were so many people wishing him ill pappas casper lillian weiss and who knows how many others there were just on the set alone nancy had had cases this difficult before and sheвђd solved them successfully but this time there were so many possibilities which one should she investigate first as she drifted to sleep the shadowy figure of rick came back into her mind he was signing autographs for a crowd of fans a monstrous figure walked toward him slowly stalking him nancy tried to cry out but her voice was caught in her throat the figure turned toward her seeing her for the first time eyes of indescribable evil glowed at her paralyzing her with fear then the figure drew a long and sharp knife that glinted in the dim light nancy tried to scream but nothing happened the shadowy figure was getting closer and closerвђ nancy awoke with a gasp and sat up in bed the clockradio by her bed read am it was only a dream thank goodness she thought her heart racing but it was so real sighing with relief she turned over ready to go back to sleep thatвђs when she noticed that bessвђs bed was empty in an instant nancy was up and out of bed she hurried into the kitchenвђno bess she checked the bathroom the living room then ran back to the bedroom nothing it couldnвђt be but it was bess was gone chapter ten the sound of a car pulling up in front of the building sent nancy to the window opening it and leaning out she saw a shiny black limousine gleaming in the light of a streetlamp a second later bess stepped out onto the sidewalk she was followed by rick who wrapped his arm around her shoulder вђњyou wonвђt mind if i donвђt walk you to the door will youвђќ he asked just loud enough for nancy to hear bess twirled around and leaned closer into his arms вђњof course notвђќ she said вђњi had a great time it was fun zipping around the city just the two of us thanksвђќ they fell into a kiss that seemed as if it would never end standing at the window nancy was alarmed as flighty as bess could be it wasnвђt like her to sneak off in the middle of the night rick had gone to bessвђs head like bubbly champagne nancy could only hope her friend wasnвђt in for a nasty вђњhangoverвђќ when it was all over вђњnancyвђќ bess called out in surprise when she saw her friend waiting for her at the door to the apartment вђњwhat are you doing upвђќ вђњexcuse meвђќ nancy answered in a low voice careful not to wake her aunt вђњbut what are you doing up is the questionвђќ bessвђs eyes were sparkling вђњoh nancyвђќ she said breathily вђњnew york is so wonderful iвђve never really noticed before how incredible it is i just have to live here someday soonвђќ turning to her friend bess continued вђњwe went everywhere we rode around wall street and went to the south street seaport and then to this incredible disco le grandine absolutely everyone there knew rick and he likes me i mean he really likes me this could be it this could be the man iвђve been looking for all my lifeвђќ вђњbessвђќ nancy began as gently as she could вђњdidnвђt you think it might be just a little dangerous to be going out with rick in the middle of the night when someone is trying to kill himвђќ bess looked annoyed вђњdonвђt spoil this for me okayвђќ she walked past nancy into the apartment and went to their room nancy glared at her friend as she disappeared down the hall bess could be so irritating sometimes earlier that day she had narrowly missed getting herself killed and here she was laughing in the face of danger вђњyou think iвђm being sillyвђќ nancy asked following after her вђњof course i do they arrested the guy didnвђt they rick convinced me that the runaway cab was only an accident besides nobody would mess with rick you should feel his musclesвђtheyвђre like steelвђќ bess slipped out of her satiny dress and kicked off the slingbacks she had worn to go dancing too tired to change into a nightgown she fell back on the bed in her lacy pink slip вђњoh nancyвђќ she murmured excitedly вђњheвђs so wonderfulвђand so cuteвђќ reaching over she snapped off the light between their beds вђњam i going to have happy dreams tonightвђќ as nancy lay in her bed watching the light of dawn brighten the room she couldnвђt help worrying about bess this was obviously more than just a schoolgirl crush and nancy was more convinced than ever that this fairytale romance was not going to have a happy ending the clock by nancyвђs bed read am bess was still asleep a contented smile on her lips nancy figured sheвђd be out for a few more hours the apartment was quiet looking out the window nancy saw only one person on the street the whole city seemed to still be asleep at eleven sheвђd be going out to brunch with her aunt and mattie but that was still two hours away after pulling on her favorite jeans and slipping her new yellow sweater over her head nancy decided that a walk might be just what she needed to help her think and unwind stepping out onto the street nancy took a deep breath of the fresh spring air the birds were singing and the goldengreen leaves on the trees swayed in the morning breeze on this quiet sunday morning with church bells ringing in the distance new york seemed like a small nineteenthcentury town nancy loved it as she walked she imagined she was part of that older simpler time after a while she came to a tiny park tucked between two buildings the morning sun was just beginning to warm the benches and a few people were out with their children pushing them on swings and watching as they ran and played nancy couldnвђt help herself she sat down on a bench and let the sun warm her face relaxing for the first time in days a minute later the touch of a hand on her shoulder made nancy jump glancing around she found herself looking into the dark eyes of lillian weiss вђњwell if it isnвђt our fair rescuerвђќ lillian smirked вђњfancy meeting you hereвђќ nancy was puzzled new york was a huge city the odds of running into someone that she knew were small to say the least вђњmind if i sit downвђќ lillian asked casually вђњiвђm dead tired havenвђt slept all nightвђќ nancy moved over to make room for her she felt uncomfortable in the company of such an unpleasant person but she didnвђt want to be impolite вђњare you still trying to save rick arlenвђs lifeвђќ lillian asked suddenly looking right into nancyвђs eyes she certainly is blunt nancy thought well i might as well be blunt right back whoever was trying to kill rick already knew that she was on the case вђњstill tryingвђќ she admitted вђњyou really shouldnвђt botherвђќ lillian said she looked down at her feet so nancy couldnвђt read her expression вђњi donвђt understandвђќ said nancy prompting her lillian looked at her curiously as if she were sizing nancy up after what seemed an eternity she fixed her eyes on nancy вђњrick is going to die and thereвђs nothing you can do about it and iвђll tell you something elseвђwhatever happens to him he has coming he got where he is by stepping on a lot of people but he made one mistake along the way he stepped on the wrong person and heвђs going to pay for itвђќ nancy couldnвђt believe what she was hearing was this a confession a warning she wasnвђt sure how to take lillianвђs statement as suddenly as she had appeared lillian stood up to leave вђњwellвђќ she said fingering the hem of her purple lambвђswool sweater вђњnice running into youвђќ she gazed at nancy with a tight smile вђњiвђll say one thing for youвђyouвђve got gutsвђќ nancy watched as the strange young woman walked away she was sure now that lillian had deliberately arranged to run into her but why nancy was more in the dark than ever вђњthe restaurant weвђre going to isnвђt far away nancy weвђll just ring for mattie on our way outвђќ eloise was standing in front of the hall mirror fussing with a teal blue silk scarf вђњis bess ready yetвђќ вђњbessвђќ nancy called as she knocked on the door of the room where her friend lay sleeping вђњdonвђt you want to have brunch with usвђќ the answer was muffled so nancy opened the door вђњleave the addressвђќ was all bess could manage вђњiвђll meet you thereвђќ with that she flopped over and buried her face in the pillow nancy closed the door eloise waited by the main door of the apartment while nancy wrote down the address and left it on the telephone table вђњah youthвђќ eloise said smiling wistfully вђњi used to be able to sleep like that on weekend mornings now iвђm always up at the crack of dawnвђќ with a wink eloise tugged on nancyвђs arm вђњshall we if i wait for my morning coffee much longer i wonвђt be worth knowingвђќ as they sat in the restaurant eating eggs benedict nancy couldnвђt stop thinking of her conversation with lillian weiss the look in her eyes had been so intense could it be that lillian was the one who was trying to kill rick or maybe she was just hiding the identity of the person who really was nancy decided not to mention running into her still she had to know what lillianвђs personal situation regarding rick was вђњmattieвђќ she began offhandedly вђњtell me more about lillian weiss i know you said lots of people hate rick but she seems to hate him more than mostвђќ mattie looked up amazed вђњyou donвђt think sheвђs behind it all do youвђќ вђњi donвђt really knowвђќ nancy replied вђњbut iвђd like to know more about herвђќ вђњlillianвђs the one rick broke up with me forвђќ mattie blurted out she looked down at her plate unhappily вђњi couldnвђt believe it when he fold me i mean iвђd stuck by him through all the bad times when he finally made it he just dropped me it was soвђвђќ she paused for a moment unable to go on вђњвђso humiliatingвђќ she took out her handkerchief and blew her nose suddenly mattie laughed вђњbut thatвђs rick for you they were only together for two months he stuck with her till she introduced him to the film people she knew then he dumped her i really canвђt blame lillian for hating him i just wish sheвђd get on with her life sheвђs justвђi donвђt knowвђthe kind of person who nurses a grudge the kind that never lets go of anything know what i meanвђќ вђњyesвђќ said nancy thoughtfully вђњi think i doвђќ вђњoh do i dare try one of theseвђќ eloise was asking with a smile as the waiter held up a plate of miniature pastries вђњoh go ahead eloiseвђќ mattie said with a grin trying to put all thoughts of rick and lillian behind her eloise looked at the pastries and thought for a moment вђњwhy notвђќ she quipped lifting a small one onto her plate just then the manager came up to the table вђњexcuse me ladies is there a nancy drew at this tableвђќ вђњwhy yesвђќ eloise answered looking at her niece вђњms drew you have a phone callвђќ the manager said вђњyou can pick it up at the main desk by the coatrackвђќ вђњit must be bessвђќ eloise guessed вђњshe probably woke up and realized sheвђd never be able to make it here after allвђќ nancy thanked the manager and made her way to the phone вђњhi bessвђќ she said into the receiver but it wasnвђt bess a raspy electronic voice warned her вђњstay away from rick arlen nancy drew and tell your little friend sheвђd better stay away tooвђќ with that the phone line went dead in nancyвђs trembling hand chapter eleven вђњby appointment onlyвђќ вђњput your picture and rгsumг under the doorвђќ вђњdo not ring buzzer without an appointmentвђќ nancy read the signs and gulped although sheвђd called earlier and left a message on dwayneвђs answering machine nancy felt sheвђd have a better chance of seeing him if she went in person but getting inside dwayne casperвђs office wasnвђt exactly going to be easy with a sigh and a deep breath she pressed the buzzer for a moment it was so quiet that she wondered whether anybody was in the office at all then crisp footsteps sounded on the other side of the door вђњdo you have an appointmentвђќ dwayneвђs voice was all business вђњwell noвђќ nancy replied вђњnot exactlyвђќ вђњin that case i suggest you learn to readвђќ вђњbut mr casperвђќ nancy said in her most polite voice вђњi left a message on your machine mattie jensen said you would talk to me my name is diane elliot вђќ nancy heard a click as he unlocked the door it swung open and a smiling dwayne casper greeted her вђњwell why didnвђt you just say youвђre a friend of mattieвђsвђќ he asked вђњcome in you must understand that if i opened the door to every struggling actor in this town iвђd never be able to get any work doneвђќ вђњoh thank you mr casperвђќ nancy said sounding grateful in the front reception area was a large empty desk no receptionist nancy noted вђњright this wayвђќ dwayne said with a sugary smile he led her into his plush office вђњhow do you know mattieвђќ вђњoh well i was an extra on вђdannerвђs dreamвђ and she was kind enough to talk to me she did say sheвђd call you about me but i guess she got busyвђќ that much was true nancy thought dwayne settled into his chair and looked at her appraisingly вђњso you know luther parks tooвђќ вђњwell no not personally that isвђќ вђњi see has mattie ever seen your work apart from extra work that isвђќ here we go nancy thought time to start lyingвђand lying big вђњoh yesвђќ she assured him вђњwe did a production of the sound of music together in the midwest mattie played the oldest daughter and i played one of the younger childrenвђќ an amused look passed over dwayneвђs face вђњthat must have been at least eight years ago mattie wasnвђt more than a kid herself back then unfortunately i couldnвђt see that productionвђќ i know nancy thought thatвђs what mattie told me dwayne leaned back in his swivel chair he seemed warm now even friendly вђњso let me guess youвђve come to the big city because you want to be a real actressвђќ delighted that the agent had bought her story nancy threw herself into her reallife acting role вђњyes sirвђќ she answered breathlessly вђњwell well wellвђ what shall we do about thatвђќ dwayne pursed his lips thinking then he stood up walked to the door and locked it вђњso we wonвђt be disturbedвђќ he explained a sudden chill made its way down nancyвђs spine if the electronic voice on the phone yesterday had been dwayneвђs she was now trapped вђњwhat did you say your name wasвђќ dwayne had a pen poised over a small pink index card вђњdiane elliotвђќ nancy said looking the agent squarely in the eye вђњwith two ls and one tвђќ вђњthatвђs a good name for an actress youвђre luckyвђќ he smiled вђњnow tell me diane why did you come to me there are hundreds of agents in this cityвђќ вђњwell mattie spoke so highly of you mr casperвђќ nancy began dwayneвђs face grew pink with pleasure вђњand i know you once represented rick arlenвђвђќ at the mention of rickвђs name the agentвђs face clouded over вђњah yes the irrepressible mr aвђќ вђњheвђs not with you anymore is heвђќ nancy was being bolder than she liked to be but she had to lead dwayne on вђњrick his real name is richard aburtuski by the way no heвђs no longer one of my clients i donвђt deal with failures ms elliotвђќ nancy looked genuinely surprised dwayne laughed derisively вђњyou think iвђm being ridiculousвђafter all heвђs at the height of success but i can tell you with certainty that leaving this agency is the biggest mistake arlen ever madeвђexcept for his decision to be an actor of course the man canвђt act his way out of a paper bag he depends on his looks to get him by but heвђll learn they all learn eventually that the biggest factor in success is loyalty and he has noneвђќ dwayneвђs face was red with anger he wasnвђt through on the subject of rick arlen but just then the buzzer rang вђњwhoever it is will go awayвђќ he said вђњi have no appointments scheduled todayвђќ the buzzer rang through the office once again and then again and again finally dwayne couldnвђt stand it anymore he bolted from his chair and unlocked the door вђњiвђm going to tell this idiot to go away do you have an appointmentвђќ he yelled hurrying through the reception area вђњbecause if you donвђt youвђd better learn to readвђќ вђњbut mr casper you must see meвђќ bessвђs voice was muffled through the door but her sense of urgency came through loud and clear вђњiвђm a really great actress and i need an agent let me read for you mr casper and you can judge for yourselfвђќ laughing bitterly dwayne called through the door вђњyoung lady iвђm a very busy man and i donвђt handle street performers please leave me aloneвђќ вђњbut iвђm an actress just listenвђќ bess began to recite a passage from romeo and juliet good old bess nancy thought with a smile she really was quite an actress when she had to be they had devised a plan after nancy was able to get inside dwayneвђs office bess would divert his attention so that nancy could search it as soon as dwayne was out of sight in the reception area nancy began to rummage through the papers on his desk the longer bess was able to divert his attention from nancy the more nancy would be able to find out and from the sound of things nancy thought she just might have all day вђњand i sing too just listen to this mr casperвђќ bess launched into a wellknown show tune in a loud offkey voice вђњplease young womanвђќ dwayne begged вђњwhy donвђt you go sing in the park or something youвђre giving me a headacheвђќ aha nancyвђs eyes opened wide as she looked at the papers in front of her an eviction noticeвђand several large bills from creditors searching further she found warnings from collection agencies even threats dwayne casperвђs talent agency was obviously in desperate trouble вђњbut mr casper iвђm the next mattie jensen everyone says i look just like her except iвђm prettierвђќ вђњwhatвђќ dwayne exploded вђњnobody but nobody ever wasвђќ is or will be prettier than mattie jensen mattie is one of a kindвђabsolutely uniqueвђќ nancy cocked her head to listen it was clear to her that where mattie was concerned dwayneвђs interest was more than just professional вђњwell iвђm unique too mr casperвђterribly unique and incredibly talentedвђќ вђњmy dear young womanвђќвђdwayne was practically screaming nowвђвђњif you donвђt leave at once iвђll call the police and may i say in parting that with your nerve youвђll probably go far in this businessвђќ quickly nancy put everything back in the desk exactly where sheвђd found it when dwayne returned he was trying hard to calm down вђњiвђm sorry now where were we before that ghastly woman interrupted usвђќ nancy shifted uncomfortably in her seat dwayneвђs eyes had a wild look in them and having found what sheвђd come for all she wanted to do was get out as quickly as she could вђњyou know mr casper i feel like such a fool but i just rememberedвђiвђve got an appointment with a photographer in fifteen minutes heвђs going to take head shots of meвђќ вђњoh i seeвђќ dwayne replied still smiling вђњwell is he any good maybe i know him whatвђs his nameвђќ вђњhis name uhвђвђќ nancy panicked for a moment what could she say finally she blurted out вђњned nickerson heвђs new in townвђjust got in from la but mattie says heвђs goodвђќ вђњhmmmвђќ dwayne frowned вђњnever heard of him well diane come and see me when youвђve got your pictures iвђll see what i can do for youвђќ he extended his hand for her to shake his grip was firm like iron and his eyes searched hers intently вђњcome to think of it have we met before you look a bit familiarвђќ dwayne said вђњwell weвђve never actually metвђќ she replied вђњbut as i said before i did do extra work on вђdannerвђs dreamвђвђќ вђњthat must be it thenвђќ he said вђњyouвђd better get going if you donвђt want to be late for your shoot look forward to seeing you again ms elliotвђќ вђњthank you so much youвђve been a great helpвђќ nancy said and left the office down in the lobby bess was munching on a candy bar and smiling broadly вђњhowвђd i doвђќ she mumbled her mouth full of chocolate вђњbravoвђќ nancy applauded laughing вђњi especially loved your rendition of вђtonightвђ it wasвђdifferent very differentвђќ вђњyou really think soвђќ asked bess fluffing her hair and winking вђњand wait till i tell you what i foundвђќ nancy said grabbing her friend by the arm вђњbut weвђd better get over to вђdannerвђs dreamвђ right away i want mattie to hear this tooвђќ the crisp spring air whirled around them as they walked briskly up broadway toward columbus avenue вђњheвђs really in bad shape huhвђќ bess asked incredulously after nancy filled her in вђњeverybody in the world is after him and when people are that desperate it can make them pretty crazy i want to keep a close eye on dwayne casper bess i think he may be our manвђќ pushing through the glass doors of worldwide broadcasting nancy and bess beamed at the security guard вђњhiвђќ nancy called out вђњweвђre back againвђќ вђњwhy hello girls you heard the set was closed didnвђt youвђќ the man asked вђњtheyвђve been having a little trouble in there and pappas sent down the order i canвђt let anybody in not even you twoвђќ вђњi knowвђќ nancy told him вђњbut could you call mattie jensen we just need to talk to her for a few minutesвђќ the security guard ran his finger down the list of telephone extensions on his desk вђњsure thing mattie letвђs seeвђ ah here it isвђќ but before he had a chance to pick up the intercom he was interrupted by the boom of a powerful explosion the sound of shattering glass tore through the air followed by a bloodcurdling scream вђњnancyвђќ gasped bess in terror вђњthat was rickвђќ chapter twelve without waiting for permission nancy and bess followed the security guard backstage losing themselves in a mob of people the girls made their way toward rickвђs dressing room the lighting designer had been the first to reach the room itself вђњcall an ambulanceвђќ he bellowed frantically nancy and bess arrived a minute later and watched in shock as kay wills the makeup artist staggered down the hall toward them her skin was ashen and she was trembling all over choking back tears she turned around and sobbed вђњitвђs badвђreally badвђќ nancy stood on tiptoe and craned her neck to see inside rickвђs dressing room the first thing that caught her eye was the wide mirror over the makeup table it had been shattered into a thousand pieces an emergency medical team had arrived and they were on their way up the hall now pushing aside the crowd of onlookers вђњmake roomвђќ nancy called flattening herself against the wall вђњrick oh where is heвђќ bess cried frantically she bit the back of her hand as she strained to get a good look just then rick appeared in the doorway he had a stunned look on his face his blond hair had been blown every which way and the white towel around his shoulders was stained bright red looking down nancy gaspedвђrickвђs hands were bleeding as soon as the paramedics saw him they broke into a run gathering around him they picked him up and laid him on a stretcher they began pulling slivers of glass out of his hands as rick winced in pain вђњback off everybodyвђќ one of the paramedics shouted as the crowd began to press in on them again in what seemed like just a few seconds they had finished their immediate task and lifted the stretcher they carried the wounded star down the hall out of the building and into a waiting ambulance once rick was gone the bystanders milled around not knowing what to do the police arrived and began inspecting the scene interviewing people and collecting evidence nancy walked over to kay who was now sitting on the floor in a corner of the hall she still looked pale as a ghost вђњwhat happened kayвђќ nancy asked gently crouching down beside her вђњhe was wwiping off hhis cold creamвђвђќ kay stammered staring off into space вђњand the mirror just exploded thank god he had that towel over his face heвђd be blindвђworse maybe and i was just on my way in thereвђit could have been me tooвђќ a few minutes later while police combed the area for clues pappas assembled the cast and crew вђњlisten up i have a report from the hospital about rickвђќ the excited buzzing died down as the producerвђs voice boomed out into the vast studio вђњheвђs going to be okay they said it looked a lot worse than it really was and that theyвђre going to release him tonight his hands will be bandaged for a while of course but we can work around that iвђve already contacted our writers to come up with some material thatвђll explain his bandaged hands if we canвђt work this into the story line somehow luther will just stick to closeups in any case weвђre not going to let this shut us down as far as iвђm concerned youвђre all still under contract and that includes rick i want everybody back here tomorrow at seven sharpвђќ just then the police officer who had been examining rickвђs dressing room let out a long low whistle вђњhey chief look what we foundвђќ the policeman held up a small metal object вђњitвђs a twentyfourhour timer whoever set this up must have done it yesterdayвђќ pappas standing a few feet away nearly choked вђњthatвђs impossible this set is closed down tight on sunday i even hired extra security my own mother couldnвђt have gotten in hereвђќ вђњwhich meansвђќ said the chief вђњthat it was probably an inside jobвђќ now nancy finally had a definite lead she could rule out dwayne casper he couldnвђt have gotten onto the set to plant the bomb but that left her with only two other suspectsвђpappas and lillian their faces floated in front of her tightly shut eyes as she leaned against the wall trying to concentrate amid the confusion nancy shook her head and opened her eyes she was back at square one with a dangerous killer still on the loose right under her nose iвђve got to get put of here she suddenly realized quickly nancy sprang up and elbowed her way through a group of technicians hovering by the studio door вђњcome onвђќ she shouted to bess вђњweвђve got to goвђќ pulling her friend by the arm nancy made straight for the front exit but she stopped short when she saw lillian standing directly in front of her a smug smile on her face вђњiвђm way ahead of you miss teen detectiveвђќ she said smirking вђњway aheadвђќ вђњwhatвђs wrong with herвђќ bess wanted to know as they hailed a taxi on the corner вђњshe gives me the creepsвђќ nancy didnвђt answer she told the cab driver the name of the hospital as they piled in вђњand hurryвђќ she added stepping off the elevator on the fifth floor nancy and bess had no trouble finding rickвђs room it was the one with the two police officers in front of it oh well thought nancy at least heвђs safe in there still she couldnвђt help feeling as though she had failed miserably the police were in on the case now so there wasnвђt much point in continuing her investigation and besides she hadnвђt managed to come up with very much had she вђњsorry miss you canвђt go in this roomвђќ one of the officers told bess when she tried to enter вђњi must see rickвђќ bess said frantically вђњa miss jensenвђs in there with mr arlen nowвђќ bess froze вђњoh i seeвђвђќ she finally managed to say вђњhas she been there very longвђќ вђњever since we got here miss about half an hourвђќ he cracked open the door to look inside вђњseems like she might be awhile longer tooвђќ bess stepped back staring anxiously at the halfopen door through it she could hear rickвђs voice and it was not the voice of a confident tv star вђњmattie oh mattie iвђm so scared someone really is trying to kill meвђќ вђњdonвђt worry my darlingвђќ she replied in a soft voice вђњthe police are here theyвђll protect youвђќ вђњyou know mattie you were right all along you were the only one who saw the truth mattie if i come out of this mess alive i swear iвђm going to make everything up to you i need you mattie i need you so badlyвђno one else ever meant a thing to me youвђre the only one iвђve ever lovedвђќ вђњiвђve heard enoughвђќ bess turned and ran down the hall covering her mouth with her hands вђњbess bess waitвђќ nancy called after her вђњleave me aloneвђќ she was fighting back her tears but losing the battle вђњi canвђt believe itвђќ she sobbed вђњi just canвђt believe itвђќ nancy started to go after bess but thought better of it right then bess needed to work this out on her own but nancy wondered about the force of her friendвђs reaction what was it about this guy that caused women to fall instantly in love with him mattie and rick had stopped talking and the police officer silently closed the door again no sense waiting around nancy decided out on the sidewalk nancy found bess her eyes were brimming over with tears and her mascara was smeared all over her face she looked utterly forlorn вђњcome on bess letвђs go homeвђќ nancy suggested gently taking her friendвђs hand bess nodded listlessly allowing herself to be led the two friends were silent all the way back to eloiseвђs apartment looking over at bess nancy wished she could comfort her somehow she knew that bess really hurt bessвђs brave hero had turned out to be not so brave after all and worse than that he was in love with someone else as they got out of the cab nancy caught sight of her aunt eloise entering the building вђњhi aunt eloiseвђќ she called as she hurried up to greet her вђњhi nancyвђbessвђќ she said as they entered the building вђњdid you have a nice dayвђќ вђњyouвђre never going to believe what happened todayвђќ bess said in a soft voice she had finally gotten control of herself вђњwell as soon as we get upstairs letвђs kick off our shoes and relax and you can tell me all about itвђќ eloise replied moving toward the mailboxes the three were in the mail alcove when eloise looked down and spotted a small box wrapped in brown paper on the package table she glanced at it and scooped it up вђњnancy itвђs addressed to youвђќ she said noticing it had no stamps as she started to hand it to nancy she froze the box was ticking chapter thirteen nancy sprang into action вђњbess get on the house phone and get someone to call the policeвђќ while bess was contacting a neighbor nancy and eloise examined the package вђњi think the ticking sounds different nowвђќ nancyвђs aunt said in a frightened whisper she was still holding the box but now in trembling hands вђњletвђs take it outsideвђќ slowly and calmly the two went out of the building and walked to the curb as soon as they had stopped and put the box down two police bombsquad officers arrived it didnвђt take them long to discover that the box contained an ordinary harmless alarm clock вђњiвђve never been so happy to see an alarm clock in my entire lifeвђќ nancyвђs aunt smiled with relief and

eloise nancy and bess thanked the men and they turned and headed back into the building and up to eloiseвђs apartment nancy bit her lip вђњwait a minute aunt eloiseвђќ she said trying to stop her aunt from calling the airport she knew her aunt was only trying to protect her but how could she leave new york while a dangerous killer was still after rick even if he wasnвђt the greatest guy in the world he didnвђt deserve to die and obviously the killer was getting closer and closer next time he might succeed вђњour tickets are for the day after tomorrowвђќ she called out as her aunt was about to lift the phone вђњmaybe i can solve the case before thenвђќ вђњforget it nancy iвђm not going to let you risk your lifeвђnot even for a couple more daysвђќ eloise sounded definite вђњand besides

river heights as we planned originally but honestly i could never live with myself if i knew iвђd walked away when i could have helpedвђќ eloise looked down at the floor nancy had gotten to her bess despite everything had to smile sleuthing was in nancyвђs blood вђњall right nancyвђќ eloise said reluctantly вђњi do have only myself to blameвђi did introduce you to mattieвђќ вђњthanks aunt eloiseвђќ nancy cried warmly throwing her arms around the older womanвђs shoulders вђњyouвђre a peach you know thatвђќ вђњsome peach i invite you to new york for a vacation and you wind up running all over town tracking down a murderer and getting bomb threats delivered to your doorвђќ вђњhe or she is not a murdererвђnot yet anywayвђќ nancy said вђњnobodyвђs been killed and i hope we can keep it that way now if youвђll excuse me thereвђs something iвђve got to take care of right awayвђќ вђњwhoвђs thereвђќ came mattieвђs surprised voice in response to nancyвђs knock вђњitвђs me may i come inвђќ вђњoh nancyвђќ mattie said when she opened the door вђњwasnвђt it awfulвђќ mattie looked exhausted obviously she had just been through quite an ordeal вђњcome on inвђќ she added distractedly вђњsorry the place is such a mess i just got back from the hospitalвђќ вђњhowвђs rick doingвђќ nancy asked вђњheвђs going to be okay butвђoh nancy his hands they hurt him terribly i just canвђt believe heвђs actually going to do the show tomorrowвђќ вђњwhatвђќ she gasped вђњtomorrowвђќ nancy was truly amazedвђhe had sounded so frightened at the hospital i have to give him a lot of credit she thought he really was brave вђњpappas showed up at the hospital he just burst in past the guards i was there for the whole thing he couldnвђt stop apologizing for this and all the other things that have been happening on the set lately he even promised to hire rick a bodyguard and to get some plainclothes detectives to be at the studio until this whole thing is over but rick said something about loyalty to his fellow actors and just shrugged it off and told pappas heвђd be back at work tomorrow as shaken up as rick was he just couldnвђt say noвђќ she sighed miserably вђњi donвђt know how iвђm going to get through tomorrowвђќ she said вђњiвђm so worried about him oh nancy what am i going to do if heвђs killed iвђll justвђiвђllвђoh i donвђt know what iвђll doвђќ mattie seemed to be on the brink of hysteria вђњhold on mattie itвђs going to be okayвђќ said nancy trying to comfort her вђњiвђm still here and iвђve got one more day in town i havenвђt given up yetвђќ mattie looked into nancyвђs eyes and a glimmer of hope showed on her face вђњyouвђyou mean itвђќ вђњmmmhmm maybe iвђm not exactly closer to solving this case but i sure know a lot more than when i started and iвђll do my best for you until itвђs time for me to leaveвђќ nancy assured her вђњplease donвђt worryвђќ but what nancy didnвђt tell mattie was that she was hoping the criminal would try again and this time make a mistakeвђthe kind of mistake he or she had managed to avoid until then her experience showed that most criminals tripped themselves up sooner or later вђњoh i hope youвђre rightвђќ mattie said with a nervous laugh вђњi guess iвђd better get you and bess hired on as extras again huhвђќ when it was all arranged mattie went back to the hospital to get rick and nancy went back upstairs for a quiet dinner with her aunt and bess just before turning in she went into the empty living room picked up the phone and dialed she was in luck вђњtwice in one weekвђќ came nedвђs familiar voice вђњwhatвђs going on nancy could this be true loveвђќ nancy giggled with a wave of warm feeling passing over her good old ned he was just what she needed right thenвђthe voice of sanity вђњyou know i love youвђќ she said with a laugh вђњbut thanks for trying to be funny i can use a little humor right nowвђќ вђњthings arenвђt going too well there are theyвђќ вђњthatвђs putting it mildlyвђќ she said and told him the latest developments in the case ned tried to sound comforting вђњlook nancy iвђve known you for a long time rightвђќ вђњforeverвђќ she replied вђњand in all that time iвђve never seen you blow a case so just hang in there youвђll figure it outвђќ вђњbut ned i have only one more dayвђќ she protested вђњsomething will happen and the pieces will all fall into place youвђll solve this one i know you will detective drewвђќ вђњwell iвђm glad somebody thinks soвђќ she sighed not really convinced вђњi appreciate the vote of confidence thoughвђќ вђњand nancy вђќ вђњyes nedвђќ вђњbe careful okay iвђd hate to have anything happen to youвђќ once again the girls were slated to play nurses rickвђs injuries had been written into the script in the new story line rory in a fit of despair would try to throw himself out a window he would be rescued but not before he had cut his hands to pieces and had to be taken to the hospital вђњnancy how do i lookвђќ bess asked later that day twirling around in her nurseвђs uniform she fluffed her red wig carefully so the pert white nurseвђs cap wouldnвђt fall off her heart didnвђt seem half as badly broken since she had found out sheвђd be working on вђњdannerвђs dreamвђќ again that day she even had a вђњsilent bitвђќвђshe was the nurse who would greet serena when she arrived at the hospital вђњi called my mother to make sure sheвђd tape the programвђќ bess said excitedly вђњthen i can take it around to casting directors and stuffвђќ nancy smiled at her friend even in the middle of all this craziness she was still managing to have a good time of course her fun was tempered by her feelings for rick whenever she saw him on the set she turned and purposely avoided him вђњoh and you know what i found out that that lady with glasses and clipboard over there is the casting directorвђќ bess whispered pulling nancy by the arm вђњiвђm going to go hang around her for a while you never can tell nancy this could be it and wonвђt rick feel like a fool when i become a bigger star than he ever wasвђќ nancy sighed and looked at her friend вђњbess as a friend iвђve got to tell you this you are totally insaneвђќ then pushing her friend playfully she whispered вђњbut go for it i hope she notices you iвђll see you when itвђs time for our scene okay i want to check out rickвђs new dressing roomвђќ rick was dressing and being made up in an improvised area across the hall from the costume room he sat staring listlessly into space still stunned by what had happened the day before kay was with him вђњso rickвђќ she was saying trying to cheer him up вђњare you going to give me a hand here or do i have to do this all myselfвђќ but rick didnвђt move he seemed so scaredвђas though there was a voice inside his head telling him over and over again that someone was trying to kill him and that he or she might very well succeed nancy leaned up against a wall and watched as kay put some warm water into the sink вђњno mirrors in here i hope youвђve noticedвђќ she said trying to make a joke when she saw she wasnвђt getting through to rick even a little bit she sighed wearily and picked up a stick of makeup вђњokay here we goвђќ she said uncapping it then вђњoopsвђќ she cried as the stick slipped out of her hands and fell into the wet sink вђњclumsy meвђќ she said to herself shaking her head suddenly there was a hissing noise the water in the sink began bubbling furiously вђњwhat theвђвђќ rick gasped a sharp odor rose from the sink nancy recognized the smell вђњthatвђs acidвђќ she whispered вђњoh my godвђќ kay cried her hands on her cheeks as she watched the acid eat holes in the stainless steel sink вђњrick that could have been your faceвђќ chapter fourteen вђњthatвђs itвђќ rick exclaimed вђњiвђve had itвђќ he tried to pick up his suede jacket but even a simple action such as this was difficult because of the bandages on his hands growling with disgust he stormed out of the room вђњrickвђќ kay called following him down the corridor вђњwhere are you goingвђќ вђњforget it kay iвђm taking a nice long walk and going someplace where nobody can find meвђќ just at that moment a beetfaced william pappas stepped into the hallway вђњwhatвђs going on hereвђќ he asked as the handsome actor flew down the hall вђњiвђm out of here off the show iвђm not taking any more chancesвђќ вђњbut youвђre under contract arlen you canвђt just leaveвђќ вђњoh yeah watch meвђќ with that rick pushed past the angry producer and made his way toward the entrance pappas made a lunge for him but a couple of crew members restrained him вђњcome on mr pappas calm downвђќ they urged him вђњgive him a break the guyвђs been under a lot of stress latelyвђќ pappas let the men straighten his suit as he muttered under his breath вђњheвђs under tension what am iвђchopped liver iвђm behind schedule and the network is breathing down my back i have ratings to think ofвђќ but it was too late rick was out the door and gone nancy and kay looked on as the producer fumed powerless to stop him seconds later luther parks hurried up to them running a hand nervously through his silver hair вђњbill someone just said rick arlen left what do you want me to doвђќ but pappas was in no mood for creative solutions вђњyouвђre the directorвђќ he snarled heading back to his office вђњthink of somethingвђќ luther shrugged and turned to lillian who was standing beside him вђњweвђll shoot the hospital scene with mattieвђќ he said вђњwhatever you sayвђќ lillian drawled throwing a wink nancyвђs way вђњreport to duty nurse drew and try not to miss your cueвђќ standing in the makebelieve operating room as the crew adjusted the lights nancyвђs spirits sank rick was out on the street somewhere unprotected and there she was on her last day in town about to walk around in the background of a fictional scene instead of tracking down a very real criminal someone had found a way to get around the set undetected again and again that was the key in spite of guards at the doors and people everywhere rickвђs enemy had gotten in if she only knew how if she could only discover the method behind the madness she felt sure the rest would fall into place but how could she do anything now вђњactionвђќ came lillianвђs voice taking her medicine tray nancy crossed the set put the tray down and walked back again heaving a deep sigh action thatвђs exactly what was needed if only there was some action she could take вђњcheer up nancyвђќ bess peered sympathetically into the mirror at her friendвђs reflection nancy wasnвђt used to losing and it hurt bess pulled a comb through her blond hair and twisted it up in one deft move she fastened it in place and searched for something comforting to say вђњi know itвђs a bummer but you win some and you lose someвђќ somehow those werenвђt the words she had been looking for вђњwell i donвђt really feel like going out to dinner thatвђs for sureвђќ nancy replied listlessly she reached for her makeup case on the bathroom counter вђњbut weвђre going to a really great restaurant your aunt eloise said itвђs one of her favorites and i canвђt wait to tell her about my big scene today the videotape editor told me he was sure i got into the shot can you imagine there i am actually handing a paper to mattie jensen on national tv my mother will flipвђќ nancy lifted the collar of her mauve jacket and fastened a rhinestone pin to the lapel вђњthereвђs just so little time left and so many unanswered questionsвђќ suddenly the door buzzer rang вђњcome on nancy thatвђs the signal your aunt and the cab are waitingвђќ bess cried вђњbe right downвђќ she called into the intercom at the restaurant the girls were seated by a lovely young hostess who looked more like a model than a restaurant employee вђњpierre will be your waiterвђќ she told them just then a young man with twinkling eyes and a handlebar mustache approached the table вђњbonsoir je mвђappelle pierre here i haf ze menuвђќ he said in a thick french accent bess couldnвђt help giggling as he handed the menus around the table giving each of them a seductive look вђњi can tell zees table will be my favorite of ze nightвђќ вђњi didnвђt know this place served french foodвђќ eloise mused out loud watching him go вђњit doesnвђtвђќ bess remarked in surprise as she looked over the menu вђњa french waiter at an american restaurant thatвђs weirdвђќ вђњnot for new york itвђs notвђќ nancyвђs aunt replied nancyвђs eyes followed the waiter to the bar where he put in an order for some other customers вђњhey steveвђќ he yelled in a regular voice вђњgive me three mineral waters and a cokeвђќ nancy looked up when the waiter returned to the table to take their order вђњgarгonвђavez vous un stylo noir peutetreвђќ вђњhuhвђќ he asked confused вђњwant to run that by me again ladyвђќ вђњyouвђre not frenchвђќ bess exclaimed вђњmais non mademoiselleвђќ the waiter admitted with a shy smile вђњi mean nope never even seen the placeвђќ вђњiвђll bet i know whatвђs going onвђќ eloise ventured вђњyouвђre an actor arenвђt youвђќ the waiter looked at eloise for a second and then laughed вђњokay okay i confess iвђm guilty i am an actor but please donвђt be madвђќ with that he tugged on the end of his mustache and pulled it off вђњi have an audition for the part of a french waiter tomorrow so i thought iвђd get in a little practice tonight now ladies what can i get youвђќ he proceeded to take their orders and then left вђњdoes that happen a lot around hereвђќ bess asked eloise smiled and shook her head no вђњbut many of the waiters in new york are actors bess and a lot of the delivery people word processors dog walkers they do many different kinds of work just to survive between acting jobsвђќ bess was sobered by the thought that an acting career could be so difficult but eloiseвђs words also had a great impact on nancy вђњplaying different rolesвђќ she murmured softly to herself suddenly a big piece of the puzzle had fallen into place thatвђs how the culprit does it she told herself hadnвђt she herself gone anywhere on the set completely unnoticed in her nurseвђs uniform no one had even looked at her twice of course how could she have missed it вђњand when the director called вђactionвђ i was supposed to be sorting these papers at the front deskвђќ bess was telling eloise вђњand mattie walks right up to me and says вђexcuse me did rory danner leave a message for meвђ and i nod and i hand her an envelope we must have done the scene six times right nancyвђќ bess didnвђt wait for an answer she just went on filling eloise in on every little detail of her big day on вђњdannerвђs dreamвђќ nancy ate her dinner in silence trying to put the final pieces of the puzzle together вђњiвђm stuffedвђќ bess said as they climbed the stairs to nancyвђs auntвђs apartment вђњthat dessert was too muchвђќ вђњafter you girls leave iвђm going to have to go on a dietвђќ eloise said reaching into her bag for the keys just then through the door they heard the phone ring вђњdonвђt worryвђthe machine will get itвђќ eloise said letting them in and flicking the lights on вђњhelloвђќ came eloiseвђs recorded voice on the answering machine вђњi canвђt come to the phone right now but if you leave a message at the sound of the beep iвђll get back to you as soon as i canвђќ вђњthis message is for nancy drewвђќ a shiver ran down nancyвђs spine it was the voice of lillian weiss вђњitвђs lillian nancy thereвђs something i have to tell you itвђs a matter of life and death meet me on the set tomorrow morning at six oвђclock before rehearsal iвђll leave a pass for youвђќ chapter fifteen вђњnancy youвђre not thinking of going are youвђќ the color drained from eloiseвђs face and she sat down on the sofa вђњyou told me yourself that you thought this woman might be the killer i canвђt allow you to put your life in danger that way even to save someone elseвђs youвђre my niece and youвђre the only child my brother has think how he would feel if something happened to youвђќ nancy sat down beside her aunt and took her hand вђњaunt eloiseвђќ she said calmly вђњever since i was a little girl iвђve been trying to solve mysteries i canвђt quit now itвђs my life aunt eloise itвђs what i do best donвђt ask me to give it up now pleaseвђќ tears in her eyes eloise hugged her niece fiercely вђњiвђll be biting my nails the whole time you know thatвђќ she said with a resigned laugh вђњbut why do you have to meet at the studioвђќ вђњoh you know how dramatic soap people are just a little added mystery now come on thereвђs nothing to worry aboutвђќ nancy countered with a smile вђњand besides i know quite a lot of karate remember all those lessons ought to be good for somethingвђќ when she got to worldwide broadcasting nancy picked up her pass at the security desk then slipped into the main corridor every muscle in her body was tensed there was something wrong about all thisвђshe knew it the moment she had heard lillianвђs voice but something drove her on step by step toward the studio as she turned down a corridor she saw someone and ducked back around the corner it was the janitor mopping the floors not wanting to run into anyone she went back around taking the long way to the studio in order to avoid him finally she reached the vacuumsealed door and pushed her way in the set was dimly lit but nancyвђs eyes adjusted to the darkness at first it seemed to be deserted but then nancy saw her lillian was sitting oh a chair on the set of the danner kitchen holding her head in her hands as nancy approached she turned around вђњour fair rescuerвђќ she said under her breath вђњhow kind of you to comeвђќ the words were full of bravado but the old selfassured lillian was gone the mocking look had disappeared and lillianвђs face was now fearful вђњwhy did you ask me to come hereвђќ nancy demanded вђњwhatвђs all this aboutвђќ вђњoh iвђm not the maniac if thatвђs what youвђre worried about in fact i asked you here becauseвђвђќ lillianвђs voice wavered вђњbecause heвђs after me nowвђќ nancy crossed the room and sat down next to lillian then she listened intently to every word of her story вђњwhen things started turning weird around here i got curious actually i was kind of hoping rick would get what he deserved if you get my meaning but then i found something it was that day i ran into you in the hall i had just found it in a closet i didnвђt want to tell anyone about it so i hid it where no one would come across itвђќ вђњthe prop room of courseвђќ nancyвђs eyes lit up so that was why lillian had acted so secretively that day вђњright and this little item i found made me want to find out more so i did i kept on finding more and more untilвђвђќ lillianвђs voice was barely a whisper вђњuntil i got this yesterdayвђќ she handed nancy a typewritten note вђњwere you thinking of blackmail my petвђќ it read вђњnot if i kill you firstвђќ вђњso you seeвђќ lillian went on вђњthatвђs why i called you here in case anything happens to me i mean i knew you were on the case and well you understandвђќ she picked up a shopping bag that lay at her feet and taking something out of it she held it up for nancy to look at вђњa longhaired wig glasses a tshirtвђвђќ nancy sifted through the contents her suspicions confirmed вђњit looks like a disguise whoever it was used it to get around the set unnoticedвђќ вђњexactlyвђќ lillian agreed вђњand what better disguise than as a stagehand one of those anonymous people walking around during every shoot everyone else is so busy doing their work no one notices itвђs perfectвђќ вђњwhat else did you findвђќ nancy asked вђњoh more of the same different every day i knew immediately that it was an actor or an exactorвђвђќ then i was right nancy said to herself вђњyou seeвђќ lillian went on вђњi finally put two and two together which i hate to say is more than youвђve doneвђќ вђњi take it you have proof of the maniacвђs identity thenвђќ nancy said вђњof course i doвђќ she said with a wicked smile вђњit isвђвђќ lillian didnвђt get a chance to finish her sentence all of a sudden every light in the entire studio flashed on shading her eyes nancy glanced up to the directorвђs booth where the lighting controls were there looking down at them from behind the thick plexiglas was dwayne casper his expression was furious and in his hand was a gunвђpointed straight at nancy chapter sixteen вђњwell hello you twoвђќ dwayneвђs voice boomed at them seeming to come from every imaginable direction he let out a monstrous laugh вђњi only followed lillian but iвђve trapped both of you how lucky congratulations your death scenes will look so lovely on videotape a videotape for my personal viewing pleasure onlyвђќ for an instant dwayne relaxed his grip on the gun a bit nancy seeing her chance made a dash for the door just as she reached it she heard it go whooossshh and the red light above it flashed on the door was lockedвђvacuum sealed вђњare we locked up down thereвђќ dwayne screamed in a grotesque parody of luther parks he laughed again вђњa little stage fright ms elliot actually i didnвђt know until yesterday that you and ms elliot were one and the same very good bit of acting very realistic you see we strive for realism hereвђreal bullets real blood real deathвђќ he waved his gun playfully at them вђњyou two are only the first act rick arlenвђs death will be the climax of my little soap opera heвђs gotten away from me so far thanks to you nancy drew but with you two little nuisances out of the way i donвђt think he has much of a chance do youвђќ dwayne paused waiting for a reply nancy had to think fast this might be her only chance to save her life and lillianвђs somehow she had to distract him make him forget he had a gun вђњdwayne why why do you hate rick so much lillian and mattie have more reason to hate him than you doвђќ her words seemed to ignite dwayneвђs fury he exploded at her just as he had at bess that day in his office вђњmore reason than i what do you know about it keep your ignorant little mouth shut rick arlen has to die and iвђll tell you why because he killed me thatвђs why he killed dwayne casperвђќ dwayne paused for breath nancy had the feeling dwayneвђs story was a long one that was good she needed timeвђtime to think of a way out вђњi was an actorвђќ dwayne cried all the hurt and rage in him pouring out with his story вђњiвђd studied every aspect of my craft and was a master of shakespeare dialects stage combatвђeverything i was underrated and underappreciatedвђbut brilliant then i met mattie вђњwe fell in love and i was the happiest man on earth thenвђthen came august we did romeo and juliet mattie was juliet but rick beat me out for the role of romeo the director was a sucker for a pretty face and so i soon found out was mattie вђњfrom that moment on my life was never the same and i never forgot what he had done to meвђќ as dwayne ranted on nancy looked around desperately for some way out вђњi am not like some people who fall in love every dayвђќ he rasped вђњwhen i lost mattie i knew that i would never love anyone ever again i decided that if i couldnвђt have her iвђd make money lots of money i gave up acting and became an agent instead вђњi made them stars i did it all and how did rick pay me back by leaving me thatвђs how i got nothing in return for all my hard workвђnothing at all he had destroyed me again вђњonce rick left other clients began to leave all i had left was mattie and thenвђвђќ dwayne paused and his expression grew dark with rage вђњthen he started luring mattie away from me thatвђs when i decided to kill him which brings me backвђвђќ he raised the gun at nancy looking down at them вђњвђto you two ladiesвђќ вђњdwayneвђќ nancy shouted shaking him out of his daze вђњyour story sounds like a soap opera that stuff doesnвђt happen in real lifeвђќ вђњthat shows what you know about life nancy drewвђќ dwayne rasped into the mikeвђќ вђњreal life is a soap opera youвђll learn that or rather you would have had you livedвђќ вђњrick didnвђt kill youвђќ nancy insisted вђњyouвђre stillвђвђќ dwayne erupted again вђњenoughвђќ he screamed вђњitвђs time for the final closeup iвђm going to write you two out of the script foreverвђќ quickly he disappeared from sight nancy guessed that he was on his way down to the set that only gave her a few seconds to think of something nancy looked frantically around lillian was standing shocked unable to help in any way she was frozen with fear as clever as she had been in figuring out who the criminal was she was utterly useless right then in the few seconds she had left nancy scanned the set looking for somethingвђanything then she saw it over in the corner stood a large metal cylinder on it were written the words вђњsmoke machineвђќ rushing over to it nancy found the control switch and turned it to the dense setting not a moment too soon either seemingly from nowhere dwayne appeared вђњah there you are my nosy little friend would you care to rejoin ms weiss onstageвђќ nancy moved slowly back to the kitchen area hoping that her plan would work вђњwhatвђs that hissingвђќ dwayne turned and looked around nervously but all he could see was the nearer half of the studio the rest was hidden by a thick white fog which was made even worse by the spotlights quickly while his back was turned nancy grabbed lillian by the arm and pulled her into the protection of the fog by the time dwayne realized what was happening and turned around again they were gone dwayne cursed loudly as nancy dragged lillian into a foggy corner on the set she left lillian there and began to walk toward the sound of dwayneвђs voice she had to get the jump on him from behind then she heard a sound that made her heart sink it was the sound of a giant fanвђthe wind machine вђњvery clever nancy drewвђќ came dwayneвђs voice through the diminishing fog вђњbut thereвђs an antidote for every poison or vice versaвђќ the fog was now down to a very small area and nancy knew that her time was running out crouching down she took a deep breath and prepared to make a desperate dive at dwayne he would still have the gun she knew she had only one advantageвђsurprise rearing back nancy flung herself through the air at dwayne at the last moment he turned and saw her the two of them fell together toppling over each other and dwayneвђs gun emptied itself chapter seventeen вђњthose were gunshots coming from the setвђќ вђњquick this wayвђќ when the police raced onto the set they found dwayne casper flat on the floor on top of him was nancy drew holding his arms in a double hammerlock вђњhis gun is on the floor over thereвђќ she told the police breathlessly as they relieved her of her burden вђњnancyвђќ eloise exclaimed rushing over to her вђњiвђm fine really aunt eloiseвђќ вђњwell all the karate lessons in the world wouldnвђt have helped if this bullet had come any closerвђќ eloise poked at the sleeve of nancyвђs jacket in it was a charred round hole the size of a dime nancy looked down at the hole her heart skipping a beat вђњplease donвђt tell dadвђќ she begged вђњand i promise iвђll be more careful from now onвђќ throwing her arms around her niece eloise sighed вђњoh nancy iвђm just glad youвђre aliveвђќ bess rushed up to them and threw her arms over theirs in a threeway hug вђњthank goodness youвђre all rightвђќ she cried вђњwhen we heard the shotsвђвђќ she couldnвђt go on the police had handcuffed dwayne who stood there passively a dull look in his eye вђњdo you know how close i was to paying arlen back for all heвђs done to meвђќ he began telling the police officer who stood impassively beside him clutching his arm вђњdo you know how long i worked to get this closeвђќ dwayne muttered bitterly his hands locked behind his back вђњtell your story to the sergeant buddyвђќ the police officer said вђњms drew iвђll need to get a statement from you and from ms weiss would you see that she makes it down to the station houseвђќ вђњof courseвђќ nancy agreed in all the commotion she hadnвђt even given a thought to lillian apparently the fright had been a bit too much for herвђsheвђd fainted вђњi had to call the police nancyвђќ eloise was explaining вђњsomething told me you
