waitstill baxter spring the story of waitstill baxter i saco water far far up in the bosom of new hampshires granite hills the saco has its birth as the mountain rill gathers strength it takes through bartletts vales its tuneful way or hides in conways fragrant brakes retreating from the glare of day now it leaves the mountains and flows through green fryeburgs woods and farms in the course of its frequent turns and twists and bends it meets with many another stream and sends it fuller and stronger along its rejoicing way when it has journeyed more than a hundred miles and is nearing the ocean it greets the great ossipee river and accepts its crystal tribute then in its turn the little ossipee joins forces and the river now a splendid stream flows onward to bonny eagle to moderation and to salmon falls where it dashes over the dam like a young niagara and hurtles in a foamy torrent through the ragged defile cut between lofty banks of solid rock widening out placidly for a moments rest in the sunny reaches near pleasant point it gathers itself for a new plunge at union falls after which it speedily merges itself in the bay and is fresh water no more at one of the falls on the saco the two little hamlets of edgewood and riverboro nestle together at the bridge and make one village the stream is a wonder of beauty just here a mirror of placid loveliness above the dam a tawny roaring wonder at the fall and a mad whiteflecked torrent as it dashes on its way to the ocean the river has seen strange sights in its time though the history of these two tiny villages is quite unknown to the great world outside they have been born waxed strong and fallen almost to decay while saco water has tumbled over the rocks and spent itself in its impetuous journey to the sea it remembers the yellowmoccasined sokokis as they issued from the indian cellar and carried their birchen canoes along the wooded shore it was in those years that the silverskinned salmon leaped in its crystal depths the otter and the beaver crept with sleek wet skins upon its shore and the brown deer came down to quench his thirst at its brink while at twilight the stealthy forms of bear and panther and wolf were mirrored in its glassy surface time sped men chained the rivers turbulent forces and ordered it to grind at the mill then houses and barns appeared along its banks bridges were built orchards planted forests changed into farms whitepainted meetinghouses gleamed through the trees and distant bells rang from their steeples on quiet sunday mornings all at once myriads of great hewn logs vexed its downward course slender logs linked together in long rafts and huge logs drifting down singly or in pairs men appeared running hither and thither like ants and going through mysterious operations the reason for which the river could never guess but the millwheels turned the great saws buzzed the smoke from tavern chimneys rose in the air and the rattle and clatter of stagecoaches resounded along the road now children paddled with bare feet in the rivers sandy coves and shallows and lovers sat on its aldershaded banks and exchanged their vows just where the shuffling bear was wont to come down and drink the saco could remember the cold year when there was a black frost every month of the twelve and though almost all the corn along its shores shrivelled on the stalk there were two farms where the vapor from the river saved the crops and all the seed for the next season came from the favored spot to be known as egypt from that day henceforward strange complex things now began to happen and the river played its own part in some of these for there were disastrous freshets the sudden breakingup of great jams of logs and the drowning of men who were engulfed in the dark whirlpool below the rapids caravans with menageries of wild beasts crossed the bridge now every year an infuriated elephant lifted the side of the old edgewood tavern barn and the wild laughter of the roistering rumdrinkers who were tantalizing the animals floated down to the rivers edge the roar of a lion tearing and chewing the arm of one of the bystanders and the cheers of the throng when a plucky captain of the local militia thrust a stake down the beasts throat these sounds displaced the former warwhoop of the indians and the ring of the axe in the virgin forests along the shores there were days and moonlight nights too when strange sights and sounds of quite another nature could have been noted by the river as it flowed under the bridge that united the two little villages issuing from the door of the riverboro town house and winding down the hill through the long row of teams and carriages that lined the roadside came a procession of singing men and singing women convinced of sin but entranced with promised pardon spiritually intoxicated by the glowing eloquence of the latterday prophet they were worshipping the band of cochranites marched down the dusty road and across the bridge dancing swaying waving handkerchiefs and shouting hosannas god watched and listened knowing that there would be other prophets true and false in the days to come and other processions following them and the river watched and listened too as it hurried on towards the sea with its story of the present that was sometime to be the history of the past when jacob cochrane was leading his overwrought ecstatic band across the river waitstill baxter then a child was watching the strange noisy company from the window of a little brick dwelling on the top of the townhouse hill her stepmother stood beside her with a young baby in her arms but when she saw what held the gaze of the child she drew her away saying we mustnt look waitstill your father dont like it who was the big man at the head mother his name is jacob cochrane but you mustnt think or talk about him he is very wicked he doesnt look any wickeder than the others said the child who was the man that fell down in the road mother and the woman that knelt and prayed over him why did he fall and why did she pray mother that was master aaron boynton the schoolmaster and his wife he only made believe to fall down as the cochranites do the way they carry on is a disgrace to the village and thats the reason your father wont let us look at them i played with a nice boy over to boyntons mused the child that was ivory their only child he is a good little fellow but his mother and father will spoil him with their crazy ways i hope nothing will happen to him for i love him said the child gravely he showed me a hummingbirds nest the first ever i saw and the littlest dont talk about loving him chided the woman if your father should hear you hed send you to bed without your porridge father couldnt hear me for i never speak when hes at home said grave little waitstill and im used to going to bed without my porridge ii the sisters the river was still running under the bridge but the current of time had swept jacob cochrane out of sight though not out of mind for he had left here and there a disciple to preach his strange and uncertain doctrine waitstill the child who never spoke in her fathers presence was a young woman now the mistress of the house the stepmother was dead and the baby a girl of seventeen the brick cottage on the hilltop had grown only a little shabbier deacon foxwell baxter still slammed its door behind him every morning at seven oclock and without any such cheerful conventions as goodbyes to his girls walked down to the bridge to open his store the day properly speaking had opened when waitstill and patience had left their beds at dawn built the fire fed the hens and turkeys and prepared the breakfast while the deacon was graining the horse and milking the cows such minor chores as carrying water from the well splitting kindling chopping pine or bringing wood into the kitchen were left to waitstill who had a strong back or if she had not had never been unwise enough to mention the fact in her fathers presence the almanac day however which opened with sunrise had nothing to do with the real human day which always began when mr baxter slammed the door behind him and reached its high noon of delight when he disappeared from view hes opening the store shutters chanted patience from the heights of a kitchen chair by the window now hes taken his cane and beaten off the boynton puppy that was sitting on the steps as usual i dont mean ivorys dog here the girl gave a quick glance at her sister but rodmans little yellow cur rodman must have come down to the bridge on some errand for ivory isnt it odd when that dog has all the other store steps to sit upon he should choose fathers when every bone in his body must tell him how father hates him and the whole boynton family father has no real cause that i ever heard of but some dogs never know when theyve had enough beating nor some people either said waitstill speaking from the pantry dont be gloomy when its my birthday sis now hes opened the door and kicked the cat all is ready for business at the baxter store i wish you werent quite so free with your tongue patty somebody must talk retorted the girl jumping down from the chair and shaking back her mop of redgold curls ill put this hateful childish round comb in and out just once more then it will disappear forever this very afternoon up goes my hair you know it will be of no use unless you braid it very plainly and neatly father will take notice and make you smooth it down father hasnt looked me square in the face for years besides my hair wont braid and nothing can make it quite plain and neat thank goodness let us be thankful for small mercies as jed morrill said when the lightning struck his motherinlaw and skipped his wife patty i will not permit you to repeat those tavern stories they are not seemly on the lips of a girl and waitstill came out of the pantry with a shadow of disapproval in her eyes and in her voice patty flung her arms round her sister tempestuously and pulled out the waves of her hair so that it softened her face ill be good she said and oh waity lets invent some sort of cheap happiness for today i shall never be seventeen again and we have so many troubles lets put one of the cows in the horses stall and see what will happen or lets spread up our beds with the head at the foot and put the chest of drawers on the other side of the room or lets make candy do you think father would miss the molasses if we only use a cupful couldnt we strain the milk but leave the churning and the dishes for an hour or two just once if you say yes i can think of something wonderful to do what is it asked waitstill relenting at the sight of the girls eager roguish face pierce my ears cried patty say you will oh patty patty i am afraid you are given over to vanity i darent let you wear eardrops without fathers permission why not lots of church members wear them so it cant be a mortal sin father is against all adornments but thats because he doesnt want to buy them youve always said i should have your mothers coral pendants when i was old enough here i am seventeen today and dr perry says i am already a wellfavored young woman i can pull my hair over my ears for a few days and when the holes are all made and healed even father cannot make me fill them up again besides ill never wear the earrings at home oh my dear my dear sighed waitstill with a halfsob in her voice if only i was wise enough to know how we could keep from these little deceits yet have any liberty or comfort in life we cant the lord couldnt expect us to bear all that we bear exclaimed patty without our trying once in a while to have a good time in our own way we never do a thing that we are ashamed of or that other girls dont do every day in the week only our pleasures always have to be taken behind fathers back its only me thats ever wrong anyway for you are always an angel its a burning shame and you only twentyone yourself ill pierce your ears if you say so and let you wear your own coral drops no patty ive outgrown those longings years ago when your mother died and left father and you and the house to me my girlhood died too though i was only thirteen it was only your inside girlhood that died insisted patty stoutly the outside is as fresh as the paint on uncle bartys new ell youve got the loveliest eyes and hair in riverboro and you know it besides ivory boynton would tell you so if you didnt come and bore my ears theres a darling ivory boynton never speaks a word of my looks nor a word that father and all the world mightnt hear and waitstill flushed then its because hes shy and silent and has so many troubles of his own that he doesnt dare say anything when my hair is once up and the coral pendants are swinging in my ears i shall expect to hear something about my looks i can tell you waity after all though we never have what we want to eat and never a decent dress to our backs nor a young man to cross the threshold i wouldnt change places with ivory boynton would you here patty swept the hearth vigorously with a turkey wing and added a few corncobs to the fire waitstill paused a moment in her task of breadkneading well she answered critically at least we know where our father is we do indeed we also know that he is thoroughly alive and though people do talk about him they cant say the things they say of master aaron boynton i dont believe father would ever run away and desert us i fear not said patty i wish the angels would put the idea into his head though of course it wouldnt be the angels theyd be above it it would have to be the old driver as jed morrill calls the evil one but whoever did it the result would be the same we should be deserted and live happily ever after oh to be deserted and left with you alone on this hilltop what joy it would be waitstill frowned but did not interfere further with pattys intemperate speech she knew that she was simply serving as an escapevalve and that after the steam was let off she would be more rational of course we are motherless continued patty wistfully but poor ivory is worse than motherless no not worse patty said waitstill taking the breadboard and moving towards the closet ivory loves his mother and she loves him with all the mind she has left she has the best blood of new england flowing in her veins and i suppose it was a great come down for her to marry aaron boynton clever and gifted though he was now ivory has to protect her poor daft innocent creature and hide her away from the gossip of the village he is surely the best of sons ivory boynton she is a terrible care for him and like to spoil his life said patty there are cares that swell the heart and make it bigger and warmer patty just as there are cares that shrivel it and leave it tired and cold love lightens ivorys afflictions but that is something you and i have to do without so it seems i suppose little rodman is some comfort to the boyntons even if he is only ten patty suggested no doubt hes a good little fellow and though its rather hard for ivory to be burdened for these last five years with the support of a child whos no nearer kin than a cousin still hes of use minding mrs boynton and the house when ivorys away the schoolteacher says he is wonderful at his books and likely to be a great credit to the boyntons some day or other youve forgot to name our one great blessing waity and i believe anyway youre talking to keep my mind off the earrings you mean weve each other no patty i never forget that day or night tis that makes me willing to bear any burden father chooses to put upon us now the bread is set but i dont believe i have the courage to put a needle into your tender flesh patty i really dont nonsense ive got the waxed silk all ready and chosen the rightsized needle and ill promise not to jump or screech more than i can help well make a tiny leadpencil dot right in the middle of the lobe then you place the needle on it shut your eyes and jab hard i expect to faint but when i come to we can decide which of us will pull the needle through to the other side probably it will be you im such a coward if it hurts dreadfully ill have only one pierced today and take the other tomorrow and if it hurts very dreadfully perhaps ill go through life with one earring aunt abby cole will say its just odd enough to suit me youll never go through life with one tongue at the rate you use it now chided waitstill for it will never last you come well take the workbasket and go out in the barn where no one will see or hear us goody goody come along and patty clapped her hands in triumph have you got the pencil and the needle and the waxed silk then bring the camphor bottle to revive me and the coral pendants too just to give me courage hurry up its ten oclock i was born at sunrise so im going on eighteen and cant waste any time iii deacon baxters wives foxwell baxter was ordinarily called old foxy by the boys of the district and also it is to be feared by the men gathered for evening conference at the various taverns or at one of the rival village stores he had a small farm of fifteen or twenty acres with a pasture a wood lot and a hayfield but the principal source of his income came from trading his sign bore the usual legend west india goods and groceries and probably the most profitable articles in his stock were rum molasses sugar and tobacco but there were chests of rice tea coffee and spices barrels of pork in brine as well as piles of cotton and woolen cloth on the shelves above the counters his shop window seldom dusted or set in order held a few clay pipes some glass jars of peppermint or sassafras lozenges black licorice stickcandy and sugar gooseberries these dainties were seldom renewed for it was only a very bold child or one with an ungovernable appetite for sweets who would have spent his penny at foxy baxters store he was thought a sharp and shrewd trader but his honesty was never questioned indeed the only trait in his character that ever came up for general discussion was his extraordinary unbelievable colossal meanness this so eclipsed every other passion in the man and loomed so bulkily and insistently in the foreground that had he cherished a second vice no one would have observed it and if he really did possess a casual virtue it could scarcely have reared its head in such ugly company it might be said to defend the fair name of the church that mr baxters deaconhood did not include very active service in the courts of the lord he had experienced religion at fifteen and made profession of his faith but all wellbroughtup boys and girls did the same in those days their parents saw to that if change of conviction or backsliding occurred later on that was not their business at the ripe age of twentyfive he was selected to fill a vacancy and became a deacon thinking it might be good for trade as it was for some years he was very active at the time of the cochrane craze since any defence of the creed that included lively detective work and incessant spying on his neighbors was particularly in his line but for many years now though he had been regular in attendance at church he had never officiated at communion and his diaconal services had gradually lapsed into the passing of the contributionbox a task of which he never wearied it was such a keen pleasure to make other people yield their pennies for a good cause without adding any of his own deacon baxter had now been a widower for some years and the community had almost relinquished the idea of his seeking a fourth wife this was a matter of some regret for there was a general feeling that it would be a good thing for the baxter girls to have some one to help with the housework and act as a buffer between them and their grim and irascible parent as for the women of the village they were mortified that the deacon had been able to secure three wives and refused to believe that the universe held anywhere a creature benighted enough to become his fourth the first be it said was a mere ignorant girl and he a beardless youth of twenty who may not have shown his true qualities so early in life she bore him two sons and it was a matter of comment at the time that she called them respectively job and moses hoping that the endurance and meekness connected with these names might somehow help them in their future relations with their father pneumonia coupled with profound discouragement carried her off in a few years to make room for the second wife waitstills mother who was of different fibre and greatly his superior she was a fine handsome girl the orphan daughter of upcountry gentlefolks who had died when she was eighteen leaving her alone in the world and penniless baxter after a few days acquaintance drove into the dooryard of the house where she was a visitor and showing her his two curlyheaded boys suddenly asked her to come and be their stepmother she assented partly because she had nothing else to do with her existence so far as she could see and also because she fell in love with the children at first sight and forgot as girls will that it was their father whom she was marrying she was as plucky and clever and spirited as she was handsome and she made a brave fight of it with foxy long enough to bring a daughter into the world to name her waitstill and start her a little way on her life journey then she too gave up the struggle and died typhoid fever it was combined with complete loss of illusions and a kind of despairing rage at having made so complete a failure of her existence the next year mr baxter being unusually busy offered a man a good young heifer if he would jog about the country a little and pick him up a housekeeper a likely woman who would if she proved energetic economical and amiable be eventually raised to the proud position of his wife if she was young healthy smart tidy capable and a good manager able to milk the cows harness the horse and make good butter he would give a dollar and a half a week the woman was found and incredible as it may seem she said yes when the deacon whose ardor was kindled at having paid three months wages proposed a speedy marriage the two boys by this time had reached the age of discretion and one of them evinced the fact by promptly running away to parts unknown never to be heard from afterwards while the other a reckless and unhappy lad was drowned while running on the logs in the river old foxy showed little outward sign of his loss though he had brought the boys into the world solely with the view of having one of them work on the farm and the other in the store his third wife the one originally secured for a housekeeper bore him a girl very much to his disgust a girl named patience and great was waitstills delight at this addition to the dull household the mother was a timid colorless docile creature but patience nevertheless was a sparkling brighteyed baby who speedily became the very centre of the universe to the older child so the months and years wore on drearily enough until when patience was nine the third mrs baxter succumbed after the manner of her predecessors and slipped away from a life that had grown intolerable the trouble was diagnosed as liver complaint but scarcity of proper food no new frocks or kind words hard work and continual bullying may possibly have been contributory causes dr perry thought so for he had witnessed three most contented deaths in the baxter house the ladies were all members of the church and had presumably made their peace with god but the good doctor fancied that their pleasure in joining the angels was mild compared with their relief at parting with the deacon i know i hadnt ought to put the care on you waitstill and you only thirteen poor mrs baxter sighed as the young girl was watching with her one night when the end seemed drawing near ive made out to live till now when patience is old enough to dress herself and help round but im all beat out and cant try any more do you mean im to take your place be a mother to patience and keep house and everything asked waitstill quaveringly i dont see but youll have to unless your father marries again hell never hire help you know that i wont have another mother in this house flashed the girl theres been three here and thats enough if he brings anybody home ill take patience and run away as job did or if he leaves me alone ill wash and iron and scrub and cook till patience grows up and then well go off together and hide somewhere im fourteen oh mother how soon could i be married and take patience to live with me do you think anybody will ever want me dont marry for a home waitstill your own mother did that and so did i and we were both punished for it youve been a great help and ive had a sight of comfort out of the baby but i wouldnt go through it again not even for her youre real smart and capable for your age and youve done your full share of the work every day even when you were at school you can get along all right i dont know how im going to do everything alone said the girl forcing back her tears youve always made the brown bread and mine will never suit father i suppose i can wash but dont know how to iron starched clothes nor make pickles and oh i can never kill a rooster mother its no use to ask me to im not big enough to be the head of the family mrs baxter turned her pale tired face away from waitstills appealing eyes i know she said faintly i hate to leave you to bear the brunt alone but i must take good care of patience and dont let her get into trouble you wont will you ill be careful promised waitstill sobbing quietly ill do my best youve got more courage than ever i had dont you spose you can stiffen up and defend yourself a little mite your fatherd ought to be opposed for his own good but ive never seen anybody that dared do it then after a pause she said with a flash of spirit anyhow waitstill hes your father after all hes no blood relation of mine and i cant stand him another day thats the reason im willing to die iv something of a hero ivory boynton lifted the bars that divided his land from the highroad and walked slowly toward the house it was april but there were still patches of snow here and there fast melting under a drizzling rain it was a gray world a bleak blackandbrown world above and below the sky was leaden the road and the footpath were deep in a muddy ooze flecked with white the treetrunks black with bare branches were lined against the gray sky nevertheless spring had been on the way for a week and a few sunny days would bring the yearly miracle for which all hearts were longing ivory was seasonwise and his quick eye had caught many a sign as he walked through the woods from his schoolhouse a new and different color haunted the treetops and one had only to look closely at the elm buds to see that they were beginning to swell some fat robins had been sunning about in the schoolyard at noon and sparrows had been chirping and twittering on the fencerails yes the winter was over and ivory was glad for it had meant no coasting andskating and sleighing for him but long walks in deep snow or slush long evenings good for study but short days and greater loneliness for his mother he could see her now as he neared the house standing in the open doorway her hand shading her eyes watching always watching for some one who never came spring is on the way mother but it isnt here yet so dont stand there in the rain he called look at the nosegay i gathered for you as i came through the woods here are pussy willows and red maple blossoms and mayflowers would you believe it lois boynton took the handful of budding things and sniffed their fragrance youre late tonight ivory she said rod wanted his supper early so that he could go off to singingschool but i kept something warm for you and ill make you a fresh cup of tea ivory went into the little shed room off the kitchen changed his muddy boots for slippers and made himself generally tidy then he came back to the livingroom bringing a pine knot which he flung on the fire waking it to a brilliant flame we can be as lavish as we like with the stumps now mother for spring is coming he said as he sat down to his meal ive been looking out more than usual this afternoon she replied theres hardly any snow left and though the walking is so bad ive been rather expecting your father before night you remember he said when he went away in january that he should be back before the mayflowers bloomed it did not do any good to say yes mother but the mayflowers have bloomed ten times since father went away he had tried that gently and persistently when first her mind began to be confused from long grief and hurt love stricken pride and sick suspense instead of that ivory turned the subject cheerily saying well were sure of a good season i think theres been a grand snowfall and that they say is the poor mans manure rod and i will put in more corn and potatoes this year i shant have to work singlehanded very long for he is growing to be quite a farmer your father was very fond of green corn but he never cared for potatoes mrs boynton said vaguely taking up her knitting i always had great pride in my cooking but i could never get your father to relish my potatoes well his son does anyway ivory replied helping himself plentifully from a dish that held one of his mothers best concoctions potatoes minced fine and put together into the spider with thin bits of pork and all browned together i saw the baxter girls today mother he continued not because he hoped she would give any heed to what he said but from the sheer longing for companionship the deacon drove off with lawyer wilson who wanted him to give testimony in some case or other down in milltown the minute patty saw him going up saco hill she harnessed the old starved baxter mare and the girls started over to the lower corner to see some friends it seems its pattys birthday and they were celebrating i met them just as they were coming back and helped them lift the rickety wagon out of the mud they were stuck in it up to the hubs of the wheels i advised them to walk up the townhouse hill if they ever expected to get the horse home townhouse hill said ivorys mother dropping her knitting that was where we had such wonderful meetings truly the lord was present in our midst and oh ivory the visions we saw in that place when jacob cochrane first unfolded his gospel to us was ever such a man probably not mother remarked ivory dryly you were speaking of the baxters i remember their home and the little girl who used to stand in the gateway and watch when we came out of meeting there was a baby too isnt there a baxter baby ivory she didnt stay a baby she is seventeen years old today mother you surprise me but children do grow very fast she had a strange name but i cannot recall it her name is patience but nobody but her father calls her anything but patty which suits her much better no the name wasnt patience not the one i mean the older sister is waitstill perhaps you mean herand ivory sat down by the fire with his book and his pipe waitstill waitstill that is it such a beautiful name shes a beautiful girl waitstill they also serve who only stand and wait wait i say on the lord and he will give thee the desires of thy heart those were wonderful days when we were caught up out of the body and mingled freely in the spirit world mrs boynton was now fully started on the topic that absorbed her mind and ivory could do nothing but let her tell the story that she had told him a hundred times i remember when first we heard jacob cochrane speak this was her usual way of beginning your father was a preacher as you know ivory but you will never know what a wonderful preacher he was my grandfather being a fine gentleman and a governor would not give his consent to my marriage but i never regretted it never your father saw elder cochrane at a revival meeting of the free will baptists in scarboro and was much impressed with him a few days later we went to the funeral of a child in the same neighborhood no one who was there could ever forget it the minister had made his long prayer when a man suddenly entered the room came towards the coffin and placed his hand on the childs forehead the room in an instant was as still as the death that had called us together the stranger was tall and of commanding presence his eyes pierced our very hearts and his marvellous voice penetrated to depths in our souls that had never been reached before was he a better speaker than my father asked ivory who dreaded his mothers hours of complete silence even more than her periods of reminiscence he spoke as if the lord of hosts had given him inspiration as if the angels were pouring words into his mouth just for him to utter replied mrs boynton your father was spellbound and i only less so when he ceased speaking the childs mother crossed the room and swaying to and fro fell at his feet sobbing and wailing and imploring god to forgive her sins they carried her upstairs and when we looked about after the confusion and excitement the stranger had vanished but we found him again as elder cochrane said the prophet of the lord can never be hid no darkness is thick enough to cover him there was a six weeks revival meeting in north saco where three hundred souls were converted and your father and i were among them we had fancied ourselves true believers for years but jacob cochrane unstopped our ears so that we could hear the truths revealed to him by the almightyit was all so simple and easy at the beginning but it grew hard and grievous afterward hard to keep the path i mean i never quite knew whether god was angry with me for backsliding at the end but i could not always accept the revelations that elder cochrane and your father had lois boyntons hands were now quietly folded over the knitting that lay forgotten in her lap but her low thrilling voice had a note in it that did not belong wholly to earth there was a long silence one of many long silences at the boynton fireside broken only by the ticking of the clock the purring of the cat and the clicking of mrs boyntons needles as her paroxysm of reminiscence over she knitted ceaselessly with her eyes on the window or the door its about time for rod to be coming back isnt it asked ivory he ought to be here soon but perhaps he is gone for good it may be that he thinks he has made us a long enough visit i dont know whether your father will like the boy when he comes home he never did fancy company in the house ivory looked up in astonishment from his greek grammar this was an entirely new turn of his mothers mind often when she was more than usually confused he would try to clear the cobwebs from her brain by gently questioning her until she brought herself back to a clearer understanding of her own thought thus far her vagaries had never made her unjust to any human creature she was uniformly sweet and gentle in speech and demeanor why do you talk of rods visiting us when he is one of the family ivory asked quietly is he one of the family i didnt know it replied his mother absently look at me mother straight in the eye thats right now listen dear to what i say mrs boyntons hair that had been in her youth like an aureole of cornsilk was now a strange yellowwhite and her blue eyes looked out from her pale face with a helpless appeal you and i were living alone here after father went away ivory began i was a little boy you know you and father had saved something there was the farm you worked like a slave i helped and we lived somehow do you remember i do indeed it was cold and the neighbors were cruel jacob cochrane had gone away and his disciples were not always true to him when the magnetism of his presence was withdrawn they could not follow all his revelations and they forgot how he had awakened their spiritual life at the first of his preaching your father was always a stanch believer but when he started on his mission and went to parsonsfield to help elder cochrane in his meetings the neighbors began to criticize him they doubted him you were too young to realize it but i did and it almost broke my heart i was nearly twelve years old do you think i escaped all the gossip mother you never spoke of it to me ivory no there is much that i never spoke of to you mother but sometime when you grow stronger and your memory is better we will talk together do you remember the winter long after father went away that parson lane sent me to fairfield academy to get enough greek and latin to make me a schoolmaster yes she answered uncertainly dont you remember i got a free ride downriver one friday and came home for sunday just to surprise you and when i got here i found you ill in bed with mrs mason and dr perry taking care of you you could not speak you were so ill but they told me you had been up in new hampshire to see your sister that she had died and that you had brought back her boy who was only four years old that was rod i took him into bed with me that night poor homesick little fellow and as you know mother hes never left us since i didnt remember i had a sister is she dead ivory asked mrs boynton vaguely if she were not dead do you suppose you would have kept rodman with us when we hadnt bread enough for our own two mouths mother questioned ivory patiently no of course not i cant think how i can be so forgetful its worse sometimes than others it s worse today because i knew the mayflowers were blooming and that reminded me it was time for your father to come home you must forgive me dear and will you excuse me if i sit in the kitchen awhile the window by the side door looks out towards the road and if i put a candle on the sill it shines quite a distance the lane is such a long one and your father was always a sad stumbler in the dark i shouldnt like him to think i wasnt looking for him when hes been gone since january ivorys pipe went out and his book slipped from his knee unnoticed his mother was more confused than usual but she always was when spring came to remind her of her husbands promise somehow well used as he was to her mental wanderings they made him uneasy tonight his father had left home on a fancied mission a duty he believed to be a revelation given by god through jacob cochrane the farm did not miss him much at first ivory reflected bitterly for since his fanatical espousal of cochranism his fathers interest in such mundane matters as household expenses had diminished month by month until they had no meaning for him at all letters to wife and boy had come at first but after six months during which he had written from many places continually deferring the date of his returnthey had ceased altogether the rest was silence rumors of his presence here or there came from time to time but though parson lane and dr perry did their best none of them were ever substantiated where had those years of wandering been passed and had they all been given even to an imaginary and fantastic service of god was his father dead if he were alive what could keep him from writing nothing but a very strong reason or a very wrong one so his son thought at times since ivory had grown to mans estate he understood that in the later days of cochranes preaching his visions inspirations and revelations concerning the marriage bond were a trifle startling from the oldfashioned orthodox point of view his most advanced disciples were to hold themselves in readiness to renounce their former vows and seek spiritual consorts sometimes according to his advice sometimes as their inclinations prompted had aaron boynton forsaken willingly the wife of his youth the mother of his boy if so he must have realized to what straits he was subjecting them ivory had not forgotten those first few years of grinding poverty anxiety and suspense his mothers mind had stood the strain bravely but it gave way at last not however until that fatal winter journey to new hampshire when cold exposure and fatigue did their worst for her weak body religious enthusiast exalted and impressionable a natural mystic she had probably always been far more so in temperament indeed than her husband but although she left home on that journey a frail and heartsick woman she returned a different creature altogether blurred and confused in mind with clouded memory and irrational fancies she must have given up hope just then ivory thought and her love was so deep that when it was uprooted the soil came with it now hope had returned because the cruel memory had faded altogether she sat by the kitchen window in gentle expectation watching always watching and this is the way many of ivory boyntons evenings were spent while the heart of him the fiveandtwentyyearold heart of him was longing to feel the beat of another heart a girls heart only a mile or more away the ice in saco water had broken up and the white blocks sailed majestically down towards the sea sap was mounting and the elm trees were budding the trailing arbutus was blossoming in the woods the robins had comeeverything was announcing the spring yet ivory saw no changing seasons in his future nothing but winter eternal winter there v patience and impatience patty had been searching for eggs in the barn chamber and coming down the ladder from the haymow spied her father washing the wagon by the wellside near the shed door cephas cole kept store for him at meal hours and whenever trade was unusually brisk and the baxter yard was so happily situated that old foxy could watch both house and store there never was a good time to ask deacon baxter a favor therefore this moment would serve as well as any other so approaching him near enough to be heard through the rubbing and splashing but no nearer than was necessary patty said father can i go up to ellen wilsons this afternoon and stay to tea i wont start till ive done a good days work and ill come home early what do you want to go gallivantin to the neighbors for i never saw anything like the girls nowadays hightytighty flauntin traipsin triflin trollops evry one of em thats what they are and ellen wilsons one of the triflinest youre old enough now to stay to home where you belong and make an effort to earn your board and clothes which you cant even if you try spunk real simonpure spunk started somewhere in patty and coursed through her blood like wine if a girls old enough to stay at home and work i should think she was old enough to go out and play once in a while patty was still too timid to make this remark more than a courteous suggestion so far as its tone was concerned dont answer me back youre full of new tricks and youve got to stop em right where you are or therell be trouble you were whistlin just now up in the barn chamber thats one of the things i wont have round my premises a whistlin girl t was a sabbathschool hymn that i was whistling this with a creditable imitation of defiance that dont make it any better sing your hymns if you must make a noise while youre workin its the same mouth that makes the whistle and sings the song so i dont see why ones any wickeder than the other you dont have to see replied the deacon grimly all you have to do is to mind when youre spoken to now run long bout your work cant i go up to ellens then whats goin on up there just a frolic theres always a good time at ellens and i would so like the sight of a big rich house now and then just a frolic land o goshen hear the girl sight of a big rich house indeed will there be any boys at the party i spose so or t wouldnt be a frolic said patty with awful daring but there wont be many only a few of marks friends well there aint goin to be no more argyfyin i wont have any girl o mine frolickin with boys so thats the end of it youre kind o crazy lately riggin yourself out with a ribbon here and a flower there and pullin your hair down over your ears why do you want to cover your ears up what are they for to hear you with father patty replied with honeysweet voice and eyes that blazed well i hope theyll never hear anything worse replied her father flinging a bucket of water over the last of the wagon wheels they couldnt these words were never spoken aloud but oh how patty longed to shout them with a clarion voice as she walked away in perfect silence her majestic gait showing she hoped how she resented the outcome of the interview ive stood up to father she exclaimed triumphantly as she entered the kitchen and set down her yellow bowl of eggs on the table i stood up to him and answered him back three times waitstill was busy with her saturday morning cooking but she turned in alarm patty what have you said and done tell me quickly i argyfied but it didnt do any good he wont let me go to ellens party waitstill wiped her floury hands and put them on her sisters shoulders hear what i say patty you must not argue with father whatever he says we dont love him and so there isnt the right respect in our hearts but at least there can be respect in our manners i dont believe i can go on for years holding in waitstill patty whimpered yes you can i have youre different waitstill i wasnt so different at sixteen but thats five years ago and ive got control of my tongue and my temper since then sometime perhaps when i have a grievance too great to be rightly borne sometime when you are away from here in a home of your own i shall speak out to father just empty my heart of all the disappointment and bitterness and rebellion somebody ought to tell him the truth and perhaps it will be me i wish it could be me exclaimed patty vindictively and with an equal disregard of grammar you would speak in temper im afraid patty and that would spoil all im sorry you cant go up to ellens she sighed turning back to her work you dont have pleasure enough for one of your age still dont fret something may happen to change things and anyhow the weather is growing warmer and you and i have so many more outings in summertime smooth down your hair child there are straws in it and its all rough with the wind i dont like flying hair about a kitchen i wish my hair was flying somewhere a thousand miles from here or at least i should wish it if it did not mean leaving you for oh im so miserable and disappointed and unhappy waitstill bent over the girl as she flung herself down beside the table and smoothed her shoulder gently there there dear it isnt like my gay little sister to cry what is the matter with you today patty i suppose its the spring she said wiping her eyes with her apron and smiling through her tears perhaps i need a dose of sulphur and molasses dont you feel well as common well i feel too well i feel as if i was a young colt shut up in an attic i want to kick up my heels batter the door down and get out into the pasture its no use talking waity i cant go on living without a bit of pleasure and i cant go on being patient even for your sake if it werent for you id run away as job did and i never believed moses slipped on the logs im sure he threw himself into the river and so should i if i had the courage stop patty stop dear you shall have your bit of pasture at least ill do some of your indoor tasks for you and you shall put on your sunbonnet and go out and dig the dandelion greens for dinner take the broken knife and a milkpan and dont bring in so much earth with them as you did last time dry your eyes and look at the green things growing remember how young you are and how many years are ahead of you go along dear waitstill went about her work with rather a heavy heart was life going to be more rather than less difficult now that patty was growing up would she he able to do her duty both by father and sister and keep peace in the household as she had vowed in her secret heart always to do she paused every now and then to look out of the window and wave an encouraging hand to patty the girls bonnet was off and her uncovered head blazed like red gold in the sunlight the short young grass was dotted with dandelion blooms some of them already grown to huge disks of yellow and patty moved hither and thither selecting the younger weeds deftly putting the broken knife under their roots and popping them into the tin pan presently for deacon baxter had finished the wagon and gone down the hill to relieve cephas cole at the counter pattys shrill young whistle floated into the kitchen but with a mischievous glance at the open window she broke off suddenly and began to sing the words of the hymn with rather more emphasis and gusto than strict piety warranted therell be something in heaven for children to do none are idle in that blessed land therell be work for the heart therell be work for the mind and employment for each little hand therell be something to do therell be something to do therell be something for children to do on that bright blessed shore where theres joy evermore therell be something for children to do pattys young existence being full to the brim of labor this view of heaven never in the least appealed to her and she rendered the hymn with little sympathy the main part of the verse was strongly accented by jabs at the unoffending dandelion roots but when the chorus came she brought out the emphatic syllables by a beat of the broken knife on the milkpan this rendition of a sabbathschool classic did not meet waitstills ideas of perfect propriety but she smiled and let it pass planning some sort of recreation for a stolen halfhour of the afternoon it would have to be a walk through the pasture into the woods to see what had grown since they went there a fortnight ago patty loved people better than nature but failing the one she could put up with the other for she had a sense of beauty and a pagan love of color there would be palehued innocence and blue and white violets in the moist places thought waitstill and they would have them in a china cup on the suppertable no that would never do for last time father had knocked them over when he was reaching for the bread and in a silent protest against such foolishness got up from the table and emptied theirs into the kitchen sink theres a place for everything he said when he came back and the place for flowers is outdoors then in the pine woods there would be she was sure star of bethlehem solomons seal the white spray of groundnuts and bunchberries perhaps they could make a bouquet and patty would take it across the fields to mrs boyntons door she need not go in and thus they would not be disobeying their fathers command not to visit that crazy boynton woman here patty came in with a pan full of greens and the sisters sat down in the sunny window to get them ready for the pot im calmer the little rebel allowed thats generally the way it turns out with me i get into a rage but i can generally sing it off you certainly must have got rid of a good deal of temper this morning by the way your voice sounded nobody can hear us in this outoftheway place its easy enough to see that the women werent asked to say anything when the men settled where the houses should be built the men werent content to stick them on the top of a high hill or half a mile from the stores but put them back to the main road taking due care to cut the sinkwindow where their wives couldnt see anything even when they were washing dishes i dont know that i ever thought about it in that way and waitstill looked out of the window in a brown study while her hands worked with the dandelion greens ive noticed it but i never supposed the men did it intentionally no you wouldnt said patty with the pessimism of a woman of ninety as she stole an admiring glance at her sister pattys own face irregular piquant tantalizing had its peculiar charm and her brilliant skin and hair so dazzled the masculine beholder that he took note of no small defects but waitstill was beautiful beautiful even in her working dress of purple calico her single braid of hair the foxwell hair that in her was bronze and in patty pale auburn was wound once around her fine head and made to stand a little as it went across the front it was a simple easy unconscious fashion of her own quite different from anything done by other women in her time and place and it just suited her dignity and serenity it looked like a coronet but it was the way she carried her head that gave you the fancy there was such spirit and pride in the poise of it on the long graceful neck her eyes were as clear as mountain pools shaded by rushes and the strength of the face was softened by the sweetness of the mouth patty never let the conversation die out for many seconds at a time and now she began again my sudden rages dont match my name very well but of course mother didnt know how i was going to turn out when she called me patience for i was nothing but a squirming little bald red baby but my name really is too ridiculous when you think about it waitstill laughed as she said it didnt take you long to change it perhaps patience was a hard word for a baby to say but the moment you could talk you said patty wants this and patty wants that did patty ever get it she never has since thats certain and look at your name its waitstill yet you never stop a moment when youre not in the shed or barn or chickenhouse or kitchen or attic or gardenpatch you are working in the sunday school or the choir it seemed as if waitstill did not intend to answer this arraignment of her activities she rose and crossed the room to put the pan of greens in the sink preparing to wash them taking the longhandled dipper from the nail she paused a moment before plunging it into the water pail paused and leaning her elbow on a corner of the shelf over the sink looked steadfastly out into the orchard patty watched her curiously and was just going to offer a penny for her thoughts when waitstill suddenly broke the brief silence by saying yes i am always busy its better so but all the same patty im waiting inside i dont know for what but i always feel that i am waiting vi a kiss shall we have our walk in the woods on the edgewood side of the river just for a change patty suggested her sister the water is so high this year that the river will be splendid we can gather our flowers in the hill pasture and then youll be quite near mrs boyntons and can carry the nosegay there while i come home ahead of you and get supper ill take todays eggs to fathers store on the way and ask him if he minds our having a little walk ive an errand at aunt abbys that would take me down to the bridge anyway very well said patty somewhat apathetically i always like a walk with you but i dont care what becomes of me this afternoon if i cant go to ellens party the excursion took place according to waitstills plan and at four oclock she sped back to her night work and preparations for supper leaving patty with a great bunch of early wildflowers for ivorys mother patty had left them at the boyntons door with rodman who was picking up chips and volunteered to take the nosegay into the house at once wont you step inside the boy asked shyly wishing to be polite but conscious that visitors from the village very seldom crossed the threshold id like to but i cant this afternoon thank you i must run all the way down the hill now or i shant be in time to supper do you eat meals together over to your house asked the boy were all three at the table if that means together we never are ivory goes off early and takes lunch in a pail so do i when i go to school aunt boynton never sits down to eat she just stands at the window and takes a bite of something now and then you havent got any mother have you no rodman neither have i nor any father nor any relations but aunt boynton and ivory ivory is very good to me and when hes at home im never lonesome i wish you could come over and eat with sister and me said patty gently perhaps sometime when my father is away buying goods and we are left alone you could join us in the woods and we would have a picnic we would bring enough for you all sorts of good things hardboiled eggs doughnuts appleturnovers and bread spread with jelly id like it fine exclaimed rodman his big dark eyes sparkling with anticipation i dont have many boys to play with and i never went to a picnic aunt boynton watches for uncle most all the time she doesnt know he has been away for years and years when she doesnt watch she prays sometimes she wants me to pray with her but praying dont come easy to me neither does it to me said patty im good at marbles and checkers and backgammon and jackstraws though so am i said patty laughing so we should be good friends ill try to get a chance to see you soon again but perhaps i cant im a good deal tied at home your father doesnt like you to go anywheres i guess interposed rodman ive heard ivory tell aunt boynton things but i wouldnt repeat them ivorys trained me years and years not to tell anything so i dont thats a good boy approved patty then as she regarded him more closely she continued im sorry youre lonesome rodman id like to see you look brighter you think ive been crying the boy said shrewdly so i have but not because ive been punished the reason my eyes are so swollen up is because i killed our old toad by mistake this morning i was trying to see if i could swing the scythe sos to help ivory in hayingtime ive only raked after and i want to begin on mowing soons i can then somehow or other the old toad came out from under the steps i didnt see him and the scythe hit him square i cried for an hour thats what i did and i dont care who knows it except i wouldnt like the boys at school to hector me ive buried the toad out behind the barn and i hope ivoryll let me keep the news from aunt boynton she cries enough now without my telling her theres been a death in the family she set great store by the old toad and so did all of us its too bad im sorry but after all you couldnt help it no but we should always look round everywheres when were cutting thats what ivory says he says folks shouldnt use edged tools till theyre old enough not to fool with em and rodman looked so wise and oldfashioned for his years that patty did not know whether to kiss him or cry over him as she said ivorys always right and now goodbye i must go this very minute dont forget the picnic i wont cried the boy gazing after her wholly entranced with her bright beauty and her kindness say ill bring something too whiteoak acorns if you like em ive got a big bagful up attic patty sped down the long lane crept under the bars and flew like a lapwing over the highroad if father was only like any one else things might be so different she sighed her thoughts running along with her feet nobody to make a home for that poor lonesome little boy and that poor lonesome big ivory i am sure that he is in love with waitstill he doesnt know it she doesnt know it nobody does but me but im clever at guessing i was the only one that surmised jed morrill was going to marry again i should almost like ivory for myself he is so tall and handsome but of course he can never marry anybody he is too poor and has his mother to look after i wouldnt want to take him from waity though and then perhaps i couldnt get him anyway if i couldnt hed be the only one ive never tried yet but i feel in my bones somehow that i could have any boy in edgewood or riverboro by just crooking my forefinger and beckoning to him i wish i wish they were different they dont make me want to beckon to them my forefinger just stays straight and doesnt feel like crooking theres cephas cole but hes as stupid as an owl i dont want a husband that keeps his mouth wide open whenever im talking no matter whether its sense or nonsense theres phil perry but he likes ellen and besides hes too serious for me and theres mark wilson hes the best dressed and the only one thats been to college he looks at me all the time in meeting and asked me if i wouldnt take a walk some sunday afternoon i know he planned ellens party hoping id be there goodness gracious i do believe that is his horse coming behind me theres no other in the village that goes at such a gait it was indeed mark wilson who always drove according to aunt abby cole as if he was goin for a doctor he caught up with patty almost in the twinkling of an eye but she was ready for him she had taken off her sunbonnet just to twirl it by the string she was so warm with walking and in a jiffy she had lifted the clustering curls from her ears tucked them back with a single expert movement and disclosed two coral pendants just the color of her eartips and her glowing cheeks hello patty the young man called in brusque country fashion as he reined up beside her what are you doing over here why arent you on your way to the party ive been over to limington and am breaking my neck to get home in time myself i am not going there are no parties for me said patty plaintively not going oh i say whats the matter it wont be a bit of fun without you ellen and i made it up expressly for you thinking your father couldnt object to a candypull i cant help it i did the best i could waitstill always asks father for me but i wouldnt take any chances today and i spoke to him myself indeed i almost coaxed him hes a regular old skinflint cried mark getting out of the wagon and walking beside her you mustnt call him names patty interposed with some dignity i call him a good many myself but im his daughter you dont look it said mark admiringly come and have a little ride wont you oh i couldnt possibly thank you some one would be sure to see us and fathers so strict there isnt a building for half a mile just jump in and have a spin till we come to the first house then ill let you out and you can walk the rest of the way home come do and make up to me a little for my disappointment ill skip the candypull if you say the word it was an incredibly brief drive at marks rate of speed and as exciting and blissful as it was brief and dangerous patty thought did she imagine it or did mark help her into the wagon differently from old dr perry for instance the fresh breeze lifted the gold thread of her curls and gave her cheeks a brighter color while her breath came fast through her parted lips and her eyes sparkled at the unexpected unaccustomed pleasure she felt so grown up so conscious of a new power as she sat enthroned on the little wagon seat mark wilson always liked his buggies courtin size so the neighbors said that she was almost courageous enough to agree to make a royal progress through the village almost but not quite come on lets shake the old tabbies up and start em talking shall we mark suggested ill give you the reins and let nero have a flick of the whip no id rather not drive she said id be afraid of this horse and anyway i must get out this very minute yes i really must if you hold nero i can just slip down between the wheels you neednt help me mark alighted notwithstanding her objections saying gallantly i dont miss this pleasure not by a jugful come along jump patty stretched out her hands to be helped but mark forestalled her by putting his arms around her and lifting her down a second of time only was involved but in that second he held her close and kissed her warm cheek her cheek that had never felt the touch of any lips but those of waitstill she pulled her sunbonnet over her flaming face while mark with a gay smile of farewell sprang into the wagon and gave his horse a free rein patty never looked up from the road but walked faster and faster her heart beating at breakneck speed it was a changed world that spun past her fright triumph shame delight a gratified vanity swam over her in turn a few minutes later she heard once more the rumble of wheels on the road it was cephas cole driving towards her over the brow of saco hill hell have seen mark she thought but he cant know ive talked and driven with him ugh how stupid and common he looks i heard your father blowin the supperhorn jest as i come over the bridge remarked cephas drawing up in the road he stood in the dooryard blowin like bedlam i guess you re late to supper ill be home in a few minutes said patty i got delayed and am a little behindhand i turn right round if you git in and lemme take you backalong a piece itll save you a good five minutes begged cephas abjectly all right much obliged but its against the rules and you must drop me at the foot of our hill and let me walk up certain i know the deacon n i aint huntin for trouble any moren you be though i d take it quick enough if you jest give me leave i aint no coward an i could tackle the deacon tomorrow if so be i had anything to ask him this seemed to patty a line of conversation distinctly to be discouraged under all the circumstances and she tried to keep cephas on the subject of his daily tasks and his mothers rheumatism until she could escape from his overappreciative society how do you like my last job he inquired as they passed his fathers house some think ive got the ell a little dite too yaller folks that aint never handled a brush allers think they can mix paint better n them that knows their trade if your object was to have everybody see the ell a mile away youve succeeded said patty cruelly she never flung the poor boy a civil word for fear of getting something warmer than civility in return itll tone down cephas responded rather crestfallen i wanted a good bright lastin shade t wont look so yaller when father lets me paint the house to match but that wont be till next year he makes fun of the yaller color same as you says a homes something you want to forget when youre away from it mother says the two rooms of the ell are big enough for somebody to set up housekeepin in what do you think i never think returned patty with a tantalizing laugh goodnight cephas thank you for giving me a lift vii what dreams may come supper was over and the work done at last the dishes washed the beans put in soak the hens shut up for the night the milk strained and carried down cellar patty went up to her little room with the one window and the slanting walls and waitstill followed and said goodnight her father put out the lights locked the doors and came up the creaking stairs there was never any talk between the sisters before going to bed save on nights when their father was late at the store usually on saturdays only for the good talkers of the village as well as the gossips and loafers preferred any other place to swap stories than the bleak atmosphere provided by old foxy at his place of business patty could think in the dark her healthy young body lying not uncomfortably on the bed of corn husks and the patchwork comforter drawn up under her chin she could think but for the first time she could not tell her thoughts to waitstill she had a secret a dazzling secret just like ellen wilson and some of the other girls who were several years older her afternoons experience loomed as large in her innocent mind as if it had been an elopement i hope im not engaged to be married to him even if he did the sentence was too tremendous to be finished even in thought i dont think i can be men must surely say something and not take it for granted you are in love with them and want to marry them it is what they say when they ask that i should like much better than being married when im only just past seventeen i wish mark was a little different i dont like his careless ways he admires me i can tell one that by the way he looks but he admires himself just as much and expects me to do the same still i suppose none of them are perfect and girls have to forgive lots of little things when they are engaged mother must have forgiven a good many things when she took father anyway mark is going away for a month on business so i shant have to make up my mind just yet here sleep descended upon the slightly puzzled but on the whole delightfully complacent little creature bringing her most alluring and untrustworthy dreams the dear innocent had indeed no need of haste young mr marquis de lafayette wilson mark for short was not in the least a gay deceiver or ruthless breaker of hearts and so far as known no scalps of village beauties were hung to his belt he was a likable lightweight young chap as indolent and pleasureloving as the strict customs of the community would permit and a kiss in his mind most certainly never would lead to the altar else he had already been many times a bridegroom miss patience baxters maiden meditations and uncertainties and perplexities therefore were decidedly premature she was a naturalborn unconsciously artistic highly expert and finished coquette she was all this at seventeen and mark at twentyfour was by no means a match for her in this field of effort yet but sometimes in getting her victim into the net the coquette loses her balance and falls in herself there wasnt a bit of harm in marquis de lafayette but he was extremely agile in keeping out of nets waitstill was restless too that night although she could not have told the reason she opened her window at the back of the house and leaned out the evening was mild with a soft wind blowing she could hear the full brook dashing through the edge of the woodlot and even the kerchug of an occasional bullfrog there were great misty stars in the sky but no moon there was no light in aunt abby coles kitchen but a faint glimmer shone through the windows of uncle barts joiners shop showing that the old man was either having an hour of peaceful contemplation with no companion but his pipe or that there might be a little group of privileged visitors headed by jed morrill busily discussing the affairs of the nation waitstill felt troubled and anxious tonight bruised by the little daily torments that lessened her courage but never wholly destroyed it any one who believed implicitly in heredity might have been puzzled perhaps to account for her he might fantastically picture her as making herself out of her ancestors using a free hand picking and choosing what she liked best with due care for the effect of combinations selecting here and there and modifying if advisable a trait of grandpa or grandma foxwell of greatuncle or greataunt baxter borrowing qualities lavishly from her own gently born and gently bred mother and carefully avoiding her respected fathers stock except perhaps to take a dash of his pluck and an ounce of his persistence jed morrill remarked of deacon baxter once when old foxy wants anything he wait till hell freezes over afore hell give up waitstill had her fathers firm chin but there the likeness ended the proud curve of her nostrils the clear wellopened eye with its deep fringe of lashes the earnest mouth all these came from the mother who was little more than a dim memory waitstill disdained any vague dreary colorless theory of life and its meaning she had joined the church at fifteen more or less because other girls did and the parson had persuaded her but out of her hard life she had somehow framed a courageous philosophy that kept her erect and uncrushed no matter how great her difficulties she had no idea of bringing a poor weak draggled soul to her maker at the last day saying here is all i have managed to save out of what you gave me that would be something she allowed immeasurably something but pitiful compared with what she might do if she could keep a brave vigorous spirit and march to the last tribunal strengthened by battles struggles defeats victories by the defense of weaker human creatures above all warmed and vitalized by the pouring out and gathering in of love patty slept sweetly on the other side of the partition the contemplation of her twopenny triumphs bringing a smile to her childish lips but even so a good heart was there still perhaps in the process of making a quick wit ready sympathy natural charm plenty indeed for the stronger sister to cherish protect and hold precious as she did with all her mind and soul there had always been a passionate loyalty in waitstills affection wherever it had been bestowed uncle bart delighted in telling an instance of it that occurred when she was a child of five maine had just separated amicably from her mother massachusetts and become an independent state it was in the middle of march but there was no snow on the ground and the village boys had built a bonfire on a plot of land near uncle barts joiners shop there was a large gathering in celebration of the historic event and waitstill crept down the hill with her homemade rag doll in her arms she stood on the outskirts of the crowd a silent absorbed little figure clad in a shabby woollen coat with a blue knit hood framing her rosy face deborah her beloved her only doll was tightly clasped in her arms for debby like her parent had few pleasures and must not be denied so great a one as this suddenly one of the thoughtless young scamps in the group wishing to create a new sensation and add to the general excitement caught the doll from the childs arms and running forward with a loud warwhoop flung it into the flames waitstill did not lose an instant she gave a scream of anguish and without giving any warning of her intentions probably without realizing them herself she dashed through the little crowd into the bonfire and snatched her cherished offspring from the burning pile the whole thing was over in the twinkling of an eye for uncle bart was as quick as the child and dragged her out of the imminent danger with no worse harm done than a good scorching he led the little creature up the hill to explain matters and protect her from a scolding she still held the doll against her heaving breast saying between her sobs i couldnt let my debby burn up i couldnt uncle bart shes got nobody but me is my dress scorched so much i cant wear it you tell father how it was uncle bart wont you debby bore the marks of her adventure longer than her owner for she had been longer in the fire but stained and defaced as she was she was never replaced and remained the only doll of waitstills childhood at this very moment she lay softly and safely in a bureau drawer ready to be lifted out sometime waitstill fancied and shown tenderly to pattys children of her own possible children she never thought there was but one man in the world who could ever be the father of them and she was separated from him by every obstacle that could divide two human beings summer viii the joiners shop village aunts and uncles were elected to that relationship by the common consent of the community their fitness being established by great age by decided individuality or eccentricity of character by uncommon lovableness or by the possession of an abundant wit and humor there was no formality about the thing certain women were always called aunt sukie or aunt hitty or what not while certain men were distinguished as uncle rish or uncle pel without previous arrangement or the consent of the high contracting parties such a couple were cephas coles father and mother aunt abby and uncle bart bartholomew coles trade was that of a joiner as for aunt abbys it can only be said that she made all trades her own by sovereign right of investigation and what she did not know about her neighbors occupations was unlikely to he discovered on this side of jordan one of the villagers declared that aunt abby and her neighbor mrs abel day had argued for an hour before they could make a bargain about the method of disseminating a certain important piece of news theirs by exclusive right of discovery and prior possession mrs day offered to give mrs cole the privilege of saco hill and aunt bettyjacks she herself to take guideboard and townhouse hills aunt abby quickly proved the injustice of this decision saying that there were twice as many families living in mrs days chosen territory as there were in that allotted to her so the river road to millikens mills was grudgingly awarded to aunt abby by way of compromise and the ladies started on what was a tour of mercy in those days the furnishing of a subject of discussion for long quiet evenings uncle barts joiners shop was at the foot of guideboard hill on the riverboro side of the bridge and it was the pleasantest spot in the whole village the shop itself had a cheery look with its weatherstained shingles its small square windows and its hospitable door half as big as the front side of the building the step was an old millstone too worn for active service and the piles of chips and shavings on each side of it had been there for so many years that sweetwilliams clove pinks and purple phlox were growing in among them in the most irresponsible fashion while a morningglory vine had crept up and curled around a longhandled rake that had been standing against the front of the house since early spring there was an air of cosy and amiable disorder about the place that would have invited friendly confabulation even had not uncle barts white head honest ruddy face and smiling welcome coaxed you in before you were aware a fine nodhead apple tree shaded the side windows and underneath it reposed all summer a bright blue sleigh for uncle bart always described himself as being plagued for shed room and kept things as he liked at the shop having a pison neat wife who did exactly the opposite at his house the seat of the sleigh was all white now with scattered fruit blossoms and one of waitstills earliest remembrances was of going downhill with patty toddling at her side of uncle barts lifting them into the sleigh and permitting them to sit there and eat the ripe red apples that had fallen from the tree uncle barts son cephas pattys secret adorer was a painter by trade and kept his pots and cans and brushes in a little outhouse at the back while uncle bart himself stood every day behind his long joiners bench almost kneedeep in shavings how the children loved to play with the white satiny rings making them into necklaces hanging them to their ears and weaving them into wreaths wonderful houses could always be built in the corner of the shop out of the little odds and ends and nubbins of white pine and uncle bart was ever ready to cut or saw a special piece needed for some great purpose the sound of the plane was sweet music in the old joiners ears i dont hardly know how id a made out if id had to work in a mill he said confidentially to cephas the noise of a saw goin all day coupled with your mothers tongue mornins an evenins would a been too much for my weak head im a quiet man cephas a man that needs a peaceful shop where he can get away from the comforts of home now and then without shirkin his duty nor causin gossip if you should ever marry cephas which dont look to me likely without you pick out a difrent girl i d advise you not to keep your stock o paints in the barn or the shed for its altogether too handy to the house and the womenfolks take my advice and have a place to yourself even if its a small one a shop or a barn has saved many a mans life and reason cephas for its agin a womans nature to have you underfoot in the house without hectorin you choose a girl sames you would a horse that you want to hitch up into a span t aint every two thatll stan together without kickin when you get the right girl keep out of her way considable an therell be less wear an tear it was june and the countryside was so beautiful it seemed as if no one could be unhappy however great the cause that was what waitstill baxter thought as she sat down on the millstone step for a word with the old joiner her best and most understanding friend in all the village ive come to do my mending here with you she said brightly as she took out her wellfilled basket and threaded her needle isnt it a wonderful morning nobody could look the world in the face and do a wrong thing on such a day could they uncle bart the meadows were a waving mass of golden buttercups the shallow water at the rivers edge just below the shop was blue with spikes of arrowweed a bunch of fragrant waterlilies gathered from the millponds upper levels lay beside waitstills mendingbasket and every foot of roadside and field within sight was swaying with longstemmed white and gold daisies the june grass the friendly humble companionable grass that no one ever praises as they do the flowers was a rich emerald green a velvet carpet fit for the feet of the angels themselves and the elms and maples was there ever such a year for richness of foliage and the sky was it ever so blue or so clear so far away or so completely like heaven as you looked at its reflection in the glassy surface of the river yes its a pretty good day allowed uncle bart judicially as he took a squint at his tsquare i don knows i should want to start out an try to beat it the lord can make a good many kinds o weather in the course of a year but when he puts his mind on to it an kind o gives himself a free hand he can turn out a june morning that must make the devil sick to his stomach with envy all the same waity my cow aint behavin herself any bettern usual shes been rampagin since sunup ive seen mother chasin her out o mis days gardenpatch twice aready it seems real good an homey to see you settin there sewin while im workin at the bench cephas is down to the store so i spose your fathers off somewheres perhaps the june grass was a little greener the buttercups yellower the foliage more lacey the sky bluer because deacon baxter had taken his luncheon in a pail under the wagon seat and departed on an unwilling journey to moderation his object being to press the collection of some accounts too long overdue there was something tragic in the fact waitstill thought that whenever her father left the village for a whole day life at once grew brighter easier more hopeful one could breathe freely speak ones heart out believe in the future when father was away the girls had harbored many delightful plans at early breakfast as it was saturday patty could catch little rod boynton if he came to the bridge on errands as usual and if ivory could spare him for an hour at noon they would take their luncheon and eat it together on the riverbank as patty had promised him at the last moment however deacon baxter had turned around in the wagon and said patience you go down to the store and have a regular housecleanin in the stockroom git cephas to lift what you cant lift yourself move everything in the place sweep and dust it scrub the floor wash the winder and make room for the new stuff that they bring up from milltown bout noon if you have any time left over put new papers on the shelves out front and clean up and fix the show winder dont stand round gabbin with cephas and seet he dont waste time thats paid for by me tell him he might clean up the terbaccer stains round the stove black it and cover it up for the summer if he aint too busy servin custmers the whole day spoiled wailed patty flinging herself down in the kitchen rocker fathers powers of invention beat anything i ever saw that stockroom could have been cleaned any time this month and its too heavy work for me anyway it spoils my hands grubbing around those nasty sticky splintery boxes and barrels instead of being out of doors ive got to be shut up in that smelly rummy tobaccoy saltfishy pepperminty place with cephas cole he wont have a pleasant morning i can tell you i shall snap his head off every time he speaks to me so i would waitstill answered composedly everything is so clearly his fault that i certainly would work off my temper on cephas still i can think of a way to make matters come out right ive got a great basket of mending that must be done and you remember theres a choir rehearsal for the new anthem this afternoon but anyway i can help a little on the cleaning then you can make rodman do a few of the odd jobs it will be a novelty to him and cephas will work his fingers to the bone for you as you well know if you treat him like a human being all right cried patty joyously her mood changing in an instant theres rod coming over the bridge now toss me my gingham apron and the scrubbingbrush and the pail and the tin of soft soap and the cleaning cloths lets see the brooms down there so ive got everything if i wave a towel from the store pack up luncheon for three you come down and bring your mending then when you see how im getting on we can consult im going to take the ten cents ive saved and spend it in raisins i can get a good many if cephas gives me wholesale price with family discount substracted from that cephas would treat me to candy in a minute but if i let him wed have to ask him to the picnic goodbye and the volatile creature darted down the hill singing therell be something in heaven for children to do at the top of her healthy young lungs ix cephas speaks the waving signal a little later on showed that rodman could go to the picnic the fact being that he was having a holiday from eleven oclock until two and ivory was going to drive to the bridge at noon anyway so his permission could then be asked pattys mind might have been thought entirely on her ugly task as she swept and dusted and scrubbed that morning but the reverse was true mark wilson had gone away without saying goodbye to her this was not surprising perhaps as she was about as much sequestered in her hilltop prison as a turkish beauty in a harem neither was it astonishing that mark did not write to her he never had written to her and as her father always brought home the very infrequent letters that came to the family mark knew that any sentimental correspondence would be fraught with danger no everything was probably just as it should be and yet well patty had expected during the last three weeks that something would happen to break up the monotony of her former existence she hardly knew what it would be but the kiss dropped so lightly on her cheek by mark wilson still burned in remembrance and made her sure that it would have a sequel or an explanation marks sister ellen and phil perry were in the midst of some form of lovers quarrel and during its progress phil was paying considerable attention to patty at sabbath school and prayermeeting occasions it must be confessed only provocative of very indirect and longdistance advances cephas cole to the amazement of every one but his constitutionally exasperated mother was toning down the ell of the family mansion mitigating the lively yellow and putting another fresh coat of paint on it for no conceivable reason save that of pleasing the eye of a certain capricious ungrateful young hussy who would probably say when her verdict was asked that she didnt see any particular difference in it one way or another trade was not especially brisk at the deacons emporium this sunny june saturday morning cephas may have possibly lost a customer or two by leaving the store vacant while he toiled and sweated for miss patience baxter in the stockroom at the back overhanging the river but no man alive could see his employers lovely daughter tugging at a keg of shingle nails without trying to save her from a broken back although cephas could have watched his mother move the house and barn without feeling the slightest anxiety in her behalf if he could ever get the heft of the doggoned cleaning out of the way so that pattys mind could be free to entertain his proposition could ever secure one precious moment of silence when she was not slatting and banging pushing and pulling things about her head and ears out of sight under a shelf and an irritating air of absorption about her whole demeanor if that moment of silence could ever under providence be simultaneous with the absence of customers in the front shop cephas intended to offer himself to patience baxter that very morning once during a temporary lull in the rear he started to meet his fate when rodman boynton followed him into the back room and the boy was at once set to work by patty who was the most consummate slavedriver in the state of maine after half an hour there was another heavensent chance when rodman went up to uncle barts shop with a message for waitstill but just then in came bill morrill a boy of twelve with a request for a gallon of molasses and would cephas lend him a stone jug over sunday for his mother had hers soakin out in soapsuds cause t want smellin jest right bills message given he hurried up the road on another errand promising to call for the molasses later cephas put the gallon measure under the spigot of the molasses hogshead and turned on the tap the task was going to be a long one and he grew impatient for the stream was only a slender trickle scarcely more than the slow dripping of drops so the molasses must be very never low and with his mind full of weightier affairs he must make a note to tell the deacon to broach a new hogshead cephas feared that he could never make out a full gallon in which case mrs morrill would be vexed for she kept mill boarders and baked quantities of brown bread and gingerbread and molasses cookies for over sunday he did wish trade would languish altogether on this particular morning the minutes dragged by and again there was perfect quiet in the stockroom as the door opened cephas taking his last chance went forward to meet patty who was turning down the skirt of her dress taking the cloth off her head smoothing her hair and tying on a clean white ruffed apron in which she looked as pretty as a pink patty stammered cephas seizing his golden opportunity patty keep your mind on me for a minute ive put a new coat o paint on the ell just to please you wont you get married and settle down with me i love you so i cant eat nor drink nor tend store nor nothin oh i i couldnt cephas thank you i just couldnt dont ask me cried patty as nervous as cephas himself now that her first offer had really come im only seventeen and i dont feel like settling down cephas and father wouldnt think of letting me get married dont play tricks on me patty and keep shovin me off so an givin wrong reasons pleaded cephas whats the trouble with me i know mothers tempers onsartain but we never need go into the main house daytimes and fatherd allers stand up agin her if she didnt treat you right ive got a good trade and father has a hundred dollars o my savins that i can draw out tomorrer if youll have me i cant cephas dont move stay where you are no dont come any nearer im not fond of you that way and besides and besides her blush and her evident embarrassment gave cephas a new fear you aint promised aready be you he asked anxiously when there aint a feller anywheres around thats ever stepped foot over your fathers doorsill but jest me i havent promised anything or anybody patty answered sedately gaining her selfcontrol by degrees but i wont deny that im considering thats true considerin who asked cephas turning pale oh several if you must know the truth and pattys tone was cruel in its jauntiness several the word did not sound like ordinary workaday riverboro english in cephass ears he knew that several meant more than one but he was too stunned to define the term properly in its present strange connection whoever t is wouldnt do any better by youn i would id take a lickin for you any day cephas exclaimed abjectly after a long pause that wouldnt make any difference cephas said patty firmly moving towards the front door as if to end the interview if i dont love you unlicked i couldnt love you any better licked now could i goodness gracious what am i stepping in cephas quick something has been running all over the floor my feet are sticking to it good gosh its mis morrills molasses cried cephas brought to his senses suddenly it was too true whatever had been the small obstruction in the tap it had disappeared the gallon measure had been filled to the brim ten minutes before and ever since the treacly liquid had been overflowing the top and spreading in a brown flood unnoticed over the floor pattys feet were glued to it her buff calico skirts lifted high to escape harm i cant move she cried oh you stupid stupid cephas how could you leave the molasses spigot turned on see what youve done youve wasted quarts and quarts what will father say and how will you ever clean up such a mess you never can get the floor to look so that he wont notice it and he is sure to miss the molasses youve ruined my shoes and i simply cant bear the sight of you at this cephas all but blubbered in the agony of his soul it was bad enough to be told by patty that she was considering several but his first romance had ended in such complete disaster that he saw in a vision his life blasted changed in one brief moment from that of a prosperous young painter to that of a blighted and despised bungler whose weeks wages were likely to be expended in molasses to make good the deacons loss find those cleaningcloths i left in the hack room ordered patty with a flashing eye get some blocks or bits of board or stones for me to walk on so that i can get out of your nasty mess fill bill morrills jug quick and set it out on the steps for him to pick up i dont know what youd do without me to plan for you lock the front door and hang fathers sign that hes gone to dinner on the doorknob scoop up all the molasses you can with one of those new trowels on the counter scoop and scrape and scoop and scrape then put a cloth on your oldest broom pour lots of water on pail after pail and swab when youve swabbed till it wont do any more good then scrub after that i shouldnt wonder if you had to fan the floor with a newspaper or itll never get dry before father comes home ill sit on the flour barrel a little while and advise but i cant stay long because im going to a picnic hurry up and dont look as if you were going to die any minute its no use crying over spilt molasses you dont suppose im going to tell any tales after youve made me an offer of marriage do you im not so mean as all that though i may have my faults it was nearly two oclock before the card announcing deacon baxters absence at dinner was removed from the front doorknob and when the store was finally reopened for business it was a most dejected clerk who dealt out groceries to the public the worst feature of the affair was that every one in the two villages suddenly and contemporaneously wanted molasses so that cephas spent the afternoon reviewing his misery by continually turning the tap and drawing off the fatal liquid then too every inquisitive boy in the neighborhood came to the back of the store to view the operation exclaiming what makes the floor so wet haint been spillin molasses have yer bet yer have good joke on old foxy x on tory hill it had been a heavenly picnic the little trio all agreed as to that and when ivory saw the baxter girls coming up the shady path that led along the river from the indian cellar to the bridge it was a merry group and a transfigured rodman that caught his eye the boy trailing on behind with the baskets and laden with tin dippers and wildflowers seemed another creature from the bigeyed quiet little lad he saw every day he had chattered like a magpie eaten like a bear is torn his jacket getting wild columbines for patty been nicely darned by waitstill and was in a state of hilarity that rendered him quite unrecognizable weve had a lovely picnic called patty i wish you had been with us you didnt ask me smiled ivory picking up waitstills mendingbasket from the nook in the trees where she had hidden it for safekeeping weve played games ivory cried the boy patty made them up herself first we had the landing of the pilgrims and waitstill made believe be the figurehead of the mayflower she stood on a great boulder and sang the breaking waves dashed high on a stern and rockbound coast and oh she was splendid then patty was pocahontas and i was capn john smith and look we are all dressed up for the indian wedding waitstill had on a crown of white birch bark and her braid of hair twined with running evergreen fell to her waist patty was wreathed with columbines and decked with some turkey feathers that she had put in her basket as too pretty to throw away waitstill looked rather conscious in her unusual finery but patty sported it with the reckless ease and innocent vanity that characterized her i shall have to run into fathers store to put myself tidy waitstill said so goodbye rodman well have another picnic some day patty you must do the chores this afternoon you know so that i can go to choir rehearsal rodman and patty started up the hill gayly with their burdens and ivory walked by waitstills side as she pulled off her birchbark crown and twisted her braid around her head with a heightened color at being watched i say goodbye now ivory but i see you at the meetinghouse she said as she neared the store ill go in here and brush the pine needles off wash my hands and rest a little before rehearsal thats a puzzling anthem we have for tomorrow i have my horse here let me drive you up to the church i cant ivory thank you fathers orders are against my driving out with any one you know very well the road is free at any rate ill hitch my horse down here in the woods somewhere and when you start to walk i shall follow and catch up with you theres luckily only one way to reach the church from here and your father cant blame us if we both take it and so it fell out that ivory and waitstill walked together in the cool of the afternoon to the meetinghouse on tory hill waitstill kept the beaten path on one side and ivory that on the other so that the width of the country road deep in dust was between them yet their nearness seemed so tangible a thing that each could feel the heart beating in the others side their talk was only that of tried friends a talk interrupted by long beautiful silences silences that come only to a man and woman whose understanding of each other is beyond question and answer not a sound broke the stillness yet the very air it seemed to them was shedding meanings the flowers were exhaling a love secret with their fragrances the birds were singing it boldly from the treetops yet no word passed the mans lips or the girls patty would have hung out all sorts of signals and lures to draw the truth from ivory and break through the walls of his selfcontrol but waitstill never and ivory boynton was made of stuff so strong that he would not speak a syllable of love to a woman unless he could say all he was only fiveandtwenty but he had been reared in a rigorous school and had learned in its poverty loneliness and anxiety lessons of selfdenial and selfcontrol that bore daily fruit now he knew that deacon baxter would never allow any engagement to exist between waitstill and himself he also knew that waitstill would never defy and disobey her father if it meant leaving her younger sister to fight alone a dreary battle for which she was not fitted if there was little hope on her side there seemed even less on his his mothers mental illness made her peculiarly dependent upon him and at the same time held him in such strict bondage that it was almost impossible for him to get on in the world or even to give her the comforts she needed in villages like riverboro in those early days there was no putting away even of men or women so demented as to be something of a menace to the peace of the household but lois boynton was so gentle so fragile so exquisite a spirit that she seemed in her sad aloofness simply a thing to be sheltered and shielded somehow in her difficult life journey ivory often thought how sorely she needed a daughter in her affliction if the baby sister had only lived the home might have been different but alas there was only a son a son who tried to be tender and sympathetic but after all was nothing but a big clumsy uncomprehending mancreature who ought to be felling trees ploughing sowing reaping or at least studying law making his own fortune and that of some future wife old mrs mason a garrulous goodhearted grandame was their only near neighbor and her visits always left his mother worse rather than better how such a girl as waitstill would pour comfort and beauty and joy into a lonely house like his if only he were weak enough to call upon her strength and put it to so cruel a test god help him he would never do that especially as he could not earn enough to keep a larger family bound down as he was by inexorable responsibilities waitstill thus far in life had suffered many sorrows and enjoyed few pleasures marriage ought to bring her freedom and plenty not carking care and poverty he stole long looks at the girl across the separating space that was so helpless to separate feeding his starved heart upon her womanly graces her quick springing step was in harmony with the fire and courage of her mien there was a line or two in her face small wonder but an unconquerable soul shone in her eyes shone too in no uncertain way but brightly and steadily expressing an unshaken joy in living valiant splendid indomitable waitstill he could never tell her alas but how he gloried in her it is needless to say that no woman could be the possessor of such a love as ivory boyntons and not know of its existence waitstill never heard a breath of it from ivorys lips even his eyes were under control and confessed nothing nor did his hand ever clasp hers to show by a telltale touch the truth he dared not utter nevertheless she felt that she was beloved she hid the knowledge deep in her heart and covered it softly from every eye but her own taking it out in the safe darkness sometimes to wonder over and adore in secret did her love for ivory rest partly on a sense of vocation a profound inarticulate divining of his vast need of her he was so strong yet so weak because of the yoke he bore so bitterly alone in his desperate struggle with life that her heart melted like wax whenever she thought of him when she contemplated the hidden mutiny in her own heart she was awestruck sometimes at the almost divine patience of ivorys conduct as a son how is your mother this summer ivory she asked as they sat down on the meetinghouse steps waiting for jed morrill to open the door there is little change in her from year to year waitstill by the way why dont we get out of this afternoon sun and sit in the old graveyard under the trees we are early and the choir wont get here for half an hour dr perry says that he does not understand mothers case in the least and that no one but some great boston physician could give a proper opinion on it of course that is impossible at present they sat down on the grass underneath one of the elms and waitstill took off her hat and leaned back against the treetrunk tell me more she said it is so long since we talked together quietly and we have never really spoken of your mother of course ivory continued the people of the village all think and speak of mothers illness as religious insanity but to me it seems nothing of the sort i was only a child when father first fell ill with jacob cochrane but i was twelve when father went away from home on his mission and if there was any one suffering from delusions in our family it was he not mother she had altogether given up going to the cochrane meetings and i well remember the scene when my father told her of the revelation he had received about going through the state and into new hampshire in order to convert others and extend the movement she had no sympathy with his selfimposed mission you may be sure though now she goes back in her memory to the earlier days of her married life when she tried hard poor soul to tread the same path that father was treading so as to be by his side at every turn of the road i am sure here ivorys tone was somewhat dry and satirical that fathers road had many turns waitstill he was a schoolmaster in saco you know when i was born but he soon turned from teaching to preaching and here my mother followed with entire sympathy for she was intensely devoutly religious i said there was little change in her but there is one new symptom she has ceased to refer to her conversion to cochranism as a blessed experience her memory of those first days seems to have faded as to her sisters death and all the circumstances of her bringing rodman home her mind is a blank her expectation of fathers return on the other hand is much more intense than ever she must have loved your father dearly ivory and to lose him in this terrible way is much worse than death uncle bart says he had a great gift of language yes and it was that in my mind that led him astray i fear that the spirit of god was never so strong in father as the desire to influence people by his oratory that was what drew him to preaching in the first place and when he found injacob cochrane a man who could move an audience to frenzy lift them out of the body and do with their spirits as he willed he acknowledged him as master whether his gospel was a pure and undefiled religion i doubt but he certainly was a master of mesmeric control my mother was beguiled entranced even bewitched at first i doubt not for she translated all that cochrane said into her own speech and regarded him as the prophet of a new era but cochranes last revelations differed from the first and were of the earth earthy my mothers pure soul must have revolted but she was not strong enough to drag father from his allegiance mother was of better family than father but they were both well educated and had the best schooling to be had in their day so far as i can judge mother always had more balance than father and much better judgment yet look at her now then you think it was your fathers disappearance that really caused her mind to waver asked waitstill i do indeed i dont know what happened between them in the way of religious differences nor how much unhappiness these may have caused i remember she had an illness when we first came here to live and i was a little chap of three or four but that was caused by the loss of a child a girl who lived only a few weeks she recovered perfectly and her head was as clear as mine for a year or two after father went away as his letters grew less frequent as news of him gradually ceased to come she became more and more silent and retired more completely into herself she never went anywhere nor entertained visitors because she did not wish to hear the gossip and speculation that were going on in the village some of it was very hard for a wife to bear and she resented it indignantly yet never received a word from father with which to refute it at this time as nearly as i can judge she was a recluse and subject to periods of profound melancholy but nothing worse then she took that winter journey to her sisters deathbed brought home the boy and hastened by exposure and chill and grief i suppose her mind gave way thats all and ivory sighed drearily as he stretched himself on the greensward and looked off towards the snowclad new hampshire hills ive meant to write the story of the cochrane craze sometime or such part of it as has to do with my family history and you shall read it if you like i should set down my childhood and my boyhood memories together with such scraps of village hearsay as seem reliable you were not so much younger than i but i was in the thick of the excitement and naturally i heard more than you having so bitter a reason for being interested jacob cochrane has altogether disappeared from public view but theres many a family in maine and new hampshire yes and in the far west that will feel his influence for years to come i should like very much to read your account aunt abbys version for instance is so different from uncle barts that one can scarcely find the truth between the two and fathers bears no relation to that of any of the others some of us see facts and others see visions replied ivory and these differences of opinion crop up in the village every day when anything noteworthy is discussed i came upon a quotation in my reading last evening that described it one said it thundered another that an angel spake do you feel as if your father was dead ivory i can only hope so that thought brings sadness with it as one remembers his disappointment and failure but if he is alive he is a traitor there was a long pause and they could see in the distance humphrey barker with his clarionet and pliny waterhouse with his bass viol driving up to the churchyard fence to hitch their horses the sun was dipping low and red behind the townhouse hill on the other side of the river what makes my father dislike the very mention of yours asked waitstill i know what they say that it is because the two men had high words once in a cochrane meeting when father tried to interfere with some of the exercises and was put out of doors it doesnt seem as if that grievance seventeen or eighteen years ago would influence his opinion of your mother or of you it isnt likely that a man of your fathers sort would forget or forgive what he considered an injury and in refusing to have anything to do with the son of a disgraced man and a deranged woman he is well within his rights ivorys cheeks burned red under the tan and his hand trembled a little as he plucked bits of clover from the grass and pulled them to pieces absentmindedly how are you getting on at home these days waitstill he asked as if to turn his own mind and hers from a too painful subject you have troubles enough of your own without hearing mine ivory and anyway they are not big afflictions heavy sorrows like those you have to bear mine are just petty nagging sordid cheap little miseries like gnatbites so petty and so sordid that i can hardly talk to god about them much less to a human friend patty is my only outlet and i need others yet i find it almost impossible to escape from the narrowness of my life and be of use to any one else the girls voice quivered and a single teardrop on her cheek showed that she was speaking from a full heart this afternoons talk has determined me in one thing she went on i am going to see your mother now and then i shall have to do it secretly for your sake for hers and for my own but if i am found out then i will go openly there must be times when one can break the lower law and yet keep the higher fathers law in this case is the lower and i propose to break it i cant have you getting into trouble waitstill ivory objected youre the one woman i can think of who might help my mother all the same i would not make your life harder not for worlds it will not be harder and even if it was i should count it all joy to help a woman bear such sorrow as your mother endures patiently day after day and waitstill rose to her feet and tied on her hat as one who had made up her mind it was almost impossible for ivory to hold his peace then so full of gratitude was his soul and so great his longing to pour out the feeling that flooded it he pulled himself together and led the way out of the churchyard to look at waitstill again would be to lose his head but to his troubled heart there came a flood of light a glory from that lamp that a woman may hold up for a man a glory that none can take from him and none can darken a light by which he may walk and live and die xi a june sunday it was a sunday in june and almost the whole population of riverboro and edgewood was walking or driving in the direction of the meetinghouse on tory hill church toilettes you may well believe were difficult of attainment by deacon baxters daughters as they had been by his respective helpmates in years gone by when waitstills mother first asked her husband to buy her a new dress and that was two years after marriage he simply said you look well enough what do you want to waste money on finery for these hard times if other folks are extravagant that aint any reason you should be you aint obliged to take your neighbors for an example take em for a warnin but foxwell my sunday dress is worn completely to threads urged the second mrs baxter thats what women always say theyre all alike no more idea o savin anything than a skunkblackbird i cant spare any money for gewgaws and you might as well understand it first as last go up attic and open the hair trunk by the winder youll find plenty there to last you for years to come the second mrs baxter visited the attic as commanded and in turning over the clothes in the old trunk knew by instinct that they had belonged to her predecessor in office some of the dresses were neat though terribly worn and faded but all were fortunately far too short and small for a person of her fine proportions besides her very soul shrank from wearing them and her spirit revolted both from the insult to herself and to the poor dead woman she had succeeded so she came downstairs to darn and mend and patch again her shabby wardrobe waitstill had gone through the same as her mother before her but in despair when she was seventeen she began to cut over the old garments for herself and patty mercifully there were very few of them and they had long since been discarded at eighteen she had learned to dye yarns with yellow oak or maple bark and to make purples from elder and sumac berries she could spin and knit as well as any old aunt of the village and cut and shape a garment as deftly as the edgewood tailoress but the task of making bricks without straw was a hard one indeed she wore a white cotton frock on this particular sunday it was starched and ironed with a beautiful gloss while a touch of distinction was given to her costume by a little black sleeveless roundabout made out of the covering of an old silk umbrella her flat hat had a single wreath of coarse daisies around the crown and her mitts were darned in many places nevertheless you could not entirely spoil her god had used a liberal hand in making her and her fathers parsimony was a sort of boomerang that flew back chiefly upon himself as for patty her style of beauty like cephas coles ell had to be toned down rather than up to be effective but circumstances had been cruelly unrelenting in this process of late deacon baxter had given the girls three or four shopworn pieces of faded yellow calico that had been repudiated by the village housewives as not fast enough in color to bear the test of proper washing this had made frocks aprons petticoats and even underclothes for two full years and pattys weekly objurgations when she removed her everlasting yellow dress from the nail where it hung were not such as should have fallen from the lips of a deacons daughter waitstill had taken a piece of the same yellow material starched and ironed it cut a curving circular brim from it sewed in a pleated crown and lo a hat for patty what inspired patty to put on a waist ribbon of deepest wine color with a little band of the same on the pale yellow hat no one could say do you think you shall like that dull red right close to the yellow patty waitstill asked anxiously it looks all right on the columbines in the indian cellar replied patty turning and twisting the hat on her head if we cant get a peek at the boston fashions we must just find our styles where we can the various roads to tory hill were alive with vehicles on this bright sunday morning uncle bart and abel day with their respective wives on the back seat of the coles double wagon were passed by deacon baxter and his daughters waitstill being due at meeting earlier than others by reason of her singing in the choir the deacons onehorse twowheeled shay could hold three persons with comfort on its broad seat and the twentyyearold mare although she was always as hollow as a gourd could generally do the mile uphill all the way in half an hour if urged continually and the deacon be it said if not good at feeding was unsurpassed at urging aunt abby cole could get only a passing glimpse of patty in the depths of the shay but a glimpse was always enough for her as her opinion of the girls charms was considerably affected by the forlorn condition of her son cephas whom she suspected of being hopelessly in love with the young person aforesaid to whom she commonly alluded as that redheaded baggage patience baxters got the kind of looks that might do well enough at a tavern dance or a husking but theyre entirely unsuited to the sabbath day or the meetinhouse so aunt abby remarked to mrs day in the way of backseat confidence its unfortunate that a deacons daughter should be afflicted with that bold style of beauty her hairs all but red in fact you might as well call it red when the sun shines on it but if shed ever smack it down with bears grease she might darken it some or anyhow shed make it lay slicker but its the kind of hair that just matches that kind of a girl sort of up an comin then her skins so white and her cheeks so pink and her eyes so snappy that shed attract attention without half trying though i guess she aint above makin an effort shes innnocent as a kitten observed mrs day impartially oh yes shes innocent enough an i hope shell keep so waitstills a sight hansomer if the truth was told but shes the sort of girl thats made for one man and the rest of em never look at her the other ones cut out for the crowd the more the merrier shes a kind of mantrap that girl is do urge the horse a little mite bartholomew it makes me kind o hot to be passed by deacon baxter its missionary sunday too when he genally has rheumatism too bad to come out i wonder if he ever puts anything into the plate said mrs day no one ever saw him that i know of the deacon keeps the thou shalt not commandments pretty well was aunt abbys terse response i guess he dont put nothin into the plate but i spose wed ought to be thankful he dont take nothin out the baptists are gettin ahead faster than theyd ought to up to the mills our minister aint no kind of a proselyter seems as if he didnt care how folks got to heaven so long as they got there the other church is havin a service this afternoon side o the river an id kind o like to go except it would please em too much to have a crowd there to see the immersion they tell me but i dont know how true that that tillman widder woman that come here from somewheres in vermont wanted to be baptized today but the other converts declared they wouldnt be if she was jed morrill said theyd have to hold her under water quite a spell to do any good chuckled uncle bart from the front seat well i wouldnt repeat it bartholomew on the sabbath day not if he did say it jed morrills responsible for more blasphemious jokes than any man in edgewood i dont approve of makin light of anybodys religious observances if theyre ever so foolish said aunt abby somewhat enigmatically our minister keeps remindin us that the baptists and methodists are our brethren but i wish hed be a little more anxious to have our sceity keep ahead of the others jeds bout right in sizin up the widder tillman was mr days timid contribution to the argument i aint a readin man but from what folks report i should think she was one o them critters that set on rocks bewilderin an bedevilin menfolks out o their senses syreens i think they call em a reglar syreen is what that woman is i guess there there abel you wouldnt know a syreen if you found one in your baked beans so dont take away a womans character on hearsay and mrs day having shut up her husband as was her bounden duty as a wife and a christian tied her bonnet strings a little tighter and looked distinctly pleased with herself abel aint startin any new gossip was aunt abbys opinion as she sprung to his rescue one or two more holes in a colander dont make much difrence bartholomew were certainly goin to be late this mornin were about the last team on the road and aunt abby glanced nervously behind elder boone aint begun the openin prayer though or we should know it you can hear him pray a mile away when the winds right i do hate to be late to meetin the elder allers takes notice the folks in the wing pews allers gapes an stares and the choir peeks through the curtain takin notes of everything youve got on your back i hope to the land theyll chord and keep together a little mite better n theyve done lately thats all i can say if the lord is right in our midst as the bible says he cant think much of our singers this summer theyre improvin now that pliny waterhouse plays his fiddle mrs day remarked pacifically there was times in the anthem when they kept together considable well last sunday they didnt always chord but there they chorded some were most there now abby dont fret cephas wont ring the last bell till he knows his own folks is crossin the common those were days of conscientious churchgoing and every pew in the house was crowded the pulpit was built on pillars that raised it six feet higher than the floor the top was cushioned and covered with red velvet surmounted by a huge giltedged bible there was a window in the tower through which cephas cole could look into the church and while tolling the bell could keep watch for the minister always exactly on time he would come in walk slowly up the righthand aisle mount the pulpit stairs enter and close the door after him then cephas would give one tremendous pull to warn loiterers on the steps a pull that meant parsons in the pulpit and was acted upon accordingly opening the big bible the minister raised his right hand impressively and saying let us pray the whole congregation rose in their pews with a great rustling and bowed their heads devoutly for the invocation next came the hymn generally at that day one of isaac wattss the singers fifteen or twenty in number sat in a raised gallery opposite the pulpit and there was a rod in front hung with red curtains to hide them when sitting down any one was free to join which perhaps accounted for aunt abbys strictures as to time and tune jed morrill blasphemious as he was considered by that acrimonious lady was the leader and a good one too there would be a great whispering and buzzing when deacon sumner with his big fiddle and pliny waterhouse with his smaller one would try to get in accord with humphrey baker and his clarionet all went well when humphrey was there to give the sure keynote but in his absence jed morrill would use his tuningfork when the key was finally secured by all concerned jed would raise his stick beat one measure to set the time and all joined in or fell in according to their several abilities it was not always a perfect thing in the way of a start but they were well together at the end of the first line and when as now the choir numbered a goodly number of voices and there were three or four hundred in the pews nothing more inspiring in its peculiar way was ever heard than the congregational singing of such splendid hymns as old hundred duke street or coronation waitstill led the trebles and ivory was at the far end of the choir in the basses but each was conscious of the others presence this morning he could hear her noble voice rising a little above or perhaps from its quality separating itself somehow ever so little from the others how full of strength and hope it was her voice how steadfast to the pitch how golden its color how moving in its crescendos how the words flowed from her lips not as if they had been written years ago but as if they were the expression of her own faith there were many in the congregation who were stirred they knew not why when there chanced to be only a few carrying the air and they could really hear waitstill baxter singing some dear old hymn full of sacred memories like while thee i seek protecting power be my vain wishes stilled and may this consecrated hour with better hopes be filled there may be them in boston that can sing louder and they may be able to run up a little higher than waitstill but the question is could any of em make aunt abby cole shed tears this was jed morrills tribute to his best soprano there were sunday evening prayermeetings too held at early candlelight when waitstill and lucy morrill would make a duet of by cool siloams shady rill or the favorite naomi and the two fresh young voices rising and falling in the tender thirds of the old tunes melted all hearts to new willingness of sacrifice father whateer of earthly bliss thy sovreign will denies accepted at thy throne of grace let this petition rise give me a calm a thankful heart from every murmur free the blessing of thy grace impart and let me live to thee how ivory loved to hear waitstill sing these lines how they eased his burden as they were easing hers falling on his impatient longing heart like evening dew on thirsty grass xii the greeneyed monster while thee i seek protecting power was the first hymn on this particular sunday morning and it usually held pattys rather vagrant attention to the end though it failed to do so today the baxters occupied one of the wing pews a position always to be envied as one could see the singers without turning around and also observe everybody in the congregation their entrance garments behavior and especially their bonnets without being in the least indiscreet or seeming to have a roving eye lawyer wilsons pew was the second in front of the baxters in the same wing and patty seated decorously but unwillingly beside her father was impatiently awaiting the entrance of the family knowing that mark would be with them if he had returned from boston timothy grant the parish clerk had the pew in between and afforded a most edifying spectacle to the community as there were seven young grants of a churchgoing age and the ladies of the congregation were always counting them reckoning how many more were in their cradles at home and trying to guess from mrs grants lively or chastened countenance whether any new ones had been born since the sunday before patty settled herself comfortably and put her foot on the wooden cricket raising her buff calico a little on the congregation side just enough to show an inch or two of petticoat the petticoat was as modestly long as the frock itself and disclosing a bit of it was nothing more heinous than a casual exhibition of good needlework deacon baxter furnished only the unbleached muslin for his daughters undergarments but twelve little tucks laboriously done by hand elaborate inchwide edging crocheted from white spool cotton and days of bleaching on the grass in the sun will make a petticoat that can be shown in church with some justifiable pride the wilsons came up the aisle a moment later than was their usual habit just after the parson had ascended the pulpit mrs wilson always entered the pew first and sat in the far end patty had looked at her admiringly and with a certain feeling of proprietorship for several sundays there was obviously no such desirable motherinlaw in the meetinghouse her changeable silk dress was the latest mode her shawl of black llama lace expressed wealth in every delicate mesh and her bonnet had a distinction that could only have emanated from portland or boston ellen wilson usually came in next with as much of a smile to patty in passing as she dared venture in the deacons presence and after her sidled in her younger sister selina commonly called silly and with considerable reason mark had come home patty dared not look up but she felt his approach behind the others although her eyes sought the floor and her cheeks hung out signals of abashed but certain welcome she heard the family settle in their seats somewhat hastily the click of the pew door and the sound of lawyer wilsons cane as he stood it in the corner then the parson rose to pray and patty closed her eyes with the rest of the congregation opening them when elder boone rose to announce the hymn they fell amazed resentful uncomprehending on the spectacle of mark wilson finding the place in the book for a strange young woman who sat beside him mark himself had on a new suit and wore a seal ring that patty had never observed before while the dress pelisse and hat of the unknown were of a nature that no girl in pattys position and particularly of pattys disposition could have regarded without a desire to tear them from her person and stamp them underfoot or better still flaunt them herself and show the world how they should be worn mark found the place in the hymnbook for the creature shared it with her and once when the grant twins wriggled and patty secured a better view once mark shifted his hand on the page so that his thumb touched that of his pretty neighbor who did not remove hers as if she found the proximity either unpleasant or improper patty compared her own miserable attire with that of the hated rival in front and also contrasted lawyer wilsons appearance with that of her father the former well dressed in the style of a gentleman of the time in broadcloth with fine linen and a tall silk hat carefully placed on the floor of the pew while deacon baxter wore homespun made of wool from his own sheep spun and woven dyed and finished at the fullingmill in the village and carried a battered felt hat that had been a matter of ridicule these dozen years the deacon would be buried in two coats jed morrill always said for he owned just that number and would be too mean to leave either of em behind him the sermon was fifty minutes long time enough for a deal of thinking many a housewife not wholly orthodox cut and made over all her childrens clothes in imagination planned the putting up of her fruit the making of her preserves and pickles and arranged her meals for the next week during the progress of those sermons patty watched the parson turn leaf after leaf until the final one was reached then came the last hymn when the people stretched their aching limbs and rising turned their backs on the minister and faced the choir patty looked at waitstill and wished that she could put her throbbing head on her sisterly shoulder and cry mostly with rage the benediction was said and with the final amen the pews were opened and the worshippers crowded into the narrow aisles and moved towards the doors pattys plans were all made she was out of her pew before the wilsons could possibly leave theirs and in her progress down the aisle securely annexed her great admirer old dr perry as well as his son philip passing the singingseats she picked up the humble cephas and carried him along in her wake chatting and talking with her little party while her father was at the horsesheds making ready to go home between services as was his habit a cold bite being always set out on the kitchen table according to his orders by means of these clever manoeuvres patty made herself the focus of attention when the wilson party came out on the steps and vouchsafed mark only a nonchalant nod airily flinging a little greeting with the nod just a how dye do mark did you have a good time in boston patty and waitsill with some of the girls who had come long distances ate their luncheon in a shady place under the trees behind the meetinghouse for there was an afternoon service to come a service with another long sermon they separated after the modest meal to walk about the common or stray along the road to the academy where there was a fine view two or three times during the summer the sisters always went quietly and alone to the baxter buryinglot where three grassgrown graves lay beside one another unmarked save by narrow wooden slabs so short that the initials painted on them were almost hidden by the tufts of clover the girls had brought roots of pansies and sweet alyssum and with a knife made holes in the earth and planted them here and there to make the spot a trifle less forbidding they did not speak to each other during this sacred little ceremony their hearts were too full when they remembered afresh the absence of headstones the lack of care in the place where the three women lay who had ministered to their father borne him children and patiently endured his arbitrary and loveless rule even cleve flanders grave the edgewood shoemaker who lay next even his restingplace was marked and with a touch of some ones imagination marked by the old mans own lapstone twentyfive pounds in weight a monument of his workaday life waitstill rose from her feet brushing the earth from her hands and patty did the same the churchyard was quiet and they were alone with the dead mourned and unmourned loved and unloved i planted one or two pansies on the first ones grave said waitstill soberly i dont know why weve never done it before there are no children to take notice of and remember her its the least we can do and after all she belongs to the family there is no family and there never was suddenly cried patty oh waity waity we are so alone you and i weve only each other in all the world and im not the least bit of help to you as you are to me im a silly vain conceited illbehaved thing but i will be better i will you wont ever give me up will you waity even if im not like you i havent been good lately hush patty hush and waitstill came nearer to her sister with a motherly touch of her hand ill not have you say such things you that are the helpfullest and the lovingest girl that ever was and the cleverest too and the liveliest and the best companykeeper no one thinks so but you patty responded dolefully although she wiped her eyes as if a bit consoled it is safe to say that patty would never have given mark wilson a second thought had he not taken her to drive on that afternoon in early may the drive too would have quickly fled from her somewhat fickle memory had it not been for the kiss the kiss was indeed a decisive factor in the situation and had shed a rosy if somewhat fictitious light of romance over the past three weeks perhaps even the kiss had it never been repeated might have lapsed into its true perspective in due course of time had it not been for the sudden appearance of the stranger in the wilson pew the moment that pattys gaze fell upon that fashionably dressed instantaneously disliked girl marquis wilsons stock rose twenty points in the market she ceased in a jiffy to weigh and consider and criticize the young man but regarded him with wholly new eyes his figure was better than she had realized his smile more interesting his manners more attractive his eyelashes longer in a word he had suddenly grown desirable a month ago she could have observed with idle and alien curiosity the spectacle of his thumb drawing nearer to another feminine thumb on the page of the watts and select hymn book now at the morning service she had wished nothing so much as to put marks thumb back into his pocket where it belonged and slap the girls thumb smartly and soundly as it deserved the ignorant cause of pattys distress was a certain annabel franklin the daughter of a cousin of mrs wilsons mark had stayed at the franklin house during his three weeks visit in boston where he had gone on business for his father the young people had naturally seen much of each other and marks inflammable fancy had been so kindled by annabels dolllike charms that he had persuaded her to accompany him to his home and get a taste of country life in maine such is man such is human nature and such is life that mark had no sooner got the whilom object of his affections under his own roof than she began to pall annabel was twentythree and to tell the truth she had palled before more than once she was so amiable so wellfinished with her smooth flaxen hair her neat nose her buttonhole of a mouth and her trim shape that she appealed to the opposite sex quite generally and irresistibly as a worthy helpmate the only trouble was that she began to bore her suitors somewhat too early in the game and they never got far enough to propose marriage flaws in her apparent perfection appeared from day to day and chilled the growth of the various young loves that had budded so auspiciously she always agreed with everybody and everything in sight even to the point of changing her mind on the instant if circumstances seemed to make it advisable her instinctive point of view when she went so far as to hold one was somewhat cut and dried in a word priggish she kept a young man strictly on his good behavior that much could be said in her favor the only criticism that could be made on this estimable trait was that no bold youth was ever tempted to overstep the bounds of discretion when in her presence no unruly words of love ever rose to his lips his hand never stole out involuntarily and imprudently to meet her small chilly one the sight of her waist never even suggested an encircling arm and as a fellow never desired to kiss her she was never obliged to warn or rebuke or strike him off her visiting list her father had an ample fortune and some one would inevitably turn up who would regard annabel as an altogether worthy and desirable spouse that was what she had seemed to mark wilson for a full week before he left the franklin house in boston but there were moments now when he regretted fugitively that he had ever removed her from her proper sphere she did not seem to fit in to the conditions of life in edgewood and it may even be that her most glaring fault had been to describe patty baxters hair at this very sunday dinner as carroty her dress altogether dreadful and her style of beauty unladylike ellen wilsons feelings were somewhat injured by these criticisms of her intimate friend and in discussing the matter privately with her brother he was inclined to agree with her and thus so little do we know of the prankishness of the blind god thus was annabel franklin working for her rivals best interests and instead of reviling her in secret and treating her with disdain in public patty should have welcomed her cordially to all the delights of riverboro society xiii hayingtime everybody in riverboro edgewood millikens mills spruce swamp duck pond and moderation was haying there was a perfect frenzy of haying for it was the monday after the fourth the precise date in july when the maine farmer said goodbye to repose and hayed desperately and unceasingly until every spear of green in his section was mowed down and safely under cover if a man had grass of his own he cut it and if he had none he assisted in cutting that of some other man for to hay although an unconventional verb was and still is a very active one and in common circulation although not used by the grammarians whatever your trade and whatever your profession it counted as naught in good weather the fishman stopped selling fish the meatman ceased to bring meat the cobbler as well as the judge forsook the bench and even the doctor made fewer visits than usual the wage for work in the hayfields was a high one and every man boy and horse in a village was pressed into service when ivory boynton had finished with his own small crop he commonly went at once to lawyer wilson who had the largest acreage of hayland in the township ivory was always in great demand for he was a mighty worker in the field and a very giant at pitching being able to pick up a fairsized haycock at one stroke of the fork and fling it on to the cart as if it were a feather lawyer wilson always took a hand himself if signs of rain appeared and mark occasionally visited the scene of action when a crowd in the field made a general jollification or when there was an impending thunderstorm in such cases even women and girls joined the workers and all hands bent together to the task of getting a load into the barn and covering the rest deacon baxter was wont to call mark wilson a worthless wheyfaced lilyhanded whelp but the description though picturesque was decidedly exaggerated mark disliked manual labor but having imbibed enough knowledge of law in his fathers office to be an excellent clerk he much preferred travelling about settling the details of small cases collecting rents and bad bills to any form of work on a farm this sort of life on stagecoaches and railway trains or on long driving trips with his own fast trotter suited his adventurous disposition and gave him a sense of importance that was very necessary to his peace of mind he was not especially intimate with ivory boynton who studied law with his father during all vacations and in every available hour of leisure during term time as did many another young new england schoolmaster marks fathers praise of ivorys legal ability was a little too warm to please his son as was the commendation of one of the county court judges on ivorys preparation of a brief in a certain case in the wilson office ivory had drawn it up at mr wilsons request merely to show how far he understood the books and cases he was studying and he had no idea that it differed in any way from the work of any other student all the same marks own efforts in a like direction had never received any special mention when he was in the hayfield he also kept as far as possible from ivory because there too he felt a superiority that made him for the moment a trifle discontented it was no particular pleasure for him to see ivory plunge his fork deep into the heart of a haycock take a firm grasp of the handle thrust forward his foot to steady himself and then raise the great fragrant heap slowly and swing it up to the waiting haycart amid the applause of the crowd rodman would be there too helping the man on top of the load and getting nearly buried each time as the mass descended upon him but doing his slender best to distribute and tread it down properly while his young heart glowed with pride at cousin ivorys prowess independence day had passed with its usual gayeties for the young people in none of which the baxter family had joined and now at eleven oclock on this burning july morning waitstill was driving the old mare past the wilson farm on her way to the river field her father was working there together with the two hired men whom he took on for a fortnight during the height of the season if mowing raking pitching and carting of the precious crop could only have been done at odd times during the year or at night he would not have embittered the month of july by paying out money for labor but nature was inexorable in the ripening of hay and old foxy was obliged to succumb to the inevitable waitstill had a basket packed with luncheon for three and a great demijohn of cool ginger tea under the wagon seat other farmers sometimes served hard cider or rum but her fathers principles were dead against this riotous extravagance temperance in any and all directions was cheap and the deacon was a very temperate man save in language the fields on both sides of the road were full of haymakers and everywhere there was bustle and stir there would be three or four men one leading the others following slowly swinging their way through a noble piece of grass and the smell of the mown fields in the sunshine was sweeter than honey in the comb there were patches of blackeyed susans in the meadows here and there while pink and white hardhack grew by the road with day lilies and blossoming milkweed the bobolinks were fluting from every tree there were thrushes in the alder bushes and orioles in the tops of the elms and waitstills heart overflowed with joy at being in such a world of midsummer beauty though life during the great heat and incessant work of hayingtime was a little more rigorous than usual the extra food needed for the hired men always kept her father in a state of mind closely resembling insanity coming downstairs to cook breakfast she would find the coffee or tea measured out for the pot the increased consumption of milk angered him beyond words because it lessened the supply of butter for sale everything that could be made with buttermilk was ordered so to be done and nothing but water could be used in mixing the raised bread the corncake must never have an egg the piecrust must be shortened only with lard or with a mixture of beeffat and dripping and so on and so on eternally when the girls were respectively seventeen and thirteen waitstill had begged a small plot of ground for them to use as they liked and beginning at that time they had gradually made a little garden with a couple of fruit trees and a thicket of red white and black currants raspberry and blackberry bushes for several summers now they had sold enough of their own fruit to buy a pair of shoes or gloves a scarf or a hat but even this tiny income was beginning to be menaced the deacon positively suffered as he looked at that odd corner of earth not any bigger than his barn floor and saw what his girls had done with no tools but a spade and a hoe and no help but their own hands he had no leisure so he growled to cultivate and fertilize ground for small fruits and no money to pay a man to do it yet here was food grown under his very eye and it did not belong to him the girls worked in their garden chiefly at sunrise in spring and early summer or after supper in the evening all the same waitstill had been told by her father the day before that she was not only using ground but time that belonged to him and that he should expect her to provide piefilling out of her garden patch during haying to help satisfy the ravenous appetites of that couple of great gorming greedy lubbers that he was hiring this year he had stopped the peeling of potatoes before boiling because he disapproved of the thickness of the parings he found in the pigs pail and he stood over patty at her work in the kitchen until waitstill was in daily fear of a tempest of some sort coming in from the shed one morning she met her father just issuing from the kitchen where patty was standing like a young fury in front of the sink fathers been spying at the eggshells i settled the coffee with and said id no business to leave so much good in the shell when i broke an egg i will not bear it he makes me feel fairly murderous youd better not leave me alone with him when im like this oh i know that im wicked but isnt he wicked too and who was wicked first pattys heart had been set on earning and saving enough pennies for a white muslin dress and every day rendered the prospect more uncertain this was a sufficient grievance in itself to keep her temper at the boiling point had there not been various other contributory causes waitstills patience was flagging a trifle too under the stress of the hot days and the still hotter breathless nights the suspicion crossed her mind now and then that her fathers miserliness and fits of temper might be caused by a mental malady over which he now had little or no control having never mastered himself in all his life her power of endurance would be greater she thought if only she could be certain that this theory was true though her slavery would be just as galling it would be so easy for her to go away and earn a living she who had never had a day of illness in her life she who could sew knit spin weave and cook she could make enough money in biddeford or portsmouth to support herself and patty too until the proper work was found for both but there would be a truly terrible conflict of wills and such fierce arraignment of her unfilial conduct such bitter and caustic argument from her father such disapproval from the parson and the neighbors that her very soul shrank from the prospect if she could go alone and have no responsibility over pattys future that would be a little more possible but she must think wisely for two and how could she leave ivory when there might perhaps come a crisis in his life where she could be useful to him how could she cut herself off from those sundays in the choir those dear fugitive glimpses of him in the road or at prayermeeting they were only sips of happiness where her thirsty heart yearned for long deep draughts but they were immeasurably better than nothing freedom from her fathers heavy yoke freedom to work and read and sing and study and grow oh how she longed for this but at what a cost would she gain it if she had to harbor the guilty conscience of an undutiful and rebellious daughter and at the same time cut herself off from the sight of the one being she loved best in all the world she felt drawn towards ivorys mother today three weeks had passed since her talk with ivory in the churchyard but there had been no possibility of an hours escape from home she was at liberty this afternoon relatively at liberty for although her work as usual was laid out for her it could be made up somehow or other before nightfall she could drive over to the boyntons place hitch her horse in the woods near the house make her visit yet be in plenty of time to go up to the river field and bring her father home to supper patty was over at mrs abel days learning a new crochet stitch and helping her to start a logcabin quilt ivory and rodman she new were both away in the wilson hayfield no time would ever be more favorable so instead of driving up townhouse hill when she returned to the village she kept on over the bridge xiv uncle bart discourses uncle bart and cephas were taking their nooning hour under the nodhead apple tree as waitstill passed the joiners shop and went over the bridge uncle bart might somehow guess where i am going she thought but even if he did he would never tell any one wheres waitstill bound this afternoon i wonder drawled cephas rising to his feet and looking after the departing team that reminds me id better run up to baxters and see if anythings wanted before i open the store if it makes any difrence said his father dryly as he filled his pipe pattys over to mis days spendin the afternoon dont spose you want to call on the pig do you hes the only one to home cephas made no remark but gave his trousers a hitch picked up a chip opened his jackknife and sitting down on the greensward began idly whittling the bit of wood into shape i kind o wish youd let me make the new ell twostory father t wouldnt be much work take it in slack time after hayin land o liberty what do you want to do that for cephas you bout pestered the life out o me gittin me to build the ell in the first place when we didnt need it no moren a toad does a pocketbook then nothin would do but you must paint it though i shant be able to have the main house painted for another year so the old wine an the new bottle side by side looks like the old driver an makes us a laughinstock to the village and now you want to change the thing into a twostory never heerd such a crazy idee in my life i want to settle down insisted cephas doggedly well settle im willin i told you that afore you painted the ell aint two rooms fourteen by fourteen enough for you to settle down in if they aint i

out in the ell aready i bet yer shell never move out if i should want to move in on a sudden i told you you was takin that risk when you cut a door through from the main part said his father genially

whole durin time i only cut the door through to please sot shed favor my gittin married but i guess t wont do no good you see father what i was thinkin of is a girl would mebbe jump at a twostory

good savins and go to buildin a bigger place for her ive asked her once aready cephas allowed with a burning face i dont spose you know the one i mean no kind of an idee responded his father with a quizzical wink that was lost on the young man as his eyes were fixed upon his whittling does she belong to the village i aint goin to let folks know who ive picked out till i git a little mite forrarder responded cephas craftily say father its all right to ask a girl twice aint it certain it is my son i never heerd there was any special limit to the number o times you could ask em and their power o sayin no is like the mercy of the lord it endureth forever you wouldnt consider a widder cephas a widderd be a good compnykeeper for your mother i haint put my good savins into an ell jest to marry a compnykeeper for mother responded cephas huffily i want to be number one with my girl and start right in on trainin her up to suit me well if trainin s your object youd better take my advice an keep it dark before marriage cephas its astonishin how the female sect despises bein trained it dont hardly seem to be in their nature to make any changes in emselves after they once gits started how are you goin to live with em then cephas inquired looking up with interest coupled with some incredulity let them do the training responded his father peacefully puffing out the words with his pipe between his lips some of ems mild and gentle in discipline like parson boones wife or mis timothy grant and others is strict and firm like your mother and mis abel day if you happen to git the first kind why do as they tell you and thank the lord t aint any worse if you git the second kind jest let em put the blinders on you and trot as straight as you know how without shying nor kickin over the traces nor bolting cause theyve got control o the bit and t aint no use fightin agin their superior strength so fur as you can judge in the early stages o the game my son which aint very fur which kind have you picked out cephas whittled on for some moments without a word but finally with a sigh drawn from the very toes of his boots he responded gloomily shes awful spunky the girl is anybody can see that but shes a young thing and i thought bein married would kind o tame her down you can see how much marriage has tamed your mother down observed uncle bart dispassionately howsomever though your mother cant be called tame shes got her good pints for shes always to be counted on the great thing in life as i take it cephas is to know exactly what to expect your mothers genally credited with an onsartin temper but folks does her great injustice in so thinking for in a long experience ive seldom come across a temper less onsartin than your mothers you know exactly where to find her every mornin at sunup and every night at sundown there aint nothin you can do to put her out o temper cause shes all out aforehand you can jest go about your reglar business thout any fear of disturbin her any further than shes disturbed aready which is considrable i dont mind it a mite nowadays though after forty years of it it would kind o gall me to keep a stiddy watch of a females disposition day by day wonderin when she was goin to have a tantrum a tantrum once a years an awful upsettin kind of a thing in a family my son but a tantrum every twentyfour hours is jest part o the days work there was a moments silence during which uncle bart puffed his pipe and cephas whittled after which the old man continued then if you happen to marry a temper like your mothers cephas look what a powful worker you genally get look at the way they sweep an dust an scrub an clean watch em when they go at the dishwashin an how they whack the rollinpin an maul the eggs an heave the wood int the stove an slat the flies out o the house the mild and gentle ones enough will be settin in the kitchen rocker readin the almanac when there aint no wood in the kitchen box no doughnuts in the crock no pies on the swing shelf in the cellar an the young ones goin round without a second shift to their backs cephass mind was far away during this philosophical dissertation on the ways of women he could see only a sunny head fairly rioting with curls a pair of eyes that held his like magnets although they never gave him a glance of love a smile that lighted the world far better than the sun a dimple into which his heart fell headlong whenever he looked at it youre right father taint no use kickin agin em he said as he rose to his feet preparatory to opening the baxter store when i said that bout trainin up a girl to suit me i kind o forgot the one ive picked out im considerin several but the one i favor mostwell i believe shed fire up at the first sight o training and thats the gospel truth considerin several be you cephas laughed uncle bart well all i hope is that the one you favor most the girl youve asked once aready is considerin you cephas went to the pump and wetting a large handkerchief put it in the crown of his straw hat and sauntered out into the burning heat of the open road between his fathers shop and deacon baxters store i shant ask her the next time till this hot spells over he thought and i wont do it in that dodgasted old store agin neither i aint so tonguetied outdoors an i kind o think id be more in the sperit of it after sundown some night after supper xv ivorys mother waitstill found a cool and shady place in which to hitch the old mare loosening her checkrein and putting a sprig of alder in her headstall to assist her in brushing off the flies one could reach the boynton house only by going up a long grassgrown lane that led from the highroad it was a lonely place and aaron boynton had bought it when he moved from saco simply because he secured it at a remarkable bargain the owner having lost his wife and gone to live in massachusetts ivory would have sold it long ago had circumstances been different for it was at too great a distance from the schoolhouse and from lawyer wilsons office to be at all convenient but he dreaded to remove his mother from the environment to which she was accustomed and doubted very much whether she would be able to care for a house to which she had not been wonted before her mind became affected here in this safe secluded corner amid familiar and thoroughly known conditions she moved placidly about her daily tasks performing them with the same care and precision that she had used from the beginning of her married life all the heavy work was done for her by ivory and rodman the boy in particular being the fleetestfooted the most willing and the neatest of helpers washing dishes sweeping and dusting laying the table as deftly and quietly as a girl mrs boynton made her own simple dresses of gray calico in summer or dark linseywoolsey in winter by the same pattern that she had used when she first came to edgewood in fact there were positively no external changes anywhere to be seen tragic and terrible as had been those that had wrought havoc in her mind waitstills heart beat faster as she neared the boynton house she had never so much as seen ivorys mother for years how would she be met who would begin the conversation and what direction would it take what if mrs boynton should refuse to talk to her at all she walked slowly along the lane until she saw a slender grayclad figure stooping over a flowerbed in front of the cottage the woman raised her head with a fawnlike gesture that had something in it of timidity rather than fear picked some loose bits of green from the ground and quietly turning her back upon the on coming stranger disappeared through the open front door there could be no retreat on her own part now thought waitstill she wished for a moment that she had made this first visit under ivorys protection but her idea had been to gain mrs boyntons confidence and have a quiet friendly talk such a one as would be impossible in the presence of a third person approaching the steps she called through the doorway in her clear voice ivory asked me to come and see you one day mrs boynton i am waitstill baxter the little girl on town house hill that you used to know mrs boynton came from an inner room and stood on the threshold the name waitstill had always had a charm for her ears from the time she first heard it years ago until it fell from ivorys lips this summer and again it caught her fancy waitstill she repeated softly waitstill does ivory know you weve known each other for ever so long ever since we went to the brick school together when we were girl and boy and when i was a child my stepmother brought me over here once on an errand and ivory showed me a hummingbirds nest in that lilac bush by the door mrs boynton smiled come and look she whispered there is always a hummingbirds nest in our lilac how did you remember the two women approached the bush and mrs boynton carefully parted the leaves to show the dainty morsel of a home thatched with soft graygreen and lined with down the birds have flown now she said they were like little jewels when they darted off in the sunshine her voice was faint and sweet as if it came from far away and her eyes looked not as if they were seeing you but seeing something through you her pale hair was turned back from her paler face where the veins showed like blue rivers and her smile was like the flitting of a moonbeam she was standing very close to waitstill closer than she had been to any woman for many years and she studied her a little wistfully yet courteously as if her attention was attracted by something fresh and winning she looked at the color ebbing and flowing in the girls cheeks at her brows and lashes at her neck as white as swansdown and finally put out her hand with a sudden impulse and touched the knot of wavy bronze hair under the brimmed hat i had a daughter once she said my second baby was a girl but she lived only a few weeks i need her very much for i am a great care to ivory he is son and daughter both now that mr boynton is away from home you did not see any one in the road as you turned in from the bars i suppose no answered waitstill surprised and confused but i didnt really notice i was thinking of a cool place for my horse to stand i sit out here in these warm afternoons mrs boynton continued shading her eyes and looking across the fields because i can see so far down the lane i have the suppertable set for my husband already and there is a surprise for him a saucer of wild strawberries i picked for him this morning if he does not come i always take away the plate and cup before ivory gets here it seems to make him unhappy he doesnt like it when you are disappointed i suppose waitstill ventured i have brought my knitting mrs boynton so that i neednt keep you idle if you wish to work may i sit down a few minutes and here is a cottage cheese for ivory and rodman and a jar of plums for you preserved from my own garden mrs boyntons eyes searched the face of this visitor from a world she had almost forgotten and finding nothing but tenderness there said with just a trace of bewilderment thank you yes do sit down my workbasket is just inside the door take that rockingchair i dont have another one out here because i have never been in the habit of seeing visitors i hope i am not intruding stammered waitstill seating herself and beginning her knitting to see if it would lessen the sense of strain between them not at all i always loved young and beautiful people and so did my husband if he comes while you are here do not go away but sit with him while i get his supper if elder cochrane should be with him you would see two wonderful men they went away together to do some missionary work in maine and new hampshire and perhaps they will come back together i do not welcome callers because they always ask so many difficult questions but you are different and have asked me none at all i should not think of asking questions mrs boynton not that i should mind answering them continued ivorys mother except that it tires my head very much to think you must not imagine i am ill it is only that i have a very bad memory and when people ask me to remember something or to give an answer quickly it confuses me the more even now i have forgotten why you came and where you live but i have not forgotten your beautiful name ivory thought you might be lonely and i wanted so much to know you that i could not keep away any longer for i am lonely and unhappy too i am always watching and hoping for what has never come yet i have no mother you have lost your daughter i thought i thought perhaps we could be a comfort to each other and waitstill rose from her chair and put out her hand to help mrs boynton down the steps she looked so frail so transparent so prematurely aged i could not come very often but if i could only smooth your hair sometimes when your head aches or do some cooking for you or read to you or any little thing like that as i would fer my own mother if i could i should be so glad waitstill stood a head higher than ivorys mother and the glowing health of her the steadiness of her voice the warmth of her handclasp must have made her seem like a strong refuge to this stormtossed derelict the deep furrow between lois boyntons eyes relaxed a trifle the blood in her veins ran a little more swiftly under the touch of the young hand that held hers so closely suddenly a light came into her face and her lip quivered perhaps i have been remembering wrong all these years she said it is my great trouble remembering wrong perhaps my baby did not die as i thought perhaps she lived and grew up perhaps her pale cheek burned and her eyes shone like stars perhaps she has come back waitstill could not speak she put her arm round the trembling figure holding her as she was wont to hold patty and with the same protective instinct the embrace was electric in its effect and set altogether new currents of emotion in circulation something in lois boyntons perturbed mind seemed to beat its wings against the barriers that had heretofore opposed it and freeing itself mounted into clearer air and went singing to the sky she rested her cheek on the girls breast with a little sob oh let me go on remembering wrong she sighed from that safe shelter let me go on remembering wrong it makes me so happy waitstill gently led her to the rockingchair and sat down beside her on the lowest step stroking her thin hand mrs boyntons eyes were closed her breath came and went quickly but presently she began to speak hurriedly as if she were relieving a surcharged heart there is something troubling me she began and it would ease my mind if i could tell it to some one who could help your hand is so warm and so firm oh hold mine closely and let me draw in strength as long as you can spare it it is flowing flowing from your hand into mine flowing like wine my thoughts at night are not like my thoughts by day these last weeks i wake suddenly and feel that my husband has been away a long time and will never come back often at night too i am in sore trouble about something else something i have never told ivory the first thing i have ever hidden from my dear son but i think i could tell you if only i could be sure about it tell me if it will help you i will try to understand said waitstill brokenly ivory says rodman is the child of my dead sister some one must have told him so could it have been i it haunts me day and night for unless i am remembering wrong again i never had a sister i can call to mind neither sister nor brother you went to new hampshire one winter waitstill reminded her gently as if she were talking to a child it was bitter cold for you to take such a hard journey your sister died and you brought her little boy rodman back but you were so ill that a stranger had to take care of you on the stagecoach and drive you to edgewood next day in his own sleigh it is no wonder you have forgotten something of what happened for dr perry hardly brought you through the brain fever that followed that journey i seem to think now that it is not so said mrs boynton opening her eyes and looking at waitstill despairingly i must grope and grope in the dark until i find out what is true and then tell ivory god will punish false speaking his heart is closed against lies and evildoing he will never punish you if your tired mind remembers wrong said waitstill he knows none better how you have tried to find him and hold him through many a tangled path i will come as often as i can and we will try to frighten away these worrying thoughts if you will only come now and then and hold my hand said ivorys mother hold my hand so that your strength will flow into my weakness perhaps i shall puzzle it all out and god will help me to remember right before i die everything that i have power to give away shall be given to you promised waitstill now that i know you and you trust me you shall never be left so alone again not for long at any rate when i stay away you will remember that i cannot help it wont you yes i shall think of you till i see you again i shall watch the long lane more than ever now ivory sometimes takes the path across the fields but my dear husband will come by the old road and now there will be you to look for xvi locked out at the baxters the late supper was over and the girls had not sat at the table with their father having eaten earlier by themselves the hired men had gone home to sleep patty had retired to the solitude of her bedroom almost at dusk quite worn out with the heat and waitstill sat under the peach tree in the corner of her own little garden tatting and thinking of her interview with ivorys mother she sat there until nearly eight oclock trying vainly to put together the puzzling details of lois boyntons conversation wondering whether the perplexities that vexed her mind were real or fancied but warmed to the heart by the affection that the older woman seemed instinctively to feel for her she did not know me yet she cared for me at once thought waitstill tenderly and proudly and i for her too at the first glance she heard her father lock the barn and shed and knew that he would be going upstairs immediately so she quickly went through the side yard and lifted the latch of the kitchen door it was fastened she went to the front door and that too was bolted although it had been standing open all the evening so that if a breeze should spring up it might blow through the house her father supposed of course that she was in bed and she dreaded to bring him downstairs for fear of his anger still there was no help for it and she rapped smartly at the side door there was no answer and she rapped again vexed with her own carelessness pattys face appeared promptly behind her screen of mosquito netting in the second story but before she could exchange a word with her sister deacon baxter opened the blinds of his bedroom window and put his head out you can try sleepin outdoors or in the barn tonight he called i didnt say anything to you at suppertime because i wanted to see where you was intendin to prowl this evenin i havent been prowling anywhere father answered waitstill ive been out in the garden cooling off its only eight oclock well you can cool off some more he shouted his temper now fully aroused or go back where you was this afternoon and see if theyll take you in there i know all about your deceitful tricks i come home to grind the scythes and found the house and barn empty cephas said youd driven up saco hill and i took his horse and followed you and saw where you went longs you couldnt have a feller callin on you here to home you thought youd call on him did yer you boldfaced hussy i am nothing of the sort the girl answered him quietly ivory boynton was not at his house he was in the hayfield you know it and you know that i knew it i went to see a sick unhappy woman who has no neighbors i ought to have gone long before i am not ashamed of it and i dont regret it if you ask unreasonable things of me you must expect to be disobeyed once in a while must expect to be disobeyed must i the old man cried his face positively terrifying in its ugliness well see about that if you want callin on a young man you were callin on a crazy woman and i wont have it i tell you do you hear i wont have a daughter o mine consortin with any o that boynton crew perhaps a night outdoors will teach you whos master in this house you imperdent shameless girl we try it anyway and with that he banged down the window and disappeared gibbering and jabbering impotent words that she could hear but not understand waitstill was almost stunned by the suddenness of this catastrophe she stood with her feet rooted to the earth for several minutes and then walked slowly away out of sight of the house there was a chair beside the grindstone under the porter apple tree and she sank into it crossed her arms on the back and bowing her head on them burst into a fit of weeping as tempestuous and passionate as it was silent for although her body fairly shook with sobs no sound escaped the minutes passed perhaps an hour she did not take account of time the moon went behind clouds the night grew misty and the stars faded one by one there would be rain tomorrow and there was a great deal of hay cut so she thought in a vagrant sort of way meanwhile patty upstairs was in a state of suppressed excitement and terror it was a quarter of an hour before her father settled himself in bed then an age it seemed to her before she heard his heavy breathing when she thought it quite safe she slipped on a print wrapper took her shoes in her hand and crept noiselessly downstairs out through the kitchen and into the shed lifting the heavy bar that held the big doors in place she closed them softly behind her stepped out and looked about her in the darkness her quick eye espied in the distance near the barn the bowed figure in the chair and she flew through the wet grass without a thought of her bare feet till she reached her sisters side and held her in a close embrace my darling my own own poor darling she cried softly the tears running down her cheeks how wicked how unjust to serve my dearest sister so dont cry my blessing dont cry you frighten me i take care of you dear next time ill interfere ill scratch and bite yes ill strangle anybody that dares to shame you and lock you out of the house you the dearest the patientest the best waitstill wiped her eyes let us go farther away where we can talk she whispered where had we better sleep patty asked on the hay i think though we shall stifle with the heat and patty moved towards the barn no you must go back to the house at once patty dear father might wake and call you and that would make matters worse its beginning to drizzle or i should stay out in the air oh i wonder if fathers mind is going and if this is the beginning of the end if he is in his sober senses he could not be so strange so suspicious so unjust he could be anything say anything do anything exclaimed patty perhaps he is not responsible and perhaps he is it doesnt make much difference to us come along blessed darling ill tuck you in and then ill creep back to the house if you say i must ill go down and make the kitchen fire in the morning you stay out here and see what happens a good deal will happen im thinking if father speaks to me of you i shouldnt be surprised to see the fur flying in all directions ill seize the first moment to bring you out a cup of coffee and well consult about what to do i may tell you now im all for running away waitstills first burst of wretchedness had subsided and she had recovered her balance im afraid we must wait a little longer patty she advised dont mention my name to father but see how he acts in the morning he was so wild so unlike himself that i almost hope he may forget what he said and sleep it off yes we must just wait no doubt hell be far calmer in the morning if he remembers that if he turns you out he faces the prospect of three meals a day cooked by me said patty thats what he thinks he would face but as a matter of fact i shall tell him that where you sleep i sleep and where you eat i eat and when you stop cooking i stop he wont part with two unpaid servants in a hurry not at the beginning of haying and patty giving waitstill a last hug and a dozen tearful kisses stole reluctantly back to the house by the same route through which he had left it patty was right she found the fire lighted when she went down into the kitchen next morning and without a word she hurried breakfast on to the table as fast as she could cook and serve it waitstill was safe in the barn chamber she knew and would be there quietly while her father was feeding the horse and milking the cows or perhaps she might go up in the woods and wait until she saw him driving away the deacon ate his breakfast in silence looking and acting very much as usual for he was generally dumb at meals when he left the house however and climbed into the wagon he turned around and said in his ordinary gruff manner bring the lunch up to the field yourself today patience tell your sister i hope shes come to her senses in the course of the night youve got to learn both of you that my sayso must be law in this house you can fuss and you can fume if it amuses you any but t wont do no good dont encourage waitstill in any whinin nor blubberin jest tell her to come in and go to work and i overlook what she done this time and dont you give me any more of your eyesnappin and lippoutin and headintheair imperdence youre under age and if you dont look out youll get something thats good for what ails you you two girls jest aid an abet one another thats what you do aid an abet one another an if you carry it any further ill find some way o separatin you do you hear patty spoke never a word nor fluttered an eyelash she had a proper spirit but now her heart was cold with a new fear and she felt with waitstill that her father must be obeyed and his temper kept within bounds until god provided them a way of escape she ran out to the barn chamber and not finding waitstill looked across the field and saw her coming through the path from the woods patty waved her hand and ran to meet her sister joy at the mere fact of her existence of being able to see her again and of hearing her dear voice almost choking her in its intensity when they reached the house she helped her upstairs as if she were a child brought her cool water to wash away the dust of the haymow laid out some clean clothes for her and finally put her on the lounge in the darkened sittingroom i wont let anybody come near the house she said and you must have a cup of tea and a good sleep before i tell you all that father said just comfort yourself with the thought that he is going to overlook it this time after i carry up his luncheon i shall stop at the store and ask cephas to come out on the river bank for a few minutes then i shall proceed to say what i think of him for telling father where you went yesterday afternoon dont blame cephas waitstill remonstrated cant you see just how it happened he and uncle bart were sitting in front of the shop when i drove by when father came home and found the house empty and the horse not in the stall of course he asked where i was and cephas probably said he had seen me drive up saco hill he had no reason to think that there was any harm in that if he had any sense he might know that he shouldnt tell anything to father except what happens in the store patty insisted were you frightened out in the barn alone last night poor dear i was too unhappy to think of fear and i was chiefly nervous about you all alone in the house with father i didnt like it very much myself i buttoned my bedroom door and sat by the window all night shivering and bristling at the least sound everybody calls me a coward but im not courage isnt not being frightened its not screeching when you are frightened now what happened at the boyntons patty ivorys mother is the most pathetic creature i ever saw and waitstill sat up on the sofa her long braids of hair hanging over her shoulders her pale face showing the traces of her heavy weeping i never pitied any one so much in my whole life to go up that long long lane to come upon that dreary house hidden away in the trees to feel the loneliness and the silence and then to know that she is living there like a hermitthrush in a forest without a woman to care for her it is heartbreaking how does the house look dreadful no everything is as neat as wax she isnt crazy patty as we understand the word her mind is beclouded somehow and it almost seems as if the cloud might lift at any moment she goes about like somebody in a dream sewing or knitting or cooking it is only when she talks and you notice that her eyes really see nothing but are looking beyond you that you know there is anything wrong if she appears so like other people why dont the neighbors go to see her once in a while callers make her unhappy she says and ivory told me that he dared not encourage any company in the house for fear of exciting her and making her an object of gossip besides he knows her ways perfectly and that she is safe and content with her fancies when she is alone which is seldom after all what does she talk about asked patty her husband mostly she is expecting him to come back daily we knew that before of course but no one can realize it till they see her setting the table for him and putting a saucer of wild strawberries by his plate going about the kitchen softly like a gentle ghost it gives me the shudders said patty i couldnt bear it if she never sees strangers what in the world did she make of you how did you begin i told her i had known ivory ever since we were school children she was rather strange and indifferent at first and then she seemed to take a fancy to me thats queer said patty smiling fondly and giving waitstills hair the hasty brush of a kiss she told me she had had a girl baby born two or three years after ivory and that she had always thought it died when it was a few weeks old then suddenly she came closer to me oh waity werent you terrified no not in the least neither would you have been if you had been there she put her arms round me and all at once i understood that the poor thing mistook me just for a moment for her own daughter come back to life it was a sudden fancy and i dont think it lasted but i didnt know how to deal with it or contradict it so i simply tried to soothe her and let her ease her heart by talking to me she said when i left her where is your house i hope it is near do come again and sit with me strength flows into my weakness when you hold my hand i somehow feel patty that she needs a woman friend even more than a doctor and now what am i to do how can i forsake her and yet here is this new difficulty with father i shouldnt forsake her go there when you can but be more careful about it you told father that you didnt regret what you had done and that when he ordered you to do unreasonable things you should disobey him after all you are not a black slave father will never think of that particular thing again perhaps any more than he ever alluded to my driving to saco with mrs day after you had told him it was necessary for one of us to go there occasionally he knows that if he is too hard on us dr perry or uncle bart would take him in hand they would have done it long ago if we had ever given any one even a hint of what we have to endure you will be all right because you only want to do kind neighborly things i am the one that will always have to suffer because i cant prove that its a christian duty to deceive father and steal off to a dance or a frolic yet i might as well be a nun in a convent for all the fun i get i want a white bookmuslin dress i want a pair of thin shoes with buckles i want a white hat with a wreath of yellow roses i want a volume of byrons poems and oh nobody knows nobody but the lord could understand how i want a string of gold beads patty patty to hear you chatter anybody would imagine you thought of nothing but frivolities i wish you wouldnt do yourself such injustice even when nobody hears you but me it is wrong sometimes when you think im talking nonsense its really the gospel truth said patty im not a grand splendid character waitstill and its no use your deceiving yourself about me if you do youll be disappointed go and parboil the beans and get them into the pot patty pick up some of the windfalls and make a greenapple pie and ill be with you in the kitchen myself before long i never expect to be disappointed in you patty only continually surprised and pleased i thought id begin making some soft soap today said patty mischievously as she left the room we have enough grease saved up we dont really need it yet but it makes such a disgusting smell that id rather like father to have it with his dinner its not much of a punishment for our sleepless night autumn xvii a brace of lovers haying was over and the close sticky dogdays too and august was slipping into september there had been plenty of rain all the season and the countryside was looking as fresh and green as an emerald the hillsides were already clothed with a verdant growth of new grass and the red pennons of the cardinal flowers hung motionless upon their upright staves how they gleamed in the meadow grasses and along the brooksides like brilliant flecks of flame giving a new beauty to the nosegays that waitstill carried or sent to mrs boynton every week to the eye of the casual observer life in the two little villages by the rivers brink went on as peacefully as ever but there were subtle changes taking place nevertheless cephas cole had asked the second time and again had been refused by patty so that even a very idiot for hopefulness could not urge his father to put another story on the ell if it turns out to be phoebe day thought cephas dolefully two rooms is plenty good enough an i shant block up the door that leads from the main part neither as i thought likely i should if so be its got to be phoebe not patty i shant care whether mother troops out n in or not and cephas dealt out rice and tea and coffee with so languid an air and made such frequent mistakes in weighing the sugar that he drew upon himself many a sharp rebuke from the deacon of course id club him over the head with a salt fish twice a day under ordnary circumstances cephas confided to his father with a valiant air that he never wore in deacon baxters presence but ive got a reason known to nobody but myself for wantin to stan well with the old man for a spell longer if ever i quit wantin to stan well with him hell get his comeuppance short an sudden speakin o standin well with folks phil perrys kind o makin up to patience baxter aint he cephas asked uncle bart guardedly mebbe you wouldnt notice it hevin no particlar intrest but your mothers kind o got the idee into her head lately an shes turrible farsighted i guess its so cephas responded gloomily its nip an tuck tween him an mark wilson that girl draws em as molasses does flies she does it thout liftin a finger too no more n the molasses does she just sets still an is an all the time shes nothin but a flighty little redheaded spitfire that dont know a good husband when she sees one the feller that gits her will live to regret it thats my opinion and cephas thought to himself good lord dont i wish i was regrettin it this very minute i spose a girl like phoebe dayd be considable less trouble to live with ventured uncle bart i never could take any fancy to that tow hair o hern i like the color well enough when im peeling it off a corn cob but i dont like it on a girls head objected cephas hypercritically an her eyes haint got enough blue in em to be blue theyre jest like skimmilk an she keeps her mouth open a little mite all the time jest as if there want no good draught through an she was atryin to git air an t was me that begun callin her feeble phoebe in school an the scholarsll never forgit it theyd throw it up to me the whole durin time if i should go to work an keep company with her mebbe theyve forgot by this time uncle bart responded hopefully though t is an awful resk when you think o companion pike samuel he was baptized and samuel he continued to be till he married the widder bixby from waterboro bein as how there want nothin particly attractive bout him though he was as nice a feller as ever lived somebody asked her why she married him an she said her cat hed jest died an she wanted a companion the boys never let go o that story samuel pike he ceased to be thirty year ago an companion pike hes remained up to this instant minute he aint lived up to his name much remarked cephas hes to home for his meals but i guess his wife never sees him between times if the cat hed lived mebbe shed a been better compny on the whole chuckled uncle bart companion was allers kind o dreamy an absentminded from a boy i remember askin him what his wifes christian name was she bein a stranger to riverboro an he said he didnt know said he called her mis bixby afore he married her an mis pike afterwards well there s something turrible queer bout this marryin business and cephas drew a sigh from the heels of his boots it seemss if a man hednt no natcheral drawin towards a girl with a good farm n stock that was willin to have him seems jest as if it set him agin her somehow and yet if youve got to sing out o the same book with a girl your whole lifetime it does seems if youd ought to have a kind of a fancy for her at the start anyhow you may feel difrent as time goes on cephas an come to see feeble i would say phoebe as your mother does the best fire dont flare up the soonest you know but old uncle bart saw that his sons heart was heavy and forbore to press the subject annabel franklin had returned to boston after a months visit and to her surprise had returned as disengaged as she came mark wilson thoroughly bored by her vacuities of mind longed now for more intercourse with patty baxter patty so gay and unexpected so lively to talk with so piquing to the fancy so skittish and difficult to manage so temptingly pretty with a beauty all her own and never two days alike there were many lions in the way and these only added to the zest of pursuit with all the other girls of the village opportunities multiplied but he could scarcely get ten minutes alone with patty the deacons orders were absolute in regard to young men his daughters were never to drive or walk alone with them never go to dances or routs of any sort and never receive them at the house this last mandate being quite unnecessary as no youth in his right mind would have gone acourtin under the deacons forbidding gaze and still there were sudden delicious chances to be seized now and then if one had his eyes open and his wits about him there was the walk to or from the singingschool when a sentimental couple could drop a few feet at least behind the rest and exchange a word or two in comparative privacy there were the church circles and prayermeetings and the intervals between sunday services when mark could detach patty a moment from the group on the meetinghouse steps more valuable than all these a complete schedule of pattys various movements here and there together with a profound study of deacon baxters habits which were ordinarily as punctual as they were disagreeable permitted mark many stolen interviews as sweet as they were brief there was never a second kiss however in these casual meetings and partings the first in springtime had found patty a child surprised unprepared she was a woman now for it does not take years to achieve that miracle months will do it or days or even hours her summers experience with cephas cole had wonderfully broadened her powers giving her an assurance sadly lacking before as well as a knowledge of detail a certain finished skill in the management of a lover which she could ably use on any one who happened to come along and at the moment any one who happened to come along served the purpose admirably philip perry as well as marquis wilson young perrys interest in patty as we have seen began with his alienation from ellen wilson the first object of his affections and it was not at the outset at all of a sentimental nature philip was a pillar of the church and ellen had proved so entirely lacking in the religious sense so selfsatisfied as to her standing with the heavenly powers that philip dared not expose himself longer to her society lest he find himself unequally yoked together with an unbeliever thus defying the scriptural admonition as to marriage patty though somewhat lacking in the qualities that go to the making of trustworthy saints was not like ellen wholly given over to the fleshpots and would prove a valuable convert philip thought one who would reflect great credit upon him if he succeeded in inducing her to subscribe to the stern creed of the day philip was a very strenuous and slightly gloomy believer dwelling considerably on the wrath of god and the doctrine of eternal punishment there was an old pennyroyal hymn much in use which describes the general tenor of his meditation my thoughts on awful subjects roll damnation and the dead what horrors seize the guilty soul upon a dying bed no wonder that jacob cochranes lively songs cheerful hopeful militant and bracing fell with a pleasing sound upon the ear of the believer of that epoch the love of god had indeed entered philips soul but in some mysterious way had been ossified after it got there he had intensely black hair dark skin and a liver that disposed him constitutionally to an ardent belief in the necessity of hell for most of his neighbors and the hope of spending his own glorious immortality in a small properly restricted and prudently managed heaven he was eloquent at prayermeeting and pattys only objection to him there was in his disposition to allude to himself as a rebel worm with frequent references to his vile body otherwise and when not engaged in theological discussion patty liked philip very much his own father although an orthodox member of the fold in good and regular standing had doctored phil conscientiously for his liver from his youth up hoping in time to incite in him a sunnier view of life for the doctor was somewhat skilled in adapting his remedies to spiritual maladies jed morrill had always said that when old mrs buxton the champion convert of jacob cochrane was at her worst keeping her whole family awake nights by her hysterical fears for their future dr perry had given her a twelfth of a grain of tartar emetic five times a day until she had entire mental relief and her anxiety concerning the salvation of her husband and children was set completely at rest the good doctor noted with secret pleasure his sons growing fondness for the society of his prime favorite miss patience baxter hell begin by trying to save her soul he thought phil always begins that way but when patty gets him in hand hell remember the existence of his heart an organ he has never taken into consideration a love affair with a pretty girl good but not too pious will help phil considerable however it turns out there is no doubt but that phil was taking his chances and that under pattys tutelage he was growing mellower as for patty she was only amusing herself and frisking like a young lamb in pastures where she had never strayed before her fancy flew from mark to phil and from phil back to mark again for at the moment she was just a vessel of emotion ready to empty herself on she knew not what temperamentally she would take advantage of currents rather than steer at any time and it would be the strongest current that would finally bear her away her idea had always been that she could play with fire without burning her own fingers and that the flames she kindled were so innocent and mild that no one could be harmed by them she had fancied up to now that she could control urge on or cool down a mans feeling forever and a day if she chose and remain mistress of the situation now after some weeks of weighing and balancing her two swains she found herself confronting a choice once and for all each of them seemed to be approaching the state of mind where he was likely to say somewhat violently take me or leave me one or the other but she did not wish to take them and still less did she wish to leave them with no other lover in sight but cephas cole who was almost though not quite worse than none if matters by lack of masculine patience and selfcontrol did come to a crisis what should she say definitely to either of her suitors her father despised mark wilson a trifle more than any young man on the river and while he could have no objection to phil perrys character or position in the world his hatred of old dr perry amounted to a disease when the doctor had closed the eyes of the third mrs baxter he had made some plain and unwelcome statements that would rankle in the deacons breast as long as he lived patty knew therefore that the chance of her fathers blessing falling upon her union with either of her present lovers was more than uncertain and of what use was an engagement if there could not be a marriage if pattys mind inclined to a somewhat speedy departure from her fathers household she can hardly be blamed but she felt that she could not carry any of her indecisions and fears to her sister for settlement who could look in waitstills clear steadfast eyes and say i cant make up my mind which to marry not patty she felt instinctively that waitstills heart if it moved at all would rush out like a great river to lose itself in the ocean and losing itself forget the narrow banks through which it had flowed before patty knew that her own love was at the moment nothing more than the note of a childs penny flute and that waitstill was perhaps vibrating secretly with a deeper richer music than could ever come to her still music of some sort she meant to feel even if they make me decide one way or another before i am ready she said to herself ill never say yes till im more in love than i am now there were other reasons why she did not want to ask waitstills advice not only did she shrink from the loving scrutiny of her sisters eyes and the gentle probing of her questions which would fix her own motives on a pinpoint and hold them up unbecomingly to the light but she had a foolish generous loyalty that urged her to keep waitstill quite aloof from her own little private perplexities she will only worry herself sick thought patty she wont let me marry without asking fathers permission and shed think she ought not to aid me in deceiving him and the tempest would be twice as dreadful if it fell upon us both now if anything happens i can tell father that i did it all myself and that waitstill knew nothing about it whatever then oh joy if father is too terrible i shall be a married woman and i can always say i will not permit such cruelty waitstill is dependent upon you no longer she shall come at once to my husband and me this latter phrase almost intoxicated patty so that there were moments when she could have run up to millikens mills and purchased herself a husband at any cost had her slender savinges permitted the best in the market and the more impersonal the husband the more delightedly patty rolled the phrase under her tongue i can never be published in church she thought and perhaps nobody will ever care enough about me to brave fathers displeasure and insist on running away with me i do wish somebody would care frightfully about me enough for that enough to help me make up my mind so that i could just drive up to fathers store some day and say good afternoon father i knew youd never let me marry there was always a dash here in pattys imaginary discourses a dash that could be filled in with any christian name according to her mood of the momentso i just married him anyway and you neednt be angry with my sister for she knew nothing about it my husband and i are sorry if you are displeased but theres no help for it and my husbands home will always be open to waitstill whatever happens patty with all her latent love of finery and ease did not weigh the worldly circumstances of the two men though the reflection that she would have more amusement with mark than with philip may have crossed her mind she trusted philip and respected his steadygoing serious view of life it pleased her vanity too to feel how her nonsense and fun lightened his temperamental gravity playing in and out and over it like a butterfly in a smoke bush she would be safe with philip always but safety had no special charm for one of her age who had never been in peril marks superior knowledge of the world moreover his careless buoyant manner of carrying himself his gay boyish audacity all had a very distinct charm for her and yet but there would be no and yet a little later pattys heart would blaze quickly enough when sufficient heat was applied to it and mark was falling more and more deeply in love every day as patty vacillated his purpose strengthened the more she weighed the more he ceased to weigh the difficulties of the situation the more she unfolded herself to him the more he loved and the more he respected her she began by delighting his senses she ended by winning all that there was in him and creating continually the qualities he lacked after the manner of true women even when they are very young and foolish xviii a state o maine prophet summer was dying hard for although it had passed by the calendar mother nature was still keeping up her customary attitude there had been a soft rain in the night and every spear of grass was brilliantly green and tipped with crystal the smoke bushes in the garden plot and the asparagus bed beyond them looked misty as the sun rose higher drying the soaked earth and dripping branches spiders webs marvels of lace dotted the short grass under the apple trees every flower that had a fragrance was pouring it gratefully into the air every bird with a joyous note in its voice gave it more joyously from a bursting throat and the river laughed and rippled in the distance at the foot of town house hill then dawn grew into full morning and streams of blue smoke rose here and there from the edgewood chimneys the world was alive and so beautiful that waitstill felt like going down on her knees in gratitude for having been born into it and given a chance of serving it in any humble way whatsoever wherever there was a barn in riverboro or edgewood one could have heard the threelegged stools being lifted from the pegs and then would begin the music of the milkpails first the resonant sound of the stream on the bottom of the tin pail then the soft delicious purring of the cascade into the full bucket while the cows serenely chewed their cuds and whisked away the flies with swinging tails deacon baxter was taking his cows to a pasture far over the hill the feed having grown too short in his own fields patty was washing dishes in the kitchen and waitstill was in the dairyhouse at the buttermaking one of her chief delights she worked with speed and with beautiful sureness patting squeezing rolling the golden mass like the true artist she was then turning the sweetscented waxen balls out of the mould on to the big stonechina platter that stood waiting she had been up early and for the last hour she had toiled with devouring eagerness that she might have a little time to herself it was hers now for patty would be busy with the beds after she finished the dishes so she drew a folded paper from her pocket the first communication she had ever received in ivorys handwriting and sat down to read it my dear waitstill rodman will take this packet and leave it with you when he finds opportunity it is not in any real sense a letter so i am in no danger of incurring your fathers displeasure you will probably have heard new rumors concerning my father during the past few days for peter morrill has been to enfield new hampshire where he says letters have been received stating that my father died in cortland ohio more than five years ago i shall do what i can to substantiate this fresh report as i have always done with all the previous ones but i have little hope of securing reliable information at this distance and after this length of time i do not know when i can ever start on a personal quest myself for even had i the money i could not leave home until rodman is much older and fitted for greater responsibility oh waitstill how you have helped my poor dear mother would that i were free to tell you how i value your friendship it is something more than mere friendship what you are doing is like throwing a lifeline to a sinking human being two or three times of late mother has forgotten to set out the supper things for my father her ten years incessant waiting for him seems to have subsided a little and in its place she watches for you ivory had written watches for her daughter but carefully erased the last two words you come but seldom but her heart feeds on the sight of you what she needed it seems was the magical touch of youth and health and strength and sympathy the qualities you possess in such great measure if i had proof of my fathers death i think now perhaps that i might try to break it gently to my mother as if it were fresh news and see if possibly i might thus remove her principal hallucination you see now do you not how sane she is in many indeed in most ways how sweet and lovable even how sensible to help you better to understand the influence that has robbed me of both father and mother and made me and mine the subject of town and tavern gossip for years past i have written for you just a sketch of the cochrane craze the romantic story of a man who swayed the wills of his fellowcreatures in a truly marvellous manner some local historian of his time will doubtless give him more space my wish is to have you know something more of the circumstances that have made me a prisoner in life instead of a free man but prisoner as i am at the moment i am sustained just now by a new courage i read in my copy of ovid last night the best of weapons is the undaunted heart this will help you too in your hard life for yours is the most undaunted heart in all the world ivory boynton the chronicle of jacob cochranes career in the little villages near the saco river has no such interest for the general reader as it had for waitstill baxter she hung upon every word that ivory had written and realized more clearly than ever before the shadow that had followed him since early boyhood the same shadow that had fallen across his mothers mind and left continual twilight there no one really knew it seemed why or from whence jacob cochrane had come to edgewood he simply appeared at the old tavern a stranger with satchel in hand to seek entertainment uncle bart had often described this scene to waitstill for he was one of those sitting about the great open fire at the time the man easily slipped into the group and soon took the lead in conversation delighting all with his agreeable personality his nimble tongue and graceful speech at suppertime the hostess and the rest of the family took their places at the long table as was the custom and he astonished them by his knowledge not only of town history but of village matters they had supposed unknown to any one when the stranger had finished his supper and returned to the barroom he had to pass through a long entry and the landlady whispering to her daughter said betsy you go up to the chamber closet and get the silver and bring it down this man is going to sleep there and i am afraid of him he must be a fortuneteller and the lord only knows what else in going to the chamber the daughter had to pass through the barroom as she was moving quietly through hoping to escape the notice of the newcomer he turned in his chair and looking her full in the face suddenly said madam you neednt touch your silver i dont want it i am a gentleman whereupon the bewildered betsy scuttled back to her mother and told her the strange guest was indeed a fortuneteller of cochranes initial appearance as a preacher ivory had told waitstill in their talk in the churchyard early in the summer it was at a childs funeral that the new prophet created his first sensation and there too that aaron and lois boynton first came under his spell the whole countryside had been just then wrought up to a state of religious excitement by revival meetings and cochrane gained the benefit of this definite preparation for his work he claimed that all his sayings were from divine inspiration and that those who embraced his doctrine received direct communication from the almighty he disdained formal creeds and all manner of church organizations declaring sectarian names to be marks of the beast and all church members to be in babylon he introduced rebaptism as a symbolic cleansing from sectarian stains and after some months advanced a proposition that his flock hold all things in common he put a sudden end to the solemn deaconingout and droning of psalm tunes and grafted on to his form of worship lively singing and marching accompanied by clapping of hands and whirling in circles during the progress of which the most hysterical converts or the most fully cochranized would swoon upon the floor or in obeying their leaders instructions to become as little children would sometimes go through the most extraordinary and unmeaning antics it was not until he had converted hundreds to the new faith that he added more startling revelations to his gospel he was in turn bold mystical eloquent audacious persuasive autocratic and even when his selfstyled communications from the almighty controverted all that his hearers had formerly held to be right he still magnetized or hypnotized them into an unwilling assent to his beliefs there was finally a proclamation to the effect that marriage vows were to be annulled when advisable and that complete spiritual liberty was to follow a liberty in which a new affinity might be sought and a spiritual union begun upon earth a union as nearly approximate to gods standards as faulty human beings could manage to attain some of the faithful fell away at this time being unable to accept the full doctrine but retained their faith in cochranes original power to convert sinners and save them from the wrath of god stormclouds began to gather in the sky however as the delusion spread month by month and local ministers everywhere sought to minimize the influence of the dangerous orator who rose superior to every attack and carried himself like some magnificent martyratwill among the crowds that now criticized him here or there in private and in public what a picture of splendid audacity he must have been wrote ivory when he entered the orthodox meetinghouse at a huge gathering where he knew that the speakers were to denounce his teachings old parson buzzell gave out his text from the high pulpit mark xiii and what i say unto you i say unto all watch just here cochrane stepped in at the open door of the church and heard the warning meant he knew for himself and seizing the moment of silence following the reading of the text he cried in his splendid sonorous voice without so much as stirring from his place within the doorframe behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice i will come in to him and will sup with him i come to preach the everlasting gospel to every one that heareth and all that i want here is my bigness on the floor i cannot find continued ivory on another page that my father or mother ever engaged in any of the foolish and childish practices which disgraced the meetings of some of cochranes most fanatical followers and converts by my mothers conversations some of which i have repeated to you but which may be full of errors because of her confusion of mind i believe she must have had a difference of opinion with my father on some of these views but i have no means of knowing this to a certainty nor do i know that the question of choosing spiritual consorts ever came between or divided them this part of the delusion always fills me with such unspeakable disgust that i have never liked to seek additional light from any of the older men and women who might revel in giving it that my mother did not sympathize with my fathers going out to preach cochranes gospel through the country this i know and she was so truly religious so burning with zeal that had she fully believed in my fathers mission she would have spurred him on instead of endeavoring to detain him you know the retribution that overtook cochrane at last wrote ivory again when he had shown the mans early victories and his enormous influence there began to be indignant protests against his doctrines by lawyers and doctors as well as by ministers not from all sides however for remember in extenuation of my fathers and my mothers espousal of this strange belief that many of the strongest and wisest men as well as the purest and finest women in york county came under this mans spell for a time and believed in him implicitly some of them even unto the end finally there was cochranes arrest and examination the order for him to appear at the supreme court his failure to do so his recapture and trial and his sentence of four years imprisonment on several counts in all of which he was proved guilty cochrane had all along said that the anointed of the lord would never be allowed to remain in jail but he was mistaken for he stayed in the states prison at charlestown massachusetts for the full duration of his sentence here i am again trying to plead the cause of my father and mother here he received much sympathy and some few visitors one of whom walked all the way from edgewood to boston a hundred and fifteen miles with a petition for pardon a petition which was delivered and refused at the boston state house cochrane issued from prison a broken and humiliated man but if report says true is still living far out of sight and knowledge somewhere in new hampshire he once sent my father an epitaph of his own selection asking him to have it carved upon his gravestone should he die suddenly when away from his friends my mother often repeats it not realizing how far from the point it sounds to us who never knew him in his glory but only in his downfall he spread his arms full wide abroad his works are ever before his god his name on earth shall long remain through envious sinners fret in vain we are certain concluded ivory that my father preached with cochrane in limington limerick and parsonsfield he also wrote from enfield and effingham in new hampshire after that all is silence various reports place him in boston in new york even as far west as ohio whether as cochranite evangelist or what not alas we can never know i despair of ever tracing his steps i only hope that he died before he wandered too widely either from his belief in god or his fidelity to my mothers longsuffering love waitstill read the letter twice through and replaced it in her dress to read again at night it seemed the only tangible evidence of ivorys love that she had ever received and she warmed her heart with what she felt that he had put between the lines would that i were free to tell you how i value your friendship my mothers heart feeds on the sight of you i want you to know something of the circumstances that have made me a prisoner in life instead of a free man yours is the most undaunted heart in all the world these sentences waitstill rehearsed again and again and they rang in her ears like music converting all the tasks of her long day into a deep and silent joy xix at the brick store there were two grand places for gossip in the community the old tavern on the edgewood side of the bridge and the brick store in riverboro the company at the edgewood tavern would be a trifle different in character more picturesque imposing and eclectic because of the transient guests that gave it change and variety here might be found a judge or lawyer on his way to court a sheriff with a handcuffed prisoner a farmer or two stopping on the road to market with a cartful of produce and an occasional teamster peddler and stagedriver on winter nights champion storytellers like jed morrill and rish bixby would drop in there and hang their woollen neckcomforters on the pegs along the wallside where there were already hats topcoats and fur mufflers as well as stacks of whips canes and oxgoads standing in the corners they would then enter the room rubbing their hands genially and nodding to companion pike cephas cole phil perry and others ensconce themselves snugly in the group by the great open fireplace the landlord was always glad to see them enter for their stories though old to him were new to many of the assembled company and had a remarkable greet on the consumption of liquid refreshment on summer evenings gossip was languid in the village and if any occurred at all it would be on the loafers bench at one or the other side of the bridge when cooler weather came the group of local wits gathered in riverboro either at uncle barts joiners shop or at the brick store according to fancy the latter place was perhaps the favorite for riverboro talkers it was a large twostory square brick building with a bigmouthed chimney and an open fire when every house in the two villages had six feet of snow around it roads would always be broken to the brick store and a crowd of ten or fifteen men would be gathered there talking listening betting smoking chewing bragging playing checkers singing and swapping stories some of the men had been through the war of and could display wounds received on the field of valor others were still prouder of scars won in encounters with the indians and there was one old codger a revolutionary veteran bill dunham by name who would add bloody tales of his encounters with the husshons his courage had been so extraordinary and his slaughter so colossal that his hearers marvelled that there was a hessian left to tell his side of the story and bill himself doubted if such were the case t is an awful sin to have on your soul bill would say from his place in a dark corner where he would sit with his hat pulled down over his eyes till the psychological moment came for the husshons to be trotted out t is an awful sin to have on your soul the extummination of a race o men even if they want nothin more n so many ignorant cockroaches them was the great days for fightin the husshons was the biggest men i ever seen on the field most of em standin six feet eight in their stockins but lord how we walloped em once we had a cannon mounted an loaded for em that was so large we had to draw the ball into it with a yoke of oxen bill paused from force of habit just as he had paused for the last twenty years there had been times when roars of incredulous laughter had greeted this boast but most of this particular group had heard the yarn more than once and let it pass with a smile and a wink remembering the night that abel day had asked old bill how they got the oxen out of the cannon on that most memorable occasion oh said bill that was easy enough we jest unyoked em an turned em out o the priminhole it was only early october but there had been a killing frost and ezra simms who kept the brick store flung some shavings and small wood on the hearth and lighted a blaze just to induce a little trade and start conversation on what threatened to be a dull evening peter morrill jeds eldest brother had lately returned from a long trip through the state and into new hampshire and his adventures by field and flood were always worth listening to he went about the country mending clocks and many an old timepiece still bears his name with the date of repairing written in pencil on the inside of its door there was never any lack of subjects at the brick store the idiosyncrasies of the neighbors being the most prolific source of anecdote and comment of scandal about women there was little though there would be occasional harmless pleasantries concerning village love affairs prophecies of what couple would be next published in the blackwalnut frame up at the meetinghouse a genial comment on the number and chances of patience baxters various beaux and whenever all else failed the latest story of deacon baxters parsimony in which the village traced the influence of heredity he cant hardly help it inheritin it on both sides was abel days opinion the baxters was allers snug from time memorial and foxys the snuggest of em when i look at his ugly mug an hear his snarlin voice i thinks to myself hes goin the same way his father did when old levi baxter was left a widderman in that house o hisn up river he grew wuss an wuss if you remember till he want hardly human at the last and i dont believe foxy even went up to his own fathers funeral t would a served old levi right if nobody else had gone said rish bixby when his wife died he refused to come into the house till the last minute he stayed to work in the barn until all the folks had assembled and even the men were all settin down on benches in the kitchen the parson sent me out for him and im blest if the old skunk didnt come in through the crowd with his sleeves rolled up went to the sink and washed and then set down in the room where the coffin was as cool as a cowcumber i remember that funeral well corroborated abel day an mis day heerd levi say to his daughter as soon as theyd put poor old mrs baxter int the grave come on marthy there s no use cryin over spilt milk wed better go home an husk out the rest o that corn old foxy could have inherited plenty o meanness from his father thats certain an hes added to his inheritance right along like the thrifty man he is i hate to think o them two fine girls wearin their fingers to the bone for his benefit oh well t wont last forever said rish bixby theyre the handsomest couple o girls on the river an theyll get husbands afore many years patiencell have one pretty soon by the looks she never budges an inch but mark wilson or phil perry are follerin behind with cephas cole watchin his chance right along too waitstill dont seem to have no beaux what with flyin around to keep up with the deacon an bein a mother to patience her hands is full i guess if things was a little mite difrent all round i could prognosticate who waitstill could keep house for was peter morrills opinion you mean ivory boynton well if the deacon was asked hed never give his consent thats certain an ivory aint in no position to keep a wife anyways what was it you heerd bout aaron boynton up to new hampshire peter asked abel day considable one way an another an none of it would a been any comfort to ivory i guess aaron n jake cochrane was both of em more interested in savin the sisters souls than the brothers aaron was a fineappearin man and so was jake for that matter n they both had the gift o gab theres nothin like a limber tongue if you want to please the womenfolks if report says true aaron died of a fever out in ohio somewheres cortlands the place i blieve seemss if he hid his trail all the way from new hampshire somehow for as a usual thing a man o booklarnin like him would be remembered wherever he went wouldnt you call aaron boynton a turrible larned man timothy timothy grant the parish clerk had just entered the store on an errand but being directly addressed and judging that the subject under discussion was a discreet one and that it was too early in the evening for drinking to begin he joined the group by the fireside he had preached in vermont for several years as an itinerant methodist minister before settling down to farming in edgewood only giving up his profession because his quiver was so full of little grants that a wandering life was difficult and undesirable when uncle bart cole had remarked that mis grant had a little of everything in the way of babystock now black red an yallerhaired dark and light complected fat an lean tall an short twins an singles jed morrill had observed dryly yes mis grant kind o reminds me of charity hows that inquired uncle bart she beareth all things chuckled jed aaron boynton was indeed a man of most adhesive larnin agreed timothy who had the reputation of the largest and most unusual vocabulary in edgewood next to jacob cochrane i should say aaron had more grandeloquence as an orator than any man weve ever had in these parts it dont seems if ivory was goin to take after his father that way the little feller now is smarts a whip an could talk the tail off a brass monkey yes but rodman aint no kin to the boyntons abel reminded him he inhails from the other side o the house thats so well ivory does for certain an takes after his mother right enough for she haint spoken a dozen words in as many years i guess ivorys got a sight o bookknowledge though an they do say he could talk greek an latin both if we had any of em in the community to converse with ive never paid no intention to the dead languages bein so ockerpied with other studies why do they call em the dead languages tim asked rish bixby because all them that ever spoke em has perished off the face o the land timothy answered oracularly dead an gone they be lock stock an barrel yet there was a time when latins an crustaceans an hebrews an prooshians an australians an simesians was chatterin away in their own tongues an so powful that they was wallopin the whole earth you might say i bet yer they never tried to wallop these here united states interpolated bill dunham from the dark corner by the molasses hogshead is ivory in here the door opened and rodman boynton appeared on the threshold no sonny ivory aint been in this evening replied ezra simms i hope there aint nothin the matter over to your house no nothing particular the boy answered hesitatingly only aunt boynton dont seem so well as common and i cant find ivory anywhere come along with me ill help you look for him an then ill go as fur as the lane with yer if we dont find him and kindly rish bixby took the boys hand and left the store mis boynton had a spell i guess suggested the storekeeper peering through the door into the darkness t aint like ivory to be out nights and leave her to rod she dont have no spells said abel day uncle bart sees considable of ivory an he says his mother is as quiet as a lamb couldnt you git no kind of a certifcate of aarons death out o that enfield feller peter seemss if that poor womand oughter be stopped watchin for a dead man tuckerin herself all out an keepin ivory an the boy all nerved up ive told ivory everything i could gether up in the way of information and give him the names of the folks in ohio that had writ back to new hampshire i didnt dialate on aarons goinson in effingham an portsmouth cause i dassay t was nothin but scandal them as hates the cochranitesll never allow theres any good in em whereas ive met some as is servin the lord good an constant an indulgin in no kind of foolishness an deviltry whatsoever speakin o husshons said bill dunham from his corner i remember we want alludin to no husshons retorted timothy grant we was dealin with the misfortunes of aaron boynton who never fit valoriously on the field o battle but perished out in ohio of scarlit fever if what they say in enfield is true tis an easy death remarked bill argumentatively scarlit fever dont seem like nothin to me manys the time ive been close enough to fire at the eyeball of a husshon an run the resk o bein blown to smithereens calm and cool i alters was too scarlit fever is an easy death from a warriors pint o view speakin of easy death continued timothy you know im a great one for words bein something of a scholard in my small way mebbe you noticed that elder boone used a strange word in his sermon last sunday now an then when theres too many yawnin to once in the congregation parsonll out with a reglar jawbreaker to wake em up the word as near as i could ketch it was youthinasia i kep holt of it till noontime an then i run home an looked through all the ys in the dictionary without findin it mebbe its hebrew i thinks for hebrews like his mothers tongue to parson so i went right up to him at afternoon meetin an says to him whats the exact meanin of youthinasia there aint no sech word in the ys in my webster says i look in the es timothy euthanasia says he means easy death an now dont it beat all that bill dunham should have brought that expression of easy death into this evenins talk i know youth an i know ashy said abel day but blessed if i know why they should mean easy death when they yoke em together thats because you aint never paid no tention to entomology said timothy aaron boynton was master o more ologies than you could shake a stick at but he used to say i beat him on entomology words air curous things sometimes as i know hevin had considable leisure time to read when i was joggin bout the country an bein brought into contack with men o learnin the way i worked it out not wishin to ask parson any more questions bein something of a scholard myself is this the youth in ashy is a peculiar kind o youth n their religion disposes em to lay no kind o stress on huming life when anything goes wrong with em an they get a setback in war or business or affairs with womenfolks they want to die right off so they take a sword an stan it straight up wherever they happen to be in the shed or the barn or the henhouse an they pint the sharp end right to their waistline where the bowels an other vital organisms is lowcated an then they fall on to it it runs em right through to the back an kills em like a shot and thats the way i callate the youth in ashy dies if my entomology is correct as it genally is dont seem an easy death to me argued okra but i aint no scholard what college did thou attend to tim i dont hold no diaploma responded timothy though i attended to wareham academy quite a spell the same time as your sister was goin to wareham seminary where eddication is still bein disseminated though of an awful poor kind compared to the old times its live an larn said the storekeeper respectfully i never thought of a seminary bein a place of dissemination before but you can see the two words is near kin you cant alters tell by the sound said timothy instructively sometimes two wordsll start from the same root an branch out diffrent like critter an hypocritter a hypocritter must natcherally start by bein a critter but a critter aint obliged to be a hypocritter thout he wants to i should hope not interpolated abel day piously entomology must be an awful interestin study though i never thought of observin words myself kept to avoid vulgar language an profanity husshons a curous word for a man interjected bill dunham with a last despairing effort i remember seein a husshon once that perhaps you aint one to observe closely abel said timothy not taking note of any interruption simply using the time to direct a stream of tobacco juice to an incredible distance but landing it neatly in the exact spot he had intended its a trade by itself you might say observin is an theres another singlar corraption the whigs in foreign parts so they say build stone towers to observe the evil machinations of the tories an so the word observatory come into general use all entomology nothin but entomology i dont see where in thunder you picked up so much larnin timothy it was abel days exclamation but every one agreed with him xx the rod that blossomed ivory boynton had taken the horse and gone to the village on an errand a rare thing for him to do after dark so rod was thinking as he sat in the livingroom learning his sundayschool lesson on the same evening that the men were gossiping at the brick store his aunt had required him from the time when he was proficient enough to do so to read at least a part of a chapter in the bible every night beginning with genesis he had reached leviticus and had made up his mind that the bible was a much more difficult book than scottish chiefs not withstanding the fact that ivory helped him over most of the hard places at the present juncture he was vastly interested in the subject of rods as unfolded in the book of exodus which was being studied by his sundayschool class what added to the excitement was the fact that his uncles christian name aaron kept appearing in the chronicle as frequently as that of the great lawgiver moses himself and there were many verses about the wonderworking rods of moses and aaron that had a strange effect upon the boys ear when he read them aloud as he loved to do whenever he was left alone for a time when his aunt was in the room his instinct kept him from doing this for the mere mention of the name of aaron he feared might sadden his aunt and provoke in her that dangerous vein of reminiscence that made ivory so anxious it kind o makes me nervous to be named rod aunt boynton said the boy looking up from the bible all the rods in these exodus chapters do such dreadful things they become serpents and one of them swallows up all the others and moses smites the waters with a rod and they become blood and the people cant drink the water and the fish die then they stretch a rod across the streams and ponds and bring a plague of frogs over the land with swarms of flies and horrible insects that was to show gods power to pharaoh and melt his hard heart to obedience and reverence explained mrs boynton who had known the bible from cover to cover in her youth and could still give chapter and verse for hundreds of her favorite passages it took an awful lot of melting pharaohs heart exclaimed the boy pharaoh must have been worse than deacon baxter i wonder if they ever tried to make him good by being kind to him ive read and read but i cant find they used anything on him but plagues and famines and boils and pestilences and thunder and hail and fire have i got a middle name aunt boynton for i dont like rod very much i never heard that you had a middle name you must ask ivory said his aunt abstractedly did my father name me rod or my mother i dont really know perhaps it was your mother but dont ask questions please i forgot aunt boynton yes i think perhaps my mother named me mothers most always name their babies dont they my mother wasnt like you she looked just like the picture of pocahontas in my history she never knew about these bible rods i guess when you go a little further you will find pleasanter things about rods said his aunt knitting knitting intensely as was her habit and talking as if her mind were a thousand miles away you know they were just little branches of trees and it was only gods power that made them wonderful in any way oh i thought they were like the singingteachers stick he keeps time with no if you look at your concordance youll finds it gives you a chapter in numbers where theres something beautiful about rods i have forgotten the place it has been many years since i looked at it find it and read it aloud to me the boy searched his concordance and readily found the reference in the seventeenth chapter of numbers stand near me and read said mrs boynton i like to hear the bible read aloud rodman took his bible and read slowly and haltingly but with clearness and understanding and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name upon his rod through the boys mind there darted the flash of a thought a sad thought he himself was a rod on whom no mans name seemed to be written orphan that he was with no knowledge of his parents suddenly he hesitated for he had caught sight of the name of aaron in the verse that he was about to read and did not wish to pronounce it in his aunts hearing this chapter is most too hard for me to read out loud aunt boynton he stammered can i study it by myself and read it to ivory first go on go on you read very sweetly i can not remember what comes and i wish to hear it the boy continued but without raising his eyes from the bible and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you and it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you rodman had read on absorbed in the story and the picture it presented to his imagination he liked the idea of all the princes having a rod according to the house of their fathers he liked to think of the little branches being laid on the altar in the tabernacle and above all he thought of the longing of each of the princes to have his own rod chosen for the blossoming and moses spoke unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod a piece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods oh how the boy hoped that aarons branch would be the one chosen to blossom he felt that his aunt would be pleased too but he read on steadily with eyes that glowed and breath that came and went in a very palpitation of interest and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds it was aarons rod then and was an almond branch how beautiful for the blossoms would have been pink and how the people must have marvelled to see the lovely blooming thing on the dark altar first budding then blossoming then bearing nuts and what was the rod chosen for he hurried on to the next verse and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod and the lord said unto moses bring aarons rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not oh aunt boynton cried the boy i love my name after ive heard about the almond rod arent you proud that its uncles name that was written on the one that blossomed he turned swiftly to find that his aunts knitting had slipped on the floor her nerveless hands drooped by her side as if there were no life in them and her head had fallen against the back of her chair the boy was paralyzed with fear at the sight of her closed eyes and the deathly pallor of her face he had never seen her like this before and ivory was away he flew for a bottle of spirit always kept in the kitchen cupboard for emergencies and throwing wood on the fire in passing he swung the crane so that the teakettle was over the flame he knew only the humble remedies that he had seen used here or there in illness and tried them timidly praying every moment that he might hear ivorys step he warmed a soapstone in the embers and taking off mrs boyntons shoes put it under her cold feet he chafed her hands and gently poured a spoonful of brandy between her pale lips then sprinkling camphor on a handkerchief he held it to her nostrils and to his joy she stirred in her chair before many minutes her lids fluttered her lips moved and she put her hand to her heart are you better aunt dear rod asked in a very wavering and tearful voice she did not answer she only opened her eyes and looked at him at length she whispered faintly i want ivory i want my son hes out aunt dear shall i help you to bed the way ivory does if youll let me then ill run to the bridge cross lots like lightning and bring him back she assented and leaning heavily on his slender shoulder walked feebly into her bedroom off the livingroom rod was as gentle as a mother and he was familiar with all the little offices that could be of any comfort the soapstone warmed again for her feet the bringing of her nightgown from the closet and when she was in bed another spoonful of brandy in hot milk then the camphor by her side an extra homespun blanket over her and the door left open so that she could see the open fire that he made into a cheerful huddles contrived so that it would not snap and throw out dangerous sparks in his absence all the while he was doing this mrs boynton lay quietly in the bed talking to herself fitfully in the faint murmuring tone that was habitual to her he could distinguish scarcely anything only enough to guess that her mind was still on the bible story that he was reading to her when she fainted the rod of aaron was among the other rods he heard her say and a moment later bring aarons rod again before the testimony was it his uncles name that had so affected her wondered the boy almost sick with remorse although he had tried his best to evade her command to read the chapter aloud what would ivory his hero his pattern and example say it had always seen rods pride to carry his little share of every burden that fell to ivory to be faithful and helpful in every task given to him he could walk through fire without flinching he thought if ivory told him to and he only prayed that he might not be held responsible for this new calamity i want ivory came in a feeble voice from the bedroom does your side ache worse rod asked tiptoeing to the door no i am quite free from pain would you be afraid to stay alone just for a while if i lock both doors and run to find ivory and bring him back no i will sleep she whispered closing her eyes bring him quickly before i forget what i want to say to him rod sped down the lane and over the fields to the brick store where ivory usually bought his groceries his cousin was not there but one of the men came out and offered to take his horse and drive over the bridge to see if he were at one of the neighbors on that side of the river not a word did rod breathe of his aunts illness he simply said that she was lonesome for ivory and so he came to find him in five minutes they saw the boynton horse hitched to a tree by the roadside and in a trice rod called him and thanking mr bixby got into ivorys wagon to wait for him he tried his best to explain the situation as they drove along but finally concluded by saying aunt really made me read the chapter to her ivory i tried not to when i saw uncles name in most every verse but i couldnt help it of course you couldnt now you jump out and hitch the horse while i run in and see that nothing has happened while shes been left alone perhaps you have to go for dr perry ivory went in with fear and trembling for there was no sound save the ticking of the tall clock the fire burned low upon the hearth and the door was open into his mothers room he lifted a candle that rod had left ready on the table and stole softly to her bedside she was sleeping like a child but exhaustion showed itself in every line of her face he felt her hands and feet and found the soapstone in the bed saw the brandy bottle and the remains of a cup of milk on the lightstand noted the handkerchief still strong of camphor on the counterpane and the blanket spread carefully over her knees and then turned approvingly to meet rod stealing into the room on tiptoe his eyes big with fear we wont wake her rod ill watch a while then sleep on the sittingroom lounge let me watch ivory id feel better if youd let me honest i would the boys face was drawn with anxiety ivorys attention was attracted by the wistful eyes and the beauty of the forehead under the dark hair he seemed something more than the child of yesterday a care and responsibility and expense for all his loving obedience he seemed all at once different tonight older more dependable more trustworthy in fact a positive comfort and help in time of trouble i did the best i knew how was anything wrong asked the boy as ivory stood regarding him with a friendly smile nothing wrong rod dr perry couldnt have done any better with what you had on hand i dont know how i should get along without you boy here ivory patted rods shoulder youre not a child any longer rod youre a man and a brother thats what you are and to prove it ill take the first watch and call you up at one oclock to take the second so that i can be ready for my school work tomorrow how does that suit you tiptop said the boy flushing with pride ill lie down with my clothes on its only nine oclock and ill get four hours sleep thats a lot more than napoleon used to have he carried the bible upstairs and just before he blew out his candle he looked again at the chapter in numbers thinking he would show it to ivory privately next day again the story enchanted him and again like a child he put his own name and his living self among the rods in the tabernacle ivory would be the prince of our house he thought oh how id like to be ivorys rod and have it be the one that was chosen to blossom and keep the rebels from murmuring xxi lois buries her dead the replies that ivory had received from his letters of inquiry concerning his fathers movements since leaving maine and his possible death in the west left no reasonable room for doubt traces of aaron boynton in new hampshire in massachusetts in new york and finally in ohio all pointed in one direction and although there were gaps and discrepancies in the account of his doings the fact of his death seemed to be established by two apparently reliable witnesses that he was not unaccompanied in his earliest migrations seemed clear but the woman mentioned as his wife disappeared suddenly from the reports and the story of his last days was the story of a brokendown melancholy unfriended man dependent for the last offices on strangers he left no messages and no papers said ivorys correspondent and never made mention of any family connections whatsoever he had no property and no means of defraying the expenses of his illness after he was stricken with the fever no letters were found among his poor effects and no article that could prove his identity unless it were a small gold locket which bore no initials or marks of any kind but which contained two locks of fair and brown hair intertwined the tiny trinket was enclosed in the letter as of no value unless some one recognized it as a keepsake ivory read the correspondence with a heavy heart inasmuch as it corroborated all his worst fears he had sometimes secretly hoped that his father might return and explain the reason of his silence or in lieu of that that there might come to light the story of a pilgrimage fanatical perhaps but innocent of evil intention one that could be related to his wife and his former friends and then buried forever with the death that had ended it neither of these hopes could now ever be realized nor his fathers memory made other than a cause for endless regret sorrow and shame his father who had begun life so handsomely with rare gifts of mind and personality a wife of unusual beauty and intelligence and while still young in years a considerable success in his chosen profession his poor father what could have been the reasons for so complete a downfall ivory asked dr perrys advice about showing one or two of the briefer letters and the locket to his mother after her fainting fit and the exhaustion that followed it ivory begged her to see the old doctor but without avail finally after days of pleading he took her hands in his and said i do everything a mortal man can do to be a good son to you mother wont you do this to please me and trust that i know what is best whereupon she gave a trembling assent as if she were agreeing to something indescribably painful and indeed this sight of a former friend seemed to frighten her strangely after dr perry had talked with her for a halfhour and examined her sufficiently to make at least a reasonable guess as to her mental and physical condition he advised ivory to break the news of her husbands death to her if you can get her to comprehend it he said it is bound to be a relief from this terrible suspense will there be any danger of making her worse mightnt the shock cause too violent emotion asked ivory anxiously i dont think she is any longer capable of violent emotion the doctor answered her mind is certainly clearer than it was three years ago but her body is nearly burned away by the mental conflict there is scarcely any part of her but is weary weary unto death poor soul one cannot look at her patient lovely face without longing to lift some part of her burden make a trial ivory its a justifiable experiment and i think it will succeed i must not come any oftener myself than is absolutely necessary she seemed afraid of me the experiment did succeed lois boynton listened breathlessly with parted lips and with apparent comprehension to the story ivory told her over and over again he told her gently the story of her husbands death trying to make it sink into her mind clearly so that there should be no consequent bewilderment she was calm and silent though her face showed that she was deeply moved she broke down only when ivory showed her the locket i gave it to my husband when you were born my son she sobbed after all it seems no surprise to me that your father is dead he said he would come back when the mayflowers bloomed and when i saw the autumn leaves i knew that six months must have gone and he would never stay away from us for six months without writing that is the reason i have seldom watched for hint these last weeks i must have known that it was no use she rose from her rockingchair and moved feebly towards her bedroom can you spare me the rest of the day ivory she faltered as she leaned on her son and made her slow progress from the kitchen i must bury the body of my grief and i want to be alone at first if only i could see waitstill we have both thought this was coming she has a womans instinct she is younger and stronger than i am and she said it was braver not to watch and pine and fret as i have done but to have faith in god that he would send me a sign when he was ready she said if i could manage to be braver you would be happier too here she sank on to her bed exhausted but still kept up her murmuring faintly and feebly between long intervals of silence do you think waitstill could come tomorrow she asked i am so much braver when she is here with me after supper i will put away your fathers cup and plate once and for all ivory and your eyes need never fill with tears again as they have sometimes when you have seen me watching you neednt worry about me i am remembering better these days and the bells that ring in my ears are not so loud if only the pain in my side were less and i were not so pressed for breath i should be quite strong and could see everything clearly at last there is something else that remains to be remembered i have almost caught it once and it must come to me again before long put the locket under my pillow ivory close the door please and leave me to myself i cant make it quite clear my feeling about it but it seems just as if i were going to bury your father and i want to be alone xxii harvesttime new englands annual pageant of autumn was being unfolded day by day in all its accustomed splendor and the feast and riot of color the almost unimaginable glory was the common property of the whole countryside rich and poor to be shared alike if perchance all eyes were equally alive to the wonder and the beauty scarlet days and days of gold followed fast one upon the other saco water flowing between quiet woodlands that were turning red and russet and brown and now plunging through rocky banks all blazing with crimson waitstill baxter went as often as she could to the boynton farm though never when ivory was at home and the affection between the younger and the older woman grew closer and closer so that it almost broke waitstills heart to leave the fragile creature when her presence seemed to bring such complete peace and joy no one ever clung to me so before she often thought as she was hurrying across the fields after one of her halfhour visits but the end must come before long ivory does not realize it yet nor rodman but it seems as if she could never survive the long winter thanksgiving day is drawing nearer and nearer and how little i am able to do for a single creature to prove to god that i am grateful for my existence i could if only i were free make such a merry day for patty and mark and their young friends oh what joy if father were a man who would let me set a bountiful table in our great kitchen would sit at the head and say grace and we could bow our heads over the cloth a united family or if i had done my duty in my home and could go to that other where i am so needed go with my fathers blessing if only i could live in that sad little house and brighten it i would trim the rooms with evergreen and creepingjenny i would put scarlet alder berries and white everlastings and blue fringed gentians in the vases i would put the last bright autumn leaves near mrs boyntons bed and set out a tray with a damask napkin and the best of my cooking then i would go out to the back door where the woodbine hangs like a red waterfall and blow the dinnerhorn for my men down in the harvestfield all the woman in me is wasting wasting oh my dear dear man how i long for him oh my own dear man my helpmate shall i ever live by his side i love him i want him i need him and my dear little unmothered unfathered boy how happy i could make him how i should love to cook and sew for them all and wrap them in comfort how i should love to smooth my dear mothers last days for she is my mother in spirit in affection in desire and in being ivorys waitstills longing her discouragement her helplessness overcame her wholly and she flung herself down under a tree in the pasture in a very passion of sobbing a luxury in which she could seldom afford to indulge herself the luxury was shortlived for in five minutes she heard rodmans voice and heard him running to meet her as he often did when she came to their house or went away from it dogging her footsteps or pattys whenever or wherever he could waylay them why my dear dear waity did you tumble and hurt yourself the boy cried yes dreadfully but im better now so walk along with me and tell me the news rod there isnt much news ivory told you id left school and am studying at home he helps me evenings and im way ahead of the class no ivory didnt tell me i havent seen him lately i said if the big brother kept school the little brother ought to keep house laughed the boy he says i can hire out as a cook pretty soon aunt boyntons most always up to get dinner and supper but i can make lots of things now things that aunt boynton can eat too oh i cannot bear to have you and ivory cooking for yourselves exclaimed waitstill the tears starting again from her eyes i must come over the next time when you are at home rod and i can help you make something nice for supper we get along pretty well said rodman contentedly i love booklearning like ivory and im going to be a schoolmaster or a preacher when ivorys a lawyer do you think pattyd like a schoolmaster or a preacher best and do you think id be too young to marry her by and by if she would wait for me i didnt think you had any idea of marrying patty laughed waitstill through her tears is this something new its not exactly new said rod jumping along like a squirrel in the path nobody could look at patty and not think about marrying her id love to marry you too but you re too big and grand for a boy of course im not going to ask patty yet ivory said once you should never ask a girl until you can keep her like a queen then after a minute he said well maybe not quite like a queen rod for that would mean longer than a man could wait shall we say until he could keep her like the dearest lady in the land that s the way he said it you do cry dreadfully easy today waity im sure you barked your leg or skinned your knee when you fell down dont you think the dearest lady in the land is a nicesounding sentence i do indeed cried waitstill to herself as she turned the words over and over trying to feed her hungry heart with them i love to hear ivory talk its like the stories in the books we have our best times in the barn for im helping with the milking now our yellow cows name is molly and the red cow used to be dolly but we changed her to golly cause shes so troublesome mollys an easy cow to milk and i can get almost all there is though ivory comes after me and takes the strippings golly swishes her tail and kicks the minute she hears us coming then she stands stifflegged and grits her teeth and holds on to her milk hard and ivory has to pat and smooth and coax her every single time ivory says shes got a kind of an attachment inside of her that she shuts down when he begins to milk we had a cross old cow like that once said waitstill absently loving to hear the boys chatter and the eternal quotations from his beloved hero we have great fun cooking too continued rod when aunt boynton was first sick she stayed in bed more and ivory and i hadnt got used to things one morning we bound up each others burns ivory had three fingers and i two done up in buttery rags to take the fire out ivory called us soldiers dressing their wounds after the battle sausages spatter dreadfully dont they and when you turn a pancake it flops on top of the stove can you flop one straight waity yes i can straight as a die thats what girls are made for now run along home to your big brother and do put on some warmer clothes under your coat the weathers getting colder aunt boynton hasnt patched our thick ones yet but she will soon and if she doesnt ivoryll take this saturday evening and do them himself he said so he shall not cried waitstill passionately it is not seemly for ivory to sew and mend and i will not allow it you shall bring me those things that need patching without telling any one do you hear and i will meet you on the edge of the pasture saturday afternoon and give them back to you you are not to speak of it to any one you understand or perhaps i shall pound you to a jelly youd make a sweet rosy jelly to eat with turkey for thanksgiving dinner you dear comforting little boy rodman ran towards home and waitstill hurried along scarcely noticing the beauties of the woods and fields and waysides all glowing masses of goldenrod and purple frost flowers the stone walls were covered with wildgrape and feathery clematis vines everywhere in sight the cornfields lay yellow in the afternoon sun and ox carts heavily loaded with full golden ears were going home to the barns to be ready for husking a sudden breeze among the orchard boughs as she neared the house was followed by a shower of russets and everywhere the red baldwins gleamed on the appletree boughs while the windfalls were being gathered and taken to the cider mills there was a grove of maples on the top of townhouse hill and the baxters dooryard was a blaze of brilliant color to see patty standing under a little rock maple her brown linseywoolsey in i one with the landscape and the hood of her brown cape pulled over her bright head was a welcome for anybody she looked flushed and excited as she ran up to her sister and said waity darling youve been crying has father been scolding you no dear but my heart is aching today so that i can scarcely bear it a wave of discouragement came over me as i was walking through the woods and i gave up to it a bit i remembered how soon it will be thanksgiving day and ill so like to make it happier for you and a few others that i love patty could have given a shrewd guess as to the chief cause of the heartache but she forebore to ask any questions cheer up waity she cried you never can tell we may have a thankful thanksgiving after all who knows what may happen im strung up this afternoon and in a fighting mood ive felt like a new piece of snappy white elastic all day its the air just like wine so cool and stinging and full of courage oh yes we wont give up hope yet awhile waity not until were snowed in put your arms round me and give me a good hug patty love me hard hard for oh i need it badly just now and the two girls clung together for a moment and then went into the house with hands closelocked and a kind of sad desperate courage in their young hearts what would either of them have done each of them thought had she been forced to endure alone the life that went on day after day in deacon baxters dreary house xxiii aunt abbys window mrs abel day had come to spend the afternoon with aunt abby cole and they were seated at the two sittingroom windows sweeping the landscape with eagle eyes in the intervals of making patchwork the foliage has been a little mite too rich this season remarked aunt abby i blieve im glad to see it thinin out some so t we can have some kind of an idee of whats goin on in the village theres plenty goin on mrs day answered unctuously some of it aboveboard an some underneath it an thats jest where its aggravatin to have the leaves so thick and the trees so high between you and other folks houses trees are good for shade its true but theres a limit to all things there was a time when i could see bout everything that went on up to baxters and down to barts shop and by goin up attic considable many things that happened on the bridge bart vows he never planted that plum tree at the back door of his shop says the children must have hove out plum stones when they was settin on the steps and the tree come up of its own accord he says he didnt take any notice of it till it got quite a start and then t was such a healthy young bush he couldnt bear to root it out i tell him its kind o queer it should happen to come up jest where it spoils my view of his premises men folks are so exasperatin that sometimes i wish there was somebody different for us to marry but there aint so there we be they are an awful trial admitted mrs day abel never sympathizes with my headaches i told him asunday i didnt believe hed mind if i died the next day an all he said was why dont you try it an see lyddy he thinks thats humorous i know thats the way bartholomew talks i guess they all do you can see the bridge better n i can lyddy has mark wilson drove over sence youve been settin there hes like one o them ostriches that hides their heads in the sand when the birdcatchers are comin along thinkin cause they cant see anything theyll never be seen he knows folks would never tell tales to deacon baxter whatever the girls done they hate him too bad lawyer wilson lives so far away he cant keep any watch o mark an mis wilsons so cityfied an purseproud nobody ever goes to her with any news bad or good so them thats the most concerned is as blind as bats marks considable stiddiern he used to be but you neednt tell me he has any notion of bringin one o that baxter tribe into his family hes only amusin himself pattyll be mrs wilson or nothin was mrs days response both o them girls is silk purses an you cant make sows ears of em we aint neither of us hardly fair to patty an i spose it s because she didnt set any proper value on cephas oh shes good enough for mark i guess though i aint so sure of his intentions as you be shes nobodys fool patty aint i allow that though she did treat cephas like the dirt in the road im thankful hes come to his senses an found out the diffrence between dross an gold its very good of you to put it that way abby mrs day responded gratefully for it was phoebe her own offspring who was alluded to as the most precious of metals i suppose wed better have the publishing notice put up in the frame before sunday therell be a great crowd out that day and at thanksgiving service the next thursday too cephas says he dont care how soon folks hears the news now alls settled said his mother i guess hes kind of anxious that the village should know jest how little truth there is in the gossip bout him bein all upset over patience baxter he said they took considable notice of him an phoebe settin together at the harvest festival last evenin he thought the baxter girls would be there for certain but i spose old foxy wouldnt let em go up to the mills in the evenin nor spend a quarter on their tickets mark could have invited patty an paid for her ticket i should think or passed her in free for that matter when the wilsons got up the entertainment but of course the deacon never allows his girls to go anywheres with menfolks not in public so they meet em side o the river or round the corner of barts shop or anywhere they can when the deacons backs turned if you tied a handkerchief over waitstills eyes she could find her way blindfold to ivory boyntons house but shes good as gold waitstill is shell stay where her duty calls her every time if any misfortune or scandal should come near them two girls the deacon will have nobody but himself to thank for it thats one sure thing young folks cant be young but once sighed mrs day i thought we had as handsome a turnout at the entertainment last evenin as any village on the saco river could a furnished an my phoebe an your cephas if i do say so as shouldnt was about the bestdressed an bestappearin couple there was present also i guess likely theyre startin out with as good prospects as any bride an groom thats walked up the middle aisle o the meetinhouse for many a year howd you like that boston singer that the wilsons brought here abby wait a minute is cephas or the deacon tendin store this afternoon the deacon cephas is paintin up to the mills well mark wilsons horse an buggy is meanderin slowly down aunt bettyjacks hill an mark is studyin the road as if he was lookin for a fourleafed clover hell hitch at the tavern or the edgewood store an wait his chance to get a word with patience said aunt abby he knows when she takes milk

way they say ellen wilsons goin to take lessons of her this winter she kind o bewildered me lyddy of course i aint never been to any cities so i dont feel altogether free to criticise but what did you think of her when she run up so high there one time i dont know how high she went but i guess there want no higher to go it made me kind o nervous allowed mrs day nervous bart an i broke out in a cold sweat he said she couldnt hold a candle to waitstill baxter but its that little flyaway wilson girl thatll get the lessons an waitstill will have to use her voice callin the deacon home to dinner things aint divided any too well in this world lyddy waitstills got the voice but she lacks the trainin the boston singer knows her business ill say that for her said mrs day shes got good stayin power agreed aunt abby did you notice how she held on to that high note when shed clumb where she wanted to git shes got breath enough to run a gristmill that girl has and howd she come down when she got good and ready to start why she zigzagged an sawtoothed the whole way it kind o made my flesh creep i guess part o the troubles with us country folks mrs day responded for folks said she sung runs

heerd her practise scales has got to be done no doubt but theyd ought to be done to home where they belong a concert aint no place for em there what did i tell yer patience baxters crossin the bridge with a pail in her hand shes got that everlastin yellerbrown linseywoolsey on an a white cloud wrapped around her head with considable red hair showin as usual you can always see her furs you can a sunrise and there goes rod boynton chasin behind as usual those baxter girls make a perfect fool o that boy but i dont spose lois boyntons got wit enough to make much fuss over the poor little creeter mark wilson could certainly see patty baxter as far as he could a sunrise although he was not intimately acquainted with that natural phenomenon he took a circuitous route from his watchtower and knowing well the point from which there could be no espionage from deacon baxters store windows joined patty in the road took the pail from her hand and walked up the hill beside her of course the village could see them but as aunt abby had intimated there wasnt a man woman or child on either side of the river who wouldnt have taken the part of the baxter girls against their father xxiv phoebe triumphs meantime feeble phoebe day was driving her fathers horse up to the mills to bring cephas cole home it was a thrilling moment a sort of outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual tie for their banns were to be published the next day so what did it matter if the community nay if the whole universe speculated as to why she was drawing her beloved back from his daily toil it had been an eventful autumn for cephas after a third request for the hand of miss patience baxter and a refusal of even more than common decision and energy cephas turned about face and employed the entire month of september in a determined assault upon the affections of miss lucy morrill but with no better avail his heart was not ardently involved in this second wooing but winter was approaching he had moved his mother out of her summer quarters back to the main house and he doggedly began papering the ell and furnishing the kitchen without disclosing to his respected parents the identity of the lady for whose comfort he was so hospitably preparing cephass belief in the holy state of matrimony as being the only one proper for a man really ought to have commended him to the opposite and ungrateful sex more than it did and lucy morrill held as respectful an opinion of the institution and its manifold advantages as cephas himself but she was in a very unsettled frame of mind and not at all susceptible to wooing she had a strong preference for philip perry and held an opinion not altogether unfounded in human experience that in course of time when quite deserted by patty baxter his heart might possibly be caught on the rebound it was only a chance but lucy would almost have preferred remaining unmarried even to the withering age of twentyfive rather than not be at liberty to accept philip perry in case she should be asked cephas therefore by the middle of october could be picturesquely and alliteratively described as being raw from repeated rejections his bruised heart and his despised ell literally cried out for the appreciation so long and blindly withheld now all at once phoebe disclosed a second virtue her first and only one hitherto in the eyes of cephas having been an ability to get on with his mother a feat in which many had made an effort and few indeed had succeeded phoebe it seems had always secretly admired respected and loved cephas cole never since her pale and somewhat glassy blue eye had opened on life had she beheld a being she could so adore if encouraged in the attitude the moment this unusual and unexpected poultice was really applied to cephass wounds they began to heal in the course of a month the most ordinary observer could have perceived a physical change in him he cringed no more but held his head higher his back straightened his voice developed a gruff assertive note like that of a stern roman father he let his moustache grow and sometimes in his most reckless moments twiddled the end of it finally he swaggered but that was only after phoebe had accepted him and told him that if a girl traversed the entire length of the saco river which she presumed to be the longest in the world the amazon not being familiar to her she could not hope to find his equal as a husband and then congratulations began to pour in was ever marriage so fortuitous the coles farm joined that of the days and the union between the two only children would cement the friendship between the families the fact that uncle bart was a joiner cephas a painter and abel day a mason and bricklayer made the alliance almost providential in its business opportunities phoebes massachusetts aunt sent a complete outfit of giltedged china a clock and a mahogany chamber set aunt abby relinquished to the young couple a bedroom and a spare chamber in the main part while the days supplied livegeese feathers and table and bedlinen with positive prodigality aunt abby trod the air like one inspired balmy is the only adjective that could describe her if only i could a looked ahead smiled uncle bart quizzically to himself id a had thirteen sons and daughters an married off one of em every year that would a made abbys good temper kind o permanent cephas was content too there was a good deal in being settled and having the whole doggoned business off your hands phoebe looked a very different creature to him in these latter days her eyes were just as pale of course but they were brighter and they radiated love for him an expression in the female eye that he had thus far been singularly unfortunate in securing she still held her mouth slightly open but cephas thought that it might be permissible perhaps after three months of wedded bliss to request her to be more careful in closing it he believed too that she would make an effort to do so just to please him whereas a mans life or property would not be safe for a single instant if he asked miss patience baxter to close her mouth not if he had been married to her for thirty times three months cephas did not think of patty any longer with bitterness in these days being of the opinion that she was punished enough in observing his own growing popularity and prosperity if she should see that mahogany chamber set going into the ell i guess shed be glad enough to change her tune thought cephas exultingly and then there suddenly shot through his mind the passing fancy i wonder if she would he promptly banished the infamous suggestion however reinforcing his virtue with the reflection that the chamber set was phoebes anyway and the marriage day appointed and the invitations given out and the weddingcake being baked a loaf at a time by his mother and mrs day as a matter of fact patty would have had no eyes for phoebes magnificent mahogany even had the cart that carried it passed her on the hill where she and mark wilson were walking her promise to marry him was a few weeks old now and his arm encircled her slender waist under the brown homespun cape that in itself was a new sensation and gave her the delicious sense of belonging to somebody who valued her highly and assured her of his sentiments clearly and frequently both by word and deed life dull gray life was going to change its hue for her presently and not long after she hoped for waitstill too it needed only a brighter a more dauntless courage a little faith that nettles when firmly grasped hurt the hand less and a fairer future would dawn for both of them the deacon was a sharper nettle than she had ever meddled with before but in these days when the actual contact had not yet occurred she felt sure of herself and longed for the moment when her pluck should be tested and proved the publishing of cephas and his third choice their dull walk up the aisle of the meetinghouse before an admiring throng on the sunday when phoebe would appear bride all this seemed very tame as compared with the dreams of this ardent and adventurous pair of lovers who had gone about for days harboring secrets greater and more daring they thought than had ever been breathed before within the hearing of saco water xxv loves young dreams it was not an afternoon for daydreams for there was a chill in the air and a gray sky only a week before the hills along the river might have been the walls of the new jerusalem shining like red gold now the glory had departed and it was a naked world with empty nests hanging to boughs that not long ago had been green with summer the old elm by the tavern that had been wrapped in a bright trail of scarlet woodbine was stripped almost bare of its autumn beauty here and there a maple showed a remnant of crimson and a stalwart oak had some rags of russet still clinging to its gaunt boughs the hickory trees flung out a few yellow flags from the ends of their twigs but the forests wore a tattered and dishevelled look and the withered leaves that lay in dried heaps upon the frozen ground driven hither and thither by every gust of the north wind gave the unthinking heart a throb of foreboding yet the glad summer labor of those same leaves was finished according to the law that governed them and the fruit was theirs and the seed for the coming year no breeze had been strong enough to shake them from the tree till they were ready to forsake it now they had severed the bond that had held them so tightly and fluttered down to give the earth all their seasons earnings on every hillside in every valley and glen the leaves that had made the summer landscape beautiful lay contentedly where the rain might rain upon them where the sun might shine upon them where the wind might sigh upon them and the snow might die upon them brown withered dead buried in snow they might be yet they were ministering to all the leaves of the next springtime bequeathing to them in turn the beauty that had been theirs the leafy canopies for countless song birds the grateful shade for man and beast young love thought little of natures miracles and hearts that beat high and fast were warm enough to forget the bleak wind and gathering clouds if there were naked trees were there not full barrels of apples in every cellar if there was nothing but stubble in the frozen fields why there was plenty of wheat and corn at the mill all ready for grinding the cold air made one long for a cheery home and fireside the crackle of a hearthlog the bubbling of a steaming kettle and patty and mark clung together as they walked along making bright images of a life together snug warm and happy patty was a capricious creature but all her changes were sudden and endearing ones captivating those who loved her more than a monotonous and unchanging virtue any little shower with patty always ended with a rainbow that made the landscape more enchanting than before of late her little coquetries and petulances had disappeared as if by magic she had been melted somehow from irresponsible girlhood into womanhood and that too by the ardent affection of a very ordinary young man who had no great gift save that of loving patty greatly the love had served its purpose in another way too for under its influence marks own manhood had broadened and deepened he longed to bind patty to him for good and all to capture the bright bird whose fluttering wings and burnished plumage so captured his senses and stirred his heart but his longings had changed with the quality of his love and he glowed at the thought of delivering the girl from her dreary surroundings and giving her the tenderness the ease and comfort the innocent gayety that her nature craved you wont fail me patty darling he was saying at this moment now that our plans are finally made with never a weak point any where as far as i can see my heart is so set upon carrying them out that every hour of waiting seems an age no i wont fail mark but i never know the day that father will go to town until the night before i can always hear him making his preparations in the barn and the shed and ordering waitstill here and there he is as excited as if he was going to boston instead of milltown the night before will do i will watch the house every evening till you hang a white signal from your window it wont be white said patty who would be mischievous on her deathbed my sundaygotomeetin petticoat is too grand and everything else that we have is yellow i shall see it whatever color it is you can be sure of that said mark gallantly then its decided that next morning i wait at the tavern from sunrise and whenever your father and waitstill have driven up saco hill ill come and pick you up and we be off like a streak of lightning across the hills to new hampshire how lucky that riverboro is only thirty miles from the state line it looks like snow and how i wish it would be something more than a flurry a regular whizzing whirring storm that would pack the roads and let us slip over them with our sleighbells ringing i should like that for they would be our only weddingbells oh mark what if waitstill shouldnt go after all though i heard father tell her that he needed her to buy things for the store and that they wouldnt be back till after nightfall just to think of being married without waitstill you can do without waitstill on this one occasion better than you can without me laughed mark pinching pattys cheek ive given the town clerk due notice and i have a friend to meet me at his office he is going to lend me his horse for the drive home and we shall change back the next week that will give us a fresh horse each way and well fly like the wind snow or no snow when we come down guide board hill that night patty we shall be man and wife isnt that wonderful we shall be man and wife in new hampshire but not in maine you say patty reminded him dolefully it does seem dreadful that we cant be married in our own state and have to go dangling about with this secret on our minds day and night but it cant be helped youll try not to even think of me as your wife till we go to portsmouth to live wont you youre asking too much when you say im not to think of you as my wife for i shall think of nothing else but ive given you my solemn promise said mark stoutly and ill keep it as sure as i live well be legally married by the laws of new hampshire but we wont think of it as a marriage till i tell your father and mine and we drive away once more together that time it will be in the sight of everybody with our heads in the air ive got the little house in portsmouth all ready patty its small but its in a nice part of the town portsmouth is a pretty place but itll be a great deal prettier when it has mrs mark wilson living in it we can be married over again in maine afterwards if your heart is set upon it im willing to marry you in every state of the union so far as i am concerned i think youve been so kind and good and thoughtful mark dear said patty more fondly and meltingly than she had ever spoken to him before and so clever too i do respect you for getting that good position in portsmouth and being able to set up for yourself at your age i shouldnt wonder a bit if you were a judge some day and then what a proud girl i shall be pattys praise was bestowed none too frequently and it sounded very sweet in the young mans ears i do believe i can get on with you to help me patty he said pressing her arm more closely to his side and looking down ardently into her radiant face youre a great deal cleverer than i am but i have a faculty for the business of the law so my father says and a faculty for moneymaking too and even if we have to begin in a small way my salary will be a certainty and we work up together i can see you in a yellow satin dress stiff enough to stand alone it must be white satin if you please not yellow after having used a hundred and ten yards of shopworn yellow calico on myself within two years i never want to wear that color again if only i could come to you better provided she sighed with the suggestion of tears in her voice if id been a common servant i could have saved something from my wages to be married on i havent even got anything to be married in i get you anything you want in portland tomorrow certainly not id rather be married in rags than have you spend your money upon me beforehand remember to have a box of your belongings packed and slipped under the shed somewhere you cant be certain what your father will say or do when the time comes for telling him and i want you to be ready to leave on a moments notice i will ill do everything you say mark but are you sure that we have thought of every other way i do so hate being underhanded every other way i am more than willing to ask your father but we know he would treat me with contempt for he cant bear the sight of me he would probably lock you up and feed you on bread and water that being the state of things how can i tell our plans to my own father he never would look with favor on my running away with you and mother is by nature set upon doing things handsomely and in proper order father would say our elopement would be putting us both wrong before the community and hed advise me to wait you are both young i can hear him announcing his convictions now as clearly as if he was standing here in the road you are both young and you can well afford to wait until something turns up as if we hadnt waited and waited from all eternity yes we have been engaged to be married for at least five weeks said patty with an upward glance peculiar to her own sparkling face one that always intoxicated mark i am seventeen and a half your father couldnt expect a confirmed old maid like me to waste any more time but i never would do this this sudden unrespectable thing if there was any other way everything depends on my keeping it secret from waitstill but she doesnt suspect anything yet she thinks of me as nothing but a child still do you suppose ellen would go with us just to give me a little comfort she might said mark after reflecting a moment she is very devoted to you and perhaps she could keep a secret she never has but theres always a first time you cant go on adding to the party though as if it was a candypull we cannot take lucy morrill and phoebe day and cephas cole because it would be too hard on the horse and besides i might get embarrassed at the town clerks office and marry the wrong girl or you might swop me off for cephas but ill tell ellen if you say so shes got plenty of grit dont joke about it mark dont i shouldnt miss waitstill so much if i had ellen and how happy i shall be if she approves of me for a sister and thinks your mother and father will like me in time there never was a creature born into the world that wouldnt love you patty i dont know look at aunt abby cole said patty pensively well it does not seem as if a marriage that isnt good in riverboro was really decent how tiresome of maine to want all those days of public notice people must so often want to get married in a minute if i think about anything too long i always get out of the notion i know you do thats what im afraid of and marks voice showed decided nervousness you wont get out of the notion of marrying me will you patty dear marrying you is more than a notion mark said patty soberly im only a little past seventeen but im far older because of the difficulties ive had i dont wonder you speak of my notions i was as light as a feather in all my dealings with you at first so was i with you i hadnt grown up patty then i came to know you better and see how you sympathized with waitstills troubles and mine i couldnt love anybody i couldnt marry anybody who didnt feel that things at our house cant go on as they are father has had a good long trial three wives and two daughters have done their best to live with him and failed i am not willing to die for him as my mother did nor have waitstill killed if i can help it sometimes he is like a man who has lost his senses and sometimes he is only grim and quiet and cruel if he takes our marriage without a terrible scene mark perhaps it will encourage waitstill to break her chains as i have mine theres sure to be an awful row mark said as one who had forecasted all the probabilities it wouldnt make any difference if you married the prince of wales nothing would suit your father but selecting the man and making all the arrangements and then he would never choose any one who wouldnt tend the store and work on the farm for him without wages waitstill will never run away she isnt like me she will sit and sit there slaving and suffering till doomsday for the one that loves her isnt free like you you mean ivory boynton i believe he worships the ground she walks on i like him better than i used and i understand him better oh but im a lucky young dog to have a kind liberal father and a bit of money put by to do with as i choose if i hadnt id be eating my heart out like ivory no you wouldnt eat your heart out youd always get what you wanted somehow and you wouldnt wait for it either and im just the same im not built for giving up and enduring and sacrificing im naturally just a tuft of thistledown mark but living beside waitstill all these years ive grown ashamed to be so light blowing about hither and thither i kept looking at her and borrowing some of her strength just enough to make me worthy to be her sister waitstill is like a bit of plymouth rock only its a lovely bit on the land side with earth in the crevices and flowers blooming all over it and hiding the granite oh if only she will forgive us mark i wont mind what father says or does she will forgive us patty darling dont fret and cry and make your pretty eyes all red i do nothing in all this to make either of you girls ashamed of me and ill keep your father and mine ever before my mind to prevent my being foolish or reckless for you know patty im heels over head in love with you and its only for your sake im taking all these pains and agreeing to do without my own wedded wife for weeks to come does the town clerk or does the justice of the peace give a weddingring just like the minister patty asked i shouldnt feel married without a ring the ring is all ready and has mw to pb engraved in it with the place for the date waiting and here is the engagement ring if you wear it when youre alone patty my mother gave it to me when she thought there would be something between annabel franklin and me the moment i looked at it you see its a topaz stone and noticed the yellow fire in it i said to myself it is like no one but patty baxter and if she wont wear it no other girl shall its the color of the tip ends of your curls and its just like the light in your eyes when youre making fun its heavenly cried patty it looks as if it had been made of the yellow autumn leaves and oh how i love the sparkle of it but never will i take your mothers ring or wear it mark till ive proved myself her loving dutiful daughter ill do the one wrong thing of running away with you and concealing our marriage but not another if i can help it very well sighed mark replacing the ring in his pocket with rather a crestfallen air but the first thing you know youll be too good for me patty you used to be a regular willothewisp all nonsense and fun forever laughing and teasing so that a fellow could never be sure of you for two minutes together its all there underneath said patty putting her hand on his arm and turning her wistful face up to his it will come again the girl in me isnt dead she isnt even asleep but shes all sobered down she cant laugh just now she can only smile and the tears are waiting underneath ready to spring out if any one says the wrong word this patty is frightened and anxious and her heart beats too fast from morning till night she hasnt any mother and she cannot say a word to her dear sister and shes going away to be married to you thats almost a stranger and she isnt eighteen and doesnt know whats coming to her nor what it means to be married she dreads her fathers anger and she cannot rest till she knows whether your family will love her and take her in and oh shes a miserable worried girl not a bit like the old patty mark held her close and smoothed the curls under the loose brown hood dont you fret patty darling im not the boy i was last week every word you say makes me more of a man at first i would have run away just for the joke anything to get you away from the other fellows and prove i was the best man but now im sobered down too ill do nothing rash ill be as staid as the judge you want me to be twenty years later youve made me over patty and if my love for you wasnt the right sort at first it is now i wish the road to new hampshire was full of lions and i could fight my way through them just to show you how strong i feel therell be lions enough smiled patty through her tears though they wont have manes and tails but i can imagine how father will roar and how my courage will ooze out of the heels of my boots just let me catch the deacon roaring at my wife exclaimed mark with a swelling chest now run along patty dear for i dont want you scolded on my account theres sure to be only a day or two of waiting now and i shall soon see the signal waving from your window ill sound ellen and see if shes brave enough to be one of the eloping party goodnight goodnight oh how i hope our going away will be tomorrow my dearest dearest patty winter xxvi a weddingring the snow had come it had begun to fall softly and steadily at the beginning of the week and now for days it had covered the ground deeper and deeper drifting about the little red brick house on the hilltop banking up against the barn and shrouding the sheds and the smaller buildings there had been two cold still nights the windows were covered with silvery landscapes whose delicate foliage made every pane of glass a leafy bower while a dazzling crust bediamonded the hillsides so that no eye could rest on them long without becoming snowblinded townhouse hill was not as well travelled as many others and deacon baxter had often to break his own road down to the store without waiting for the help of the village snowplough to make things easier for him many a path had waitstill broken in her time and it was by no means one of her most distasteful tasks that of shovelling into the drifts of heapedup whiteness tossing them to one side or the other and cutting a narrow cleanedged track that would pack down into the hardness of marble there were many chores to be done these cold mornings before any household could draw a breath of comfort the baxters kept but one cow in winter killed the pig not to eat but to sell and reduced the flock of hens and turkeys but waitstill was always as busy in the barn as in her own proper domain her heart yearned for all the dumb creatures about the place intervening between them and her fathers scanty care and when the thermometer descended far below zero she would be found stuffing hay into the holes and cracks of the barn and henhouse giving the horse and cow fresh beddings of straw and a mouthful of extra food between the slender meals provided by the deacon it was three oclock in the afternoon and a fire in the baxters kitchen since six in the morning had produced a fairly temperate climate in that one room though the entries and chambers might have been used for refrigerators as the deacon was as parsimonious in the use of fuel as in all other things and if his daughters had not been hardy young creatures trained from their very birth to discomforts and exposures of every sort they would have died long ago the baxter kitchen and glittered in all its accustomed cleanliness and order scrubbing and polishing were cheap amusements and nobody grudged them to waitstill no tables in riverboro were whiter no tins more lustrous no pewter brighter no brick hearths ruddier than hers the beans and brown bread and indian pudding were basking in the warmth of the old brick oven and what with the crackle and sparkle of the fire the gleam of the blue willowware on the cupboard shelves and the scarlet geraniums blooming on the sunny shelf above the sink there were few pleasanter place to be found in the village than that same baxter kitchen yet waitstill was ill at ease this afternoon she hardly knew why her father had just put the horse into the pung and driven up to millikens mills for some grain and patty was down at the store instructing bill morrill cephas coles successor in his novel task of waiting on customers and learning the whereabouts of things no easy task in the bewildering variety of stock in a country store where pins treacle gingham epsom salts indian meal shoestrings shovels brooms sulphur tobacco suspenders rum and indigo may be demanded in rapid succession patty was quiet and docile these days though her color was more brilliant than usual and her eyes had all their accustomed sparkle she went about her work steadily neither ranting nor railing at fate nor bewailing her lot but even in this waitstill felt a sense of change and difference too subtle to be put in words she had noted pattys summer flirtations but regarded them indulgently very much as if they had been the irresponsible friskings of a lamb in a meadow waitstill had more than the usual reserve in these matters for in new england at that time though the soul was a subject of daily conversation the heart was felt to be rather an indelicate topic to be alluded to as seldom as possible waitstill certainly would never have examined patty closely as to the state of her affections intimate as she was with her sisters thoughts and opinions about life she simply bided her time until patty should confide in her she had wished now and then that pattys capricious fancy might settle on philip perry although indeed when she considered it seriously it seemed like an alliance between a butterfly and an owl cephas cole she regarded as quite beneath pattys rightful ambitions and as for mark wilson she had grown up in the belief held in the village generally that he would marry money and position and drift out of riverboro into a gayer larger world her devotion to her sister was so ardent and her admiration so sincere that she could not think it possible that patty would love anywhere in vain nevertheless she had an instinct that her affections were crystallizing somewhere or other and when that happened the uncertain and eccentric temper of her father would raise a thousand obstacles while these thoughts coursed more or less vagrantly through waitstills mind she suddenly determined to get her cloak and hood and run over to see mrs boynton ivory had been away a good deal in the woods since early november chopping trees and helping to make new roads he could not go long distances like the other men as he felt constrained to come home every day or two to look after his mother and rodman but the work was too lucrative to be altogether refused with waitstills help he had at last overcome his mothers aversion to old mrs mason their nearest neighbor and she being now a widow with very slender resources went to the boyntons several times each week to put the forlorn household a little on its feet it was all uphill and down to ivorys farm waitstill reflected and she could take her sled and slide half the way going and coming or she could cut across the frozen fields on the crust she caught up her shawl from a hook on the kitchen door and throwing it over her head and shoulders to shield herself from the chill blasts on the stairway ran up to her bedroom to make herself ready for the walk she slipped on a quilted petticoat and warmer dress braided her hair freshly while her breath went out in a white cloud to meet the freezing air snatched her wraps from her closet and was just going down the stairs when she remembered that an hour before having to bind up a cut finger for her father she had searched pattys bureau drawer for an old handkerchief and had left things in disorder while she ran to answer the deacons impatient call and stamp upon the kitchen floor hurry up and dont make me stan here all winter he had shouted if you ever kept things in proper order you wouldnt have to hunt all over the house for a piece of rag when you need it patty was very dainty about her few patched and darned belongings also very exact in the adjustment of her bits of ribbon her collars of crocheted thread her adored coral pendants and her pile of neat cotton handkerchiefs hemstitched by her own hands waitstill accordingly with an exclamation at her own unwonted carelessness darted into her sisters room to replace in perfect order the articles she had disarranged in her haste she knew them all these poor little trinkets humble pathetic evidences of pattys feminine vanity and desire to make her bright beauty a trifle brighter suddenly her hand and her eye fell at the same moment on something hidden in a far corner under a white fascinator one of those headcoverings of filmy wool dotted with beads worn by the girls of the period she drew the glittering unfamiliar object forward and then lifted it wonderingly in her hand it was a string of burnished gold beads the avowed desire of pattys heart a string of beads with a brilliant little stone in the fastening and as if that were not mystery enough there was something slipped over the clasped necklace and hanging from it as waitstill held it up to the light a circlet of plain gold a weddingring waitstill stood motionless in the cold with such a throng of bewildering thoughts misgivings imaginings rushing through her head that they were like a flock of birds beating their wings against her ears the imaginings were not those of absolute dread or terror for she knew her patty if she had seen the necklace alone she would have been anxious indeed for it would have meant that the girl urged on by ungoverned desire for the ornament had accepted present from one who should not have given it to her secretly but the weddingring meant something different for patty something more something certain something unescapable for good or ill a weddingring could stand for nothing but marriage could patty be married how when and where could so great a thing happen without her knowledge it seemed impossible how had such a child surmounted the difficulties in the path had she been led away by the attractions of some stranger no there had been none in the village there was only one man who had the worldly wisdom or the means to carry patty off under the very eye of her watchful sister only one with the reckless courage to defy her father and that was mark wilson his name did not bring absolute confidence to waitstills mind he was gay and young and thoughtless how had he managed to do this wild thing and had he done all decently and wisely with consideration for the girls good name the thought of all the risks lying in the train of pattys youth and inexperience brought a wail of anguish from waitstills lips and dropping the beads and closing the drawer she stumbled blindly down the stairway to the kitchen intent upon one thought only to find her sister to look in her eyes feel the touch of her hand and assure herself of her safety she gave a dazed look at the tall clock and was beginning to put on her cloak when the door opened and patty entered the kitchen by way of the shed the usual patty rosy buoyant alert with a kind of childlike innocence that could hardly be associated with the possession of weddingrings are you going out waity wrap up well for its freezing cold waity waity dear whats the matter she cried coming closer to her sister in alarm waitstills face had lost its clear color and her eyes had the look of some dumb animal that has been struck and wounded she sank into the flagbottomed rocker by the window and leaning back her head uttered no word but closed her eyes and gave one long shivering sigh and a dry sob that seemed drawn from the very bottom of her heart xxvii the confessional waity i know what it is you have found out about me who has been wicked enough to tell you before i could do so tell me who oh patty patty cried waitstill who could no longer hold back her tears how could you deceive me so how could you shut me out of your heart and keep a secret like this from me who have tried to be mother and sister in one to you ever since the day you were born god has sent me much to bear but nothing so bitter as this to have my sister take the greatest step of her life without my knowledge or counsel stop dear stop and let me tell you all is told and not by you as it should have been weve never had anything separate from each other in all our lives and when i looked in your bureau drawer for a bit of soft cotton it was nothing more than i have done a hundred times you can guess now what i stumbled upon a weddingring for a hand i have held ever since it was a babys my sister has a husband and i am not even sure of his name waity waity dont take it so to heart and patty flung herself on her knees beside waitstills chair not till you hear everything when i tell you all you will dry your eyes and smile and be happy about me and you will know that in the whole world there is no one else in my love or my life but you and my my husband who is the husband asked waitstill dryly as she wiped her eyes and leaned her elbow on the table who could it be but mark has there ever been any one but mark i should have said that there were several in these past few months waitstills tone showed clearly that she was still grieved and hurt beyond her power to conceal i have never thought of marrying any one but mark and not even of marrying him till a little while ago said patty now do not draw away from me and look out of the window as if we were not sisters or you will break my heart turn your eyes to mine and believe in me waity while i tell you everything as i have so longed to do all these nights and days mark and i have loved each other for a long long time it was only play at first but we were young and foolish and did not understand what was really happening between us you are both of you only a few months older than when you were young and foolish objected waitstill yes we are years and years five weeks ago i promised mark that i would marry him but how was i ever to keep my word publicly you have noticed how insultingly father treats him of late passing him by without a word when he meets him in the street you remember too that he has never gone to lawyer wilson for advice or put any business in his hands since spring the wilsons are among fathers aversions that is all you can say it is no use to try and explain them or rebel against them waitstill answered wearily that is all very well and might be borne like many another cross but i wanted to marry this particular aversion argued patty would you have helped me to marry mark secretly if i had confided in you never in the world never i knew it exclaimed patty triumphantly we both said so and what was mark to do he was more than willing to come up here and ask for me like a man but he knew that he would be ordered off the premises as if he were a thief that would have angered mr and mrs wilson and made matters worse we talked and talked until we were hoarse we thought and thought until we nearly had brain fever from thinking but there seemed to be no way but to take the bull by the horns you are both so young you could well have bided awhile we could have bided until we were gray nothing would have changed father and just lately i couldnt make mark bide confessed patty ingenuously he has been in a rage about fathers treatment of you and me he knows we havent the right food to eat nothing fit to wear and not an hour of peace or freedom he has even heard the men at the store say that our very lives might be in danger if we crossed fathers will or angered him beyond a certain point you cant blame a man who loves a girl if he wants to take her away from such a wretched life his love would be good for nothing if he did not long to rescue her i would never have left you behind to bear your slavery alone while i slipped away to happiness and comfort not for any man alive would i i have done it this speech so unlike waitstill in its ungenerous reproach was repented of as soon as it left her tongue oh i did not mean that my darling she cried i would have welcomed any change for you and thanked god for it if only it could have come honorably and aboveboard but dont you see waity how my marriage helps everything that is what makes me happiest that now i shall have a home and it can be yours father has plenty of money and can get a housekeeper he is only sixtyfive and as hale and hearty as a man can be you have served your time and surely you need not be his drudge for the rest of your life mark and i thought you would spend half the year with us waitstill waived this point as too impossible for discussion when and where were you married patty she asked in allentown new hampshire last monday the day you and father went to saco ellen went with us you neednt suppose it was much fun for me girls that think running away to be married is nothing but a lark do not have to deceive a sister like you nor have a father such as mine to reckon with afterwards you thought of all that before didnt you child nobody that hasnt already run away to be married once or twice could tell how it was going to feel never did i pass so unhappy a day if mark was not everything that is kind and gentle he would have tipped me out of the sleigh into a snowbank and left me by the roadside to freeze i might have been murdered instead of only married by the way i behaved but mark and ellen understood then the very next day marks father sent him up to bridgton on business and he had to go to allentown first to return a friends horse so he couldnt break the news to father at once as he intended does a new hampshire marriage hold good in maine asked waitstill still intent on the bare facts at the bottom of the romance well of course stammered patty somewhat confused maine has her own way of doing things and wouldnt be likely to fancy new hampshires but nothing can make it wicked or anything but according to law besides mark considered all the difficulties he is wonderfully clever and he has a clerkship in a portsmouth law office waiting for him and thats where we are going to live in new hampshire where we were married and my darling sister will come soon and stay months and months with us when is mark coming back to arrange all this late tonight or early tomorrow morning where did you go after you were married where did i go echoed patty in a childish burst of tears where could i go it took all day to be married all day long working and driving hard from sunrise to seven oclock in the evening then when we reached the bridge mark dropped me and i walked up home in the dark and went to bed without any supper for fear that you and father would come back and catch me at it and ask why i was so late my poor foolish dear sighed waitstill pattys tears flowed faster at the first sound of sympathy in waitstills voice for selfpity is very enfeebling she fairly sobbed as she continued so my only weddingjourney was the freezing drive back from allentown with ellen crying all the way and wishing that she hadnt gone with us mark and i both say well never be married again so long as we live where have you seen your husband from that day to this i havent laid eyes on him said patty with a fresh burst of woe i have a certificatething and a weddingring and a beautiful frock and hat that mark bought in boston but no real husband im no more married than ever i was dont you remember i said that mark was sent away on tuesday morning and this is thursday ive had three letters from him but i dont know till we see how father takes it when we can tell the wilsons and start for portsmouth we shant really call ourselves married till we get to portsmouth we promised each other that from the first it isnt much like being a bride never to see your bridegroom to have a father who will fly into a passion when he hears that you are married not to know whether your new family will like or despise you and to have your only sister angered with you for the first time in her life waitstills heart melted and she lifted pattys tearstained face to hers and kissed it well dear i would not have had you do this for the world but it is done and mark seems to have been as wise as a man can be when he does an unwise thing you are married and you love each other thats the comforting thing to me we do sobbed patty no two people ever loved each other better than we but its been all spoiled for fear of father i must say i dread to have him hear the news and waitstill knitted her brows anxiously i hope it may be soon and i think i ought to be here when he is told mark will never understand or bear with him and there may be trouble that i could avert ill be here too and im not afraid and patty raised her head defiantly father can unmarry us thats why we acted in this miserable secret underhanded way somehow though i havent seen mark since we went to allentown i am braver than i was last week for now ive got somebody to take my part ive a good mind to go upstairs and put on my gold beads and my weddingring just to get used to them and to feel a little more married no i cant after all for there is father driving up the hill now and he may come into the house what brings him home at this hour i was expecting him every moment and waitstill rose and stirred the fire he took the pung and went to the mills for grain he hasnt anything in the back of the pung and oh waity he is standing up now and whipping the horse with all his might i never saw him drive like that before what can be the matter he cant have seen my weddingring and only three people in all the world know about my being married waitstill turned from the window her heart beating a little faster what three people know three hundred are likely to know sooner or later it may be a false alarm but father is in a fury about something he must not be told the news until he is in a better humor xxviii patty is shown the door deacon baxter drove into the barn and flinging a blanket over the wheezing horse closed the door behind him and hurried into the house without even thinking to lay down his whip opening the kitchen door and stopping outside long enough to kick the snow from his heavy boots he strode into the kitchen and confronted the two girls he looked at them sharply before he spoke scanning their flushed faces and tearstained eyes then he broke out savagely oh youre both here thats lucky now stan up and answer to me whats this i hear at the mills about patience common talk outside the store the time had come then and by some strange fatality when mark was too far away to be of service tell me what you heard father and i can give you a better answer patty replied hedging to gain time and shaking inwardly bill morrill says his brother that works in new hampshire reports you as ridin through the streets of allentown last monday with a young man there seemed but one reply to this so patty answered tremblingly he says whats true i was there what and it was plain from the deacons voice that he had really disbelieved the rumor a whirlwind of rage swept through him and shook him from head to foot do you mean to stan there an own up to me that you was thirty miles away from home with a young man he shouted if you ask me a plain question ive got to tell you the truth father i was how dare you carry on like that and drag my name into scandal you worthless trollop you who went along with you ill skin the hide off him whoever t was patty remained mute at this threat but waitstill caught her hand and whispered tell him all dear its got to come out be brave and i stand by you why are you interferin and puttin in your meddlesome oar the deacon said turning to waitstill the girl would never a been there if youd attended to your business shes nothin but a fool of a young filly an youre an old carthorse it was your job to look out for her as your mother told you to anybody might a guessed she needed watchin you shall not call my sister an old carthorse ill not permit it cried patty plucking up courage in her sisters defence and as usual comporting herself a trifle more like a spitfire than a true heroine of tragedy hush patty let him call me anything that he likes it makes no difference at such a time waitstill knew nothing of my going away till this afternoon continued patty i kept it secret from her on purpose because i was afraid she would not approve i went with mark wilson and and i married him in new hampshire because we couldnt do it at home without everybodys knowledge now you know all do you mean to tell me youve gone an married that reckless wuthless horsetrottin cardplayin sneak of a wilson boy thats courted every girl in town married the son of a man that has quarrelled with me and insulted me in public by the lord harry ill crack this whip over your shoulders once before im done with you if id used it years ago you might have been an honest woman today instead of a foxwell baxter had wholly lost control of himself and the temper that had never been governed or held in check lashed itself into a fury that made him for the moment unaccountable for his words or actions waitstill took a step forward in front of patty put down that whip father or ill take it from you and break it across my knee her eyes blazed and she held her head high youve made me do the work of a man and thank god ive got the muscle of one dont lift a finger to patty or i defend her i promise you the dinnerhorn is in the side entry and two blasts will bring uncle bart up the hill but id rather not call him unless you force me to the deacons grasp on the whip relaxed and he fell back a little in sheer astonishment at the bravado of the girl ordinarily so quiet and selfcontained he was speechless for a second and then recovered breath enough to shout to the terrified patty i wont use the whip till i hear whether youve got any excuse for your scandalous behavior hear me tell you one thing this little pleasuretrip o yourn wont do you no good for i break the marriage i wont have a wilson in my family if i have to empty a shotgun into him but your lies and your low streets are so beyond reason i cant believe my ears whats your excuse i say stop a minute patty before you answer and let me say a few things that ought to have been said before now interposed waitstill if patty has done wrong father youve no one but yourself to thank for it and its only by gods grace that nothing worse has happened to her what could you expect from a young thing like that with her merry heart turned into a lump in her breast every day by your cruelty did she deceive you well youve made her afraid of you ever since she was a baby in the cradle drawing the covers over her little head when she heard your step whatever crop you sow is bound to come up father thats natures law and gods as well you hold your tongue you readin the law to your elders an betters said the old man choking with wrath my business is with this wuthless sister o yourn not with you youve got your coat and hood on miss so you jest clear out o the house an if youre too slow about it ill help you along ive no kind of an idea youre rightly married for that young wilson sneak couldnt pay so high for you as all that but if it amuses you to call him your husband go an find him an stay with him this is an honest house an no place for such as you patty had a good share of the baxter temper not under such control as waitstills and the blood mounted into her face you shall not speak to me so she said intrepidly while keeping a discreet eye on the whip im not a a caterpillar to be stepped on im a married woman as right as a new hampshire justice can make me with a weddingring and a certificate to show if need be and you shall not call my husband names time will tell what he is going to be and thats a soninlaw any true father would be proud to own why are you set against this match father argued waitstill striving to make him hear reason patty has married into one of the best families in the village mark is gay and thoughtless but never has he been seen the worse for liquor and never has he done a thing for which a wife need hang her head it is something for a young fellow of fourandtwenty to be able to provide for a wife and keep her in comfort and when all is said and done it is a true lovematch patty seized this inopportune moment to forget her fathers presence and the tragic nature of the occasion and in her usual impetuous fashion flung her arms around waitstills neck and gave her the hug of a young bear my own dear sister she said i dont mind anything so long as you stand up for us dont make her go tonight father pleaded waitstill dont send your own child out into the cold remember her husband is away from home she can find another up at the mills as good as he is or better off with you i say you trumpery little baggage you go then dear it is better so uncle bart will keep you overnight run up and get your things and waitstill sank into a chair realizing the hopelessness of the situation she not take anything from my house its her husbands business to find her in clothes theyll be better ones than ever you found me was pattys response no heroics for her no fainting fits at being disowned no hysterics at being turned out of house and home no prayers for mercy but a quick retort for every gibe from her father and her defiant attitude enraged the deacon the more i wont speak again he said in a tone that could not be mistaken into the street you go with the clothes you stand up in or i do what i said id do go patty its the only thing to be done dont tremble for nobody shall touch a hair of your head i can trust you to find shelter tonight and mark will take care of you tomorrow patty buttoned her shabby coat and tied on her hood as she walked from the kitchen through the sittingroom towards the side door her heart heaving with shame and anger and above all with a childs sense of helplessness at being parted from her sister dont tell the neighbors any more lies than you can help called her father after her retreating form an if any of em dare to come up here an give me any of their imperdence theyll be treated same as you come back here waitstill and dont go to slobberin any goodbyes over her she aint likely to get out o the village for some time if shes expectin mark wilson to take her away i shall certainly go to the door with my sister said waitstill coldly suiting the action to the word and following patty out on the steps shall you tell uncle bart everything dear and ask him to let you sleep at his house both girls were trembling with excitement waitstill pale as a ghost patty flushed and tearful with defiant eyes and lips that quivered rebelliously i spose so she answered dolefully though aunt abby hates me on account of cephas id rather go to dr perrys but i dont like to meet phil there doesnt seem to be any good place for me but it s only for a night and you not let father prevent your seeing mark and me tomorrow will you are you afraid to stay alone i sit on the steps all night if you say the word no no run along father has vented his rage upon you and i shall not have any more trouble god bless and keep you darling run along and youre not angry with me now waity you still love me and youll forgive mark and come to stay with us soon soon soon well see dear when all this unhappy business is settled and you are safe and happy in your own home i shall have much to tell you when we meet tomorrow xxix waitstill speaks her mind patty had the most ardent love for her elder sister and something that resembled reverence for her unselfishness her loyalty and her strength of character but if the truth were told she had no great opinion of waitstills ability to feel righteous wrath nor of her power to avenge herself in the face of rank injustice it was the conviction of her own superior finesse and audacity that had sustained patty all through her late escapade she felt herself a lucky girl indeed to achieve liberty and happiness for herself but doubly lucky if she had chanced to open a way of escape for her more docile and dutiful sister she would have been a trifle astonished had she surmised the existence of certain mysterious waves that had been sweeping along the coasts of waitstills mind that afternoon breaking down all sorts of defences and carrying her will along with them by sheer force but it is a truism that two human beings can live beside each other for half a century and yet continue strangers pattys elopement with the youth of her choice taking into account all its attendant risks was indeed an exhibition of courage and initiative not common to girls of seventeen but waitstill was meditating a mutiny more daring yet a mutiny too involving a course of conduct most unusual in maidens of puritan descent she walked back into the kitchen to find her father sitting placidly in the rockingchair by the window he had lighted his corncob pipe in which he always smoked a mixture of dried sweetfern as being cheaper than tobacco and his face wore something resembling a smile a foxy smile as he watched his youngestborn ploughing down the hill through the deep snow while the more obedient waitstill moved about the room setting supper on the table conversation was not the deacons forte but it seemed proper for some one to break the ice that seemed suddenly to be very thick in the immediate vicinity that little jillgoovertheground will give the neighbors a pleasant evenin tellin em bout me he chuckled aunt abby cole will run the streets o the three villages by sunup tomorrer but nobody pays any tention to a woman whose tongue is hung in the middle and wags at both ends i want intending to use the whip on your sister waitstill continued the deacon with a crafty look at his silent daughter though a trouncin would a done her a sight o good but i was only tryin to frighten her a little mite an pay her up for bringin disgrace on us the way shes done makin us the talk o the town well shes gone an good riddance to bad rubbish say i one less mouth to feed an one less body to clothe youll miss her jest at first on account o there bein no other womenfolks on the hill but t wont last long ill have bill morrill do some o your outside chores so t you can take on your sisters work if she ever done any this was a most astoundingly generous proposition on the deacons part and to tell the truth he did not himself fully understand his mental processes when he made it but it seemed to be drawn from him by a kind of instinct that he was not standing well in his elder daughters books though the two girls had never made any demonstration of their affection in his presence he had a fair idea of their mutual dependence upon each other not that he placed the slightest value on waitstills opinion of him or cared in the smallest degree what she or any one else in the universe thought of his conduct but she certainly did appear to advantage when contrasted with the pert little hussy who had just left the premises also waitstill loomed large in his household comforts and economies having a clear head a sure hand and being one of the steadygoing reliable sort that can be counted on in emergencies not like patty going off at halfcock at the smallest provocation yes waitstill as a product of his masterly training for the last seven years had settled down not without some trouble and friction into a tolerably dependable packhorse and he intended in the future to use some care in making permanent so valuable an aid and ally she did not pursue nor attract the opposite sex as his younger daughter apparently did so by continuing his policy of keeping all young men rigidly at a distance he could count confidently on having waitstill serve his purposes for the next fifteen or twenty years or as long as he himself should continue to ornament and enrich the earth he would go to saco the very next day and cut patty out of his will arranging his property so that waitstill should be the chief legatee as long as she continued to live obediently under his roof he intended to make the last point clear if he had to consult every lawyer in york county for he wouldnt take risks on any woman alive if he must leave his money anywhere and it was with a bitter pang that he faced the inexorable conviction that he could neither live forever nor take his savings with him to the realms of bliss prepared for members of the orthodox church in good and regular standing if he must leave his money behind him he would dig a hole in the ground and bury it rather than let it go to any one who had angered him in his lifetime these were the thoughts that caused him to relax his iron grip and smile as he sat by the window smoking his corncob pipe and taking one of his very rare periods of rest presently he glanced at the clock its only quarterpast four he said i thought t was later but the snow makes it so light you cant jedge the time the moon fulls tonight dont it yes come to think of it i know it does aint you settin out supper a little mite early wait still this was a longer and more amiable speech than he had made in years but waitstill never glanced at him as she said it is a little early but i want to get it ready before i leave be you goin out mind i wont have you follerin patience round youll only upset what ive done an anyhow i want you to keep away from the neighbors for a few days till all this blows over he spoke firmly though for him mildly for he still had the uneasy feeling that he stood on the brink of a volcano and as a matter of fact he tumbled into it the very next moment the meagre supper was spread a plate of cold soda biscuits a driedapple pie and the usual brown teapot were in evidence and as her father ceased speaking waitstill opened the door of the brick oven where the beanpot reposed set a chair by the table and turning took up her coat her mothers old ridingcloak it was and calmly put it on reaching then for her hood and her squirrel tippet you are goin out then spite o what i said the deacon inquired sternly did you really think father that i would sleep under your roof after you had turned my sister out into the snow to lodge with whoever might take her in my seventeen yearoldsister that your wife left to my care my little sister the very light of my life waitstills voice trembled a trifle but otherwise she was quite calm and free from heroics of any sort the deacon looked up in surprise i guess youre kind o hystericky he said set down set down an talk things over i aint got nothin agin you an i mean to treat you right set down the old man was decidedly nervous and intended to keep his temper until there was a safer chance to let it fly waitstill sat down theres nothing to talk over she said i have done all that i promised my stepmother the night she died and now i am going if theres a duty owed between daughter and father it ought to work both ways i consider that i have done my share and now i intend to seek happiness for myself i have never had any and i am starving for it an youd leave me to git on the best i can after what ive done for you burst out the deacon still trying to hold down his growing passion you gave me my life and im thankful to you for that but youve given me little since father haint i fed an clothed you no more than i have fed and clothed you youve provided the raw food and ive cooked and served it youve bought and i have made shirts and overalls and coats for you and knitted your socks and comforters and mittens not only have i toiled and saved and scrimped away my girlhood as you bade me but ive earned for you who made the butter and took care of the hens and dried the apples and drew in the rugs who raised and ground the peppers for sale and tended the geese that you might sell the feathers no father i dont consider that im in your debt xxx a clash of wills deacon foxwell baxter was completely nonplussed for the first time in his life he had never allowed argyfyin in his household and there had never been a clash of wills before this when he had not come off swiftly and brutally triumphant this situation was complicated by the fact that he did not dare to apply the brakes as usual since there were more issues involved than ever before he felt too stunned to deal properly with this daughter having emptied all the vials of his wrath upon the other one and being in consequence somewhat enfeebled it was always easy enough to cope with patty for her impertinence evoked such rage that the argument took care of itself but this grave young woman was a different matter there she sat composedly on the edge of her wooden chair her head lifted high her color coming and going her eyes shining steadily like fixed stars there she sat calmly announcing her intention of leaving her father to shift for himself yet the skies seemed to have no thought of falling he felt that he must make another effort to assert his authority now you take off your coat he said the pipe in his hand trembling as he stirred nervously in his chair you take your coat right off an set down to the suppertable same as usual do you hear eat your victuals an then go to your bed an git over this crazy fit that patience has started workin in you no more nonsense now do as i tell you i have made up my mind father and its no use arguing all who try to live with you fail sooner or later you have had four children father one boy ran away the other did not mind being drowned i fear since life was so hard at home you have just turned the third child out for a sin of deceit and disobedience she would never have committed for her nature is as clear as crystal if you had ever loved her or considered her happiness so i have done with you unless in your old age god should bring you to such a pass that no one else will come to your assistance then id see somehow that you were cared for and nursed and made comfortable you are not an old man you are strong and healthy and you have plenty of money to get a good housekeeper i should decide differently perhaps if all this were not true you lie i havent got plenty of money and the deacon struck the table a sudden blow that made the china in the cupboard rattle youve no notion what this house costs me an the feed for the stock an you two girls an labor at the store an the hayfield an the taxes an insurance ive slaved from sunrise to sunset but i aint hardly been able to lay up a cent i spose the neighbors have been fillin you full o tales about my misable little savins an makin em into a fortune well you wont git any of em i promise you that you have plenty laid away everybody knows so whats the use of denying it anyway i dont want a penny of your money father so goodbye theres enough cooked to keep you for a couple of days and waitstill rose from her chair and drew on her mittens father and daughter confronted each other the secret fury of the man met by the steady determination of the girl the deacon was baffled almost awed by waitstills quiet selfcontrol but at the very moment that he was halfuncomprehendingly glaring at her it dawned upon him that he was beaten and that she was mistress of the situation where would she go what were her plans for definite plans she had or she could not meet his eye with so resolute a gaze if she did leave him how could he contrive to get her back again and so escape the scorn of the village the averted look the lessened trade where are you goin now he asked and though he tried his best he could not for the life of him keep back one final taunt i spose like your sister youve got a man in your eye he chose this to him impossible suggestion as being the most insulting one that he could invent at the moment i have replied waitstill a man in my eye and in my heart we should have been husband and wife before this had we not been kept apart by obstacles too stubborn for us to overcome my way has chanced to open first though it was none of my contriving had the roof fallen in upon him the deacon could not have been more dumbfounded his tongue literally clove to the roof of his mouth his face fell and his mean piercing eyes blinked under his shaggy brows as if seeking light waitstill stirred the fire closed the brick oven and put the teapot on the back of the stove hung up the longhandled dipper on its accustomed nail over the sink and went to the door her father collected his scattered wits and pulled himself to his feet by the arms of the highbacked rocker you shant step outside this room till you tell me where youre goin he said when he found his voice i have no wish to keep it secret i am going to see if mrs mason will keep me tonight tomorrow i shall walk down river and get work at the mills but on my way i shall stop at the boyntons to tell ivory i am ready to marry him as soon as hes ready to take me this was enough to stir the blood of the deacon into one last fury i might have guessed it if i hadnt been blind as a bat an deaf as an adder and he gave the table another ringing blow before he leaned on it to gather strength of course it would be one o that crazy boynton crew youd take up with he roared nothin would suit either o you girls but choosin the biggest enemies ive got in the whole village youve never taken pains to make anything but enemies so what could we do you might as well go to live on the poorfarm aaron boynton was a disreptable hound lois boynton is as crazy as a loon the boy is a nobodys child an ivorys no better than a common pauper ivorys a brave strong honorable man and a scholar too i can work for him and help him earn and save as i have you how longs this been goin on the deacon was choking but he meant to get to the bottom of things while he had the chance it has not gone on at all he has never said a word to me and i have always obeyed your will in these matters but you cant hide love any more than you can hide hate i know ivory loves me so im going to tell him that my duty is done here and i am ready to help him goin to throw yourself at his head be you sneered the deacon by the lord i don know where you two girls got these loose ways o thinkin an acting mebbe he wont take you an then wherell you be you wont git under my roof again when youve once left it you can make up your mind to that if you have any doubts about ivorys being willing to take me youd better drive along behind me and listen while i ask him waitstills tone had an exultant thrill of certainty in it she threw up her head glorying in what she was about to do if she laid aside her usual reserve and voiced her thoughts openly it was not in the hope of convincing her father but for the bliss of putting them into words and intoxicating herself by the sound of them come after me if you will father and watch the welcome i shall get oh i have no fear of being turned out by ivory boynton i can hardly wait to give him the joy i shall be bringing it s selfish to rob him of the chance to speak first but i do it and before deacon baxter could cross the room waitstill was out of the kitchen door into the shed and flying down townhouse hill like an arrow shot free from the bow the deacon followed close behind hardly knowing why but he was no match for the girl and at last he stood helpless on the steps of the shed shaking his fist and hurling terrible words after her words that it was fortunate for her peace of mind she could not hear a curse upon you both he cried savagely not satisfied with disobeyin an defyin me youve put me to shame an now youll be settin the neighbors agin me an ruinin my trade if you was freezin in the snow i wouldnt heave a blanket to you if you was starvin i wouldnt fling either of you a crust never shall you darken my doors again an never shall you git a penny o my money not if i have to throw it into the river to spite you here his breath failed and he stumbled out into the barn whimpering between his broken sentences like a whipped child here i am with nobody to milk nor feed the hens nobody to churn tomorrow nor do the chores a poor misable creeter deserted by my children with nobody to do a hands turn thout bein paid for every step they take i give em what they deserve i don know what but ill be even with em yet and the deacon set his baxter jaw in a way that meant his determination to stop at nothing xxxi sentry duty ivory boynton drove home from the woods that same afternoon by way of the bridge in order to buy some provisions at the brick store when he was still a long distance from the bars that divided the lane from the highroad he espied a darkclad little speck he knew to be rodman leaning over the fence waiting and longing as usual for his homecoming and his heart warmed at the thought of the boyish welcome that never failed the sleigh slipped quickly over the hardpacked shining road and the bells rang merrily in the clear cold air giving out a joyous sound that had no echo in ivorys breast that day he had just had a vision of happiness through another mans eyes was he always to stand outside the banquetingtable he wondered and see others feasting while he hungered now the little speck bounded from the fence flew down the road to meet the sleigh and jumped in by the drivers side i knew youd come tonight rodman cried eagerly i told aunt boynton youd come how is she well as common no not a bit well since yesterday morning but mrs mason says its nothing worse than a cold mrs mason has just gone home and weve had a grand housecleaning today shes washed and ironed and baked and weve put aunt boynton in clean sheets and pillowcases and her rooms nice and warm and i carried the eat in and put it on her bed to keep her company while i came to watch for you aunt boynton let mrs mason braid her hair and seemed to like her brushing it its been dreadful lonesome and oh i am glad you came back ivory did you find any more spruce gum where you went this time pounds and pounds rod enough to bring me in nearly a hundred dollars i chanced on the greatest place ive found yet i followed the wake of an old whirlwind that had left long furrows in the forest ive told you how the thing works and i tracked its course by the gum that had formed wherever the trees were wounded its hard lonely work rod but it pays well if i could have been there maybe we could have got more im good at shinning up trees yes sometime we go gumpicking together well climb the trees like a couple of cats and take our knives and serape off the precious lumps that are worth so much money to the druggists youve let down the bars i see cause i knew youd come tonight said rodman i felt it in my bones were going to have a splendid supper are we thats good news ivory tried to make his tone bright and interested though his heart was like a lump of lead in his breast its the least i can do for the poor little chap he thought when he stays as caretaker in this lonely spot i wonder if i hadnt better drive into the barn rod and leave the harness on nick till i go in and see mother guess i will shes hot aunt boynton is hot and restless but mrs mason thinks thats all ivory found his mother feverish and her eyes were unnaturally bright but she was clear in x mind and cheerful too sitting up in bed to r breathe the better while the maltese eat snuggled under her arm and purred peacefully the cat is rods idea she said smilingly but in a very weak voice he is a great nurse i should never have thought of the eat myself but she gives me more comfort than all the medicine ivory and rodman drew up to the supper table already set in the kitchen but before ivory took his seat he softly closed the door that led into the livingroom they ate their beans and brown bread and the mince pie that had been the splendid feature of the meal as reported by the boy and when they had finished and rodman was clearing the table ivory walked to the window lighting his pipe the while and stood soberly looking out on the snowy landscape one could scarcely tell it was twilight with such sweeps of whiteness to catch every gleam of the dying day drop work a minute and come here rod he said at length can you keep a secret course i can im chock full of em now and nobody could dig one of em out o me with a pickaxe oh well if youre full you naturally couldnt hold another i could try to squeeze it in if its a nice one coaxed the boy i dont know whether you think its a nice one rod for it breaks up one of your plans im not sure myself how nice it is but its a very big unexpected startling one what do you think your favorite patty has gone and got married patty married cried rod then hastily putting his hand over his mouth to hush his tooloud speaking yes she and mark wilson ran away last monday drove over to allentown new hampshire and were married without telling a soul deacon baxter discovered everything this afternoon like the old fox that he is and turned patty out of the house mean old skinflint exclaimed rod excitedly all the incipient manhood rising in his tenyearold breast is she gone to live with the wilsons the wilsons dont know yet that mark is married to her but i met him driving like jehu just after i had left patty and told him everything that had happened and did my best to cool him down and keep him from murdering his new fatherinlaw by showing him it would serve no real purpose now did he look married and all different asked rod curiously yes he did and more like a man than ever he looked before in his life we talked everything over together and he went home at once to break the news to his family without even going to take a peep at patty i couldnt bear to have them meet till he had something cheerful to say to the poor little soul when i met her by uncle barts shop she was trudging along in the snow like a draggled butterfly and crying like a baby sympathetic tears dimmed rodmans eyes i cant bear to see girls cry ivory i just cant bear it especially patty neither can i rod i came pretty near wiping her eyes but pulled up remembering she wasnt a child but a married lady well now we come to the point isnt pattys being married the point no only part of it pattys being sent away from home leaves waitstill alone with the deacon do you see and if patty is your favorite waitstill is mine i might as well own up to that shes mine too cried rod theyre both my favorites but i always thought patty was the suitablest for me to marry if shed wait for me waitstill is too grand for a boy shes too grand for anybody rod there isnt a man alive thats worthy to strap on her skates well shes too grand for anybody except and here rods shy wistful voice trailed off into discreet silence now i had some talk with patty and she thinks waitstill will have no trouble with her father just at present she says he lavished so much rage upon her that therell be none left for anybody else for a day or two and moreover that he will never dare to go too far with waitstill because shes so useful to him im not afraid of his beating or injuring her so long as he keeps his sober senses if hes ever rightly had any but i dont like to think of his upbraiding her and breaking her heart with his cruel talk just after shes lost the sister thats been her only companion and ivorys hand trembled as he filled his pipe he had no confidant but this quaint tenderhearted oldfashioned little lad to whom he had grown to speak his mind as if he were a man of his own age and rod in the same way had gradually learned to understand and sympathize its dreadful lonesome on townhouse hill said the boy in a hushed tone dreadful lonesome echoed ivory with a sigh and i dont dare leave mother until her fever dies down a bit and she sleeps now do you remember the night that she was taken ill and we shared the watch rodman held his breath do you mean you re going to let me help just as if i was big he asked speaking through a great lump in his throat there are only two of us rod youre rather young for this piece of work but youre trusty you re trusty am i to keep watch on the deacon thats it and this is my plan nick will have had his feed you re to drive to the bridge when it gets a little darker and hitch in uncle barts horseshed covering nick well youre to go into the brick store and while youre getting some groceries wrapped up listen to anything the men say to see if they know whats happened when youve hung about as long as you dare leave your bundle and say youll call in again for it then see if baxters store is open i dont believe it will be and if it isnt look for a light in his kitchen window and prowl about till you know that waitstill and the deacon have gone up to their bedrooms then go to uncle barts and find out if patty is there rods eyes grew bigger and bigger shall i talk to her he asked and whatll i say no just ask if shes there if shes gone mark has made it right with his family and taken her home if she hasnt why god knows how that matter will be straightened out anyhow she has a husband now and he seems to value her and waitstill is alone on the top of that windswept hill ill go ill remember everything cried rodman in the seventh heaven of delight at the responsibilities ivory was heaping upon him dont stay beyond eight oclock but come back and tell me everything youve learned then if mother grows no worse ill walk back to uncle barts shop and spend the night there just just to be near thats all you couldnt hear waitstill even if she called rod said couldnt i a mans ears are very sharp under certain circumstances i believe if waitstill needed help i could hear her breathe besides i shall be up and down the hill till i know alls well and at sunrise i go up and hide behind some of baxters buildings till i see him get his breakfast and go to the store now wash your dishes and ivory caught up his cap from a hook behind the door are you going to the barn asked rodman no only down to the gate for a minute mark said that if he had a good chance hed send a boy with a note and get him to put it under the stone gatepost its too soon to expect it perhaps but i cant seem to keep still rodman tied a gingham apron round his waist carried the teakettle to the sink and poured the dishpan full of boiling water then dipped the cups and plates in and out wiped them and replaced them on the table gave the beanplatter a special polish and set the half mince pie and the butterdish in the cellarway a boy has to do most everything in this family he sighed to himself i dont mind washing dishes except the nasty fryingpan and the sticky beanpot but what im going to do tonight is different here he glowed and tingled with anticipation i know what they call it in the storybooks its sentry duty and thats braver work for a boy than dishwashing which however depends a good deal upon circumstances and somewhat on the point of view xxxii the house of aaron a feeling that the day was to bring great things had dawned upon waitstill when she woke that morning and now it was coming true climbing saco hill was like climbing the hill of her dreams life and love beckoned to her across the snowy slopes at rest about pattys future though troubled as to her sorry plight at the moment she was conscious chiefly of her newborn freedom she revelled in the keen air that tingled against her cheek and drew in fresh hope with every breath as she trod the shining pathway she was full of expectancy her eyes dancing her heart as buoyant as her step not a vestige of confusion or uncertainty vexed her mind she knew ivory for her true mate and if the way to him took her through dark places it was lighted by a steadfast beacon of love at the top of the hill she turned the corner breathlessly and faced the length of road that led to the boynton farm mrs masons house was beyond and oh how she hoped that ivory would be at home and that she need not wait another day to tell him all and claim the gift she knew was hers before she asked it she might not have the same exaltation tomorrow for now there were no levels in her heart and soul she had a sense of mounting from height to height and lighting fires on every peak of her being she took no heed of the road she was travelling she was conscious only of a wonderful inward glow the house was now in sight and a tall figure was issuing from the side door putting on a fur cap as it came out on the steps and down the lane ivory was at home then and best of all he was unconsciously coming to meet her although their hearts had been coming to meet each other she thought ever since they first began to beat as she neared the bars she called ivorys name his hands were in the pockets of his greatcoat and his eyes were fixed on the ground sombre he was distinctly sombre in mien and gait could she make him smile and flush and glow as she was smiling and flushing and glowing as he heard her voice he raised his head quickly and uncomprehendingly dont come any nearer she said until i have told you something his mind had been so full of her that the sight of her in the flesh standing twenty feet away bewildered him she took a few steps nearer the gate near enough now for him to see her rosy face framed in a blue hood and to catch the brightness of her eyes under their lovely lashes ordinarily they were cool and limpid and grave waitstills eyes now a sunbeam danced in each of them and her lips almost always tightly closed as if she were holding back her natural speech her lips were red and parted and the soul of her free at last shone through her face making it luminous with a new beauty i have left home for good and all she said ill tell you more of this later on but i have left my fathers house with nothing to my name but the clothes i stand in i am going to look for work in the mills tomorrow but i stopped here to say that im ready to marry you whenever you want me if you do want me ivory was bewildered indeed but not so much so that he failed to apprehend and instantly too the real significance of this speech he took a couple of long strides and before waitstill had any idea of his intentions he vaulted over the bars and gathered her in his arms never shall you go to the mills never shall you leave my sight for a single hour again my onewomaninalltheworld come to me to be loved and treasured all your life long ive worshipped you ever since i was a boy ive kept my heart swept and garnished for you and no other hoping i might win you at last how glorious to hear all this delicious poetry of love and to feel ivorys arms about her making the dream seem surer oh how like you to shorten the time of my waiting he went on his words fairly chasing one another in their eagerness to be spoken how like you to count on me to guess my hunger for your love to realize the chains that held me back and break them yourself with your own dear womanly hands how like you oh wonderful waitstill ivory went on murmuring phrases that had been lying in his heart unsaid for years scarcely conscious of what he was saying realizing only that the miracle of miracles had happened waitstill for her part was almost dumb with joy to be lying so close to his heart that she could hear it beating to feel the passionate tenderness of his embrace and his kiss falling upon her hair i did not know a girl could be so happy she whispered ive dreamed of it but it was nothing like this i am all atremble with it ivory held her off at arms length for a moment reluctantly grudgingly you took me fairly off my feet dearest he said and forgot everything but the one supreme fact you were telling me had i been on guard i should have told you that i am no worthy husband for you waitstill i havent enough to offer such a girl as you youre too late ivory you showed me your heart first and now you are searching your mind for bugbears to frighten me i am a poor man no girl could be poorer than i am after what youve endured you ought to have rest and comfort i shall have both in you this with eyes all wet lifted to ivorys my mother is a great burden a very dear and precious but a grievous one she needs a daughter it is in such things that i shall be your helpmate will not the boy trouble you and add to your cares rod i love him he shall be my little brother what if my father were not really dead i think of this sometimes in the night what if he should wander back broken in spirit feeble in body empty in purse i do not come to you free of burdens if my father is deserted by all i must see that he is made comfortable he never treated me like a daughter but i acknowledge his claim mine is such a gloomy house will it be gloomy when i am in it and waitstill usually so grave laughed at last like a carefree child ivory felt himself hidden in the beautiful shelter of the girls love it was dark now or as dark as the night ever is that has moonlight and snow he took waitstill in his arms again reverently and laid his cheek against her hair i worship god as well as i know how he whispered worship him as the maker of this big heaven and earth that surrounds us but i worship you as the maker of my little heaven and earth and my heart is saying its prayers to you at this very moment hush my dear hush and dont value me too much or i shall lose my head i that have never known a sweet word in all my life save those that my sister has given me i must tell you all about patty now i happen to know more than you dear i met her at the bridge when i was coming home from the woods and i saw her safely to uncle barts door i dont know why we speak of it as uncle barts when it is really aunt abbys i next met mark who had fairly flown from bridgton on the wings of love arriving hours ahead of time i managed to keep him from avenging the insults heaped upon his bride and he has driven to the mills to confide in his father and mother by this time patty is probably the centre of the family group charming them all as is her custom oh i am so glad mark is at home now i can be at rest about patty and i must not linger another moment for i am going to ask mrs mason to keep me overnight cried waitstill bethinking herself suddenly of time and place i will take you there myself and explain everything and the moment ive lighted a fire in mrs masons best bedroom and settled you there what do you think i am going to do i shall drive to the town clerks house and if he is in bed rout him out and have the notice of our intended marriage posted in a public place according to law perhaps i shall save a day out of the fourteen ive got to wait for my wife mills indeed i wonder at you waitstill as if mrs masons house was not far enough away without your speaking of mills i only suggested mills in case you did not want to marry me said waitstill walk up to the door with me begged ivory the horse is all harnessed and rod will slip him into the sleigh in a jiffy oh ivory do you realize what this means and waitstill clung to his arm as they went up the lane together that whatever sorrow whatever hardship comes to us neither of us will ever have to bear it alone again i believe i do realize it as few men could for never in my fiveandtwenty years have i had a human creature to whom i could pour myself out in whom i could really confide with whom i could take counsel you can guess what it will be to have a comprehending woman at my side shall we tell my mother do say yes i believe she will understand rod rod come and see whos stepping in the door this very minute rodman was up in his bedroom attiring himself elaborately for sentry duty his delight at seeing waitstill was perhaps slightly tempered by the thought that flashed at once through his mind that if she was safe he would not be required to stand guard in the snow for hours as he had hoped but this grief passed when he fully realized what waitstills presence at the farm at this unaccustomed hour really meant after he had been told he hung about her like the child that he was though he had a bit of the hero in him at bottom too embracing her waist fondly and bristling with wondering questions is she really going to stay with us for always ivory he asked every day and all the days every night and all the nights praise god from whom all blessings flow said ivory taking off his fur cap and opening the door of the livingroom but weve got to wait for her a whole fortnight rod isnt that a ridiculous snail of a law patty didnt wait a fortnight patty never waited for anything ivory responded with a smile but she had a good reason and alas we havent or they say that we havent and i am very grateful to the same dear little patty for when she got herself a husband she found me a wife rodman did not wholly understand this but felt that there were many mysteries attending the love affairs of grownup people that were too complicated for him to grasp and it did not seem to be just the right moment for questions waitstill and ivory went into mrs boyntons room quietly hand in hand and when she saw waitstill she raised herself from her pillow and held out her arms with a soft cry of delight i havent had you for so long so long she said touching the girls cheek with her frail hand you are going to have me every day now dear whispered waitstill with a sob in her voice for she saw a change in the face a new transparency a still more ethereal look than had been there before every day she repeated longingly waitstill took off her hood and knelt on the floor beside the bed hiding her face in the counterpane to conceal the tears she is coming to live with us dear come in rod and hear me tell her waitstill is coming to live with us isnt that a beautiful thing to happen to this dreary house asked ivory bending to take his mothers hand dont you remember what you thought the first time i ever came here mother and waitstill lifted her head and looked at mrs boynton with swimming eyes and lips that trembled ivory is making it all come true and i shall be your daughter mrs boynton sank farther back into her pillows and closing her eyes gave a long sigh of infinite content her voice was so faint that they had to stoop to catch the words and ivory feeling the strange benediction that seemed to be passing from his mothers spirit to theirs took rods hand and knelt beside waitstill the verse of a favorite psalm was running through lois boyntons mind and in a moment the words came clearly as she opened her eyes lifted her hands and touched the bowed heads let the house of aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever she said slowly and reverently and ivory with all his heart responded amen xxxiii aarons rod ivory ivory ivory stirred in a sleep that had been troubled by too great happiness to travel a dreary path alone a path leading seemingly nowhere and then suddenly to have a companion by ones side the very sight of whom enchanted the eye the very touch of whom delighted the senses what joy unspeakable who could sleep soundly when wakefulness brought a train of such blissful thoughts ivory ivory he was fully awake now for he knew his mothers voice in all the years ever thoughtful of his comfort and of the constant strain upon his strength lois had never wakened her son at night coming mother coming he said when he realized she was calling him and hastily drawing on some clothing for the night was bitterly cold he came out of his room and saw his mother standing at the foot of the stairway with a lighted candle in her hand can you come down ivory it is a strange hour to call you but i have something to tell you something i have been piecing together for weeks something i have just clearly remembered if its something that wont keep till morning mother you creep back into bed and well hear it comfortably he said coming downstairs and leading her to her room ill smooth the covers so beat up the pillows there and throw another log on the sittingroom fire now whats the matter couldnt you sleep all summer long i have been trying to remember something something untrue that you have been believing some falsehood for which i was responsible i have pursued and pursued it but it has always escaped me once it was clear as daylight for rodman read me from the bible a plain answer to all the questions that tortured me that must have been the night that she fainted thought ivory when i awoke next morning from my long sleep the old puzzle had come back a thousand times worse than before for then i knew that i had held the clue in my own hand and had lost it now praise god i know the truth and you the only one to whom i can tell it are close at hand ivory looked at his mother and saw that the veil that had separated them mentally seemed to five vanished in the night that had passed often and often it had blown away as it were for the fraction of a moment and then blown back again now her eyes met his with an altogether new clearness that startled him while her health came with ease and she seemed stronger than for many days you remember the winter i was here at the farm alone when you were at the academy yes it was then that i came home and found you so terribly ill do you think we need go back to that old time now mother dear yes i must i must one morning i received a strange letter bearing no signature in which the writer said that if i wished to see my husband i had only to go to a certain address in brentville new hampshire the letter went on to say that mr aaron boynton was ill and longed for nothing so much as to speak with me but there were reasons why he did not wish to return to edgewood would i come to him without delay ivory now sat straight in his chair and listened keenly feeling that this was to be no vague uncertain and misleading memory but something true and tangible the letter excited me greatly after your fathers long absence and silence i knew it could mean nothing but sorrow but although i was half ill at the time my plain duty was to go so i thought and go without making any explanation in the village all this was new to ivory and he hung upon his mothers words dreading yet hoping for the light that they might shed upon the past i arrived at brentville quite exhausted with the journey and weighed down by anxiety and dread i found the house mentioned in the letter at seven oclock in the evening and knocked at the door a common hardfeatured woman answered the knock and seeming to expect me ushered me in i do not remember the room i remember only a child leaning patiently against the windowsill looking out into the dark and that the place was bare and cheerless i came to call upon mr aaron boynton i said with my heart sinking lower and lower as i spoke the woman opened a door into the next room and when i walked in instead of seeing your father i confronted a haggard deathstricken young woman sitting up in bed her great eyes bright with pain her lips as white as her hollow cheeks and her long black hair streaming over the pillow the very sight of her struck a knell to the little hope i had of soothing your fathers sick bed and forgiving him if he had done me any wrong well you came as i thought you would said the girl looking me over from head to foot in a way that somehow made me burn with shame now sit down in that chair and hear what ive got to say while ive got the strength to say it i havent the time nor the desire to put a gloss on it aaron boynton isnt here as you plainly see but thats not my fault for he belongs here as much as anywhere though he wouldnt have much interest in a dying woman if you have suffered on account of him so have i and you havent had this pain boring into you and eating your life away for months as i have i pitied her she seemed so distraught but i was in terror of her all the same and urged her to tell her story calmly and i would do my best to hear it in the same way calm she exclaimed with this agony tearing me to pieces well to make beginning and end in one aaron boynton was my husband for three years i caught hold of the chair to keep myself from falling and cried i do not believe it believe it or not she answered scornfully it makes no difference to me but i can give you twenty proofs in as many seconds we met at a cochrane meeting and he chose me from all the others as his true wife for two years we travelled together but long before they came to an end there was no happiness for either of us he had a conscience not much of a one but just enough to keep him miserable at last i felt he was not believing the doctrines he preached and i caught him trying to get news of you and your boy just because you were out of reach and neglecting my boy and me who had given up everything to wander with him and live on whatever the brethren and sisters chose to give us so there was a child a boy i gasped did did he live hes in the next room she answered and its him i brought you here for aaron boynton has served us both the same he left you for me and me for heaven knows who if i could live i wouldnt ask any favors of you least of all but i havent a penny in the world though i shant need one very long my friend thats nursing me hasnt a roof to her head and she wouldnt share it with the boy if she had shes a bigoted orthodox but what do you expect me to do i asked angrily for she was stabbing me with every word the boy is your husbands child and he always represented you as a saint upon earth i expect you to take him home and provide for him he doesnt mean very much to me just enough so that i dont relish his going to the poorhouse thats all hell go to something very like that if he comes to mine i said dont worry me with talk for i cant stand it she wailed clutching at her nightgown and flinging back her hair either you take the child or i send somebody to edgewood with him somebody to tell the whole story some of the cochranites can support him if you wont or at the worst aaron boyntons town can take care of his son the doctor has given me two days to live if its a minute longer ive warned him and i warn you that ill end it myself and if you dont take the boy ill do the same for him hes a good sight better off dead than knocking about the world alone hes innocent and theres no sense in his being punished for the sins of other folks i see it all why did i never think of it before my poor poor rod said ivory clenching his hands and burying his head in them dont grieve ivory it has all turned out so much better than we could have hoped just listen to the end she was frightful to hear and to look at the girl was though all the time i could feel that she must have had a gipsy beauty and vigor that answered to something in your father go along out now she cried suddenly i cant stand anybody near the doctor never gives me half enough medicine and for the hour before he comes i fairly die for lack of it though little he cares go upstairs and have your sleep and tomorrow you can make up your mind you dont leave me much freedom to do that i tried to answer but she interrupted me rocking her body to and fro neither of us wi ever see aaron boynton again you no more than i hes in the west and a man with two families and no means of providing for them doesnt come back where hes known come and take her away eliza take her away quick she called i stumbled out of the room and the woman waved me upstairs you mustnt mind hetty she apologized she never had a good disposition at the best but shes frantic with the pain now and good reason too its about over and i be thankful when it is youd better swallow the shame and take the child i cant and wont have him and it be easy enough for you to say he belongs to some of your own folks by this time i was mentally bewildered when the iron first entered my soul when i first heard the truth about your father at that moment my mind gave way i know it now poor poor mother my poor gentle little mother murmured ivory brokenly as he asked her hand dont cry my son it is all past the sorrow and the bitterness and the struggle i will just finish the story and then we close the book forever the woman gave me some bread and tea and i flung myself on the bed without undressing i dont know how long afterward it was but the door opened and a little boy stole in a sad strange darkeyed little boy who said can i sleep up here mothers screaming and im afraid he climbed to the couch i covered him with a blanket and i soon heard his deep breathing but later in the night when i must have fallen asleep myself i suddenly awoke and felt him lying beside me he had dragged the blanket along and crept up on the bed to get close to my side for the warmth i could give or the comfort of my nearness the touch of him almost broke my heart i could not push the little creature away when he was lying there so near and warm and confiding he all unconscious of the agony his mere existence was to me i must have slept again and when the day broke i was alone i thought the presence of the child in the night was a dream and i could not remember where i was nor why i was there mother dear mother dont tell me any more tonight i fear for your strength urged ivory his eyes full of tears at the remembrance of her sufferings there is only a little more and the weight will be off my heart and on yours my poor son would that i need not tell you the house was still and i thought at first that no one was awake but when i opened the sittingroom door the child ran towards me and took my hand as the woman came in from the sickroom go into the kitchen rodman she said and lace up your boots youre going right out with this lady hetty died in the night she continued impassively the doctor was here about ten oclock and ive never seen her so bad he gave her a big dose of sleeping powder and put another in the table drawer for me to mix for her towards morning she was helpless to move we thought but all the same she must have got out of bed when my back was turned and taken the powder dry on her tongue for it was gone when i looked for it it didnt hasten things much and i dont blame her if ever there was a wild reckless creature it was hetty rodman but i who am just the opposite would have done the same if id been her she hurriedly gave me a cup of coffee and putting a coat and a cap on the boy literally pushed me out of the house ive got to report things to the doctor she said and youre better out of the way go down that side street to the station and mind you say the boy belonged to your sister who died and left him to you youre a cochranite aint you so was hetty and theyre all sisters so youll be telling no lies goodbye rodman be a good boy and dont be any trouble to the lady how i found the station i do not know nor how i made the journey nor where i took the stagecoach the snow began to fall and by noon there was a drifting storm i could not remember where i was going nor who the boy was for just as the snow was whirling outside so it was whirling in my brain mother i can hardly bear to hear any more it is too terrible cried ivory rising from his chair and pacing the floor i can recall nothing of any account till i awoke in my own bed weeks afterwards the strange little boy was there but mrs day and dr perry told me what i must have told them that he was the child of my dead sister those were the last words uttered by the woman in brentville i carried them straight through my illness and brought them out on the other side more firmly intrenched than ever if only the truth had come back to you sooner sighed ivory coming back to her bedside i could have helped you to bear it all these years sorrow is so much lighter when you can share it with some one else and the girl who died was called hetty rodman then and she simply gave the child her last name yes poor suffering creature i feel no anger against her now it has burned itself all away nor do i feel any bitterness against your father i forgot all this miserable story for so long loving and watching for him all the time that it is as if it did not belong to my own life but had to do with some unhappy stranger can you forgive too ivory i can try he answered god knows i ought to be able to if you can and will it turn you away from rod no it draws me nearer to him than ever he shall never know the truth why should he just as he crept close to you that night all unconscious of the reason you had for shrinking from him so he has crept close to me in these years of trial when your mind has been wandering life is so strange to think that this child of all others should have been a comfort to you the lords hand is in it whispered mrs boynton feebly his boyish belief in me his companionship have kept the breath of hope alive in me thats all i can say the bible story is happening over again in our lives then dont you remember that aarons rod budded and blossomed and bore fruit and that the miracle kept the rebels from murmuring this rebel never will murmur again mother and ivory rose to leave the room now that you have shed your burden you will grow stronger and life will be all joy for waitstill will come to us soon and we can shake off these miseries and be a happy family once more it is she who has helped me most to find the thread pouring sympathy and strength into me nursing me loving me because she loved my wonderful son oh how blest among women i am to have lived long enough to see you happy and as ivory kissed his mother and blew out the candle she whispered to herself even so lord jesus come quickly xxxiv the deacons waterloo mrs masons welcome to waitstill was unexpectedly hearty much heartier than it would have been six months before when she regarded mrs boynton as little less than a harmless lunatic of no use as a neighbor and when she knew nothing more of ivory than she could gather by his occasional drive or walk past her door with a civil greeting rodman had been until lately the only member of the family for whom she had a friendly feeling but all that had changed in the last few weeks when she had been allowed to take a hand in the boyntons affairs as to this newest development in the life of their household she had once been young herself and the veriest block of stone would have become human when the two lovers drove up to the door and told their exciting story ivory made himself quickly at home and helped the old lady to get a room ready for waitstill before he drove back for a look at his mother and then on to carry out his impetuous and romantic scheme of routing out the town clerk and announcing his intended marriage waitstill slept like the shepherd boy in the pilgrims progress with the herb called hearts ease in her bosom she opened her eyes next morning from the depths of mrs masons best feather bed and looked wonderingly about the room with all its unaccustomed surroundings she heard the rattle of fireirons and the flatter of dishes below the first time in all her womans life that preparations for breakfast had ever greeted her ears when she had not been an active participator in them she lay quite still for a quarter of an hour tired in body and mind but incredibly happy in spirit marvelling at the changes wrought in her during the day preceding the most eventful one in her history only yesterday her love had been a bud so closely folded that she scarcely recognized its beauty or color or fragrance only yesterday and now she held in her hand a perfect flower when and how had it grown and by what magic process the image of ivory had been all through the night in the foreground of her dreams and in her moments of wakefulness both made blissful by the heaven of anticipation that dawned upon her was ever man so wise so tender and gentle so strong so comprehending what mattered the absence of worldly goods the presence of care and anxiety when n woman had a steady hand to hold a steadfast heart to trust a man who would love her and stand by her whateer befell then the face of ivorys mother would swim into the mental picture the pale face as white as the pillow it lay upon the face with its aureole of ashen hair and the wistful blue eyes that begged of god and her children some peace before they closed on life the vision of her sister was a joyful one and her heart was at peace about her the plucky little princess who had blazed the way out of the ogres castle she saw patty clearly as a future fine lady in velvets and satins and furs bewitching everybody by her gay spirits her piquant vivacity and the loving heart that lay underneath all the nonsense and gave it warmth and color the remembrance of her father alone on the hilltop did indeed trouble waitstill selfreproach in the true sense of the word she did not could not feel never since the day she was born had she been fathered and daughterly love was absent but she suffered when she thought of the fierce selfwilled old man cutting himself off from all possible friendships while his vigor was being sapped daily and hourly by his terrible greed of money true housewife that waitstill was her mind reverted to every separate crock and canister in her cupboards every article of her baking or cooking that reposed on the swingsheh in the cellar thinking how long her father could be comfortable without her ministrations and so how long he would delay before engaging the u inevitable housekeeper she revolved the number of possible persons to whom the position would be offered and wished that mrs mason who so needed help might be the chosen one but the fact of her having been friendly to the boyntons would strike her at once from the list when she was thankfully eating her breakfast with mrs mason a little later and waiting for ivory to call for them both and take them to the boynton farm she little knew what was going on at her old home in these very hours when to tell the truth she would have liked to slip in had it been possible wash the morning dishes skim the cream do the weeks churning make her fathers bed and slip out again into the dear shelter of love that awaited her the deacon had passed a good part of the night in scheming and contriving and when he drank his selfmade cup of muddy coffee at seven oclock next morning he had formed several plans that were to be immediately frustrated had he known it by the exasperating and suspicious nature of the ladies involved in them at eight he had left the house started bill morrill at the store and was on the road in search of vengeance and a housekeeper old mrs atkins of deerwander sniffed at the wages offered miss peters of union falls an aged spinster with weak lungs had the impertinence to tell him that she feared she couldnt stand the cold in his house she had heard he was very particular about the amount of wood that was burned a fourmile drive brought him to the village poetically named the brick kiln where he offered to mrs peter upham an advance of twentyfive cents a week over and above the salary with which he had sought to tempt mrs atkins far from being impressed mrs uphill being of a high temper and candid turn of mind told him shed prefer to starve at home there was not another free woman within eight miles and the deacon was chafing under t e mortification of being continually obliged to state the reason for his needing a housekeeper the only hope it seemed lay in going to saco and hiring a stranger a plan not at all to his liking as it was sure to involve him in extra expense muttering threats against the universe in general he drove home by way of millikens mills thinking of the unfed hens the unmilked cow the unwashed dishes the unchurned cream and above all of his unchastened daughters his rage increasing with every step until it was nearly at the white heat of the night before a long stretch of hill brought the tired old mare to a slow walk and enabled the deacon to see the widow tillman clipping the geraniums that stood in tin cans on the shelf of her kitchen window now foxwell baxter had never been a village lothario at any age nor frequented the society of such of late years indeed he had frequented no society of any kind so that he had missed for instance abel days description of the widow tillman as a reglar syreen though he vaguely remembered that some of the baptist sisters had questioned the authenticity of her conversion by their young and attractive minister she made a pleasant picture at the window she was a free woman a little too free the neighbors would have said but the deacon didnt know that she was a comparative newcomer to the village and her mind had not been poisoned with feminine gossip in a word she was a distinctly hopeful subject and acting on a blind and sudden impulse he turned into the yard dung the reins over the mares neck and knocked at the back door her character s no worse than mine by now if aunt abby coles on the road he thought grimly an if the wilsons see my sleigh inside of widders fence so much the better itll give em a jog good morning mis tillman he said to the smiling lady ill come to the pint at once my youngest daughter has married mark wilson against my will an gone away from town an the older ones chosen a husband still less to my likin do you want to come and housekeep for me i surmised something was going on returned mrs tillman i saw patty and mark drive away early this morning with mr and mrs wilson wrapping the girl up and putting a hot soapstone in the sleigh and considable kissing and hugging thrown in this knowledge added fuel to the flame that was burning fiercely in the deacons breast well how about the housekeeping he asked trying not to show his eagerness and not recognizing himself at all in the enterprise in which he found himself indulging i m very comfortable here the lady responded artfully and i dont know s i care to make any change thank you i didnt like the village much at first after living in larger places but now im acquainted it kind of gains on me her reply was carefully framed for her mind worked with great rapidity and she was mistress of the situation almost as soon as she saw the deacon alighting from his sleigh he was not the sort of man to be a casual caller and his manner bespoke an urgent errand she had a pension of six dollars a month but over and above that sum her living was precarious she made coats and she had never known want for she was a master hand at dealing with the opposite sex deacon baxter according to common report had ten or fifteen thousand dollars stowed away in the banks so the situation would be as simple as possible under ordinary circumstances it was as easy to turn out one mans pockets as allothers when he was a normal human being but deacon baxter was a different proposition i wonder how long hes likely to live she thought glancing at him covertly out of the tail of her eye his evil temper must have driven more than one nail in his coffin i wonder if l refuse to housekeep whether i get a better offer i wonder if i could manage him if i got him id rather like to sit in the baxter pew at the orthodox meetinghouse after the way some of the baptist sisters have snubbed me since i come here not a vestige of these incendiary thoughts showed in her comely countenance and her soul might have been as white as the highbibbed apron that covered it to judge by her genial smile id make the wages fair urged the deacon looking round the clean kitchen with the breakfasttable sitting near the sunny window and the odor of corned beef and cabbage issuing temptingly from a boiling pot on the fire i hope she aint a great meateater he thought but its too soon to cross that bridge yet a while ive no doubt of it said the widow wondering if her voice rang true but ive got a pension and why should i leave this cosy little home would i better myself any thats the question im kind of lonesome here thats the only reason id consider a move no need o bein lonesome down to the falls said the deacon and im in an out all day between the barn an the store this indeed was not a pleasant prospect but jane tillman had faced worse ones in her time im no hand at any work outside the house she observed as if reflecting i can truthfully say im a good cook and have a great faculty for making a little go a long ways she considered this a masterstroke and in fact it was for the deacons mouth absolutely watered at this apparently unconscious comprehension of his disposition but im no hand at any chores in the barn or shed she continued my first husband would never allow me to do that kind of work perhaps i could git a boy to help out ive been kind o thinkin o that lately what wages would you expect if i paid a boy for the rough work asked the deacon tremulously well to tell the truth i dont quite fancy the idea of taking wages judge dickinson wants me to go to alfred and housekeep for him and id named twelve dollars a month its good pay and i havent said no but my rent is small here im my own mistress and i dont feel like giving up my privileges twelve dollars a month he had never thought of approaching that sum and he saw the heap of unwashed dishes growing day by day and the cream souring on the milkpans suddenly an idea sprang fullborn into the deacons mind jed morrills old driver must have been close at hand would jane tillman marry him no woman in the three villages would be more obnoxious to his daughters that in itself was a distinct gain she was a fine robust figure of a woman in her early forties and he thought after all that the hollowchested spindleshanked kind were more expensive to feed on the whole than their betterpadded sisters he had never had any difficulty in managing wives and thought himself quite equal to one more bout even at sixtyfive though he had just the faintest suspicion that the high color on mrs tillmans prominent cheekbones the vigor shown in the coarse black hair and handsome eyebrows might make this task a little more difficult than his previous ones but this fear vanished almost as quickly as it appeared for he kept saying to himself a judge of the county court wants her at twelve dollars a month hadnt i better bid high an git settled if youd like to have a home o your own thout payin rent youve only got to say the word an ill make you mis baxter said the deacon therell be nobody to interfere with you an a handsome legacy if i die first for none o my few savins is goin to my daughters i can promise you that the deacon threw out this tempting bait advisedly for at this moment he would have poured his hoard into the lap of any woman who would help him to avenge his fancied wrongs this was information indeed the few savings alluded to amounted to some thousands jane tillman knew had she not better burn her ships behind her take the risks and have faith in her own powers she was getting along in ears and her charms of person were lessening with every day that passed over her head if the deacons queer ways grew too queer she thought an appeal to the doctor and the minister might provide a way of escape and a neat little income to boot so on the whole the marriage though much against her natural inclinations seemed to be providentially arranged the interview that succeeded had it been reported verbatim deserved to be recorded in local history deacon baxter had met in jane tillman a foeman more than worthy of his steel she was just as crafty as he and in generalship as much superior to him as napoleon bonaparte to cephas cole her knowledge of and her experiences with men all very humble it is true but decidedly varied enabled her to play on every weakness of this particular one she had in hand and at the same time skilfully to avoided alarming him heretofore the women with whom the deacon had come in contact had timidly steered away from the rocks and reefs in his nature and had been too ignorant or too proud to look among them for certain softer places that were likely to be there since man is man after all even when he is made on a very small pattern if jane tillman became mrs baxter she intended to get the whip hand and keep it but nothing was further from her intention than to make the deacon miserable if she could help it that was not her disposition and so when the deluded man left her house he had made more concessions in a single hour than in all the former years of his life his future spouse was to write out a little paper for his signature just a friendly little paper to be kept quite private and confidential between themselves stating that she was to do no work outside of the house that her pension was to be her own that she was to have five dollars in cash on the first of every month in lieu of wages and that in ease of his death occurring first she was to have a third of his estate and the whole of it if at the time of his decease he was still pleased with his bargain the only points in this contract that the deacon really understood were that he was paying only five dollars a month for a housekeeper to whom a judge had offered twelve that as he had expected to pay at least eight he could get a boy for the remaining three and so be none the worse in pocket also that if he could keep his daughters from getting his money he didnt care a hang who had it as he hated the whole human race with entire impartiality if jane tillman didnt behave herself he had pleasing visions of converting most of his fortune into cash and having it dropped off the bridge some dark night when the doctor had given him up and proved to his satisfaction that death would occur in the near future all this being harmoniously settled the deacon drove away and caused the announcement of his immediate marriage to be posted directly below that of waitstill and ivory boynton might as well have all the fat in the fire to once he chuckled there wont be any housework done in this part of the county for a week to come if we should have more snow nobodyll have to do any shovellin for the womenfolksll keep all the paths in the village trod down from door to door travellin round with the news a spite match the community in general called the deacons marriage and many a man and many a woman too regarding the amazing publishing notice in the frame up at the meetinghouse felt that in jane tillman deacon baxter had met his waterloo shes plenty good enough for him said aunt abby cole though i know thats a terrible poor compliment if she thinks shell ever break into sciety here at the falls shell find herself mistaken its a mystery to me why the poor deluded man ever done it but aint it wonderful the ingenuity the lord shows in punishin sinners i couldnt a thought out such a good comeuppance myself for deacon baxter as marryin jane tillman the thing that troubles me most is thinkin how tickled the baptists be to git her out o their meetin an into ourn xxxv two heavens at the very moment that deacon baxter was i starting out on his quest for a housekeeper patty and mark drove into the mason dooryard and the sisters flew into each others arms the dress that mark had bought for patty was the usual charting and unsuitable offering of a mans spontaneous affection being of dark violet cloth with a wadded cape lined with satin a little brimmed hat of violet velvet tied under her chin with silk ribbons completed the costume and before the youthful bride and groom had left the ancestral door mrs wilson had hung her own ermine victorine the envy of all edgewood around pattys neck and put her ermine willow muff into her new daughters hands thus she was as dazzling a personage and as improperly dressed for the journey as she could well be waitstill in her plain linseywoolsey was entranced with pattys beauty and elegance and the two girls had a few minutes of sisterly talk of interchange of radiant hopes and confidences before mark tore them apart their cheeks wet with happy tears as the mason house faded from view patty having waved her muff until the last moment turned in her seat and said mark dear do you think your father would care if i spent the twentydollar goldpiece he gave me for waitstill she will be married in a fortnight and if my father does not give her the few things she owns she will go to her husband more illprovided even than i was i have so much dear mark and she so little its your own weddingpresent to use as you wish mark answered and its exactly like you to give it away go ahead and spend it if you want to i can always earn enough to keep you without anybodys help and mark after cracking the whip vaingloriously kissed his wife just over the violet ribbons and with sleighbells jingling they sped over the snow towards what seemed paradise to them the new hampshire village where they had been married and where so a few days later waitstill received a great parcel which relieved her of many feminine anxieties and she began to shape and cut and stitch during all the hours she had to herself they were not many for every day she trudged to the boynton farm and began with youthful enthusiasm the household tasks that were so soon to be hers by right dont waste too much time and strength here my dearest said ivory do you suppose for a moment i shall keep you long on this lonely farm i am ready for admission to the bar or i am fitted to teach in the best school in new england nothing has held me here but my mother and in her present condition of mind we can safely take her anywhere we will never live where there are so many memories and associations to sadden and hamper us but go where the best opportunity offers and as soon as may be my wife will be a pearl of great price he added fondly and i intend to provide a right setting for her this was all said in a glow of love and joy pride and ambition as ivory paced up and down before the livingroom fireplace while waitstill was hanging the freshly laundered curtains ivory was right waitstill baxter was indeed a jewel of a woman she had little knowledge but much wisdom and after all knowledge stands for the leaves on a tree and wisdom for the fruit there was infinite richness in the girl a richness that had been growing and ripening through the years that she thought so gray and wasted the few books she owned and loved had generally lain unopened it is true upon her bedroom table and she held herself as having far too little learning to be a worthy companion for ivory boynton but all the beauty and cheer a comfort that could ever be pressed into the arid life of the baxter household had come from waitstills heart and that heart had grown in warmth and plenty year by year those lonely tasks too hard for a girls hands those unrewarded drudgeries those days of faithful labor in and out of doors those evenings of selfsacrifice over the mendingbasket the quiet avoidance of all that might vex her fathers crusty temper her patience with his miserly exactions the hourly holding back of the hasty word all these had played their part all these had been somehow welded into a strong sunny steady lifewisdom there is no better name for it and so she had unconsciously the best of all harvests to bring as dower to a husband who was worthy of her ivorys strength called to hers and answered it just as his great need awoke such a power of helpfulness in her as she did not know she possessed she loved the man but she loved the task that beckoned her too the vision of it was like the breath of wind from a hilltop putting salt and savor into the new life that opened before her these were quietly happy days at the farm for mrs boynton took a new if transient hold upon life that deceived even the doctor rodman was nearly as ardent a lover as ivory hovering about waits ill and exclaiming you never stay to supper and its so lonesome evenings without you will it never be time for you to come and eve with us waity dear the days crawl so slowly at which ivory would laugh push him away and draw waitstill nearer to his own side saying if you are in a hurry you young cormorant what do you think of me and waitstill would look from one to the other and blush at the heaven of love that surrounded her on every side i believe you are longing to begin on my cooking you two big greedy boys she said teasingly what shall we have for new years dinner rod do you like a turkey roasted brown and crispy with giblet gravy and cranberry jelly do you fancy an apple dumpling afterwards an apple dumpling with potato crust or will you have a suet pudding with foamy sauce stop waitstill cried ivory dont put hope into us until you are ready to satisfy it we cant bear it and i have a box of goodies from my own garden safely stowed away in uncle barts shop waitstill went on mischievously they were to be sold in portland but i think theyll have to be my weddingpresent to my husband though a very strange one indeed there are peaches floating in sweet syrup there are tumblers of quince jelly there are jars of tomato and citron preserves and for supper you shall eat them with biscuits as light as feathers and white as snowdrifts we can never wait two more days rod let us kidnap her let us take the old bobsled and run over to new hampshire where one can be married the minute one feels like it we could do it between sunrise and moonrise and be at home for a late supper would she be too tired to bake the biscuits for us do you think what do you say rod will you be best man and there would be youthful unaccustomed laughter floating out from the kitchen or livingroom bringing a smile of content to lois boyntons face as she lay propped up in bed with her open bible beside her he binds up the brokenhearted she whispered to herself he gives unto them a garland for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness the quiet wedding was over there had been neither feasting nor finery nor presents nor bridal journey only a homecoming that meant deep and sacred a joy as fervent gratitude as any four hearts ever contained in all the world but the laughter ceased though the happiness flowed silently underneath almost forgotten in the sudden sorrow that overcame them for it fell out that lois boynton had only waited as it were for the marriage and could stay no longer there are two heavens both made of love one inconceivable evn by the other so divine it is the other far on this side of the stars by men called home and these two heavens met over at boyntons during these cold white glistening december days lois boynton found hers first after a windy moonlit night a morning dawned in which a hush seemed to be on the earth the cattle huddled together in the farmyards and the fowls shrank into their feathers the sky was gray and suddenly the first white heralds came floating down like scouts seeking for paths and campingplaces waitstill turned mrs boyntons bed so that she could look out of the window slope after slope dazzling in white crust rose one upon another and vanished as they slipped away into the dark green of the pine forests then there fell from out the skies a feathery whiteness over all the land a strange soft spotless something pure as light it could not be called a storm for there had been no wind since sunrise no whirling fury no drifting only a still steady solemn fall of crystal flakes hour after hour hour after hour mrs boyntons book of books was open on the bed and her finger marked a passage in her favorite biblepoet here it is daughter she whispered i have found it in the same chapter where the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shout for joy the lord speaks to job out of the whirlwind and says hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail sit near me waitstill and look out on the hills hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow no not yet but please god i shall and into many other treasures soon and she closed her eyes all day long the airways were filled with the glittering army of the snowflakes all day long the snow grew deeper and deeper on the ground and on the breath of some whitewinged wonder that passed lois boyntons window her white soul forsook its earthlot and took flight at last they watched beside her but never knew the moment of her going it was just a silent flitting a ceasing to be without a tremor or a flutter that could be seen by mortal eye her face was so like an angels in its shining serenity that the few who loved her best could not look upon her with anything but reverent joy on earth she had known nothing but the broken arcs but in heaven she would find the perfect round there at last on the other side of the stars she could remember right poor lois boynton for weeks afterwards the village was shrouded in snow as it had never been before within memory but in every happy household the homelife deepened day by day the books came out in the long evenings the grandsires told old tales under the inspiration of the hearthfire the children gathered on their wooden stools to roast apples and pop corn and hearts came closer together than when summer called the housemates to wander here and there in fields and woods and beside the river over at boyntons when the snow was whirling and the wind howling round the chimneys of the highgabled old farmhouse when every window had its frame of ermine and fringe of icicles and the sleet rattled furiously against the glass then ivory would throw a great back log on the bank of coals between the firedogs the kettle would begin to sing and the eat come from some snug corner to curl and purr on the braided hearthrug school was in session and ivory and rod had their textbooks of an evening but oh what a new and strange joy to study when there was a sweet woman sitting near with her workbasket a woman wearing a shining braid of hair as if it were a coronet a woman of clear eyes and tender lips one who could feel as well as think one who could be a mans comrade as well as his dear love truly the second heaven the one on this side of the stars by men called home was very present over at boyntons sometimes the broadseated old haircloth sofa would be drawn in front of the fire and ivory laying his pipe and his greek grammar on the table would take some lighter book and open it on his knee waitstill would lift her eyes from her sewing to meet her husbands glance that spoke longing for her closer companionship and gladly leaving her work and slipping into the place by his side she would put her elbow on his shoulder and read with him once rod from his place at a table on the other side of the room looked and looked at them with a kind of instinct beyond his years and finally crept up to waitstill and putting an arm through hers nestled his curly head on her shoulder with the quaint charm and grace that belonged to him it was a young and beautiful shoulder waitstills and there had always been and would always be a gracious curve in it where a childs head might lie in comfort presently with a shy pressure rod whispered shall i sit in the other room waitstill and ivory am i in the way ivory looked up from his book quietly shaking his head while waitstill put her arm around the boy and drew him closer our little brother is never in the way she said as she bent and kissed him men may come and men may go saco water still tumbles tumultuously over the dam and rushes under the edgewood bridge on its way to the sea and still it listens to the story of today that will sometime be the history of yesterday on midsummer evenings the windows of the old farmhouse over at boyntons gleam with unaccustomed lights and voices break the stillness lessening the gloom of the long grassgrown lane of lois boyntons watching in days gone by on sunny mornings there is a merry babel of childrens chatter mingled with gentle maternal warnings for this is a new brood of young things and the river is calling them as it has called all the others who ever came within the circle of its magic the fragile harebells hanging their blue heads from the crevices of the rocks the brilliant columbines swaying to and fro on their tall stalks the patches of gleaming sand in shallow places beckoning little bare feet to come and tread them the glint of silver minnows darting hither and thither in some still pool the tempestuous journey of some weatherbeaten log fighting its way downstream here is life in abundance luring the child to share its risks and its joys when waitstills boys and pattys girls come back to the farm they play by saco water as their mothers and their fathers did before them the paths through the pine woods along the rivers brink are trodden smooth by their restless wandering feet their eager curious eyes search the waysides for adventure but their babble and laughter are oftenest heard from the ruins of an old house hidden by great trees the stones of the cellar all overgrown with blackberry vines are still there and a fragment of the brick chimney where swallows build their nests from year to year a wilderness of weeds tall and luxuriant springs up to hide the stone over which jacob cochrane stepped daily when he issued from his door and the polished stick with which threeyearold patty beats a tattoo may be a round from the very chair in which he sat expounding the bible according to his own vision the thickets of sweet clover and redtipped grasses of waving ferns and young alder bushes hide all of ugliness that belongs to the deserted spot and serve as a miniature forest in whose shade the younglings foreshadow the future at their play of homebuilding and housekeeping in a far corner altogether concealed from the passerby there is a secret treasure a wonderful rosebush its green leaves shining with health and vigor when the july sun is turning the hayfields yellow the children part the bushes in the leafy corner and little waitstill boynton steps cautiously in to gather one splendid rose for father and mother jacob cochranes heart with all its faults and frailties has long been at peace on a chill dreary night in november all that was mortal of him was raised from its unhonored restingplace not far from the ruins of his old abode and borne by three of his disciples far away to another state the gravestones were replaced face downward deep deep in the earth and the sod laid back upon them so that no man thence forward could mark the place of the prophets transient burial amid the scenes of his first and only triumphant ministry it is a sad story jacob cochranes waitstill said to her husband when she first discovered that her children had chosen the deserted spot for their play and yet ivory the red rose blooms and blooms in the ruins of the mans house and perhaps somewhere in the world he has left a message that matches the rose
