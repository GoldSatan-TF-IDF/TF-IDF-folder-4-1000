passing and repassing nymphs that movd with grace divine beheld whereer i rovd bright shone the vernal day with double blaze as beauty gave new force to phoebus rays by no grave scruples checkd i freely eyed the dangrous show rash youth my only guide and many a look of many a fair unknown met full unable to control my own but one i markd then peace forsook my breast one oh how far superior to the rest what lovely features such the cyprian queen herself might wish and juno wish her mien the very nymph was she whom when i dard his arrows love had even then prepard nor was himself remote nor unsupplied with torch welltrimmd and quiver at his side now to her lips he clung her eyelids now then settled on her cheeks or on her brow and with a thousand wounds from evry part pierced and transpierced my undefended heart a fever new to me of fierce desire now seizd my soul and i was all on fire but she the while whom only i adore was gone and vanishd to appear no more in silent sadness i pursue my way i pause i turn proceed yet wish to stay and while i follow her in thought bemoan with tears my souls delight so quickly flown when jove had hurld him to the lemnian coast so vulcan sorrowd for olympus lost and so oeclides sinking into night from the deep gulph lookd up to distant light wretch that i am what hopes for me remain who cannot cease to love yet love in vain oh could i once once more behold the fair speak to her tell her of the pangs i bear perhaps she is not adamant would show perhaps some pity at my tale of woe oh inauspicious flame tis mine to prove a matchless instance of disastrous love ah spare me gentle powr if such thou be let not thy deeds and nature disagree now i revere thy fires thy bow thy darts now own thee sovreign of all human hearts spare me and i will worship at no shrine with vow and sacrifice save only thine remove no grant me still this raging woe sweet is the wretchedness that lovers know but pierce hereafter should i chance to see one destined mine at once both her and me such were the trophies that in earlier days by vanity seduced i toild to raise studious yet indolent and urgd by youth that worst of teachers from the ways of

lovely greek his promisd bride but lo while thus i execrate incensd the minister of fate wondrous accents soft yet clear wafted on the gale i hear ah much deluded lay aside thy threats and anger misapplied art not afraid with sounds like these toffend whom thou canst not appease death is not wherefore dreamst thou thus the son of night and erebus nor was of fel erynnis born in gulphs where chaos rules forlorn but sent from god his presence leaves to gather home his ripend sheaves to call encumberd souls away from fleshly bonds to boundless day as when the winged hours excite and summon forth the morninglight and each to convoy to her place before theternal fathers face but not the wickedthem severe yet just from all their pleasures here he hurries to the realms below terrific realms of penal woe myself no sooner heard his call than scaping through my prisonwall i bade adieu to bolts and bars and soard with angels to the stars like him of old to whom twas givn to mount on fiery wheels to heavn bootes wagon slow with cold appalld me not nor to behold the sword that vast orion draws or evn the scorpions horrid claws beyond the suns bright orb i fly and far beneath my feet descry nights dread goddess seen with awe whom her winged dragons draw thus ever wondring at my speed augmented still as i proceed i pass the planetary sphere the milky way and now appear heavns

worlds above shall times unsated maw crave and engulf the very heavns that regulate his flight and was the sire of all able to fence his works and to uphold the circling worlds but through improvident and heedless haste let slip thoccasion so then all is lost and in some future evil hour yon arch shall crumble and come thundring down the poles jar in collision the olympian king fall with his throne

dignified frankness and simplicity of conscious truth which renders even egotism respectable and delightful whether he describes the fervent and tender emotions of his juvenile fancy or delineates his

robert fellows i to my tutor thomas young though i had determined my excellent tutor to write you an epistle in verse yet i could not satisfy myself without sending also another in prose for the emotions of my gratitude which your services so justly inspire are too expansive and too warm to be expressed in the confined limits of poetical metre they demand the unconstrained freedom of prose or rather the exuberant richness of asiatic phraseology thought it would far exceed my power accurately to describe how much i am obliged to you even if i could drain dry all the sources of eloquence or exhaust all the topics of discourse which aristotle or the famed parisian logician has collected you complain with truth that my letters have been very few and very short but i do not grieve at the omission of so pleasurable a duty so much as i rejoice at having such a place in your regard as makes you anxious often to hear from me i beseech you not to take it amiss that i have not now written to you for more than three years but with you usual benignity to impute it rather to circumstances than to inclination for heaven knows that i regard you as a parent that i have always treated you with the utmost respect and that i was unwilling to tease you with my compositions and i was anxious that if my letters had nothing else to recommend them they might be recommended by their rarity and lastly since the ardour of my regard makes me imagine that you are always present that i hear your voice and contemplate your looks and as thus i charm away my grief by the illusion of your presence i was afraid when i wrote to you the idea of your distant separation should forcibly rush upon my mind and that the pain of your absence which was almost soothed into quiescence should revive and disperse the pleasurable dream i long since received your desirable present of the hebrew bible i wrote this at my lodgings in the city not as usual surrounded by my books if therefore there be anything in this letter which either fails to give pleasure or which frustrates expectation it shall be compensated by a more elaborate composition as soon as i return to the dwelling of the muses
