i stilling that night after dinner had surpassed himself he always did wrayford reflected when the small fry from highfield came to dine he cobham stilling who had to find his bearings and keep to his level in the big heedless ironic world of new york dilated and grew vast in the congenial medium of highfield the red house was the biggest house of the highfield summer colony and cobham stilling was its biggest man no one else within a radius of a hundred miles on a conservative estimate had as many horses as many greenhouses as many servants and assuredly no one else had three motors and a motorboat for the lake the motorboat was stillings latest hobby and he rode or steered it in and out of the conversation all the evening to the obvious edification of every one present save his wife and his visitor austin wrayford the interest of the latter two who from opposite ends of the drawingroom exchanged a fleeting glance when stilling again launched his craft on the thin current of the talk the interest of mrs stilling and wrayford had already lost its edge by protracted contact with the subject but the dinnerguests the rector mr swordsley his wife mrs swordsley lucy and agnes granger their brother addison and young jack emmerton from harvard were all for divers reasons stirred to the proper pitch of feeling mr swordsley no doubt was saying to himself if my good parishioner here can afford to buy a motorboat in addition to all the other expenditures which an establishment like this must entail i certainly need not scruple to appeal to him again for a contribution for our galahad club the granger girls meanwhile were evoking visions of lakeside picnics not unadorned with the presence of young mr emmerton while that youth himself speculated as to whether his affable host would let him when he came back on his next vacation learn to run the thing himself and mr addison granger the elderly bachelor brother of the volatile lucy and agnes mentally formulated the precise phrase in which in his next letter to his cousin professor spildyke of the university of east latmos he should allude to our last delightful trip in my old friend cobham stillings tenthousanddollar motorlaunch for east latmos was still in that primitive stage of culture on which five figures impinge isabel stilling sitting beside mrs swordsley her bead slightly bent above the needlework with which on these occasions it was her oldfashioned habit to employ herself isabel also had doubtless her reflections to make as wrayford leaned back in his corner and looked at her across the wide flowerfilled drawingroom he noted first of all for the how many hundredth time the play of her hands above the embroideryframe the shadow of the thick dark hair on her forehead the lids over her somewhat full grey eyes he noted all this with a conscious deliberateness of enjoyment taking in unconsciously at the same time the particular quality in her attitude in the fall of her dress and the turn of her head which had set her for him from the first day in a separate world then he said to himself she is certainly thinking where on earth will cobham get the money to pay for it stilling cigar in mouth and thumbs in his waistcoat pockets was impressively perorating from his usual dominant position on the hearthrug i said if i have the thing at all i want the best that can be got thats my way you know swordsley i suppose im what youd call fastidious always was about everything from cigars to wom his eye met the apprehensive glance of mrs swordsley who looked like her husband with his clerical coat cut slightly lower so i said if i have the thing at all i want the best that can be got nothing makeshift for me no secondbest i never cared for the cheap and showy i always say frankly to a man if you cant give me a firstrate cigar for the lords sake let me smoke my own he paused to do so well if you have my standards you cant buy a thing in a minute you must look round compare select i found there were lots of motorboats on the market just as theres lots of stuff called champagne but i said to myself ten to one theres only one fit to buy just as theres only one champagne fit for a gentleman to drink argued like a lawyer eh austin he tossed this to wrayford take me for one of your own trade wouldnt you well im not such a fool as i look i suppose you fellows who are tied to the treadmill excuse me swordsley but works work isnt it i suppose you think a man like me has nothing to do but take it easy loll through life like a woman by george sir id like either of you to see the time it takes i wont say the brain but just the time it takes to pick out a good motorboat why i went mrs stilling set her embroideryframe noiselessly on the table at her side and turned her head toward wrayford would you mind ringing for the tray the interruption helped mrs swordsley to waver to her feet im afraid we ought really to be going my husband has an early service tomorrow her host intervened with a genial protest going already nothing of the sort why the nights still young as the poet says long way from here to the rectory nonsense in our little twentyhorse car we do it in five minutes dont we belle ah youre walking to be sure stillings indulgent gesture seemed to concede that in such a case allowances must be made and that he was the last man not to make them well then swordsley he held out a thick red hand that seemed to exude beneficence and the clergyman pressing it ventured to murmur a suggestion what that galahad club again why i thought my wife isabel didnt we no well it must have been my mother then of course you know anything my good mother gives is well virtually you havent asked her sure i could have sworn i get so many of these appeals and in these times you know we have to go cautiously im sure you recognize that yourself swordsley with my obligations here now to show you dont bear malice have a brandy and soda before you go nonsense man this brandy isnt liquor its liqueur i picked it up last year in london last of a famous lot from lord st oswyns cellar laid down here it stood me at eh he broke off as his wife moved toward him ah yes of course miss lucy miss agnes a drop of sodawater look here addison you wont refuse my tipple i know well take a cigar at any rate swordsley and by the way im afraid youll have to go round the long way by the avenue tonight sorry mrs swordsley but i forgot to tell them to leave the gate into the lane unlocked well its a jolly night and i daresay you wont mind the extra turn along the lake and by jove if the moons out youll have a glimpse of the motorboat shes moored just out beyond our boathouse and its a privilege to look at her i can tell you the dispersal of his guests carried stilling out into the hall where his pleasantries reverberated under the oak rafters while the granger girls were being muffled for the drive and the carriages summoned from the stables by a common impulse mrs stilling and wrayford had moved together toward the fireplace which was hidden by a tall screen from the door into the hall wrayford leaned his elbow against the mantelpiece and mrs stilling stood beside him her clasped hands hanging down before her have you anything more to talk over with him she asked no we wound it all up before dinner he doesnt want to talk about it any more than he can help its so bad no but this time hes got to pull up she stood silent with lowered lids he listened a moment catching stillings farewell shout then he moved a little nearer and laid his hand on her arm in an hour she made an imperceptible motion of assent ill tell you about it then the keys as usual she signed another yes and walked away with her long drifting step as her husband came in from the hall he went up to the tray and poured himself out a tall glass of brandy and soda the weather is turning queer black as pitch i hope the swordsleys wont walk into the lake involuntary immersion eh hed come out a baptist i suppose whatd the bishop do in such a case theres a problem for a lawyer my boy he clapped his hand on wrayfords thin shoulder and then walked over to his wife who was gathering up her embroidery silks and dropping them into her workbag stilling took her by the arms and swung her playfully about so that she faced the lamplight whats the matter with you tonight the matter she echoed colouring a little and standing very straight in her desire not to appear to shrink from his touch you never opened your lips left me the whole job of entertaining those blessed people didnt she austin wrayford laughed and lit a cigarette there you see even austin noticed it whats the matter i say arent they good enough for you i dont say theyre particularly exciting but hang it i like to ask them here i like to give people pleasure i didnt mean to be dull said isabel well you must learn to make an effort dont treat people as if they werent in the room just because they dont happen to amuse you do you know what theyll think theyll think its because youve got a bigger house and more money than they have shall i tell you something my mother said shed noticed the same thing in you lately she said she sometimes felt you looked down on her for living in a small house oh she was half joking of course but you see you do give people that impression i cant understand treating any one in that way the more i have myself the more i want to make other people happy isabel gently freed herself and laid the workbag on her embroideryframe i have a headache perhaps that made me stupid im going to bed she turned toward wrayford and held out her hand good night good night he answered opening the door for her when he turned back into the room his host was pouring himself a third glass of brandy and soda here have a nip austin gad i need it badly after the shaking up you gave me this afternoon stilling laughed and carried his glass to the hearth where he took up his usual commanding position why the deuce dont you drink something you look as glum as isabel one would think you were the chap that had been hit by this business wrayford threw himself into the chair from which mrs stilling had lately risen it was the one she usually sat in and to his fancy a faint scent of her clung to it he leaned back and looked up at stilling want a cigar the latter continued shall we go into the den and smoke wrayford hesitated if theres anything more you want to ask me about gad no i had full measure and running over this afternoon the deuce of it is i dont see where the moneys all gone to luckily ive got plenty of nerve im not the kind of man to sit down and snivel because ive been touched in wall street wrayford got to his feet again then if you dont want me i think ill go up to my room and put some finishing touches to a brief before i turn in i must get back to town tomorrow afternoon all right then stilling set down his empty glass and held out his hand with a tinge of alacrity good night old man they shook hands and wrayford moved toward the door i say austin stop a minute his host called after him wrayford turned and the two men faced each other across the hearthrug stillings eyes shifted uneasily theres one thing more you can do for me before you leave tell isabel about that loan explain to her that shes got to sign a note for it wrayford in his turn flushed slightly you want me to tell her hang it im softhearted thats the worst of me stilling moved toward the tray and lifted the brandy decanter and shell take it better from you shell have to take it from you shes proud you can take her out for a row tomorrow morning look here take her out in the motorlaunch if you like i meant to have a spin in it myself but if youll tell her wrayford hesitated all right ill tell her thanks a lot my dear fellow and youll make her see it wasnt my fault eh women are awfully vague about money and shell think its all right if you back me up wrayford nodded as you please and austin theres just one more thing you neednt say anything to isabel about the other business i mean about my mothers securities ah said wrayford pausing stilling shifted from one foot to the other id rather put that to the old lady myself i can make it clear to her she idolizes me you know and hang it ive got a good record up to now i mean my mothers been in clover since i married i may say shes been my first thought and i dont want her to hear of this beastly business from isabel isabels a little harsh at times and of course this isnt going to make her any easier to live with very well said wrayford stilling with a look of relief walked toward the window which opened on the terrace gad what a queer night hot as the kitchenrange shouldnt wonder if we had a squall before morning i wonder if that infernal skipper took in the launchs awnings before he went home wrayford stopped with his hand on the door yes i saw him do it shes shipshape for the night good that saves me a run down to the shore good night then said wrayford good night old man youll tell her ill tell her and mum about my mother his host called after him ii the darkness had thinned a little when wrayford scrambled down the steep path to the shore though the air was heavy the threat of a storm seemed to have vanished and now and then the moons edge showed above a torn slope of cloud but in the thick shrubbery about the boathouse the darkness was still dense and wrayford had to strike a match before he could find the lock and insert his key he left the door unlatched and groped his way in how often he had crept into this warm pinescented obscurity guiding himself by the edge of the bench along the wall and hearing the soft lap of water through the gaps in the flooring he knew just where one had to duck ones head to avoid the two canoes swung from the rafters and just where to put his hand on the latch of the farther door that led to the broad balcony above the lake the boathouse represented one of stillings abandoned whims he had built it some seven years before and for a time it had been the scene of incessant nautical exploits stilling had rowed sailed paddled indefatigably and all highfield had been impressed to bear him company and to admire his versatility then motors had come in and he had forsaken aquatic sports for the flying chariot the canoes of birchbark and canvas had been hoisted to the roof the sailboat had rotted at her moorings and the movable floor of the boathouse ingeniously contrived to slide back on noiseless runners had lain undisturbed through several seasons even the key of the boathouse had been mislaid by isabels fault her husband said and the locksmith had to be called in to make a new one when the purchase of the motorboat made the lake once more the centre of stillings activity as wrayford entered he noticed that a strange oily odor overpowered the usual scent of dry pinewood and at the next step his foot struck an object that rolled noisily across the boards he lighted another match and found he had overturned a can of grease which the boatman had no doubt been using to oil the runners of the sliding floor wrayford felt his way down the length of the boathouse and softly opening the balcony door looked out on the lake a few yards away he saw the launch lying at anchor in the veiled moonlight and just below him on the black water was the dim outline of the skiff which the boatman kept to paddle out to her the silence was so intense that wrayford fancied he heard a faint rustling in the shrubbery on the high bank behind the boathouse and the crackle of gravel on the path descending to it he closed the door again and turned back into the darkness and as he did so the other door on the landside swung inward and he saw a figure in the dim opening just enough light entered through the round holes above the respective doors to reveal mrs stillings cloaked outline and to guide her to him as he advanced but before they met she stumbled and gave a little cry what is it he exclaimed my foot caught the floor seemed to give way under me ah of course she bent down in the darkness i saw the men oiling it this morning wrayford caught her by the arm do take care it might be dangerous if it slid too easily the waters deep under here yes the waters very deep i sometimes wish she leaned against him without finishing her sentence and he put both arms about her hush he said his lips on hers suddenly she threw her head back and seemed to listen whats the matter what do you hear i dont know he felt her trembling im not sure this place is as safe as it used to be wrayford held her to him reassuringly but the boatman sleeps down at the village and who else should come here at this hour cobham might he thinks of nothing but the launch he wont tonight i told him id seen the skipper put her shipshape and that satisfied him ah he did think of coming then only for a minute when the sky looked so black half an hour ago and he was afraid of a squall its clearing now and theres no danger he drew her down on the bench and they sat a moment or two in silence her hands in his then she said youd better tell me wrayford gave a faint laugh yes i suppose i had in fact he asked me to he asked you to yes she uttered an exclamation of contempt hes afraid wrayford made no reply and she went on im not tell me everything please well hes chucked away a pretty big sum again how he says he doesnt know hes been speculating i suppose the madness of making him your trustee she drew her hands away you know why i did it when we married i didnt want to put him in the false position of the man who contributes nothing and accepts everything i wanted people to think the money was partly his i dont know what youve made people think but youve been eminently successful in one respect he thinks its all his and he loses it as if it were there are worse things what was it that he wished you to tell me that youve got to sign another promissory note for fifty thousand this time is that all wrayford hesitated then he said yes for the present she sat motionless her head bent her hand resting passively in his he leaned nearer what did you mean just now by worse things she hesitated havent you noticed that hes been drinking a great deal lately yes ive noticed they were both silent then wrayford broke out with sudden vehemence and yet you wont wont put an end to it good god save whats left of your life she made no answer and in the stillness the throb of the water underneath them sounded like the beat of a tormented heart isabel wrayford murmured he bent over to kiss her isabel i cant stand it listen no no ive thought of everything theres the boy the boys fond of him hes not a bad father except in the trifling matter of ruining his son and theres his poor old mother hes a good son at any rate hed never hurt her and i know her if i left him shed never take a penny of my money what she has of her own is not enough to live on and how could he provide for her if i put him out of doors i should be putting his mother out too you could arrange that there are always ways not for her shes proud and then she believes in him lots of people believe in him you know it would kill her if she ever found out wrayford made an impatient movement it will kill you if you stay with him to prevent her finding out she laid her other hand on his not while i have you have me in this way in any way my poor girl poor child unless you grow tired unless your patience gives out he was silent and she went on insistently dont you suppose ive thought of that too foreseen it well and then he exclaimed ive accepted that too he dropped her hands with a despairing gesture then indeed i waste my breath she made no answer and for a time they sat silent again a little between them at length he asked youre not crying no i cant see your face its grown so dark yes the storm must be coming she made a motion as if to rise he drew close and put his arm about her dont leave me yet you know i must go tomorrow he broke off with a laugh im to break the news to you tomorrow morning by the way im to take you out in the motorlaunch and break it to you he dropped her hands and stood up good god how can i go and leave you here with him youve done it often yes but each time its more damnable and then ive always had a hope she rose also give it up give it up youve none then yourself she was silent drawing the folds of her cloak about her none none he insisted he had to bend his head to hear her answer only one what my dearest what dont touch me that he may die they drew apart again hearing each others quick breathing through the darkness you wish that too he said i wish it always every day every hour every moment she paused and then let the words break from her youd better know it youd better know the worst of me im not the saint you suppose the duty i do is poisoned by the thoughts i think day by day hour by hour i wish him dead when he goes out i pray for something to happen when he comes back i say to myself are you here again when i hear of people being killed in accidents i think why wasnt he there when i read the deathnotices in the paper i say soandso was just his age when i see him taking such care of his health and his diet as he does you know except when he gets reckless and begins to drink too much when i see him exercising and resting and eating only certain things and weighing himself and feeling his muscles and boasting that he hasnt gained a pound i think of the men who die from overwork or who throw their lives away for some great object and i say to myself what can kill a man who thinks only of himself and night after night i keep myself from going to sleep for fear i may dream that hes dead when i dream that and wake and find him there its worse than ever she broke off with a sob and the loud lapping of the water under the floor was like the beat of a rebellious heart there you know the truth she said he answered after a pause people do die do they she laughed yes in happy marriages they were silent again and isabel turned feeling her way toward the door as she did so the profound stillness was broken by the sound of a mans voice trolling out unsteadily the refrain of a musichall song the two in the boathouse darted toward each other with a simultaneous movement clutching hands as they met hes coming isabel said wrayford disengaged his hands he may only be out for a turn before he goes to bed wait a minute ill see he felt his way to the bench scrambled up on it and stretching his body forward managed to bring his eyes in line with the opening above the door its as black as pitch i cant see anything the refrain rang out nearer wait i saw something twinkle there it is again its his cigar its coming this way down the path there was a long rattle of thunder through the stillness its the storm isabel whispered hes coming to see about the launch wrayford dropped noiselessly from the bench and she caught him by the arm isnt there time to get up the path and slip under the shrubbery no hes in the path now hell be here in two minutes hell find us he felt her hand tighten on his arm you must go in the skiff then its the only way and let him find you and hear my oars listen theres something i must say she flung her arms about him and pressed her face to his isabel just now i didnt tell you everything hes ruined his mother taken everything of hers too and hes got to tell her it cant be kept from her she uttered an incredulous exclamation and drew back is this the truth why didnt you tell me before he forbade me you were not to know close above them in the shrubbery stilling warbled nita juanita ask thy soul if we must part wrayford held her by both arms understand this if he comes in hell find us and if theres a row youll lose your boy she seemed not to hear him you you you hell kill you she exclaimed wrayford laughed impatiently and released her and she stood shrinking against the wall her hands pressed to her breast wrayford straightened himself and she felt that he was listening intently then he dropped to his knees and laid his hands against the boards of the sliding floor it yielded at once as if with a kind of evil alacrity and at their feet they saw under the motionless solid night another darker night that moved and shimmered wrayford threw himself back against the opposite wall behind the door a key rattled in the lock and after a moments fumbling the door swung open wrayford and isabel saw a mans black bulk against the obscurity it moved a step lurched forward and vanished out of sight from the depths beneath them there came a splash and a long cry go go wrayford cried out feeling blindly for isabel in the blackness oh she cried wrenching herself away from him he stood still a moment as if dazed then she saw him suddenly plunge from her side and heard another splash far down and a tumult in the beaten water in the darkness she cowered close to the opening pressing her face over the edge and crying out the name of each of the two men in turn suddenly she began to see the obscurity was less opaque as if a faint moonpallor diluted it isabel vaguely discerned the two shapes struggling in the black pit below her once she saw the gleam of a face she glanced up desperately for some means of rescue and caught sight of the oars ranged on brackets against the wall she snatched down the nearest bent over the opening and pushed the oar down into the blackness crying out her husbands name the clouds had swallowed the moon again and she could see nothing below her but she still heard the tumult in the beaten water cobham cobham she screamed as if in answer she felt a mighty clutch on the oar a clutch that strained her arms to the breakingpoint as she tried to brace her knees against the runners of the sliding floor hold on hold on hold on a voice gasped out from below and she held on with racked muscles with bleeding palms with eyes straining from their sockets and a heart that tugged at her as the weight was tugging at the oar suddenly the weight relaxed and the oar slipped up through her lacerated hands she felt a wet body scrambling over the edge of the opening and stillings voice raucous and strange groaned out close to her god i thought i was done for he staggered to his knees coughing and sputtering and the water dripped on her from his streaming clothes she flung herself down again straining over the pit not a sound came up from it austin austin quick another oar she shrieked stilling gave a cry my god was it austin what in hell another oar no no untie the skiff i tell you but its no use nothings any use i felt him lose hold as i came up after that she was conscious of nothing till hours later as it appeared to her she became dimly aware of her husbands voice high hysterical and important haranguing a group of scared lanternstruck faces that had sprung up mysteriously about them in the night poor austin poor wrayford terrible loss to me mysterious dispensation yes i do feel gratitude miraculous escape but i wish old austin could have known that i was saved
