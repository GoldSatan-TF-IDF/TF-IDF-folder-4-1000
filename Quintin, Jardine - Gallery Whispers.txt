wwwhodderheadlinecom this is for eileen who shines her light into dark places how many feminists does it take to change a light bulb she looked at him across the dinner table with a light indulgent smile okay she said quietly lets have it he beamed in his small triumph one he barked the word out and in that instant his heavy eyebrows seemed to slam together in a frown and thats not funny olive shook her head youre not wrong there lauren seated on his right looked up at her father i dont get that dad he grinned no i suppose youre still a couple of years short of getting it oh said the child do you have to be twelve before you can be a feminist neil gazed down at her bland innocence written on her small round face and realised yet again that if ever there was a mothers daughter it was lauren barbara mcllhenney a small hand tugged at his shirtsleeve daddy daddy spencer shouted eagerly did you hear the one about the hearts supporter who went into a pub with an alligator he laughed as he ruffled his sons thick fair hair aye i did spence often the first time i heard it it was a celtic supporter that had the alligator dont you go telling that sort of joke outside though you could get into real trouble if the wrong lad heard you and you could get into real trouble if the wrong woman heard you tell that other one olive countered wherever did you pick it up anyway from karen neville neville isnt she the new ds in andy martins office thats the one not so new now though shes been there a right few weeks now mum can spence and me leave the table its nearly time for the holiday programme she turned to her daughter and raised an eyebrow it was enough sorry may spence and i leave the table thats better have both of you finished all your homework lauren and spencer nodded in tandem very well you may neil mcllhenney gazed at his children as they ran from the small dining room and across the hall a gentlemans family his fatherin law joe baxter had pronounced after spencers birth son and daughter one of each ill get the coffee he said rising from his carver chair you want milk in yours or just black have we any of that baileys left she asked him if so ill take some of that in it he nodded olive in her turn watched her husband as he left the room neil wasnt exactly fat but over the thirteen years of their marriage he had gained over two stone sure he had a massive frame to carry it but still every time she thought of chic his father and remembered the sudden awfulness of his death at the party for spencers christening she felt a pang of fear for him chic had been fiftyfour a big bulky man like his son and he was only two years short of forty without warning she felt another type of pang as the cough reflex kicked in neil in the kitchen heard the paroxysm then the quick puff of the inhaler as the fit settled down this wasnt right it wasnt bloody right anybody who knew them well would have realised that simply by the fact that he was there making the coffee everyone in their circle knew that olive couldnt stand his bloody coffee christ shed told them often enough he either used too much or not enough or ruined it by putting in too much milk or made it straight from a boiling kettle and damn near scalded her now here she was letting him make the kenco without a murmur indeed it was not bloody right dyou not think you should go back to the doctor he asked as he set a mug its contents heavily laced with the last of the irish cream liqueur on the coaster which lay before her on the table she shot him the stare the full highintensity spinechiller that he knew so well the laser look she could snap on in an instant olives silencer her colleagues called it in the staffroom in their awe at her ability to bring order to the rowdiest class without ever raising her voice no i do not she retorted i have asthma the doctors told me that and shes given me my inhaler she warned me that the cough would come and go its the go part that im concerned about love surely she could give you something that would settle it a bit quicker ill be all right she snapped now pack it in change the subject what sort of a day did you have whats the news on the chief neil backed off for that moment at least hes coming on he said the boss says that he has another appointment with the heart specialist in spain next tuesday if that goes okay theyll let him come home provided that they take at least three days for the journey and that lady proud does most of the driving when will he be back at work theres no news on that yet i understand from the boss that one of the force examiners will have to pass him fit before he can come back the moment cant come soon enough for big bob i can tell you he hates every day he spends in that office olive smiled im sure hes just saying that in case anyone thinks hes trying to undermine the chief hes probably loving it really her husband shook his head dcc skinner is many things but he aint that subtle he doesnt like being tied to a desk and he never will im his executive assistant i know this what if the chief doesnt come back she asked what would he do then ah but the chief will be back it was only a mild heart attack theyve put him on light medication and given him a diet he paused and she seized her chance speaking of diets neil mcllhenney you could do with losing some weight elbows on the table shoulders hunched head bowed he looked across at her his look this time out from under his heavy beetling eyebrows with a secret smile that went right into her soul and told her far more eloquently than the words which now they used to each other only occasionally how much he loved her christ he rumbled in his slow deep voice she sits there with bloody baileys in her coffee and tells me to lose weight he watched her as she slept she lay on her right side and although he could not see her face he knew that her hand would be on the pillow the thumb gently brushing her lips in an unconscious gesture which he had always guessed was a relic of a childhood habit her dark hair thick and wavy tousled at the ends from their energetic lovemaking clung to her neck and shoulders her back was to him as he looked at her admiring the curve of her hip in profile against the street light which shone outside their curtained window he had lain like this often before sometimes unable to keep from touching her from running a fingertip softly down her spine knowing what it did to her and that within a few minutes she would be awake and they would be locked together again yet on this night her turned back seemed to him to be a rejection for all her commitment in their coupling only a few hours before it had been satisfying for each of them yet there had been none of the sense of spiritual union which they had known at the beginning of their partnership that was one of the things which had set her apart from the other women who had lain in his bed before he had found her and she had tamed him yet now it was at best misplaced or worse he feared lost whats the matter she did not stir as she spoke her question but her voice was clear and wideawake nothing he answered softly im just thinking thats all about what och just the job you know but the jobs been quiet for the last wee while she paused are you still having flashbacks to that man with the gun he shook his head at once no absolutely not thats only happened to me that one time a couple of days after it happened something else then she rolled on to her back and looked up at him frowning not ariel surely he smiled at her concern a small sad smile no no not her that was a long time ago and shes dead she never really existed in fact ah but she did and so did her brother once or twice no more than that ive wakened in the night thinking of him and had to hang on to you to drive the fright away nonetheless theyre in the past so she demanded whats bugging you nothing he insisted i just cant sleep no one could snort like alex andy martin she exclaimed as she propped herself up on both elbows you are one of the worlds great sleepers if you are lying awake in the dark there is some reason for it come on out with it he reached out his left hand to cup her breast but she shied away from him that wont work tell me whats the problem he looked into her eyes i think we might be she frowned quickly rubbish she said at once but there was a defensiveness in her voice which proved she didnt believe her own denial he reached out his hand again touching her forehead as if to rub away the frown lines alexis skinner he whispered you can tell me all night that theres nothing wrong but you still wont make either of us believe it im afraid and i mean that literally because it does scare me that you and i are losing our way when we got together we had a shared vision of what we wanted each other above all else i still feel that way if i had to id give up everything i have and walk away from everything ive achieved just to be with you but youve changed i havent she protested i love you just as much as i always did i want you just as much then why do you keep changing your mind about marrying me i havent anyway thats not the issue he grunted no its not is it its the issue thats the issue ah now were getting to it she fired back at him suddenly youre still on about the baby thing i thought wed agreed that wed start thinking about a family in five years aye he said but theres a basic principle wrapped up in there isnt there about levels of commitment to each other her frown was back ah she countered andy says that hed walk away from everything for alex so she must say the same thing is that it it was his turn to look defensive thats sentimental emotional hypothetical crap and not worthy of you youve had achievements youve got a successful career that you say youd give up for love well good for you boy but surely im entitled to some professional fulfilment of my own or are you really and truly saying that you expect me to put aside all my ambitions to satisfy your need to extend your line hey hey he soothed her im not saying that at all apart from your dad theres no one who thinks more of your ability and your potential than i do im sorry about going back to the baby thing that was a cheap shot listen if you want to become the managing partner of curie anthony and jarvis ill back you all the way if you want to become a qc im all for that too i dont begrudge you your ambitions my darling but im coming to believe that as you pursue them youll leave me behind youll outgrow me im afraid thats starting to happen already when we got together you were a student now youve been marked out for stardom within your firm and i can see the effect its having on you for the last few days there have been times when ive had the feeling that youve been trying to distance yourself from me in some way deny it if you will but thats how i see it and i can only blame it on one thing curie anthony and bloody jarvis he shifted his weight on his elbow listen i do my job damn well i think and im completely committed to it but im not in love with it you are with yours one day you may feel that you have to choose between it and me and maybe that days coming close thats what keeps me awake at night she leaned over and kissed him would it help if we got married next month she asked he looked sadder than ever no love it wouldnt if my fears are real it wouldnt change a damn thing you have to be all you can be with or if it has to be without me youre your fathers daughter and i cant change that so what are you saying he gave a sigh so deep that her hair moved on its breeze i suppose im asking myself whether it will hurt even more later than it would if we split now if i backed off to let you concentrate full time on your career i know how i would feel about it but maybe for both our sakes you should ask yourself the same question he looked at her solemn face at her averted eyes yes maybe you as if it had been waiting for the perfect moment to intervene the bedside phone burst into life fucking thing has a mind of its own martin snarled but still he turned to pick it up yes he snapped sorry andy said brian mackie on the other end of the line but ive just had a call out to a suspicious death in a steading development out near whitekirk from what ive been told its a murder for sure im just leaving for the scene do you want to turn out the head of cid looked at his fiancee hating what he saw in her eyes aye he answered i think that would be a good idea james andrew skinner had always been by any reasonable measurement a considerate child but cutting back teeth can upset the calmest temperament so sarah and bob had shared floorwalking duties until finally at around five am their younger son had settled down they had been asleep themselves for little more than an hour when brian mackie had called to ask sarah if she could attend the scene of the whitekirk death bob sat at the kitchen table nursing his first coffee of the day watching his wife as she fed frozen bread into the fourslice toaster he grinned at her i never fail to be impressed by the way you can eat breakfast before you go out to look at a body she turned towards him returning his smile ah but it doesnt always stay down she countered remember that one in advocates close before we were married skinner shuddered as the vision of that wet november morning reprinted itself in his minds eye for the thousandth time how could i ever forget it i was perfectly okay at murder scenes up until then but from that moment on i havent looked at a victim without feeling queasy think yourself lucky then now youre deputy chief constable acting chief even you dont have to do that any more he knew that her remark was bait but he rose to it nonetheless not so ill always lead from the front as long as im in this job you know that i might be past my sellby date when it comes to looking at people whove been burned to a crisp or had their brains blown all over the walls but it doesnt mean ill run away from the duty if i think that its required of me it doesnt matter what office im in if i think itll help the effort or if i feel that its expected of me ill be there her eyes narrowed very slightly what it doesnt matter what office im in she threw back at him hey what happened to all that stuff about you not wanting to be a chief constable are you getting to enjoy sitting in jimmys chair he smiled again this time at her sharpness in leading him onto her hook he accepted the slice of buttered toast which she offered him and took a bite ill never enjoy sitting in jimmys chair he said finally precisely because it is his chair i want to see him make a full recovery from this heart scare and come back to work then i want him to stay in post health permitting right up to retirement age when it is time for him to go ill think seriously about my own ambitions and my obligations even to my force and my family but just between you and me over the last couple of weeks ive been asking myself how id feel about someone else doing the job and how would you sarah asked well he answered ive been thinking through the likely candidates theres not one of them couldnt get both feet into one of sir jamess shoes far from filling them both it would be very difficult for me to work with anyone else apart maybe from willie haggerty in strathclyde and there isnt a cats chance of him getting it so you will go for the job when jimmy retires unless i decide to quit at the same time as him she was rarely surprised by him not any more but as she looked at him astonishment shone in her big hazel eyes you wouldnt do that youre wedded to the force he stood up laughing lightly and took her in his arms wrong doctor sarah grace skinner i am wedded to you and no one else and from now on i will do whats best for us and not me for all i might chunter on to big neil about being tied to a desk i have never been as happy with my life as i am right now thats because of the rock its built on namely you and the kids mcllhenney eh she mused ill bet youre giving him a hard time just now hows he doing i havent seen him for a few weeks im not giving him a hard time at all mind you he has been a bit quiet lately probably feeling as deskbound as me ill cure that though ive got a job lined up for him what out of your office no representing my office itll mean guaranteed ninetofive working for a while so olive will like it too sounds like a departure for neil youll have him carrying a briefcase next what is it just something ive cooked up with the other chiefs its a national problem but its been agreed that well coordinate it im going to talk to him and andy about it today he squeezed her bottom then turned her towards the door thats all i can tell you about it its cloak and dagger stuff so now youd better take your wee bag and get off to certify mackies stiff if andy turns up at the scene tell him i want to see him this morning ask him to tie up a time for a meeting with gerry ill do that she said nodding as she spoke are you sure youre okay to stay here until the nanny arrives yeah thats fine good because if the guys want a quick postmortem i might just go straight on into edinburgh and do it myself even in the dark of the late autumn morning sarah reached oldbams finding her way along the twisting country roads which she knew so well in only fifteen minutes nestling on the edge of a wood a mile south of the hamlet ofwhitekirk it was one of a number of previously abandoned steadings throughout east lothian which had been rescued by private developers and returned to use as homes in its transformed existence the occupants were no longer farm workers instead they tended to be city dwellers who had developed a middleaged hankering for country life she could see the blue lights of the ambulance and the police vehicles ahead other as she steered her preelander carefully along the narrow treelined approach way from the a she came to a halt next to a patrol car its dayglo flashes shining in her headlights until she switched them off the death house was at the end of one of three rows of terraced cottages built of red stone blocks with black slate roofs lights shone in all but one of the dwellings which formed three sides of a rectangle around an open green space the fourth was a long barn which had been adapted to provide covered parking as she glanced around the small community faces looked back at her from several windows detective superintendent brian mackie stood in the doorway as she walked up the path hello sarah he said nodding his bald domed head in greeting they always seem to happen at night dont they your clients through in the back she stepped inside following him across the entrance hall and through a door at the other side into a big farmhouse style kitchen there a figure sat slumped in a varnished captains chair drawn up to a heavy oak table the woman had her back to sarah her head which lolled on her right shoulder was covered by a clear plastic bag like the hood of a hanged man it was tight around the neck secured not by a rope but by heavy black adhesive tape when was she found mackie glanced at his watch just over two hours ago they have a milk round out here believe it or not the guy was putting the pinta on the front doorstep and looked through the window he nodded towards closed double doors behind him those lead through to the dining room they were open and he could look right through there was enough light from that table lamp over there to let him see what had happened milkmen have mobile phones these days so he called us right away the two officers from the car outside broke in through the back door and found her so what made you ring the bell for a fullscale murder investigation taken by surprise sarah and the superintendent looked back towards the kitchen door through which andy martin had come silently into the room ive seen suicides that looked like this plastic bag and all the black tape sir said mackie formal in the presence of the uniformed woman constable who stood behind the head of cid bright young pc cowan here reckoned that if the woman had fastened the tape round her own neck there would have been a roll of the stuff and scissors lying on the table in front of her as you can see there isnt pc cowan even put on her gloves and had a look in all the drawers and cupboards its not there either fair enough the chief superintendent nodded good work constable he said to the girl at his side mr mackie will make sure that your divisional commander hears of this he turned back to the other detective are arthur dorwards lot on the way yes in that case wed all better get our big feet out of here and avoid contaminating this scene any further doctor can you certify death without disturbing the plastic bag i want to leave her until shes been photographed sure sarah laid her small case on the table opened it and took out a penlight whats wrong with andy she thought as she crouched down beside the body he hasn t called me doctorin years the dead womans eyes were open there was no flicker of reaction when she shone the torch on her pupils theres no fear in her expression she said quietly to the two detectives as she worked she looks perfectly calm she held her wrist for a few moments confirming the absence of pulse then looked closely at it and at the other no marks on her either at least none that i can see nothing to indicate that shes been restrained while this was done then untied afterwards sarah looked into the womans face once more in life she had been attractive in her early middle age with dark hair showing only a few strands of grey then something caught her eye something so incongruous that she kicked herself mentally for not noticing it right away andy brian shes wearing makeup she lifted one of the dead wrists and sniffed at it and perfume too if you look in her bedroom youll probably find a bottle or a spray of a fragrance called joy whatever happened to this lady she got herself dolled up for it she leaned forward and peered closely at the plastic bag oh yes she whispered that tells me a lot she stood up and closed her bag okay she pronounced her voice sharp and professional once more you have formal certification of death about four hours ago id say subject to autopsy confirmation the cause of death will turn out to be asphyxiation i assume said martin as mackie ushered them from out of the kitchen to await the arrival of detective inspector arthur dorward and his squad of crime scene technicians dont assume sarah replied i could see no marks on the plastic bag if shed suffocated id expect to find lipstick smears from where shed tried to suck in air maybe she didnt try the head of cid suggested she didnt but not because she had willed herself to stop breathing you cant do that its a reflex theres something else here id say that this woman died or at least became deeply unconscious before she had a chance to suffocate ill tell you the whole story after the autopsy dyou want me to do it or do you want joe hutchison in on this one you do it sarah said martin if you feel you need a second opinion call him in but you handle it in the first instance youve picked up the ball so run with it as far as you can he turned to mackie who was she brian the owner of the cottage is a mrs gaynor weston im assuming thats her in there but thats all i have for now maggie rose should be here soon with some cid reinforcements shell direct the interviews with the neighbours and so on once arthurs people have dusted the place fully ill look for personal papers and see what they tell me the first thing well need to do is locate a next of kin too right the head of cid agreed when we do well need to be careful how much information we give from the way this looks the next of kin or another close relative could be the prime suspect this woman was killed by someone close to her someone she trusted and said sarah quietly she was a willing victim so that means she cut mackie short yes it means that this looks like an assisted suicide i agree andy martin frowned but thats not what the procurator fiscal will call it theres no such thing in the eyes of the law the charge here will be murder and the penalty will be life imprisonment how did it look out at oldbams andy skinner asked as his head of cid settled into a low chair around the coffee table in the chief constables office just after midday very neat and orderly boss martin replied the victim is a forty three year old woman gaynor weston she was a training consultant selfemployed lived alone divorced from her husband professor nolan weston seven years ago next of kin is raymond weston her only son aged eighteen just started his first term at aberdeen university mrs weston was seated at her kitchen table with a bag over her head secured tightly by black tape there was no sign of forced entry to the house and nothing appeared to have been disturbed dorwards people found two plates cups saucers and cutlery in the dishwasher it had been run though every damn thing in it was fingerprintfree there were two long stemmed wine glasses on the draining board and an empty bottle of mouton cadet on the table each of the glasses still had traces of wine in them and one had lipstick on the rim the same shade as mrs westons the team tried to lift prints from them but they were too badly smeared what about the bag skinner grunted it was strong clear polythene unmarked no brand name on it no store name nothing at all there were no others like it in the house or in the garden shed nor was there any sign of the black tape weve looked everywhere now someone took it away for sure probably brought it too the ex what do we know about him what does he profess do we know yet martin nodded brian mackie had all that before ten oclock this morning hes a surgeon he has a chair at edinburgh university and works mostly at the western general hospital mmm divorced for seven years you say did mrs weston have any man friends apparently so maggie found a neighbour a ms joan ball another single woman who claims to have been a close pal according to her mrs weston was having a relationship with one of her clients a guy called terry futcher he runs an advertising agency and hes married the husband was still around as well they stayed friends after the split do we know why they were divorced the dcc asked it seems to have been her idea she told joan ball that she just wanted her own space she wanted the freedom to be herself she said after they parted the boy stayed with his father during the school term and with her during the holidays the prof has a cottage up in the highlands and occasionally the three of them went up there together hed visit her at the steading on occasion too joan ball knew not to call on her when she saw his car there or futchers for that matter and did these cars stay all night of course did she see any cars there last night no she didnt martin replied she was out herself and got home well after midnight she said that gaynors lights were on but other than her own there was no car at the door shed have noticed if either of the blokes were there did the prof know about futcher yes but ms ball didnt think that the boyfriend knew about him skinner shook his steelgrey head shit twotiming the married boyfriend with the single exhusband thats a nice twist martin smiled suddenly and wickedly who said the ex is single he asked professor weston married his secretary five years ago jesus the acting chief constable laughed out loud two cheated wives a cuckolded lover and an exhusband with a guilty secret there seems to have been a whole queue of people with a reason to top this woman except countered the head of cid that sarahs thinking and mine is that gaynor weston topped herself with assistance now why would she want to do that according to joan balls account she was living the life of reilly could you and sarah be wrong the dcs frowned at his friend the postmortem may show that but i dont think so then i hate the sound of this one skinner said unless we get a clear dna link to the helper suppose they made love before they did it it could be a bastard to prove christ i almost wish this person had been just a wee bit cleverer hadnt left the second glass and most of all that the bugger had left that roll of black tape stuck preferably to mrs westons fingers if he or she had done that simple thing wed be reporting this one as a suicide and saving ourselves a lot of work and probably grief he frowned did she leave a note no we turned the place inside out even looked in her computer nothing at all apart from her gentlemen callers did mrs weston have a big circle of friends yes her diary was chockfull in that event all those people will have to be checked out as indeed will the very helpful ms ball if shes as close a pal as she told brian at the moment shes our only witness i wonder if she has a roll of black tape in her toolbox lets wait for good doctor sarahs postmortem report said martin once we have that well have a better idea of the basis of our investigation if we do find ourselves with a lot of interviewing to do ill give brian extra resources to handle it if he needs them the head of cid looked across to the far end of the big room as gerry crossley the chief constables secretary came in carrying a tray with two mugs and a plate of biscuits apart from all that though sir he said as the young man placed the tray on the coffee table why did you want to see me i want to brief you on something thats developed and to ask your view on what i intend to do about it he paused as the door closed behind the secretary ive called a meeting of heads of special branch from all eight scottish police forces two oclock this afternoon in this building but before i get round to that lets deal with the really important stuff sarah called me from edinburgh royal while she was waiting for the body to arrive from oldbams she said that she was worried about you that you werent yourself this morning i can tell just from looking at you that shes right whats up son martin picked up his mug took a sip to test the temperature then a mouthful he held it cradled in both hands for several seconds staring across the room and out of the long window finally his gaze swung round to skinner its alex and me he said at last were in bother i think we might be breaking up there was an edge to the silence which filled the room andy looked at his friend trying to gauge his reaction anybody else involved bob asked quietly yes martin replied but not in the sense you mean mitchell laidlaws the problem laidlaw and the mighty firm of curie anthony and jarvis with every day she spends there alexs ambitions are becoming more clear before she graduated they were vague and involved going to the bar under mitchs influence shes become hooked on litigation thats the specialist area she wants to follow and being alex shes only interested in becoming the best there is do you begrudge her that no i dont but her ambition and my hopes for the two of us dont fit together any more weve been dancing around this for a while now this morning i brought it to a head i asked her whether she wants to break off our engagement to concentrate on her career skinner gasped thats a bit heavy andy isnt it maybe it is but she didnt say no the silence returned ever more palpable bob stood up walked over to the window and looked out is this purely about alex he asked quietly or does her mother come into it too what dyou mean you know bloody well what i mean you tell me you see her career as a rival but are you coloured in that by what you know about myra lets not piss about alexs mother was a serial adulteress are you asking yourself whether this newfound ambition others this lusting after something other than you might be some sort of genetic inheritance setting itself free martin threw back his head jesus bob the words burst out in a great gasp alex isnt a bit like her mother its you she takes after and thats what really worries me im sorry to be so blunt but all that time that myra was screwing around you hadnt the faintest idea of it because you were so wrapped up in the job if she hadnt been killed your marriage would probably have gone on skinner snorted you think it would have survived her being pregnant by another man sure shed either have had the kid aborted without your knowledge or shed just have told you that it was yours youd never have doubted that for a second the big mans eyes narrowed so my familys subordinate to my job is it he whispered no its not martin snapped not any more youve sorted out your priorities but youve done it from a position at the top of the tree alex hasnt and shes only just started to climb i hadnt thought of it this way before but if i think of you and myra then look at alex and me the roles are reversed im not saying for one moment that im afraid alex will start sleeping around but sometimes im not so sure about me ahh christ said skinner wearily shaking his head lifes never easy pal is it look take it from me my daughter loves you do you love her of course well isnt that enough thats what im asking alex so far ive had no answer just silence and to me thats speaking volumes there is nothing especially mysterious about special branch every police force has such a unit within its organisation and they link loosely together into a network which is responsible for protecting the public against subversion terrorism and other threats outside the bounds of runofthemill criminal activity nevertheless looking at the eight officers seven men and one woman who were seated at the conference table as he came into the room bob skinner experienced an unusual sense of personal power and pride he was chief constable only on a temporary basis during the absence of sir james proud struck down by a mild heart attack while on holiday in spain sir john govan the outgoing strathclyde chief and new security adviser to the secretary of state could easily have assumed command of the operation he was about to outline and yet it was govan himself who had proposed skinner for the task bob has a track record in this type of situation he had said the rest of us are penpushers by comparison so lets all of us agree to put our people under his command until this crisis is resolved skinner and the two men who had accompanied him into the room took their places at the head of the table as they did so the eight others looked at them in complete surprise the dcc scanned their faces detective inspector mario mcguire his own special branch chief superintendent harry mcguigan from strathclyde then lorraine morrison from tayside walter paton from central joe impey from dumfries and galloway brian burns from fife andrew macintosh from grampian and lan evans from northern detective inspectors all good afternoon people he said briskly welcome to fettes and thank you all for getting here promptly i know that in your roles as heads of special branch you maintain regular contact with each other so wholesale introductions arent necessary however for those of you who dont know my companions the officer on my right is detective chief superintendent andy martin my head of cid and on my left is detective sergeant neil mcllhenney my executive assistant mr martin is here as my deputy in these matters ill explain ds mcllhenneys role later now to business all of you even mario mcguire my own head of special branch thought that this was going to be an ordinary liaison meeting it isnt and for that small deception i apologise so why the hell are you here dont worry im going to tell you but first i want to say this you all work on a confidential basis and know the importance of keeping your mouths shut this meeting isnt just confidential its top secret neither its existence nor its subject are to be discussed with anyone other than members of this group or with your own chief constables in this instance all of you are working directly under my command so thats an order he picked up mcguires glance yes mario that applies to you too i know your wifes a detective chief inspector but she doesnt need to know about this skinner looked round the table youll all remember a couple of years ago when we had major problems here in edinburgh with a gang of terrorists at the festival there was a general murmur of confirmation round the table and a few nods well this time we may have something similar on our hands like all of you he continued im part of a secret network mr martin neil and mario are aware of this and now you should be too if only so that you understand the strength of what were dealing with here sir john govan may have taken over from me as the secretary of states security adviser and good luck to him only martin and mcllhenney caught the edge of bitterness in skinners tone but that doesnt affect my links with or my position within ml he paused to let his words sink in last weekend the director general had a call from his opposite number in the secret intelligence service the cold war may be long behind us but as weve seen all too often that doesnt make the world a less dangerous place or take away the need to gather knowledge of potential threats to our national interests there are some people out there who are potential threats to everyone theyre for hire and the skill they sell is violence the media call them international terrorists but thats too broad a description very few of them are motivated by creed or belief their driving force is large lumps of cash paid into swiss bank accounts they are not street criminals you wont find them behind any gang murders not in the states not here not in russia not anywhere they are what the boys in the cia really do call wet workers assassins for hire to take out political and other targets there are no coou formal qualifications required but in fact most of them are exspecial forces all of the major intelligence services have a list of these people they know who they are where theyre based the identities they use the type of job they handle theres a database in langley which lists them all and which even shows their operational records we have partial access to it he smiled softly partial because the cia is understandably shy about even us getting to know which projects theyve sponsored themselves as far as possible these subjects are kept under constant observation by the western intelligence services who in this instance at least pool resources and information but theyre good these folk theyre aware of that and whenever theyve got something cooking they simply drop out of sight to reappear maybe somewhere else maybe under another name once the jobs done these patterns of movement actually give a good picture of who was behind what they also give the intelligence community a clear idea when a project is under way skinner looked round the table thats whats happened here he said the message which ml passed to five a few days ago concerned the disappearance of one michael hawkins from surveillance in cape town he looked around the table once more michael hawkins is the current identity of a man formerly known during his service with the south african army as hencke van roost using a variety of names other than those he has completed projects for the intelligence services of five different countries and for at least six political or fundamentalist organisations his credits include the assassination by bomb a few years back of an asian head of state a shooting in dublin which was thought to be gangrelated but which in fact was carried out for political reasons and the elimination of a very highprofile international public figure guess who in which the official verdict was accidental death when one of these people goes to ground then naturally enough the intelligence services want to know why unless one of them already knows in which case the word is passed discreetly to the sponsors friends when hawkins slipped his surveillance it took everyone by surprise the first thought was that he had a role in the recent us embassy bombings in africa and was running for his life or indeed that he might already have lost it but the us scotched that one the osama bin laden terror group did have a specialist adviser in those incidents but he was taken out in the initial missile strike on afghanistan the americans however did volunteer information from one of their people a woman who they had infiltrated into hawkins close circle thats their description you work out what it means this was quite a gesture on their part since theyve had to pull that agent out of south africa altogether now that shes been exposed she gave them one clue that was all the only thing hawkins said when she asked him where he was going he told her im flying north for the winter skinner paused for the winter he said that could be significant i appreciate lady and gentlemen that it could also mean anything and as i speak the search for hawkins is going on all over europe and in the us however there is a strong possibility that he might be coming here ill explain that later for now he turned to mcllhenney neil if you would the big sergeant stood and walked to the far end of the table where a slide projector stood oldfashioned technology skinner apologised as his assistant flicked off the conference room lights and switched on the projector on the portable screen opposite a face appeared a young man in his early twenties with reddish blond hair staring seriously at the camera this is hencke van roost said the dcc as he looked when he enlisted in the south african army at the age of twentythree before he signed on he completed an engineering degree at massachusetts institute of technology he comes from a wealthy family does our man his father who died a few years back was a rancher and wine producer mcllhenney pressed the button of the remote changer and the carousel turned revealing a second photograph hes still van roost in this one skinner continued four years into his army service by now hes a captain in special forces this was taken on an operation in namibia the cia agent copied it the man was bare chested wearing only green shorts socks and heavy boots his hair was bleached even more fair than it had been in the earlier image and he was smiling a submachine gun was slung over his shoulder and three black men lay sprawled awkwardly in death at his feet he nodded to his assistant who moved on to the next slide she copied this one too he said as the watchers gasped the south africans grin was even wider again he was barechested his muscles standing out impressively in the sunlight as he stood flanked by his fellow soldiers there was a machete stuck in his belt and in each hand he held by the hair a glassyeyed mouth agape severed white human head the cia managed to identify those two believe it or not they were americans hired by the namibian insurgents every time van roosts unit captured a mercenary that was how they dealt with them they were known in every southern african battle zone as the headhunters skinner paused the platoon didnt only work abroad the government used them to foment tribal violence in the townships it was even suggested that van roost invented the necklace lorraine morrison shot him a puzzled look you dont know about that fashion accessory inspector it involves filling a car tyre with petrol hanging it round some poor buggers neck and setting it alight it was common practice in the townships for a while and some say our man hencke came up with the idea he nodded to mcllhenney once more and a fourth photograph appeared on the screen it could have been a different person this time the smile was gentle perfectly civilised and framed by a thin moustache while the wellgroomed hair was darker more noticeably red the man wore an expensively cut blazer and his goldrimmed glasses made him look studious during his eventful army career continued skinner van roost not unnaturally made many enemies so after five years when his tour was almost completed the top brass did him a favour they reported him killed in action in namibia brought back an unrecognisable body and had a funeral a few months later mr michael hawkins whom you see there returned from an extensive spell in the us and set up in practice in cape town as a consultant civil engineer his firm has done pretty well in the twelve years since then initially it was given a legup with a few government contracts but it built up pretty quickly a list of significant private sector clients in south africa and abroad today it has a staff of twenty although theres a vacancy since the cia pulled their woman out the dcc paused as mcllhenney turned off the projector switched on the lights and resumed his seat he did other things for the former south african regime too he went on ten years ago he paid a business visit to the us to advise the government on an office purchase in chicago while he was there samuel tshabala the leader in exile of a radical black faction was killed shot by a sniper as he got into his car in san francisco this was very embarrassing for the americans the guy had been under their protection and more than a few people in africa accused them of setting him up so the fbi and the cia in a rare show of cooperation threw everything at it eventually the bureau discovered that mr michael hawkins had entered the country ten days before the hit but had never left they also discovered that one peter veivers south african national had left the country through los angeles airport on the day after although when they checked they found no record of his ever having entered they placed veivers in a hotel in san francisco where he had stayed for seven days checking out on the morning of the shooting by sheer chance the drug enforcement agency had been staking out the same hotel during veivers time there waiting for a crowd of colombians and were able to give the bureau a piece of good quality video footage of their man far better than they had taken from the house security cameras they handed over to the cia at that point now as it happened the agency had been very interested in the late hencke van roost he had killed a couple of their people in namibia the very two you saw a few minutes ago in fact so they were very pleased when they heard he was dead they had his picture on file from his mit days and from south african press coverage of his alleged death so they made the connection quickly then they had a look at mr michael hawkins back at work in cape town and put the whole story together there was some talk of terminating him there and then but in the end they did something much more sensible they recruited him michael hawkins was blackmailed into handling sticky jobs for the agency and that really was the start of it skinner leaned back okay he said ive been talking for long enough any questions so far di morrison raised a hand if he worked for the cia why did they have to plant someone in his office because he doesnt work for them alone he works for virtually anyone and he doesnt ask agency approval before he takes on a job the dcc grinned they might think they do but the cia dont actually run theworld the tshabala affair left them with egg on their faces and so did the asian assassination i mentioned earlier that man was a client too so they put their spy in hawkins camp as a sort of early warning system mario mcguire raised a hand how many aliases does the guy use sir every time he goes under skinner replied he does it under a new name and he switches to another after the jobs done mcllhenney shifted his massive frame in his seat can i ask a question boss of course youre not just here to work the projector why does the present south african government tolerate someone like this because chances are hes worked for them too in the past no one knows for sure who set up tshabala but the cia were fairly certain that the anc were involved that suspicion was more or less confirmed when the murder was taken off the agenda of the truth and reconciliation commission the awful truth is that people like hawkins are useful very useful for a time at least theyre very good at what they do and they dont have links to anyone so what are we to do with this guy if we catch him stick him on a plane to south africa and let him carry on in business skinner glanced at andy martin looked around the room then back at mcllhenney not this time neil no one ties my hands not in my own country or anywhere else if mr hawkins is coming here on a project then if we can we will stop him with whatever force is appropriate if by ill luck he succeeds in his objective well do our damnedest to make sure he doesnt leave scotland but if he does hell be hunted down i have a free hand in this as i said people like hawkins are useful for a time this mans time is up wherever else he goes after this it wont be back to cape town the big question though mr skinner said superintendent harry mcguigan why would he come to scotland if we knew that for sure we could plan very specifically but we can make some pretty decent guesses and one thats really informed political asked mcguigan almost certainly this guy only works for governments and their opponents the dcc leaned back in his chair stretching his long lean body what political target in scotland would be important enough to justify the hiring of a very expensive international assassin to take him out lets begin with the obvious there are currently five members of the british cabinet from scottish constituencies as of now theyre all on roundtheclock protection but realistically only two stand out as potential targets the defence secretary and the foreign secretary ministry of defence security have been given overall responsibility for protecting those two that makes me happy since my friend adam arrow will be in command of that end and hes a bit special im pretty confident that if either of those two men is hawkins target his chances of success are poor other possibilities a member of the royal family he shook his head i dont believe that one for a minute okay maybe a splinter irish nationalist group might like to kill a british royal but those boys would want to do the job themselves i cant see them hiring in outside talent nevertheless that angle isnt being ruled out all royal visits in scotland have been quietly cancelled until the threat is eliminated no the intelligent guess has to be that if hawkins is coming to scotland on a contract in line with his cryptic remark to his cia girlfriend then his target is a vip visitor rather than a scot and thats where this gets really worrying because heres where i get round to the informed supposition i mentioned earlier it hasnt been announced yet but in a couple of months time in december there will be a special meeting of world heads of government and finance ministers to consider the effect of the international response to the continuing global economic crisis its an initiative by our own prime minister who as youll have noticed likes to cultivate his image on the international stage where he looked around the table at eight frowning faces youve guessed it people right here in bonnie scotland in the edinburgh international conference centre to be precise the usa germany france russia the peoples republic of china japan canada italy singapore malaysia indonesia and many others have been invited to attend until now the only people who have known about this meeting have been the people involved and their immediate advisers the main players agreed the timing and venue at the last g meeting eicc dont even know yet that theyre hosting it so if michael hawkins trip to scotland is related to that it points to someone on the invitation list having ordered a hit on someone else now that might be a bad omen for international relations but its a secondary issue for me i dont need to remind you that a few years back a visiting head of state was assassinated right here in edinburgh the argument that he was better off dead cuts no ice with me he was done on my patch i swore then that such a thing would never happen again it wont ive been told that we dont need to worry about protection in this case that will be the job of the military advised by sir john govan i dont envy jock his task the armys security approach is usually based on deterrence hawkins wont be scared off by any number of soldiers hes clever hes resourceful and as far as anyone knows he has never failed all he needs is one opening and the president of the united states or russia or our prime minister christ maybe more than one of them can kiss their arse goodbye the dcc smiled calmly lady and gentlemen he said we are going to prevent that if michael van roost hawkins is in scotland we are going to find him if he has yet to arrive we are going to try to nab him at his port of entry you and your officers all have no other task but this each of you will report progress to me through detective sergeant mcllhenney on a daily basis any instructions neil may give you will be with my full authority watch the airports of course but lets proceed on the assumption that hes here already your starting point will be to check all landing cards completed by noneu nationals on entry to the uk you will receive full cooperation if necessary from your opposite numbers in police forces in england and wales remember that they do not need to know what this is all about nor should they its quite possible that hawkins will be travelling on a false eu passport and in that case there will be no landing card so hotel checks are important too he may have rented accommodation speak to all the letting agencies in your areas of course when you go to check the properties indeed whenever theres a chance you could come face to face with this bloke you will be armed thats not a suggestion its an order skinner picked up a number of sealed envelopes which he had brought with him into the room and handed them round these are some photofit treatments of hawkins prepared by the people in ml theyre based on the last photograph you saw and they show how he might look in a variety of disguises one thing he cant hide though van roost took a bullet in the right leg towards the end of his army days and hes walked with a limp ever since as well as the prints youll also find in those envelopes ds mcllhenneys office and home phone numbers plus my own and mr martins why would he come here so far ahead of the meeting sir asked di burns from fife planning inspector planning this man is meticulous in everything he does if someone attending this conference is his target then his track record says that hell come here weeks in advance to check out the cityscape to work out the best positions for an attempt and to prepare his means of escape this man is not a martyr his aim will be to complete his contract and fade into the background what do we do if we find him boss mcguire spoke quietly but his voice was loaded with meaning keep him under observation if you can said skinner and send for me try not to confront him but if you have to and he as much as looks at you the wrong way put a bullet in him what you mean in his good leg sir said di impey from dumfries and galloway srriling along the table pokerfaced the dcc turned and looked at the man freezing his grin no inspector he ground the words out slowly i mean right between the bloody eyes if he has to this man will kill you stone dead then take your head as a trophy with a nod around the table and a final glare at impey he stood up bringing the briefing to a close and strode out of the room followed by mcllhenney leaving martin to see the visitors on their way i dont fancy that dumfries bloke boss said the sergeant as they walked along the command corridor the neither neil give him a hard time when he makes his daily reports question him keep him on his toes make sure hes checking the ferry terminals on his patch hawkins could come in from ireland ill do that sir as the two men stepped into the chief constables office skinner looked at his assistant neil he asked abruptly whats up what do you mean sir you know bloody well what i mean first andy now you youve got something on your mind i know this job can be boring at times do you want a move back to the action mcllhenneys great shoulders sagged and he seemed to slump into himself im sorry if ive been letting anything show boss he said thats not my way aye he admitted somethings up but its got nothing to do with the job its olive shes ill and she knows it yet she wont do anything about it shes scared boss and oh by christ so am i i see said skinner quietly sit down man and tell me about it maybe theres something i can do to help although brian mackies patch took in a big rural area the divisional cid commanders office was in the st leonards police station on the east of edinburgh the detective superintendent did not care for the modern brick building and would have preferred to have been based in haddington beside his deputy detective chief inspector maggie rose but he kept these feelings to himself understanding the thinking behind andy martins deployment of his cid resources he was at his desk in midaftemoon reading his way through faxed witness statements taken from the neighbours ofgaynor weston in oldbarns when there was a light knock on the door come in called mackie he had expected a uniformed officer with more statements from maggie rose and so he looked up in surprise as dr sarah grace skinner stepped into the room hello doc the thin bald detective exclaimed standing with his unfailing courtesy an office consultation this is an honour sarah grinned at him suddenly it struck him that the drab wet day outside was just a little brighter all part of the service in this new era of forensic pathology she said as the took a seat at mackies conference table coffee he offered no thanks and you shouldnt either im trying to cut down bobs consumption just now too you desk jockeys drink far too much of that damn stuff desk jockeys indeed mackie grunted but with a smile youll wind the boss up if you call him that to his face s not true anyway where was i at six oclock this morning yeah i know i was only kidding with you not about the coffee though to be serious ive just finished the autopsy on mrs weston my report is being produced right now and should be with you before five oclock but i thought id call in and talk it through with you indamn she broke off as her mobile telephone warbled its call signal frowning slightly as she produced it from the pocket of her jacket im sorry brian i forgot to switch it off she took the call nonetheless pressing the receive button bob hi look im in a meeting right now yes okay mackie watched her as she listened for almost a minute yes she said eventually she was hesitant and wore worried frown on her face i can do that ill need to be careful to avoid ethical problems but yes okay ill do it after this give me the address she switched the phone to her left hand took a notebook and pen from her bag and scribbled a few words quickly got that i know where it is too see you tonight bye she ended the call switched off the phone and put it away problem asked mackie i hope not sarah replied the worried look lingering on her face something that bob volunteered me to do thats all she snapped her gaze back on to the detective okay once more mrs weston ive done a full postmortem examination and had most of the lab work rushed through the plastic bag over the head was a precaution or maybe it was meant to distract us i dont know but it was unnecessary gaynor weston died from a massive overdose of diamorphine injected into her left thigh she would have lost consciousness in seconds and died within two minutes there was no question of suffocation there were no signs of violence on the body and nothing at all to indicate that the subject had been restrained before the injection was administered shortly before her death she ate a fillet steak medium rare with courgettes and french fries also over a longer period she drank the best part of a bottle of red wine and followed it with black coffee any sign of recent sexual activity no brian none at all i cant help you with a dna trace im afraid she shook her head there were no romantic goodbyes here when the meal was over gaynor sat in her kitchen chair placed where it could be seen from outside after the event and allowed herself to be put to death mackie leaned forward you could state on oath that there was no possibility of the injection being selfinflicted no but what i will say is that even if she fixed the bag over her own head first there was no possibility of the victim injecting herself directly into an artery then disposing of the hypodermic before she lost consciousness you didnt find the tape at the scene and if you didnt find a hypo or a bottle with traces of diamorphine which we didnt then that will rule out the possibility of suicide the minimum any jury could possibly do would be return a verdict of culpable homicide dependent on the mental state of the perpetrator but this was so premeditated that you will have about a ninetynine percent chance of a murder conviction in any trial assuming that you can place the accused at the scene at the time excellent said mackie but why why did gaynor weston let herself be switched off sarah looked at him unblinking about two weeks ago mrs weston had an operation to remove a growth from her left leg there was another growth on her foot and the factthat it hadnt been excised indicates to me that it had developed since then i removed it and had it analysed the woman had a malignant melanoma a form of cancer which offers little prospect of a cure unless it is discovered at a very early stage in this case from the depth of the earlier excision when i explored it if that too was a melanoma as i am quite certain it was from the nature of the procedure i would say that the size of the tumour removed would have pointed to a prognosis of death within three to four months the disease had already metastasised to the spine liver and lungs any treatment would have been purely palliative the most honest course of action would simply have been to keep the patient as comfortable as possible for the time she had left that would have meant in effect limited chemical treatments supported by tranquillisers and increasing sedation diamorphine would have been used in increasing quantities to keep mrs weston out of pain in the event she took the lot at once brian mackie let out a great sigh very neat and tidy for her he said but a right bloody mess for us shit why didnt she top herself down in hawick say on john mcgrigors patch big johns a pragmatist hed probably have washed the glasses planted a roll of tape and a syringe at the scene and closed the book on it wed better find out where she had this operation two weeks ago then take a close look at her circle of friends i can help you with the first part of that sarah offered normally a procedure like this one would have been performed in the department of clinical oncology at the western general hospital i checked with them it wasnt the royal infirmary has no record of it either nor has st johns in livingston nor bangour nor roodlands i asked at murrayfield hospital and they said no but then i checked with st marthas a little private clinic on the south side of the city the administrator there said that she was bound by confidentiality and wouldnt talk to me i told her who i was and what i was doing but she still would not open her mouth not without a court order she insisted so if you want to search her records you better go get a sheriffs warrant ill talk to her myself before i go that far mackie replied but maybe andy martin and i should shortcircuit all that and go to see the exhusband given his profession his has to be the main name in the frame only if you can place him at the scene we can probably do that according to witness accounts he was a regular caller at oldbarns so hell have left traces of himself the big problem is placing him or anyone else for that matter in the house at the time of gaynor westons last supper he picked up the witness statements none of the neighbours saw a bloody thing even if someone walked in this minute and confessed we wouldnt have enough to go to trial at the moment our only hope of that rests with the clever people in arthur dorwards forensics lab but i cant see how even theyre going to help this time andy martin and mario mcguire sat in the head ofcids office on the second floor of the fettes headquarters building half an hour after the visitors had departed after skinner and mcllhenney had withdrawn the chief superintendent had continued the briefing for a few more minutes until he was sure that each of the visiting officers had a complete grasp of the situation and that everyones priorities in the search for the assassin were the same all of scotlands police forces have points of entry to the country within their territory even central which although it has no ferry ports or air terminals does have docking facilities at the bp oil installation at grangemouth martins concern was that every possible route into scotland should be identified and covered as far as possible if you were him sir asked mcguire what would you do the dcss vivid green eyes flashed as he smiled grimly at his colleague whats the most obvious thing he said throwing the question back fly into the busiest airport i suppose which has to be heathrow then catch the shuttle or hire a car and drive to scotland and if you were hawkins where would you fly from mcguire stroked his chin his black beard grew fast a dark shadow always showed by midaftemoon for all that he had a wet shave every morning anywhere but south africa he answered eventually right but if you were south african and your real name was van roost maybe your natural inclination might be to route through holland the low countries airlines are making a real effort to pinch travellers from scotland away from london you can access just about anywhere in the world out of glasgow edinburgh or aberdeen through schiphol and brussels that works in the other direction too so youd better check out kim and sabena landings their computers should tell you the origin of each passengers journey even if they were onward travellers from outside holland or belgium damn it martin scolded himself i should have come up with this clever thought that at the briefing mario make sure that big neil passes that on to mcguigan and macintosh so that glasgow and aberdeen landings are checked too ach ill tell them myself no the boss has set up the chain of communication through mcllhenney so that he can keep in touch with everything thats happening lets do it his way very good sir ill nip along and tell neil now you do that the detective inspector started for the door hang on a minute the dcs called out are you happy that youve got enough manpower for this job well mcguire answered slowly since you ask another set of legs with a sharp brain to drive them wouldnt do any harm okay ill lend you karen neville or sammy pye from my personal staff take your pick the di frowned considering his choice are either of them firearms trained both first class shots the pair of them then its hard to choose between them but ill take neville maggies worked with her and rates her pretty highly okay youve got her pick her up on your way out and brief her remember though she only needs to know that were looking for this guy she doesnt need to know why mcguire nodded and turned towards the door once more only to hear a knock then see it open as brian mackie stepped into the room martin looked up surprised hello thin man he said what brings you here he waved a hand in farewell as the special branch commander left cheers mario good luck with what asked mackie casually as the door closed his lottery ticket so whats up the tall detective looked up glumly this oldbarns investigation thats what he handed a folder to the head of cid thats sarahs postmortem report the woman was full of cancer undoubtedly shed have died within months someone helped her on the way with a great big dose of pharmaceutical heroin any thoughts on who i dont want to jump to any conclusions here ive sent maggie and young stevie steele from clan pringles division out to interview the boyfriend to see how he reacts however someone performed an operation on mrs weston two weeks ago theres no record of it in any of the main hospitals or at the murrayfield but sarah found a wee private clinic on the south side thats acting a bit shifty they clammed up when she asked them about it im wondering whether her exhusband whos a surgeon remember did the exploratory op and then did her a favour when she asked martin finished his colleagues supposition for him hed have had access to the drugs i suppose ach id be heart sorry for the poor bastard if he did that even although its against my principles unless mackie began hesitated for a few second then gathered his breath and went on unless we succumb to a rare burst of professional incompetence and close the book on this one write it up for the fiscal as a suicide the head of cid looked at his friend in silence for around thirty seconds then he opened sarahs report and read it still without a word finally he looked up brian id hate to see this man lose his career and his liberty for doing something that he wasnt cruel enough to refuse but were only investigators mate not judge not jury not even prosecutors whatever our different private feelings we have a public duty to establish facts and report them to the fiscal and we cant neglect it not ever lets you and i follow this for a bit one step at a time first lets pay a joint visit to this clinic that obstructed sarah and give them a hard time until they tell us whether mrs weston was a patient there and if so who treated her well see where we go from there martin paused what have you done about the press roystons told them that were waiting for the result of the pm before reporting to the fiscal sarahs still waiting for a small piece of lab work so technically thats still true fine it can stay like that overnight lets go and see this clinic whats it called by the way st marthas andy martin grunted with a grim anger which surprised his colleague she wont be much help to them if they get in my way olive mcllhenney was not an easy woman to take off guard her husband had been trying for many years to achieve this but with very few successes however when she opened her front door and saw who was standing on the step a green barbour thrown over her shoulders to protect her from the rain her normally imperturbable expression changed to one of complete surprise dr skinner she exclaimed come in quick out of the rain you remember me then said sarah as she stepped into the narrow hall way of the semidetached villa the two women had met only once at a social event more than a year earlier of course i do here give me your coat what brings you here anyway as well as being unshakeable olive was quick witted even as she was hanging the waxed cotton raincoat on one of a row of hooks behind the front door she answered her own question has that husband of mine been talking to you she asked quickly too quickly for the cough took her unawares racking her body sending colour to her cheeks making her visitor realise how pale they had been before and highlighting the contrast of the dark circles under her eyes she produced an inhaler from the pocket of her cardigan and took two quick puffs no sarah replied truthfully as the fit subsided neil hasnt said a word to me but my husband has been worrying about him and this afternoon finally he made him tell him what was wrong so if you want to blame anyone for this visit blame bob as she spoke she followed her hostess into the living room where lauren and spencer were watching grange hill intently neither turned as the two women passed through into the kitchen although the chocolatepoint siamese cat which lay on the floor between them did flick an ear in their direction olives complexion had paled once more after the paroxysm maybe i shouldnt say this to you but neil never has trusted doctors she said as she closed the door on the children hes just being silly my gp says i have a touch of asthma thats why she gave me the inhaler and does it help asked sarah very quietly catching her eye as she did so not allowing her to look away no it doesnt she answered in a whisper no i didnt think it had olive im here as a friend and the last thing i want to do is to undermine your confidence in your relationship with your family doctor but i have to ask you have you had a chest xray recently the other woman shook her head not in the last seven years my last one was clear though she added quickly has your doctor suggested an xray no how long have you had this cough olive frowned leaning back against a worksurface and looking at the ceiling i suppose it would have been around the end of june when it started i had a bit of bother when we were on holiday just after that neil and i like to walk but i found that i was getting short of breath if we went too far we gave up on the walks and the problem went away i put it down to a chest infection at the time then at the end of september it came back i went to see dr jones then she said it was probably asthma and gave me the inhaler i see sarah paused listen olive i have to be honest here if you were my patient id have sent you for an xray straight away to eliminate certain possibilities if nothing else she glanced at her watch i have a friend who works in the chest clinic at the western i checked with her earlier shes on duty now and shell fit you in if you like i could take you along there best have this cleared up yes olive mcllhenney looked at her shrewdly she knew exactly what was being said what her visitor meant by certain possibilities she had smoked too many cigarettes in the years between ages fifteen and thirtyfour not to have been aware of them still those were possibilities for others not for her well she said at last if itll reassure that big daft bugger of a husband of mine why not hang on here a minute ill ask my neighbour to keep an eye on the kids and the cat till neil gets home then ill write a note for him and we can be off she moved towards the back door that sure is a lovely cat sarah remarked casually samson yes the kids spoil him rotten as she turned to answer sarah noticed for the first time a small lump on the right side of her neck st marthas andy martin read the name aloud that was all there was picked out in gold lettering on the small green board fixed to the gatepost at the entrance to the big red sandstone villa in one of the quietest streets in the grange one of the wealthiest of edinburghs southern suburbs doesnt tell you a lot does it no said mackie as private clinics go this one seems almost secret lets go and find out what secrets they are keeping the head ofcid locked his silver mondeo and led the way up the gravel path holding a huge golf umbrella as shelter against the rain the storm doors of the clinic were open as they reached them revealing a big greyglasspanelled door inside as martin folded the umbrella in the wide vestibule mackie tried the door handle it turned and they stepped inside the entrance hall was a study in mahogany the polished floor shone a heavy balustrade ran up the wide stairway which led to the upper floor and a huge piece of furniture all coat hooks and mirrors stood against one wall facing a varnished door on which the word reception was etched on a brass plate mackie tried the second door but it was locked as he frowned at the head ofcid a woman appeared at the rear of the big hallway im afraid our office is closed gentlemen she said sharply in any event we do not receive representatives without appointment you will receive us though madam the detective chief superintendent barked back at her producing his warrant card as he spoke we are police officers afterwards it occurred to brian mackie that andy martin normally would have seen the funny side of her remark i see murmured the woman examining his card and mackies closely she looked to be in her early fifties dressed in a severe grey skirt and pullover which almost matched her hair it was drawn back in a bun i in mm am miss emma pople she said through thin lips this woman has all the warmth of a mackerel thought mackie i am the administrator here what is the reason for your visit what services do you provide here martin asked we provide convalescent facilities for roman catholic ladies recovering from surgery or other debilitating treatments st marthas is owned by an order of nuns some of our patients are themselves sisters who attends your patients usually they are seen by the surgeons or physicians in whose care they have been do you have surgical facilities here we have a small theatre for emergencies we dont have health board approval for everyday surgery ah i see so is that why you obstructed our pathologist colleague when she called you earlier on today for this first time emma pople looked unsure of herself you remember martin went on her names dr skinner she called this clinic earlier today asking for information on a mrs gaynor weston more specifically whether she had ever been a patient here you did speak to her didnt you the womans mouth set even tighter that is correct i was unable to help her no miss pople you refused to help her told her to get a court order i believe i may have done i may tell you the same thing just you do that maam said the head of cid evenly in that event mr mackie and i will take you at your word well go to the sheriff and hell give us a warrant to search these premises but we wont do it privately or even quietly well make a fuss about it in the media and well make damn sure lothian health board hears about it too is that what you want would the holy sisters appreciate the publicity would the health board like what we might find emma pople looked at him and realised that he would do exactly as he threatened her grey armour seemed to crack very well she muttered defeated come through to my office the television was still on when olive mcllhenney showed sarah into her living room but this time neil was watching shirtsleeved and alone as the opening titles of the bill showed on the screen looking for tips on policing sarah ventured with an awkward smile the big sergeant turned to look at her he began to heave himself out of his chair until she waved him to stay seated i was mocking the afflicted actually he answered none of those buggers would last five minutes with the boss that cid room of theirs is a joke most of them seem to be sat on their backsides all day kids upstairs olive asked he nodded in reply ill just go and see what theyre up to you have a chat with sarah a quick look passed between husband and wife sarah saw it and thought that she had never seen so much said without words in only a moment in time youve got something to tell me he said quietly as the door closed as she looked at him she felt fears cold hand clutch her stomach this was not something she had ever done before not to a friend at least none of her training had covered this moment yes neil i have olive asked me to explain things to you alone while shes with lauren and spencer she and i have just been to the chest clinic at the western we saw dr miller one of the registrars there shes a very fine doctor we couldnt have seen anyone better she sent olive for an xray when the print came back it showed a big patch covering most of the lower part of her right lung the left one is clear she paused what does that mean neil asked speaking slowly as if to keep his voice steady it could have meant pneumonia with other symptoms or pleurisy in the present circumstances the next stage of investigation would normally have been a bronchoscopy thats a procedure in which an instrument is passed into the lung and a piece of tissue is snipped out for biopsy however dr miller found a lump in one of the lymphatic glands at the base of the neck she took tissue from that with a needle and sent that for analysis i persuaded her to call in a favour from someone in the lab and have it rushed through while we were there she stopped to gather herself and to fight back the tears which she knew were not far away a biopsy tests for malignancy neil i am afraid that olives was positive she has what is known as a nonsmall cell carcinoma of the right lung its at a fairly advanced stage since it has metastasised into the lymphatic system she looked at the big detective and he stared back at her are you telling me that olive has lung cancer sarah is that what all that stuff means yes her answer was a whisper yet it seemed to fill the room neil sagged back into his chair feeling the cold sweep through his body feeling his heart hammering in his chest feeling a panic akin to nausea rising in his throat what are our chances he asked his voice as quiet as hers all the better with you at her side sarah replied this disease cant be cured but there are treatments which can drive it into remission dr miller has arranged an appointment with one of the consultants in the department of clinical oncology at the western general his names derek simmers hes fitting olive in at his friday clinic tomorrow afternoon at two fifteen would it help if we went private she shook her head brushing her auburn hair against her shoulders not at all there is no finer centre for the treatment of cancer anywhere in the country than the western general its a major research hub and it exchanges information with other centres around the world so whatever treatment is offered to olive will be stateoftheart hes good then this simmers asked neil struggling to control the shivers which were coursing through his body the best will he operate can he cut the thing out i cant say for sure but as i understand it surgical intervention at this stage of olives disease would be unlikely because of the metastasis it would have to be radical and there would always be a danger that it would actually make the cancer spread faster does olive know all this i think she knew it before we went to the clinic sudden fierce anger shone in his eyes and that gp of hers told her she had asthma he snapped ill have the woman struck off neil said sarah urgently we all make clinical judgements based on what we see and on what our patients tell us anyhow you cant let yourself be sidetracked by anything right now dr miller has written to dr jones telling her whats happened and ill speak to her myself tomorrow you have to be completely focused on helping olive fight this thing dont think about anything else ill speak to bob and im sure hell give you compassionate leave as and when you need it i dont want that the detective replied at once ill go with her to see simmers tomorrow of course but we have to hold on to our normal life as far as we can i understand that and its good she bit her bottom lip an unconscious gesture god neil i cant advise you on this because i cant really imagine being in your shoes oh no he countered quietly what about that time the boss was stabbed she smiled sadly no that was different that was only a forty eight hour crisis you and olive have a longer fight on your hands to beat this thing but beat it we will neil mcllhenney said determinedly as the door opened and olive came into the room she was smiling sarah thought it was the bravest thing she had ever seen she turned patted her on the shoulder and without a word left them together she was in her car shoulders wet from the rain which was still falling heavily before finally the tears caught up with her couldnt you have visited me at my office tomorrow the man asked as he showed maggie rose into his small study id have called at your office this afternoon mr futcher the red haired detective replied but you were out and your secretary didnt know when youd be back she glanced around the study the ornately papered walls were covered in photographs of its owner mostly in evening dress and all with other people in groups as her gaze panned around the room she recognised several sports and show business personalities three scottish business heroes and a number of public figures including to her surprise deputy chief constable bob skinner did you tell my wife why youre here when she answered the door not that it matters of course he added too hastily no we simply introduced ourselves and asked to see you terry futcher glanced at detective sergeant stevie steele why are there two of you anyway its our normal practice in circumstances like these the detective chief inspector answered i take it you know why were here futcher nodded his head he was a tall wellbuilt man in his early forties sunbronzed even in late autumn with immaculately groomed brown hair and a tightly trimmed beard yes i can guess youve come about gay he pointed to a green leather chesterfield settee take a seat please he offered lowering himself into a matching armchair take a seat thank you said rose settling against an arm of the comfortable sofa how long have you known mrs weston mr futcher she asked for just over four years how did you meet i hired her consultancy firm to train my people she was a specialist in human resources an inelegant term for what people used to call personnel management she was very good on teambuilding and motivation and i thought she could add a cutting edge to our new business presentations i must admit that at first i thought her methods were a bit silly but they worked very well the agencys billings have grown in each of the years shes been helping us your relationship went beyond the office though didnt it futcher did not meet her gaze as he nodded since when that started a few months after she came to work for us and its been going on ever since how often did you see each other hard to say really the adman replied wed get together whenever we could arrange it would you describe it as an intense relationship hell no the opposite in fact it was a very relaxed thing we liked each other a great deal and we had sex on occasion but we werent in love with each other futcher took a breath look inspector i play around okay i mean its the sort of bloke i am as for gay she came out of a marriage a few years back principally to make her own space and live her own life our arrangement didnt threaten that and it didnt threaten my own marriage thats as frank as i can be with you you couldnt have put it more clearly said rose tell me did mrs weston have any other er arrangements to use your term was she seeing anyone else you mean not that i know of she certainly never gave me any hint of that but to be honest i wouldnt have known if she was i never visited gay without checking that it was okay with her that was the way she wanted it all part of her having that space of hers futcher broke off sinking deeper into his chair gazing at the ceiling when did you find out about mrs westons death sir steele asked him quietly this afternoon he replied gathering himself my secretary picked up a copy of the evening news at lunchtime there was a story about police being at the scene of the death of a single woman at oldbams steading she showed it to me as soon as she saw it as far as i know there are were only two single women living out there gay and joan ball i switched on radio forth their two oclock news bulletin gave out the name are you telling us that your secretary knew about mrs weston futcher glanced at the young detective katie knows everything about me sergeant shes been with me since i founded the futcher agency twelve years ago from your concern a few minutes ago i guess your wife doesnt know about her though futcher looked at steele again uncomfortably and with a touch of anger showing no she bloody doesnt he snapped what did you do when you heard that mrs weston was dead asked rose i went to church to the cathedral at the end of york place to pray im a practising catholic you should practise a bit harder at least until you get to the bit about the commandments the response was on the tip of the detective chief inspectors tongue but she fought it back all afternoon she asked instead almost i went back to the office just after five and asked katie to call a journalist friend others in the heralds edinburgh office to see what he knew he told her that the police were being cagey about it is that right is there a problem how did she die rose ignored his questions when was the last time you saw mrs weston futcher stroked his beard just over a fortnight ago he replied just before she went into hospital she went into hospital she told me she was going into a clinic for a minor operation she didnt say what it was for so i assumed it was some sort of womens thing have you spoken to her since several times by telephone she told me that the operation had been fine that she was recuperating and that everything would be sorted out soon is that your phrase or hers asked rose the man looked at her curiously for a second hers in fact her exact words i remember her saying them i remember it vividly what did you take her to mean by that i suppose i thought she meant that her plumbing would all be healed up and we could his voice tailed off and you could resume a sexual relationship steele offered thats right where were you in the early hours of this morning mr futcher he looked round eyes narrowing at her sudden sharp question rose leaned forward on the leather settee closer to him in bed he answered quietly from when from about eleven oclock you didnt go to oldbams last night did you no i did not you didnt help gaynor weston end her own life futchers face paled is that what happened you were nowhere near oldbams at two oclock this morning you were in bed no i wasnt he gasped yes i was maggie rose settled back into the comfortable old chesterfield and smiled gently at him thats okay then im sorry to have been so direct mr futcher we have to ask these questions you understand he sighed yes of course good thats good she glanced round at steele thats us almost finished stevie yes maam just one other thing to do really thats right the chief inspector still smiling looked back across at futcher if youd ask your wife to join us sir just to confirm formally that you were here in bed at two oclock this morning the last vestige of the bronzed look vanished from the mans face no he cried out leave penny out of this im sorry sir said rose trying to sound as if she really meant it i know its difficult for you but we need corroboration of your story for the fiscal terry futcher thrust himself out of his armchair took a pace towards the rooms small window then turned abruptly to face the two police officers once more then dont ask penny he snarled at them i was in bed all right you bastards but i never said i was here i was with katie my secretary here take this you look as though you need itbob handed his wife a huge vodka and tonic ice and lemon fighting to break the bubbling surface near the brim of the crystal tumbler oh i do my love how do i need it barefoot she leaned back against the kitchen worksurface and took a mouthful of the strong mixture are the boys asleep jazz is marks reading he took a deep breath reading her silence bad is it he asked at last she nodded and sipped again at her drink its bad all right poor olive poor neil poor kids olive has lung cancer with at least one secondary in her lymph glands theyll give her a scan at the oncology clinic to determine whether its spread any further than that honey she said bitterly its at times like this i feel thankful that i work in pathology i dont think i could cope if i had to hand down death sentences on a daily basis he threw back his head exhaling a great gasp of air oh dear christ he exclaimed filling up with blind helpless anger olive and neil mcllhenney are as nice a couple as youll meet in a days march they adore each other and those kids of theirs are a pair of wee gems what the fuck have they done to deserve this does she have any hope he asked depends on what the scan shows if there are no other metastases then clearly her chances will be better im no expert on current treatments but i do know the stats they show that the great majority of people with this type of cancer at this stage of development die within a couple of years however being as positive as i can the available figures only show the position as it was about five years ago thats how long it takes for the statistical picture to emerge against that the oncologists the drug companies and the clinical researchers are rewriting the book on cancer every day i dare say i could connect to the internet right now and find a whole list of treatments for lung cancer that ive never heard of before bob turned down the heat on the rice and on the marinera sauce crossed to the fridge and poured himself a drink as big as the one he had mixed for his wife as an afterthought he topped up her glass with vodka is there anything we can do to help them he asked you can give neil tomorrow afternoon off for openers so that he can go to the clinic jesus ill send him on compassionate leave as of this minute no said sarah quickly he must be the judge of that olives teaching career will be on hold for a long time at the very best but its important for them both from a morale point of view that he continues to work as normally as he can neil picked that up right away one thing did occur to me though do you know what the grandparent situation is his forehead furrowed characteristically as he thought neils fathers dead his mother has pretty bad arthritis she lives in a sheltered flat olives mother isnt around any more she went off to england with another bloke years ago her dads a civil servant works in the benefits agency up in aberdeen brothers and sisters olive has a brother hes a soldier based in aldershot neil has a brother called charlie and a sister called mavis hes in australia and shes in canada right in those circumstances the most helpful thing that we could do for them is to look after lauren and spencer as the need arises if this disease is treatable itll be done mostly on an outpatient basis and olive could be pretty sick for a day or two after each session itd be best if the kids didnt see that so if there are no handy relatives why dont we offer to put them up absolutely he turned back towards the hob and their supper life can be a bitch sarah can it not he said quietly as she came to stand beside him until ten minutes ago i was getting quietly worked up about my daughter putting her career before her relationship with andy something like this puts that well in perspective it makes me feel guilty too about how lucky i am if everyone got what they deserve then how would my life have panned out and neils he lay in the dark staring at the ceiling listening to his wife breathing beside him waiting for his emotions to define themselves since sarah had broken the news he had felt rage pity and a terrible terrible fear all mixed together he and olive had eaten a quiet supper and then they had gone to bed her dignified palefaced silence had upset him more than anything else but he had been afraid to break it afraid that if he did he would say the wrong thing at last she turned to him and he took her in his strong arms beneath the duvet her tears came then great heaving frightened sobs why me she asked him why me because my darling he said softly his deep voice quavering as she had never heard it before there is in this world no fairness no justice and no righteousness if there were things like this just wouldnt happen he pressed a hand to her breast love if i could take this thing from out of you and put it into me you know that i would i cant do that but i will be at your side as you fight it every step of the way this is a team game were in it together for you are what my life is about lets agree two things first that whatever treatment they offer we grab it and second that through it all the d word will never be mentioned okay he felt rather than saw her nod im sorry to be so weak she whispered you weak he chuckled in spite of himself you are about as weak as a large whisky and im bru you are the strongest woman ive ever known this bloody disease doesnt have a clue what its letting itself in for taking on olive mcllhenney just keep giving it that look of yours itll get the message and bugger off sharpish i wish it was that easy aye but it is in a way i know next to nothing about these things but i do know that determination has a big part to play she kissed his chest okay ill do that ill give it the silencer and you can take it somewhere quiet and give it a kicking well teach the bloody thing to try to come between us he gets around then this mr futcher said the head of cid as he and brian mackie turned the corner into crewe road south the western general hospital lies only a quarter of a mile from the police headquarters building in fettes avenue and so the two detectives had decided to walk to their appointment with professor nolan weston the rain of the previous day had gone but the afternoon was drab and cold martin seemed to wear its greyness like an overcoat to match his mood he and alex had spent a silent night the crisis between them remained unresolved so it seems mackie answered maggie and steele saw katie meams the secretary bird first thing this morning she backed up his story right enough she told them that futcher and she worked late the night before mrs weston died when they were finished he took her for a steak then ran her home she invited him in for coffee and afters as she sometimes does she says and he stayed until two in the morning did maggie believe her yes on balance she did so did stevie they gave her a moderately hard time made her go over the story time and again she never varied at all eventually she got annoyed and went into some very graphic detail about the size offutchers tackle impressive apparently his line to the other ladies is that the wife cant take too much of it the superintendent paused i was thinking of asking maggie to go along and take a look at the evidence he added with a sidelong smile unless you wanted to lend me karen neville that is martin chuckled in spite of himself neville would love the job im sure but shes doing something else just now he said as the two men turned into the hospitals entrance roadway the department of clinical oncology is a complex which includes some of the newest buildings within the western generals sprawling grounds mackie led the way through the automatic glass doors and into the yellow brick reception area professor weston please he said to the nursing assistant seated behind its high wooden counter youre the gentlemen from the police she asked quietly martin nodded yes hes expecting you if you go round the corner through the double doors and up the first flight of stairs then through another set of doors youll find his office third on the right ill buzz him and let him know that youre coming they followed her directions to the letter as they pushed their way through the second set of doors they found a tall man standing in the hall he was shirtsleeved in the warmth of the hospital wearing the trousers of a brown suit he was as bald as brian mackie but his head seemed bigger and more pointed than the superintendents gentle dome gentlemen he greeted them solemnly im nolan weston hello professor said martin accepting the proffered handshake as he introduced himself and his colleague glad you could see us so quickly well try not to take up too much of your time weston led them into a tiny room so small that there was barely room for two chairs on the other side of his desk this is about gay of course he began of course said the head ofcid when did you last see your ex wife professor three weeks ago the tall man answered as he folded himself awkwardly into his swivel chair she and i took raymond our son up to aberdeen for his first term at university thats just not true mr weston brian mackie exclaimed youve seen her since then he lifted his briefcase on to his lap opened it and took out a folder two weeks ago you removed a growth from her leg at st marthas private clinic in the grange a procedure for which those premises are not authorised incidentally these are your notes and the biopsy report which confirmed that your former wife was suffering from a malignant melanoma where the hell did you get those weston demanded angrily those are confidential not in the context of an inquiry into a suspicious death they aint martin retorted suspicious death extremely mackie went on i have here also a copy of our postmortem report which comments on the procedure you performed and says that secondary tumours were developing rapidly if you read it youll see that your exwifes death was caused by a massive overdose of diamorphine does that surprise you nolan weston looked at him impassively it saddens me superintendent but no to be frank it does not surprise me andy martin held up a hand perhaps at this stage sir you would like to consider legal representation it might be better if this interview continued on a more formal basis no no no exclaimed the surgeon lets carry on i want to hear where this is going lets go back to my first question then said mackie when did you last see mrs weston alive the last time i saw her at all officer was when i discharged her from st marthas i had a very difficult conversation with her about the biopsy report and i offered to refer her case at once to mr simmers a consultant colleague of mine she refused to let me do that she said that she wanted to go home for a couple of weeks to think things through and put her affairs in order i agreed to that on condition that if she experienced any growing discomfort she would contact me have you spoken to her since i phoned her a couple of times of an evening just to see that she was all right i spoke to her last on monday she said that everything was as it had been and she said that i would hear from her on thursday his head dropped briefly i understand what she meant now where were you on wednesday night sir specifically between midnight and two am i was at home in bed with my wife and she will confirm that if necessary she is extremely pregnant she kept me awake most of the night but why do you ask me this martin shifted in his uncomfortable chair because someone helped mrs weston end her life professor she was injected and a plastic bag was secured over her head she couldnt have done it herself no way whoever did it took away the syringe and the roll of the black tape which was used to secure the bag she had help no doubt about it this man she saw from time to time futcher the adman was it him no we dont think so there was a pause as weston looked from one detective to the other why were you so secretive about treating your former wife professor asked mackie because i didnt want my present wife to find out about it came the retort sharply couldnt you have referred her to someone else from the very start gay didnt want that she asked me to do the procedure and i always did what she asked including divorcing her averting his eyes once more weston nodded tell us about your relationship with her please said the head of cid the man across the desk laughed softly how long do you have he leaned back in his seat until his shoulders and the back of his head were touching the partition wall behind him gaynor and i were married for twelve years he began and throughout that time we were extremely happy or so i thought then on our twelfth anniversary she told me she was leaving me just like that she told me that there were things that she wanted to do with her life and that she simply could not achieve them within the confines of marriage there was no discussion she just moved out to a small flat in barnton a year later we were divorced by mutual consent we had joint custody of raymond but it was agreed that he should live with me during the school term during our separation and immediately after our divorce we didnt see much of each other nothing at all in fact if ray wasnt the reason i heard about her of course heard how her consultancy career was going from strength to strength raymond would mention the odd name too mens names gentlemen callers i suppose youd say almost all of my life was work at that period but not quite all i formed a relationship with avril my second wife at that time she was my secretary at the university and five years ago we married to my surprise gaynor didnt like that at all she didnt speak to me for a year then out of the blue i had a call from her asking me to bring ray out to oldbarns to which she had just moved for supper i did that and we had a good time together it was like being a family unit again almost this became a weekly event until one time whenray had flu i called her to tell her this but she asked me if id like to come anyway on my own weston looked at the two detectives you have to remember id never stopped loving her so i went out there for dinner on the excuse that we had to discuss rays schooling our relationship changed that night i found myself having an affair with my exwife did she regret the divorce asked martin no not for one minute the thing about gay you see was her craving for danger yet conversely she didnt like to feel threatened futcher the adman he was married too like me there was that element of risk of exposure but safety too in that the involvement was purely physical what about you you still loved her yes and she loved me but we had defined our relationship long before so there was you and there was futcher mackie intervened was there anyone else a shadow seemed to pass across nolan westons face there may have been he replied she told me once that futcher and i werent the only arrows in her quiver her phrase not mine but she never mentioned a name might your son have known asked the superintendent its possible ill ask him but not tonight hes still in shock poor lad as are we all to an extent its important sir if you cant we may have to interview him ourselves no leave him to me please ill have a talk with him tomorrow morning fair enough martin agreed but no later when did he get home last night he has a car up in aberdeen but i felt happier going up to collect him myself rather than let him make such a long drive in an emotional state you must have been fairly emotional yourself professor im a surgeon mr martin i was emotional two weeks ago when i realised that gay was going to die yesterday i felt an element of relief that she ray and i had been spared the weeks and months of torment which we had all faced you didnt give her the diamorphine did you professor the head of cid asked quietly no sir i did not to be frank with you had she asked me for it i think i would have done but she didnt just as well then said martin rising slowly to his feet thank you professor for your help brian give mr weston your number so that he can call you directly once hes spoken to his son the superintendents hand had already left his breast pocket a business card held between the first two fingers nolan weston walked his visitors to the top of the stairs the two policemen made their way silently down to the ground floor through the reception area which was much busier than it had been earlier and outside into the cold grey afternoon what did you think of him said mackie as the glass doors closed behind them martin stared at him blankly a shocked expression on his face what is it andy the superintendent asked you didnt see them then who where in there just now in the waiting area they had their backs to us but id know them anywhere neil and olive mcllhenney so far inspector there have been seventeen sightings of this man hawkins across europe skinner glanced at the report on his desk every one of them has been checked out and at the end of every one theres been a wild goose fake hawkinses have been seen in germany france poland italy switzerland england and spain oh sorry i forgot luxembourg these have all been registered in the past twentyfour hours the polish contact turned out to be a tall blonde transsexual who just happened to have a limp he smiled i guess well hear about a right few more before we fasten onto the right man if we ever do its not like you to sound pessimistic sir mcguire remarked realistic mario id rather you said realistic this bloke is a professional just like us let me ask you something if you wanted to go undercover for any purpose how easy dyou think it would be for us to find you yes even us your close colleagues the swarthy detective laughed you mean if i decided to do a runner from the wife how scarce could i make myself i suppose id do the obvious things id dye my hair and eyebrows another colour as far away from black as possible maybe red like maggie id wear glasses dark wherever i could to cut down the chance of eye contact with someone who might know me or might have seen a picture id try to do something with my teeth dye them too perhaps to make them less white and sparkly he paused thinking yes and id try to do something about my mannerisms as well to eliminate recognisable things like for example the way i smile my ace card though would be to speak italian everywhere i went skinner nodded right now i dont think that all of those things put together would fool maggie or me or mr martin or neil not the people closest to you but someone else even in the force theyd have trouble how many languages does hawkins speak asked mcguire suddenly hey the dcc responded thats a good question ill get on to london and ask them maybe were looking for a german or an italian not an italian boss even if he dyed his hair black like mine it wouldnt work his features are wrong ill take your word for it anyway it all leads into the point i was going to make you and i were amateurs in the anonymity business hawkins is a pro his life depends on it if you can come up with a few simple dodges on the spur of the moment hes going to pull something really special out of the hat all that artwork in the envelopes i handed out yesterday mario probably none of its worth a damn were blind my friend stone blind as coppers were used to events and people we can come to grips with and weve got all sorts of toys to help us look for them but in this task were an extension of the intelligence community groping about in the dark trying to catch a puff of smoke in our hands thats the way it is in their world they deal in rumour and suggestion not substance they stand sightless in some damn great gallery picking up each and every whisper analysing them giving them form and putting them together until the jigsaw picture is complete or at least recognisable skinner leaned back in his chair so inspector what murmurings have you been picking up around your patch mcguire shook his head so far boss the silence has been deafening neil mcllhenney stared out of the only window in the small consulting room it looked on to a car park in which every space seemed to be occupied i never realised he whispered to himself what said olive sharply beside him sorry love he replied i was thinking out loud the car parks here there are so many of them and theyre all full i never realised that there were so many sick people you just concentrate on this one the strain in her voice tore at his heart he reached across and took her hand feeling the pressure as she squeezed his sure love sure they had been in the clinic for just over two hours in that time olive had been weighed examined by a thinfaced girl who had introduced herself as dr berry mr simmers registrar and sent for a scan a few minutes before they had been called back into the consulting room they looked over their shoulders simultaneously as the door opened a tall wellbuilt fairhaired roundfaced man strode into the room wearing a white coat and with the tool of his trade a stethoscope hanging from his neck good afternoon he said im mr simmers your consultant sorry to have kept you waiting im afraid that the first consultation always seems to take for ever thats because there are so many things we have to do he sat not behind his desk but on it and looked directly at olive at once neil was struck by the gentleness of his eyes and by the calmness of his expression from out of nowhere an inexplicable feeling of relief swept over him the first thing i have to ask you mrs mcllhenney is this do you understand what is happening to you yes she replied the word was clipped but controlled thats good in these situations we cant afford to prevaricate you have an incurable disease mrs mcllhenney we cant avoid that fact you have a carcinoma of the right lung in the second stage of development now i use the word incurable because that in clinical terms is what it is however it is not untreatable there are ways of attacking your tumour and the secondary growth surgery isnt an option here not with the metastasis in the lymphatic system but we do have the options of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or a mixture of both there is a chance that if you react favourably your cancer can be driven into remission possibly indefinitely looking at your xray and on the basis of dr berrys examination i would propose that we start you on a course of chemotherapy radiation might have a part to play later depending on the rate of progress but not just yet for the first time the consultant looked at neil then back to olive his gentle blue eyes were unblinking im not going to play anything down here these treatments are aggressive and the sideeffects at least initially will be unpleasant youll experience a day or two of fairly violent sickness but well do what we can to control that using steroids however he paused however there is a further alternative which i have to put to you and that is that we simply give you palliative treatments and concentrate on keeping you as well and as comfortable as possible for as long as possible the choice has to be yours to her complete surprise she smiled at him you mean i can give up she asked then without waiting for a reply she looked sideways at neil raising her eyebrows very slightly he gave the briefest of nods olive mcllhenney turned back to the consultant as my husband would say if i didnt have him so well trained she said bugger that for a game of soldiers when do we start the treatment neil doesnt have the problem andy its olive whos in bother cancer look dont ask me about it man the big fella asked me for help and i got sarah involved if he wants to tell anyone about whats happening he will but until he does say something you and mackie forget about seeing them okay martin nodded emphatically absolutely ill call brian to let him know not that hes an office gossip type mind you christ he said its a cliche i know but something like this doesnt half put your own troubles into perspective dont talk to me about them either sarah and i have decided that you and alex can sort your own lives out selfish bastards we may be but you two are adults only you know how you feel he spun away from the window of his office lets change the subject hows the weston investigation coming along its not going to be a quick fix the head of cid replied that much i do know the husband looked like a good bet but he claimed that he was at home in bed with his wife brians gone to interview the lady but ive no doubt he was telling the truth anyone else in the frame well theres the son raymond professor weston let slip that he has a car up in aberdeen so its possible that he could have driven down to oldbams hes only a kid though just eighteen i dont think for a minute that his mother would have involved him in helping to end her life still hell have to be interviewed said skinner sure i know but its not a priority no theres one other line of enquiry open to us mrs weston was killed with a pharmaceutical quality drug if we can trace the source youre sure it couldnt have been street heroin bob the stuff was absolutely pure if anything like that was in circulation wed be finding bodies all over the city aye i suppose youre right so what are you going to do about it were doing it right now rose and steele are contacting the chief pharmacists in every hospital in the city asking them to verify their stocks of diamorphine and report any shortfalls the drugs squad maintains regular contact with the only manufacturer in the area but their procedures and security are exemplary so i dont believe for one moment that the stuff that killed mrs weston came from there the big dcc sat on the edge of the chiefs desk its bloody difficult to nick heroin from a hospital pharmacy as well the stuffs kept under lock and key and only released on a doctors signature he looked across at martin but maybe if you were a doctor a consultant even but nolan weston didnt do it according to his wife come on andy if you had solid circumstantial evidence against some hooligan and he offered his wife as an alibi would you accept it at face value bloody sure you wouldnt professors wives dont tell porkies is that what youre saying to me touche the chief superintendent laughed gently however if you were a juror not a cynical bastard of a copper but an ordinary innocent conscientious juror and the nice pregnant profs wife stood up in the witness box and swore on the bible that when her predecessor was offed she was making him a nice cup of hot chocolate would you believe her almost certainly you would it was skinners turn to smile anyway continued martin i believe weston the acting chief constable pushed himself off the desk and took two steps back to the window okay i wont argue with that suddenly his right hand shot up index finger pointing at his colleague so weston didnt do it but maybe he supplied the diamorphine he denies that too nonetheless lets see what your check with the hospitals shows us he turned once more to look out of the window but stopped and looked back at the younger man oh aye and make sure you check that st marthas place as well if i wanted to misappropriate some smack id do it there rather than at the western or the royal brian and i covered that when we were there the head of cid countered they store some prescription drugs there but not diamorphine they buy their supplies from the pharmacy at the royal on prescriptions signed by the doctors who consult there the dragon miss pople signs personally for every issue bugger are you trying to slam every door in my face pal no martin smiled look just let us get on with it bob eh theres nothing you would do if you were running this show that we wont cover believe me sure i know that my friend dont mind me its just this bloody office it may be only a hundred yards from yours but when the doors closed it seems like miles you carry on and i wish you the best of luck for youre going to need it without evidence tying anyone to the scene youre going to have to find the source of the diamorphine to have a chance of clearing this one up dont i know it he broke off as the door opened and gerry crossleys head appeared sorry to butt in mr skinner he said will you take a call from di impey of dumfries and galloway special branch neils not available so hes asked for you he says its really urgent the dcc smiled mcllhenney must have put the frighteners on him right enough he said to martin hes probably decided to report everything as of now on an urgent basis okay gerry put him through he crossed to his desk and sat behind it picking up the phone on the first ring inspector he barked what have you got a possible contact with our target sir were following him right now and hes heading your way impeys voice sounded hollow there was a rushing noise in the background tell me youre not calling on a carphone inspector said skinner heavily please tell me that those things are about as secure as a politicians fly im sorry sir said the detective a shade plaintively id no choice it all happened so fast i didna even have time to pick up my sergeant okay just tell me where you are minimum details im on the road from moffat to edinburgh up by the devils beeftub our subjects in a red vauxhall vectra northern ireland registration delta echo whisky skinner thought fast okay if youre on that road you wont come off it before leadbum thats for sure is there a lot of traffic aye sir theres a convoy of two tourist buses and three lorries up ahead itll be slow going like well just you be sure that your man doesnt get the jump on you as he clears it dont let him twig you either though when you get to the leadbum junction youll find mario mcguire parked and waiting for you transfer into his car as quick as you can and continue surveillance brief mario on the circumstances when you team up very good sir said impey his words crackling as his earphone lost its signal martin curious was gazing at skinner as he hung up hawkins could be if it is i only hope he doesnt rumble our friend impey otherwise well find the poor bastard dead in a ditch up tweedsmuir way as expected brian martin sounded weary as he spoke into the telephone entirely mackie replied avril weston confirms that she and the professor were at home together at the time of gaynors death they were doing the telegraph crossword as a matter of fact the lady is indeed very pregnant and she has difficulty sleeping like he said she knew about gaynors condition apparently nolan told her about it after he did the operation at st marthas he was in a right state as you could imagine did she know what sort of a relationship her husband had with his exwife i dont believe so the superintendent answered i did ask her very gently you understand whether she approved of his seeing her she told me that as far as she was concerned it was good for raymond that his parents remained on friendly terms after their divorce but she didnt give me the impression that she knew they were having it off martin heard a slurping sound come over the phone line and guessed that mackie must be drinking from a mug of coffee the boy was up and about by the way he continued he seemed compos mentis to me so i asked him a few questions he said that the first he knew of his mothers illness was when his father told him yesterday when he picked him up from aberdeen the last time he spoke to her was on wednesday night she phoned him at his hall of residence only just caught him the boy said before he went out to a freshers do with his pals she sounded okay according to the lad although it struck him at the time that she didnt really say why she was calling him he knows now that she was saying goodbye ahh poor kid martin murmured did you ask him about his mothers sexlife yes i was never happy with the idea of leaving that to the father as far as he knew she didnt have any boyfriends obviously futcher never went out to oldbams while the lad was there he did say that his mother used to go to sno concerts and to the opera and he was under the impression that she went with someone although she never mentioned a name it neednt have been a man worth looking into though i agree ive asked maggie and stevie to go out to oldbarns this evening to reinterview the ball woman christ watch the overtime i didnt have any choice shes off to the canaries tomorrow morning so weve got to catch her tonight you dont fancy her for it not even a wee bit mackie drew a breath nah worse luck theres something i never told you about joan ball she has severe arthritis in both hands she was given early retirement from the civil service three years ago on health grounds no way could she have injected gaynor even fastening the plastic bag over her head would have been beyond her jesus this doesnt get any easier thin man does it to martins surprise a gentle laugh sounded down the line ah but i havent given you the good news yet said the superintendent arthur dorwards clever people have managed to lift a saliva trace off one of the two wine glasses that were left in mrs westons sink the one without mrs westons lipstick on it hopefully itll give us a dna match if only we can find the bugger who left it is special branch always like this inspector asked karen neville nah mario mcguire answered as he spoke he kept his eyes firmly on the rearview mirror watching the road behind the angled fourway leadbum junction lay two hundred yards beyond their parking place most of the time its the sort of stuff youve been doing checking on known or potential troublemakers surveillance vip protection we rarely get to do action things you dont sound very excited by the prospect thats because im not sergeant five years ago i might well have looked forward to a bundle with an international terrorist but not any more neville frowned what happened to change you i got married for one thing i like going home to the wife at night with all my bits in place his mouth twisted wryly i suppose getting shot might have affected me too you were shot when a few years back in a good oldfashioned gunfight were you badly hurt oh aye when youre on the floor feeling numb all over listening to the blood bubbling out of your chest and someone says to you its okay son take it easy you know youre badly hurt the thing i remember best is bob skinner talking to me he said all the right things but i could see from the look in his eyes that he was just doing his best to reassure me he laughed practical to the end thats the boss i remember him saying the royal infirmarys right next door funnily enough that was the thing that made me feel better you went through that said neville yet here you are in sb carrying a gun and waiting for a bad guy couldnt you have asked for a uniform job sure i could but if i had then that bullet would have taken more out of me than blood and a bit of lung tissue i have to do the job the way ive always done it for my sake but that doesnt mean that i have to relish it dont you worry about she hesitated should i worry mcguire read her thoughts should you be worried in case the action starts and i freeze up he asked no way karen one thing getting shot does for you it makes you very keen not to get shot again freeze and thats whats going to happen have you ever shot anyone she asked quietly i dont know to tell you the truth we were all blazing away that night i might have hit the guy i suppose but i dont think so has anyone else on the team thats not a question you should ask those who have dont like to talk about it but since you have asked it andy martin and brian mackie have they got the guy who shot me the boss has too he put another guy down that night in the hall andy had to do it another time as well and dont in your daftest moment ever ask him about that oh aye and so did brian brian mackie nevilles surprise burst from her aye the thin man never batted an eyelid either hes the best shot on his eyes narrowed as he looked in the mirror hold on a red car just came round the bend in the distance the sergeant turned to look out of the rear window yes i see it a silver car then a green one then red it looks like a vauxhall too okay look this way now dont give the driver any idea that we might be waiting for him eat your apple or something quickly from a pocket in the drivers door he took two miniature football boots joined by a white cord and slung them round the rear view mirror some of the lads take the piss out of me about my theory but i cant think of a better way of disguising an unmarked car could you imagine a cop wagon with windscreen ornaments how about a nodding dog on the back shelf karen suggested dryly nah nae use the bad guys might think it was mcllhenney dont you knock neil i think hes nice im allowed to knock him hes my best pal he glanced in the side mirror as he tugged the ringpull to open a can of pepsi and raised it to his lips this is the guy all right he drank from the tin as the red car swept past delta echo whisky he read switching on the engine of his nissan as he spoke get ready less than thirty seconds later the rear offside door of the car was jerked open and a man slid quickly into the back seat hello joe said mcguire this is karen neville he handed the can of pepsi to the newcomer finish that for me slipping into first gear he slid from his parking place on the verge and moved smoothly into traffic behind a blue volkswagen ahead of them the red vauxhall took a left turn at the junction heading for penicuik the inspector muttered okay joe tell us all about it haud on a minute son the veteran grizzled detective inspector impey grunted breathing heavily from his short sprint to mcguires car i need this he raised the pepsi and threw his head back emptying the can in a single swallow hah thats better right about our man he tapped his colleague on the shoulder dont get too close now mario teach your granny the other man growled dinna be so touchy here son i dont think your boss likes me joe therell be someone else doesnt like you if you dont get to the bloody point aye okay okay this is the wey it happened we were watching the irish ferry coming into dock at craigryan lookin at the folk through binoculars like all of a sudden ah sees this bloke hes a dead ringer for one of those photofits that your boss gave us ginger hair big thick moustache you ken the one ah mean then while im watching him he gets up and walked across the deck and hes got a limp ahm really interested then he paused got ony mair pepsi neville reached into her bag and handed him a can thanks hen said impey as he opened it the sergeant fought off an urge to make clucking noises normally we give a the cars coming off the ferry a quick once over looking for familiar faces from the circulation list things might be quieter in ireland these days but old habits die hard like my oppo was up the ramp and i was at the exit with a uniformed polis it was fine till we got taste this bloke he takes a look at the uniform coming towards him shouted something at him and put his foot down ah didnae have time to wait for my oppo my car was handy so i jumped in it and got after him why would someone like hawkins panic at a police ferry check neville asked casually how the bloody hell would i know hen impey snapped at her then turned once more to look at the back of mcguires head i couldnae be sure where he was going until he turned off the a for moffat that was when i phoned mcllhenney only he wisnae in so i phoned your boss he told me muttered mcguire as he drove into the centre of penicuik i dont suppose you called anyone to ask for a number trace naw impey replied ah was concentrating on the subject wasnt ah thats okay for we did our mans driving a hired car were trying to dig up someone in eurodollar to give us the hirers details bugger he swore softly as the traffic lights in the middle of the small midlothian town turned to amber as he watched helplessly trapped behind two other vehicles their quarry hit the accelerator and shot across the junction pull out and go through impey urged dont be daft joe if he looked back and saw me do that hed rumble us for sure if he hasnt already that is patience man hes got traffic in front of him well catch him up like a watched kettle the lights seemed to take forever to change but eventually the three police officers resumed their pursuit for a time it seemed that mcguires confidence had been misplaced as they found themselves trapped behind two articulated lorries which had pulled out of a small industrial estate just beyond the town centre they had reached glencorse barracks before the road cleared far enough ahead to allow overtaking but once they had passed the obstruction the inspector was able to put his foot down they were nearing a stretch of dual carriageway when neville pointed to a coach less than two hundred yards in front of them i think hes in front of that bus i caught a flash of red just thenas if to prove her right the red vauxhall pulled into the overtaking lane of the widened roadway and speeded up mcguire accelerated steadily keeping pace with it but being careful not to be drawn too close their target led them down the straight road towards edinburgh reaching after five minutes the double roundabout of the straiten junction with the city bypass at the second of the huge islands the suspected hawkins indicated right and swung off the edinburgh road heading eastwards why are we going this way i wonder mcguire mused aloud hes heading away from the posh end of the city maybe hes going south impey suggested maybe but i doubt it joe if he was heading say for berwick hed have taken another route unless of course he spotted us way back and hes been pulling our chains ever since well find out when we get to the end of the bypass hows that like because if he heads for leith hes probably close to his destination if he heads down the al then hes taking the piss and im going t have him you got your firearm handy ahm not carrying mario impey confessed sheepishly christ are you going out of your way to wind up bob skinner did you not hear his instruction at that briefing aye but ah just dinnae like guns ah had a mate once shot himself in the leg with his i hate to think where the boss shoot you if he finds out youve ignored his order okay karens armed and able to back me up and were only going after one bloke but if wed been after a team you could have put us all in danger impey growled ach you city polis yis are all fuckin cowboys excuse my french hen cest rien neville replied in a little under ten minutes they came to the junction which marked the end of the bypass mcguire drew the nissan a little closer to the red car ready to cover his move whether he headed north or south beside him his sergeant shifted edgily in her seat their quarry took neither option instead he headed straight through the junction and turned into the service area on the other side of the wide al going for petrol mcguire guessed he slipped quietly off the roundabout hanging back as far as he dared then turned into the narrow access road slowing to check that the vauxhall had not turned into the motor lodge car park but had indeed carried on to the filling station beyond there were six pumps on the forecourt all occupied the red car stood a little back from them waiting for one to clear as he slid quietly behind him mcguire could see the driver clearly for the first time in profile as he looked at the pumps he had lit a cigarette his right arm was leaning on the open window i can see the likeness right enough joe and yet something gnawed at the back of his mind mario karen neville touched his arm interrupting his search of his memory one of the pumps just cleared why isnt he moving up maybe he needs diesel impey suggested unlikely in a hire car maybe hes just finishing his fag before he goes to fill up whatever hes off guard and im having him otherwise ill have to buy bloody petrol or hell twig us karen you take the passenger side joe you stay here mario mcguire was a big easygoing man until the action button was pressed he opened his door and stepped out of the car his gun in his hand in an instant swiftly and noiselessly he closed the gap to the red car the man inside was drawing on his cigarette he started in surprise as karen neville stepped into his line of vision in the same moment the inspector reached through the vectras open side window and pressed the cold muzzle of his walther to the back of the mans head good evening sir he said in a quiet conversational tone just in case youre in any doubt we are police officers and that thing you feel against your skull is not a piece of pipe or a banana or anything like that its a real gun and they make me nervous so if you move the wrong muscle you wont move any others ever again now i want you to step out of the car keeping your hands in the air then i want you to lie face down on the ground where is this man impey now said bob skinner he spoke quietly but there was something in his tone which send a cold shiver running down mario mcguires spine on his way back to dumfries boss i told him to get the you knowwhat out of edinburgh before you got your hands on him well the bugger cant run fast enough or far enough wherever he surfaces again hes going to find out that my bite is a hell of a lot worse than my bark dont be too hard on him boss he was showing initiative he just made an honest mistake so did the captain of the titanic thanks to that man and his monumental stupidity ive had the commander of the interpol task force on counterfeiting moaning down my phone for the last half hour you were advised of this operation as was every other special branch office in the country including dumfries and bloody galloway you were all told that they were watching a major software forgery centre in south armagh and you were all given photographs of the agents involved in spite of that because oflmpeys honest mistake weve ruined the culmination of the operation the guy you lifted was following a courier the purpose of that was to discover the bootleggers main distribution route and from that to catch their customers with the stuff in their possession the interpol people even sent a fax to impeys office warning him that the man was on the move ive checked its in his intray and it was there when he left to check the ferry passengers mcguire scratched his chin oh shit he groaned poor old joe dont waste your sympathy on the guy mario he should have committed that information to memory and he should have had that mans face imprinted in his brain thats standard sb procedure as you know well if impey isnt up to following it he isnt up to the job but he wont be in it for much longer hell have a very embarrassed chief constable waiting for him when he gets back to his office tomorrow morning and believe me archie deas is not a man anyone wants to embarrass whatll he do to him hang him up by his soft bits until they drop off probably once they have hell stick him back in a uniform and post him to auchencross or some place like that with a bike to get around on at least thats what ive suggested to archie that he should do he swivelled in his chair what about mr steyn the agent have you calmed him down just about ive booked him into the george for the night on our tab hell go back to ireland in the morning take him out to dinner just to show real contrition take mags along if you like mcguire frowned i cant do that boss ive promised to meet neil tonight he says hes got something to tell me the frown turned into his dazzling smile from the way he sounded i suspect that olives in the club again it seemed to stevie steele that while joan ball couldnt have been more than fiftyfive her hands looked as if they could have been ninety they hung from her wrists like two claws as she spoke to her visitors knuckles hugely swollen fingers twisted cruelly into her palms she caught the young detectives glance what do you think of my talons sergeant she asked holding one up against the light from a table lamp beside her chair i think its a damn shame miss ball dont they make it difficult for you to live out in the country i mean you cant drive can you no i cant but i manage all right the social services are very good they provide all sorts of support home help someone to do my shopping and so on then there are the disabled charity people they helped me with adapting the house and in other ways too i have a brother in north berwick who takes me about and a sister in edinburgh and of course gaynor was a great help to me too in all sorts of ways for example she was good with a sewing machine so she would alter clothes for me i cant manage buttons or zips any more too small and fiddly she would replace them with velcro fastenings she was a very kind person very thoughtful ill miss her a great deal her steady gaze moved from steele to rose i take it that you want to ask me more questions about her you take it right the chief inspector replied did you see much of mrs weston in the two weeks before her death she asked quite a bit really she was off work all that time did she tell you why she said that she had a little womens trouble and that she had been ordered to stay at home for a couple of weeks no gentleman callers her eyes narrowed as she looked at rose would i be correct in guessing that it was a little more serious than that yes you would mrs weston was very ill without hope of recovery in fact i see so she decided to end her life and now youre looking for the person who helped her how do you work that one out come on sergeant she threw him a withering look almost the first question i was asked when i was interviewed before was whether i had seen nolans car or the man futchers outside gaynors house that night and you still cant recall seeing either one asked rose no because they werent there but that doesnt matter a damn the covered parking at the far end of the square is never full theres no car in my space for example if gaynor had a visitor he could easily have put his car in there or even left it on the approach road none of the other residents saw anything parked on that road i dont suppose theres any way of checking the other possibility in any event were pretty satisfied that neither professor weston nor mr futcher were there that night so we have to look for alternatives weve been through mrs westons address book as far as we can tell most of the entries and telephone numbers in there relate to business associates yes that would be right gaynors work was her life her professional and social circles were pretty much interchangeable however i dont believe that there was anyone at work with whom she was particularly close no one at all i suppose you could talk to her secretary and the other staff in her business we have said steele the secretary knew of her relationship with futcher but that was all the other three employees didnt even know where she lived other than that it was in east lothian rosamund the secretary is the only one whos ever been out there however rose continued mrs weston once made a remark which suggested that there might have been a third man in her life do you know anything about that joan ball frowned gaynor never mentioned anything to me about a third man rose groaned inwardly but even as she did the woman drew in a deep breath clasping her twisted hands together nevertheless she went on i did have a suspicion that there might be whenever she had a visitor she would always mention it at some point i always knew when futcher was there or nolan such a nice man nolan i remember the times when rosamund came to visit if they had a rush job on sometimes gaynor would work at weekends but there were i think three occasions on which i saw a car there at night following which she didnt say anything can you describe the car four wheels and a roof other than that im lost i have no memory for colours and i wouldnt know one make from another other than beetles i used to have one of them but this wasnt a beetle you cant be sure the visitor was a man though said the chief inspector no i cant but the car was still there in the early hours of the morning on at least two of the occasions im a poor sleeper but gone by my breakfasttime read into that what you will i cant help you any further im afraid can you remember when these visits took place that might help over the last six or seven months the most recent occasion was about a month ago good even that gives us some extra help she stood and steele followed thank you very much miss ball well just go next door to mrs westons now ive brought the keys and theres something inside i want to check their arthritic hostess showed them slowly to the door enjoy your holiday said rose ill try im going with a disabled group they have people to help you pack and so on id rather be on an ordinary tour but its for the best the important thing is to get some warmth into these things she held up a ravaged hand to wave them goodbye shes a game lady steele remarked as they stood outside in the evening darkness listen maam what did you mean about checking next door im expected home at some point tonight it wont take long i want to take a look at mrs westons laptop she didnt keep personal appointments on her office machine maybe she had a computer diary out here i looked at her filofax myself and if there had been anything in it about a night visit from a gentleman caller id have remembered lets just check while were here she led the way across the grass to gaynor westons front door and opened it with a key from the labelled bunch in her pocket switching on the lights she trotted up the short flight of stairs to the attic room which the dead woman had used as an office the laptop lay on a small desk plugged into a wall socket quickly rose opened it and looked at the small keyboard until she found the startup button in the top righthand corner the two detectives waited as the machine booted up do you know these machines asked the chief inspector yes no problem steele placed the cursor on the apple symbol in the menu bar and dragged it down until he found a folder headed recent applications he triggered it open and looked at the software list right he said briskly claris organiser thatll be it if theres anything on here he opened the program revealing a fresh clean diary page for that day swinging the arrow up to the menu bar he selected calendar and a different page appeared showing four full days steele clicked on a tab at the side of the page the display changed once more setting out a full month several of the dates showed appointments look at the last one rose whispered pointing at the screen it says write to ray on the afternoon before her death but there was no note said steele no yet ill bet this was a woman who kept her appointments lets look at the rest they went back over the month in the two weeks before the reference to her son there were no entries none until two words st marthas and a time am three days before that was a further entry terry futcher pm and on the saturday before nw ray aberdeen this is all personal stuff steve no business appointments at all rose scanned quickly through the month but i dont see anything here that helps can you go back the sergeant nodded clicked on a minus symbol at the top of the page and the previous months listings appeared he read through them carefully there he said with a slight nod of his head towards the display look at the entry for the twentyeighth deacey dinner oh pm oh means oldbams i guess but whos deacey surname or forename who knows lets see if he features earlier run over the previous months the sergeant scrolled back through six more months of entries they revealed four more visits by deacey the first of them as joan ball had said seven months earlier there were also three entries referring to theatre dates with the same person looks like mrs westons third arrow rose murmured our mystery man lets see if the mysterys answered here replied steele he went back to the menu bar and selected contact list a series of names and telephone numbers appeared listed alphabetically nolan westons name was there also terry futchers there was no deacey no listing beginning with the letter d bugger the sergeant swore quietly never mind stevie said rose he might not be listed in here but with a name as unusual as that it shouldnt take us long to fit a face to it its a step forward brian but dont let the team get too carried away about it even if you identify and trace this deacey character youre still a bit away from placing him at oldbams on the night ofgaynors death not if his dna matches the trace dorwards lot found on that glass straws on the wind man and youre clutching at them well see theres another straw as well there was an entry on wednesday reminding her to write to her son i wonder if she ever did you bet she did she was thorough and methodical this woman that letters kicking around somewhere im going back to see the lad tomorrow morning ill take maggie with me just you do that mate but thats enough for today call me over the weekend if you have to but otherwise ill see you next week martin replaced the receiver are you a step nearer to tracing doctor death asked alex as he turned towards her dont use that term even in fun he replied a little sharply ive been dreading the tabloids picking it up so far this has been a quiet lowkey investigation into what most of them have decided is a suicide thanks to the careful wording ofalan roystons press release maybe if you were a bit more forthcoming the person youre after might came forward maybe if you buy a bikini itll be warm enough for you to go swimming in the sea tomorrow people do not walk into police offices asking to be locked up for life not as a matter of course anyway she beamed across the table at him as he resumed his seat sipping at his coffee which had cooled during mackies call surely this might be the sort of person who would do just that helping a friend to die must be an awful thing to do ill bet that whoever did it its preying on their mind right now ill bet theyd love to get it off their chest whatever the consequences why dont you let brian mackie call a press conference and explain exactly whats happened ill bet it would work he looked back at her unsmiling for a cautious lawyer youre throwing a few bets around tonight youre also forgetting basic legal principles if brian did that hed have the fiscal down on his neck in an instant for compromising the whole investigation and prejudicing a future trial okay he doesnt need to spell it all out just enough to let the press draw conclusions alex i dont care whose daughter you are just leave the police work to us okay her gaze dropped as she sat back in her chair hurt by his snub then tossing her napkin onto the table she stood picked up her mug and stepped silently into the kitchen she was pouring herself more coffee when he appeared in the doorway you can get your own she snapped alex love im sorry he said i didnt mean to bite your head off well i meant to bite yours she fired back unappeased sorry sorry sorry lets not shout at each other all night weve got unfinished business you and i from a couple of nights ago you know it as well as i do but youve been dodging the subject ever since alex had never been able to sustain anger for any length of time she had never been sure whether this was a strength or a weakness okay she said quietly truce lets talk ive been working myself up to have it all out with you tonight anyway thats probably why i was so snippy she picked up her coffee walked past him back into the living room and sat on the long sofa staring across the room without a hint of a smile i dont want to break off our engagement andy she began in spite of himself he felt his heart take flight in his chest and then she shot it down yet i think youre right we need to stand back from each other and take a look at our future together and how it would be for unless each of us gets what we have a right to expect out of life it isnt a future i want to contemplate from where i stand she looked at him for the first time a light smile on her lips or in this case sit i have as much right to a career as you have you on the other hand do not have the right to put pressure on me about having children or to make me feel guilty about not having them as youve done already i want what my stepmother has a successful professional life built up to the point at which she can adapt her work to suit her circumstances the age difference between my dad and sarah is about the same as it is between you and me yet theyve made it work yes even after pops midlife crisis in spite of it theyve made it work if you want to be jealous of anything andy dont make it my job be jealous of them for they are what we should be aiming to be we should be thinking longterm but you dont seem capable of that his green eyes seemed to lose their sparkle as he looked at her youre getting it off your chest all right i wonder if you realise just how calculating you sound does love come into this at all she turned on him of course it does and do i love you but taking for granted comes into it too and thats what you do with me he opened his mouth in a retort but she cut him off ask yourself this just lately have we been making love or have we just been fucking i know the difference do you lets try not to wound each other any more thans necessary eh he whispered she softened at once oh im sorry she exclaimed taking his hand you know what i mean though he nodded his blond head yes i know i know so what do you want to do about it im going to move out andy she said i really dont want to break off our engagement far from it but please understand im still learning to be me as an adult i think i need room to finish the process christ he chuckled youre more grown up than me in some ways where will you live ill buy a flat i still have the money from selling my student flat in glasgow and my furnitures in store its a sensible thing to do when you and i have ourselves sorted and when eventually we do get married maybe i can rent it out in the short term gina my pal in the office has room to spare at her place in comely bank im going to move in there with her she paused i want you to leave me for a week till i get things sorted then maybe we could go out for dinner next saturday like we used to and start again from there try to build a more comfortable relationship okay he agreed still reluctantly when will you go tomorrow then im taking a couple of days off at the beginning of next week all planned eh she smiled at him cautiously it was time for someone to be decisive wasnt it yes sweetheart i suppose it was tonight though what lets make love youre not serious gasped mackie with sudden shocked incredulity he pulled his car to a stop on the greenway how i wish i wasnt said maggie rose neil asked mario to have a drink with him last night he told him then ahhh murmured the superintendent i really was trying not to think about it andy and i saw them at the western yesterday when we went to see the prof later on we agreed that we hadnt if you know what i mean i supposed there must be something but still olive lung cancer poor lass thats terrible hows neil handling it mario knows him better than anyone he says that inside hes scared stiff but on the outside hes putting on the strongest face he can he and olive have decided that theyre not going to treat it as some dark secret theyre going to tell all their friends whats happening and how things are going all the way along are they going to operate they cant its too advanced she goes into the western next wednesday to start chemotherapy how long will she have to stay there just a couple of days once a month with topups on a daypatient basis and what are her chances rose smiled neil says shes going to make it he wont contemplate any other outcome and neither should we oh god muttered mackie still shaken lets just pray that hes right brian said his deputy grimfaced once more if you believe in prayer give it all youve got they sat in silence for a few seconds until it was broken by the insistent hooting of a bus its driver furious to find a car blocking the lane which he regarded as his exclusive property ah bugger off snarled the superintendent with uncharacteristic ferocity but he slipped into gear nonetheless and moved off they drove on for a few more minutes heading westward along the glasgow road until they arrived at the junction with murrayfield avenue mackie took a right turn drove for two hundred yards up the sloping street then turned left nolan westons house was only a few yards from the corner it was saturday and so the detectives were not surprised when the surgeon opened the door he on the other hand looked decidedly puzzled mr mackie he said i wasnt expecting you this morning especially since you interrogated my son yesterday without my permission im sorry if that upset you sir but the opportunity arose so i took it i dont think any harm was done do you weston shook his head no i dont suppose it was he smiled in any event i keep forgetting that ray is eighteen you dont need my permission to talk to him do you maggie rose had been on the verge of telling him that very thing come in please the professor continued i havent met your colleague mackie introduced his deputy as he led them through to a small sitting room which opened into a semicircular conservatory the garden beyond was lush and welltended and rich with the colours of autumn a heavily pregnant woman sat in a bamboo armchair on the left of the glass room she smiled at mackie who nodded in acknowledgement ah yes you met my wife yesterday said weston avril this is chief inspector rose now what can i do for you we need to speak with your son again im afraid said the superintendent something else has come up and it involves him very well he took a pace towards a door in the righthand corner of the room rose could see that it led to the kitchen ray weston called come on in here a few seconds later a young man ambled into the room he was tall at least six feet three inches but finefeatured and rakethin his dark hair flying in all directions from his high forehead there was a thick slice of buttered toast in his right hand wh is it he mumbled then saw the two detectives oh hello morning ray said mackie sorry to bother you again this is dci rose she and i need to ask you a couple of things first have you had any mail in the last couple of days the youth shrugged his shoulders not yesterday thats for sure today i dont know dad i havent sorted the post yet the professor answered let me have a look its still on the hall table he left the room the others waited for him in silence raymond munching on his toast when he returned he was waving a brown a envelope this is for you aberdeen postmark he handed the letter to his son the detectives looked on as he tore it open and peered inside theres a note he said withdrawing a slip of paper and handing it to mackie it was a short message a simple scrawl in a strong hand the detective read it aloud it says this arrived today and its signed beano whos he my roommate raymond peered into the brown manila once more its a letter he shook it free and held it up for the detectives to see a simple creamcoloured envelope as he looked at the handwritten address his face paled dad he whispered plaintively its from mum then i think you should read it alone ray his father said yes rose agreed but first do you have a letter opener professor that envelope has to be handled carefully from now on we dont want any more fingerprints on it why asked weston puzzled rose took the letter from his son holding it by a corner and looked at it its postmarked thursday the day after mrs weston died we need to find the person who posted it and chances are his prints are on this i see the surgeon went into the kitchen and returned with a thin bladed knife which he handed to rose carefully the chief inspector slit the envelope along the top shook out the letter within and handed it to raymond as the young man went into the kitchen avril weston pushed herself from her chair and came over to join her husband the four stood silently watching the door eventually the sobbing began growing louder heartrending avril started for the kitchen at first nolan held her back but eventually he released her hand and allowed her to go to her stepson she returned a minute later maybe two with the letter which she handed to her husband he held it up and began to read my lovely ray when you receive this youll know dad will have explained everything and although he did not know that i was going to do what ive done i know that hell understand and that hell support my decision i watched you grandmother die of cancer when i was your age it all but destroyed me and i will not put you through the same experience im not afraid of what i would have faced and i am not doing this thing for me but for you and for your father because i love you both so very much nolan westons voice faltered for a moment but he gathered himself and read on i want you to live the rest of your life for me and to be all you can be for my sake of all the good things in my life and there have been many you and dad have been absolutely the best live well for me with all my love mum he looked up as he finished and saw that ray had come back into the room they embraced father and son as if they were welding their grief together mackie nodded towards the conservatory and the two women followed him leaving them together eventually the two tall westons rejoined them do you need the letter as well asked raymond no said mackie not just now anyway i dont think for a moment that therell be any prints on that other than your mums the envelopes all we need but the young man demanded if mum didnt post it herself then who did did she give it to her secretary the detectives looked at each other almost imperceptibly mackie nodded no said rose we know that your mother wrote the letter only a few hours before she died we believe that it was posted next day by the person who helped her end her life thats what all this is about raymond weston exclaimed someone killed my mum rose replied simply yes but thats not right the young man shouted it should have been me or dad dad why didnt you help her believe me son said nolan quietly if she had asked me to i would have but she loved both of us too much ever to have involved us ray asked mackie briskly does the name deacey thats deacey mean anything to you deacey never heard of him why was it him we dont know that we just need to find him thats all professor does the name mean anything to you weston dropped his eyes and shook his head the third arrow i guess he murmured sadly avrils presence forgotten completely what the hell brought this on anyway bob skinner asked his daughter you just turn up out of the blue i cant remember the last time you wanted to go out for a run with your old man i cant remember the last time i wanted to go for a run with anyone alex panted they were jogging eastward along the shore of the forth estuary away from gullane in the direction offidra island which stood guard with its lighthouse over yellowcraigs beach bob was taking it easy but still maintaining a respectable pace making her work to keep up ive let myself get really out of shape she gasped since i started with the firm from now on im going to do more of this and go to the gym twice a week instead of once a month youre twice my age and twice as fit christ youll be joining the girls rugby team next no fear pops bad for the boobs ive always thought he stopped abruptly beneath the isolated house which was the only sign of civilisation along that stretch of coastline why is it he said breathing only slightly hard that people always seems to pussyfoot around these days when they want to tell me something am i that much of a bear come on kid out with it what do you mean gasped alex i mean that you could have done three laps ofholyrood park just to burn off energy you didnt need to come down here youre working up to telling me something let me guess its about you and andy she looked up at him screwing up her eyes against the watery winter sun has he been talking we did have a chat but it didnt amount to much i told him that sarah and i wouldnt get involved so im right then alex shifted her footing on the shingle on which they stood and gazed across the calm water towards the fidra light yes youre right im moving out this afternoon bugger he frowned his mouth tightening what is it about our family these days that we can never manage to all be happy at the same time look pops she said in an attempt at reassurance its not that bad were not breaking off the engagement just stopping living together for a while itll do us good in the long run maybe it will and maybe i should even be pleased i can still be oldfashioned from time to time the concept of living together before marriage is not one i was brought up to believe in nonetheless in my experience when you take one step back in a relationship its very difficult not to take another before you know it theres a gap which can be very difficult to close well be all right alex insisted we just need some breathing space thats all no my lovely daughter he said firmly thats not true andy doesnt need breathing space you do so dont go pinning the blame on him not in that way anyway right now youre finding this relationship stifling okay maybe thats his fault but youre the one whos making all the decisions do you think im right thats irrelevant because id support you even if i thought you were wrong no its not its important to me do you think im right as it happens i do secretly when you got engaged then moved in with andy i thought that you were giving away too much of your life too soon now that youve decided to claim at least some of it back i can only be pleased not that i want you to tell andy that mind why didnt you say i said plenty when your relationship began remember and caused mayhem for a while i lost my daughter and my best friend i dont want that to happen again anyway youre a big girl now youve got the right to make your own mistakes and hopefully to learn from them he smiled suddenly his face lighting up now he said giving her sweatslicked ponytail a quick tug youre going to learn the folly of buggering up my saturday morning were nowhere near halfway through this run so lets get back to it and at a decent pace too you want to get fit kid okay just follow me and find out what it takes you want some time off andy you think i need it i dont know pal but if you feel you do ill accommodate you andy martin smiled across the chief constables low table with all that weve got on our plate at the moment youre offering me leave bob what youre really doing is asking whether i can keep my eye on the ball with alex moving out and all given the example of neil mcllhenney id be no man at all if i couldnt anyway i respect what shes doing and our longterm plans havent changed shes still wearing the ring now can we get on with our monday briefing as usual skinner nodded he was in uniform in preparation for a meeting of the police board and shifted uncomfortably in his seat as he sipped his coffee okay lets do that what do i need to know the main item is the weston investigation the son received a letter from his mother on saturday morning it was posted in edinburgh on the day after her death was it indeed prints covered in them at least five different thumbs for a start some of them will be post office staff and one is gaynors are you trying to trace the postmen to eliminate them martin shook his head no their union hates that theyd probably strike if we suggested printing them all anyway its not necessary when we find the person were after and his dabs match one on the envelope thats fine itll be another piece of evidence if they dont it could help the defence skinner suggested true but im not going to start sweating about it till we catch the man could mrs weston have given the letter to anyone else to post for her have we established whether she had any visitors during the day as far as we can joan ball her neighbour looked in on her in the morning then in the afternoon she made a few phone calls to her office with hindsight its clear she was putting her affairs in order however theres no evidence that she had any visitors other than miss ball and the person who helped her die so its unlikely that she gave the letter to someone else to post martin paused however all that aside weve got a new name to go on maggie and steele found it on her computer diary a man called deacey what are they doing to trace him the usual step one check whether hes known to us he isnt according to our intelligence unit there are no deaceys first or second name known to the police in scotland step two look up the telephone directory theyve done that already and come up empty no deacey listed in edinburgh the lothians greater glasgow fife or tayside so this morning theyll check with the department of social security the registrar general the passport office and the driving licence agency is he a serious contender dyou think right now bob hes our only contender well lets just find him and hope id really like to get a clearup on this one too many unresolved possibilities if we dont too many whispers too many fingers left pointing at professor weston or at his son fine but just how much of our resources do we commit to this as much as is necessary we cannot be seen to have backed off from this investigation in any way whatever our personal feelings might be skinner paused for what its worth my very private belief is that given her circumstances mrs weston had every moral right to do what she did and if she needed someone to help her so be it would you apply that belief to olive mcllhenney asked martin solemnly you know about that yes brian called me on saturday he had it from maggie via mario well god forbid that it should come to that but if it does then yes i believe that olive should be able to choose her moment and that neil should be free to be part of it should he choose what about you the head ofcid took a sip from his cup and slowly replaced it in its saucer i had this conversation last week with mackie he began in a roundabout way but mostly i hid my views behind the law then the fact is bob as you know i was brought up as a catholic as ive grown older ive come to differ with my church on a number of issues for example no bloody celibate is going to dictate to me about contraception or about interpersonal relationships however the one thing thats ingrained in me is my belief in the sanctity of life skinners eyebrows rose even after all these years you surprise me andy he said quietly especially given the things that youve had to do in this job i dont have to remind you of them how could i forget that once i had the choice between killing someone or letting you die afterwards when i had done it i discussed it with my confessor and i was absolved the priest agreed with my choice but that wasnt enough for me i went to confession in four more churches and in three of those i was absolved again the fourth priest an irishman and old by the sound of him told me that what had been about to happen was gods will and that i had committed a mortal sin he refused me absolution right there in the box through the grille i told him to go and fuck himself i havent been to church from that day i suppose i have to recognise that ive withdrawn from it and yet its teachings still will not allow me to accept that life is something that we can switch off as a matter of course look at it this way if a state will not take the life of a murderer how can it sanction the killing of the innocent i take that point skinner conceded and ill think hard on it but to come back to you given your belief how can you bring yourself to carry a firearm on duty because i accept that there are circumstances when a gun can be used to preserve life yours for example but i can never be dispassionate about it like you and brian say the big dcc grunted huh i cant speak for mackie but theres nothing dispassionate about me andy when ive had to shoot people theyve bloody deserved it and ive been positive about it take this hawkins man for example when hes traced hell be arrested if he doesnt offer resistance depending on who catches him he might be delivered to the cia but somewhere along the line someone will put a bullet behind his ear and the south african press will be told that a wellknown local businessman has been killed in a car crash or whatever thats the way this one will be played out make no mistake if that troubles your conscience maybe youd better have no more to do with the search for the man if youd prefer it ill take you out of the chain of command altogether martin shifted in his seat once more and grunted no dont do that this mans a fucking headhunter for gods sake and he could be after our head of government my responsibility is to the innocent and ill fulfil it ive already made that choice remember even if that old irish bastard did damn me to hell for it so whats the latest on the hawkins front he asked skinner glanced at his watch mcllhenney should be ready to report by now lets call him in he reached across to the console on his desk and pressed a button less than a minute later the side door of the office opened and the bulky sergeant stepped into the room carrying a thick folder to martin he seemed tired and drawn there was none of the usual joviality in his eyes in its place the chief superintendent saw a steely determination sit down big fella said the dcc want a coffee mcllhenney laid his folder on the low table no thanks boss ive decided to cut that out i went to the doctor on saturday morning and had myself checked out the last thing we need right now is for anything to be wrong with me there isnt though naw he just told me to give up coffee and lose a few pounds ive to get more exercise he said but the fact is ive lost five pounds in the last week without doing a bloody thing hows olive doing asked skinner shes fantastic she told the kids last night that she had a wee problem and shed be off work for a while but that it was nothing to worry about incidentally boss i talked to her about your offer to look after lauren and spencer next weekend its very kind of you and sarah and wed like to take you up on it thats good when does the treatment begin she goes in on wednesday afternoon for assessment then they begin on thursday she gets out about five on friday skinner nodded okay sarah collect the children after school on friday afternoon right he continued hawkins whats to report absolutely nothing im afraid since that bloody fiasco caused by the man from dumfries whose hide is even now drying on his office door skinner interrupted with a growl there hasnt been a sniff of him in scotland not a single scent theres been nothing else across europe either you know boss its been a while since the original tip came out of south africa im beginning to wonder whether hes slipped the net altogether so am i said the dcc heavily but we maintain surveillance regardless though the preparations for the economic conference are going ahead too acc elders working on the general policing arrangements and on traffic management following the blueprint that was drawn up when we had the commonwealth heads of government we may make the vehicle restrictions even tighter than they were then thats all background stuff though as far as our force is concerned mcguire and neville and the rest of the sb people are our front line how much longer will this operation run mario asked karen neville until the last head of governments plane takes off for home the inspector replied or until mr hawkins resurfaces in south africa fresh from a winter holiday in europe or until we catch the bugger you dont think theres a chance he really is on holiday do you sure theres a chance of that he could be sliding down mountains in switzerland while every secret policeman in europe is combing the airports the ferry terminals aye even the bloody streets looking for him this search is based on information from the spooks you see karen the mi crowd theyre all too clever by half and most of them are panic merchants the sort to have the world chasing its tail on the back of the faintest hint i remember once not so long ago they started a panic hunt for a terrorist suspect who as it turned out was in fact in the south of spain on holiday with his best friends wife he grimaced however there always is that five per cent chance that their information is accurate so it has to be checked out in this case the boss seems convinced that its a lot stronger than the usual twenty to one shot so tell me sergeant what have you got planned for today checking more male landing cards inspector looking for a limping guy with a false beard and moustache funny chuckled mcguire thats exactly what im going to be doing weve got a fair few to work our way through this week though he picked up a pile of cards from a tray at the side of his desk theres a conference of international economists up at the conference centre this week sponsored by edinburgh university how about this for a title the development of subnational economies within supranational structures the opening session is this afternoon theres an address by bruce anderson the secretary of state thats the boy arent you involved in the security asked neville not on this one ive been kept informed and ive allocated our two sb colleagues to assist but the protection squad are in charge anderson isnt regarded as a prime target so the view is that you and i are better employed on hawkins surveillance he tapped the pile of cards this is where were involved this is an attractive event for economists its attracted over two hundred and forty delegates two thirds of them from outside the european union theyve been pouring into edinburgh all weekend so after filtering out the female delegates were left with one hundred and fiftytwo of these things to go through when sergeant brown and dc mcnee are finished with the secretary of state they can get on with checking the individual cards which come in on a daily basis so for the purpose of this exercise you and i are on our own he split the cards into two lots then folded them there you are he said brightly theres the best part of a weeks work there henry wills the secretary of the university is our main contact at the conference hell tell us which people are in which hotels so that we can give them the onceover you dont think for a minute that hawkins would show up at an economists conference do you mcguire shook his head no i dont but he could try to sneak in among them conceivably he could even register once weve checked all the delegates if one of these cards isnt accounted for or if one of the holders checked in but isnt actually taking part in the event that could be interesting this cant be the man were after the sergeant gasped i mean look at that place its a bloody rabbit warren gaynor weston was a classy woman in her forties she wouldnt have been interested in an unemployed twentyseven yearold from a tip like this you never know though mused maggie rose with a light smile tell me stevie are you familiar with the phrase a wee bit of rough or maybe this stinking pile will reveal a dazzling urbanite damned by cruel fate to live under whats left of its roof if edinburghs housing was divided into descending categories from one to ten the property before which the two detective stood would have rated a marginal thirteen it stood as a monument to illconceived public housing the last remaining eyesore the last rotting tooth in a street on which all the other filthy tenements had been razed to the ground more than half of its windows were boarded up yet ironically half a dozen satellite dishes were fixed to its wall christ knows whats in there stevie steele muttered but they must have pissed off the housing people up at the city council every last one of them are you sure you want to go in there maam i could call up a couple of uniforms to huckle our man down to st leonards the first time i come across a building that i wont go into the chief inspector replied evenly then im done for in cid come on hes in number f or so the woman at the dss said she led the way up the weedinfested path and through the open entrance to the tenement whos the listed tenant asked steele its not him i take it no according to the council the tenant is a mrs hannah mason once upon a time there might have been a door at the entrance to the building but if there had it was long gone and its frame had been torn out beyond was a long narrow corridor which stank of urine they followed it until they came to a flight of stairs it was late on a tuesday afternoon and all of the bulbs had been stolen from the stairway lights and so they made their way up to the third floor landing in almost pitch darkness as their eyes became accustomed to the gloom they saw six doors off a long corridor two had planks nailed cross them two had glazed panels and the remaining two had boards where originally the glass had been theyre really helpful in this part of town arent they said rose not a single number on any door not a single name no they take them off to confuse the debtcollectors behind one of the glass panels a light shone the only sign of life along the silent corridor steele walked up to the door and pressed a buzzer set in its jamb there was no sound guessing that the batteries were dead he pounded on it three times with the side of his closed fist eventually the sound of shuffling came from within the house the dull green door swung open and a woman appeared framed against the light from within a smell of almost indescribable staleness threatened to engulf them aye from the tired hostility other tone rose guessed that there had not been a welcome caller at her door for years she was perhaps fortyfive but looked ten years older in her youth she might have been pretty but now her features were worn and weary she was short and dumpy with lifeless grey hair that was sadly in need of a wash as was the loose purple nylon dress which hung around her police steele announced flashing his warrant card quickly is this number twentythree ah dinna fuckin ken she snapped back at him a scowl disfiguring her still further you live here dont you aye but ah wouldna ken whit number it wis naebody ever writes taste me only the social and ah tear them up were looking for a mr deacey said rose well hes no here the little woman replied emphatically theres jist me me and ma budgie theres nae point in yis talking to it though wee bastard nivir says a fuckin word she would have slammed the door but steele put a hand against it okay he growled roughly who else lives on this floor she pointed along the hallway to a door opposite hers one with unpainted wood in place of its glass panel theres a hoor along there an a bloke wi her ah think yis could try there shell no have gone taste work yet thanks said the sergeant allowing her to return to her squalor poor budgie muttered maggie rose as she strode across the corridor to rap briskly on the wooden panel there was no answer she knocked again without success stevie steeles patience reached breaking point excuse me maam he said taking a heavy black leather glove from his overcoat pocket he put it on his right hand then punched the plywood panel it split neatly down the middle and the sundered pieces fell away into the flat police open up the sergeant shouted into the hall in which the blue light of a television shone the woman who appeared in the doorway a few seconds later still had her looks but the detectives knew that in not so many years she would be almost exactly like her neighbour across the way there was a hardness in her eyes a cold resigned glare in which her future was written she fumbled with the catch of a short red imitationleather skirt her other hand smoothing her silverblonde hair she stood around five feet six with the assistance of a pair of inordinately high heels who are you then cid mrs mason rose answered were involved in a murder investigation and were looking for malcolm deacey who steele thought that her bewilderment was genuine but the dci refused to buy it lets find out who she said stepping past the woman rocking her back on her heels the sergeant followed her into the hall and through a doorway at the end before them was a man sitting in a low armchair watching television he looked up at them he was black with garish orange dreadlocks who you he asked lazily showing a studied insouciance which the detectives recognised from many interview rooms edinburgh cid rose answered briskly we want to ask you some questions about a woman mr deacey a dead woman sho he grunted pushing himself easily to his feet less go den rose had begun to turn towards the door when he sprang at her instinctively she threw up her right arm in a gesture which was literally facesaving like steele she wore an overcoat and a jacket beneath but neither was protection against the open razor which deacey swung at her savagely she cried out more with fear than pain as it sliced into her forearm the man turned towards steele to be met by a heavy gloved fist which caught him square in the middle of the forehead his knees buckled his eyes glazed and he went down sprawling limply on the floor as if he was something that had been shaken from a sack the sergeant stamped down hard on his right hand trapping the razor he took it from the helpless fingers folded it and slipped it into his pocket then calmly he rolled the dazed deacey onto his face drove a knee hard into his back and handcuffed him you try to get up pal he whispered and ill cut your nicking ears off pushing himself quickly to his feet he turned to rose blood was pouring from her arm down her hand and dripping onto the carpet you he snarled at hannah mason who stood in the doorway stunned by the sudden explosion of violence get me clean towels tissues anything you have he helped the dci out of her bloody overcoat and jacket and looked at the cut it was bonedeep it ran along the full length of her forearm for a few seconds he felt nauseated but he fought off the temptation to throw up then the woman was back with a decently white towel and a box of kleenex tissues he padded the wound with the paper handkerchiefs then took the towel and clamped it on top press that hard maggie he said rose nodded palefaced but clear eyed she held the towel tight watching him as he ripped the belt from his waistband and used it to fasten a tourniquet just above her elbow as he finished deacey began to stir on the floor steele put a foot on his neck as he took out his mobile phone and dialled the st leonards police office identifying himself to the telephonist he barked out the address i have an injured officer ambulance pronto and backup to take a prisoner back to the nick he glowered down at the man who had given up all thoughts of struggling you might think youre in trouble mister he said coldly and evenly but believe me you dont have the faintest idea of how deep in the shit you really are lets promise each other something eh whats that she whispered that this is going to be the last time that either of us visits the other in this bloody place mario mcguire had never been more sincere in his life as his wife looked up at him the thought came to him that she had never looked more lovely her red hair had been brushed by a recovery room nurse and was spread softly on the pillow her eyes were still slightly hazy from the anaesthetic and her appearance was one of gentle vulnerability her right arm lay above the covers encased in a huge thick bandage from just above the elbow to the wrist life is the scene of one continuous accident my dear she mumbled with a light halfstoned smile but yes lets both do our best to make sure we dont what the hell was that boy steele thinking about mcguire growled letting you get into a situation like that when i see him im going to she squeezed his arm lightly with her left hand youre going to thank him from the bottom of your heart and buy him a great big drink you couldnt have kept me out of there any more than he could she grinned again whos the ranking officer here when it came to the bit stevie was brilliant he flattened the guy and secured him inside ten seconds then took care of me like an expert deacey went for me because i was nearest if he had got to stevie first the smile left her face and she shuddered shh he soothed her lets not talk about it any more all things considered lets just thank our lucky stars he looked at her at her heavily bandaged right arm and at the tube which ran from her left arm to a drip set up by the bedside ive talked to the guy who operated on you he said there was quite a bit of tendon and muscle damage but theyve been able to sew everything back together theyre confident that everything will sort itself in time and that you wont have any impaired movement in your hand you lost a lot of blood though theyre going to put a couple of pints into you she frowned at him you mean im not getting home tonight nor tomorrow night nor the night after that theyre going to keep you in until friday at the very least oh shit its only a cut he sighed mags love its one of the worst wounds of its type that your surgeon has ever treated to guarantee a full recovery they have to keep your arm immobilised for a while so do what they say if you want to be able to button up your shirts with your right hand her grin returned or unbutton yours she chuckled woozily he could tell that she was ready for sleep im going to go now he said theyre going to move you to a ward in a minute ill look in tomorrow morning were working up here just now he leaned across the bed and kissed her sleep tight and watch that arm mario she whispered as he made to stand the heavy sedative was kicking in with a vengeance what he smiled at her amused he had never seen her as intoxicated wrong bloody deacey she murmured but hes the only one her voice trailed off as the drug drew her into sleep he kissed her once more on the forehead stood and turned to leave the surgeon stood in the doorway you sure shell be all right now mcguire asked something in his voice made it clear that there had better be only one answer to that question yes if she does what shes told for the next few days he sighed rough job for a woman suddenly mario felt a lump in his throat he looked back over his shoulder towards the bed so that the man could not see his eyes some woman he said lost in love and admiration he shook his head as if to clear it zipped up his barbour and headed out of edinburgh royal infirmary into the night the clock in his car which was parked near the ae entrance thanks to his special branch clout told him that it was just after eight thirty instead of heading home he swung right out of the hospital gate and drove off in the direction of the st leonards divisional headquarters the officer on duty at the entrance nodded an acknowledgement as he walked into the building mr mackie still here he asked yes sir said the man up in his office ds steeles still here too mcguire trotted upstairs gave a brief knock on the divisional cid commanders door and walked in mackie and steele were seated at a long conference table shirtsleeved the superintendent held a mug of coffee while the sergeant was sipping from a can of sprite they stood anxiously as he closed the door behind him how is she asked mackie drugged up to the eyeballs and having blood pumped into her but shes going to be all right thank christ mario im sorry steele began what for saving her life we owe you one son thanks from both of us but i should have held her back the young sergeant protested that place was a snake pit i should have gone in first stevie said mcguire steadily if you had held her back even now youd have been shaking the mothballs out of your uniform he peeled off his barbour and the jacket of his suit together and threw them across the table whats the deacey story then brian he isnt one the superintendent answered sourly we printed him then ran a pnc check the guys real name is winston joseph hes a pimp from birmingham hes been wanted for four years since one of his girls was murdered cut to bits he was the only suspect witnesses saw them together at the scene the other tarts in his string said that the dead girl had been doing freelance jobs and hed found out he hasnt been seen since the cid down there assumed hed gone back to the caribbean but now it turns out that he got himself fixed up with a new identity we were put on to him by the dss people he was the only deacey that their records showed up its obvious that when maggie told him that she wanted to talk to him about the death of a woman he jumped to the wrong conclusion ie that hed been rumbled and that she and stevie were there to lift him for killing the girl weve charged him with attempted murder but as soon has hes been up before the sheriff tomorrow for a formal remand weve got to send him down south for questioning there our brummie colleagues are very grateful to us thats good mags be pleased too yes but he was our only deacey and no way was he gaynors boyfriend we can be sure of that much so the weston investigations at a dead stop she wont be so chuffed about that i suppose not mcguire grunted coffee asked mackie please he paused ill just go for a piss first still in shirtsleeves his warrant card hanging on a chain round his neck he left the room he walked straight past the male toilet which was not far from mackies office then downstairs and along the corridor to the stations holding cells hello davie he said to the custody sergeant the man looked at him for a long time unsmiling remember that night in muirhouse when those three guys had you trapped mcguire asked meaningfully the sergeant reached a decision with a grim nod he rose and led him along the row of cells until they came to the last door on the right its tuesday the night he said at last quiet naebody else in yet he turned his master key in the lock winston joseph was squatting on the bed against the far wall of the cell when the blackhaired shirtsleeved thicknecked figure stepped into his world he jumped to his feet i told yall already aint got nothin to say mon thats fine mcguire growled i dont want you to say anything i just want you to scream for a while he stepped forward reaching out with his left hand as if to clip the man on the side of the head instinctively joseph leaned back as he did so the swarthy detective shifted his weight and smashed his right fist into the fleshy triangle just below his rib cage the smacking sound seemed to bounce off the cells tiled room for a moment the bizarre orange dreadlocks stood out straight as if their owner had been struck by lightning indescribable bolts of pain flooded through the bulky body of the former malcolm deacey as his legs buckled beneath him and he slumped to the floor he did his best to scream but found that all the air seemed to have been driven from his lungs they burned adding to his agony as he gasped for breath his smiling nightmare allowed him squirm on the floor for a few seconds then hauled him upright held him by the throat with his left hand and hit him again in the same spot but even harder this time joseph lost control of his bladder as well as his legs just in case you were wondering said mario mcguire conversationally as he dug his left thumb agonisingly into the bunched nerve endings at the base of the mans neck that was my wife you cut this afternoon i wish i had more time to get to know you but still ive got enough you my man are in for the worst few minutes of your life somewhere in his befuddled brain winston joseph knew that the smart thing to do would be to pass out unfortunately he never had been very smart every special branch commander for a decade had come to know henry wills well student politics were no longer seen as a major subject for surveillance but even in relaxed times those in charge of the security of the state thought it prudent to be aware of the broad spectrum of campus activity very few things happened in edinburgh university of which its registrar was ignorant wills was a polite urbane man as he sat at his meeting table with mario mcguire and karen neville his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose made him look even more owlish than usual before we begin inspector i must ask you how is your wife i read all about her mishap in this mornings scotsman as he spoke he glanced through the window towards the sprawling buildings of the royal infirmary of which the nearest was less than three hundred yards away mcguire smiled shes doing fine thanks mr wills i looked in on her before i came here she had a good night god help them today though once the postop sedations all worn off maggies a hellish patient and how are you mario the registrar added quietly to tell you the truth i still shake every time i think what might have happened itll be a while before i can put that thought out of my mind and the man who did it the inspector looked at his watch hes due in the sheriff court just about now once hes been charged formally hell be off to england to be questioned about a murder does that mean that he wont be punished for attacking your wife no not at all when our courts want him well get him back theyll take a plea in absentia i should think and hell be sent to the high court for disposal hell get ten years at least hopefully the judge will make it consecutive to be served after hes due for release from his life sentence for the brum murder he glowered at wills if he makes it concurrent then effectively the bastard will have got off with it he placed his hands palmsdown on the table his way of indicating that the subject was closed how many of your economists do we still have to check henry he asked wills looked at the bundle of landing cards which lay on the desk before him and at the registration sheets which lay beside them in matching order today should see it done the registrar replied looking from one detective to the other those are the details of the people in the last two discussion groups once you work through these thatll be everyone accounted for a pity in a way ive enjoyed your morning visits mario mcguire fought to suppress a chuckle most men enjoyed a visit from karen neville but he was surprised to hear the bookish middleaged academic admit it the sergeant was a rare combination of attractive features and spectacular physique in addition she had a quick open smile and a way of looking through her bluegrey eyes at most things male which made them feel as if there was no one else in the room she was the second most desirable woman mcguire had ever seen in the past her own desires had been quick to surface this had led her into trouble on more than one occasion her smile widened a little as she ran a hand over her thick designer blonde hair i envy you your office mr wills she responded looking round the oakpanelled room ours is a steelfurnished box thats right said the inspector intervening before their host could reach meltdown point special branch isnt that special when it comes to accommodation he looked on as wills divided the papers into two sets anything exceptional in this lot he asked well the other man began there is one chap whose sheet struck me as slightly odd the thing is he doesnt appear to be an economist his name is wayne ventnor he does list a degree but its in chemical engineering from the university of western australia at first sight its not clear what hes doing here my supposition is that hes a civil servant nominated by an australian state government although his registration sheet doesnt say that that sounds plausible all the same mcguire agreed the sheets still show the same information as the ones weve seen before do they yes name nation or university of origin qualifications any special area of interest conference number discussion group allocation and hotel or other accommodation only one thing missing isnt there whats that asked neville as wills nodded sheepishly a photograph of each delegate said the inspector if wed had those we could have done this check in a day dont i know it the registrar acknowledged its supposed to be standard practice for university events but the people who organised this conference are a law unto themselves you might tell them mcguire grumbled that when it comes to security im the law around here and that i dont appreciate having to go round eyeballing two hundred plus people when we could have handled most of it at a desk if theyd done a professional job come on karen he said say goodbye to mr wills and lets get on down to the conference centre to get this lot looked over maggie is going to make a full recovery isnt she bob skinner asked anxiously the wounded chief inspector had served for a time as his executive assistant she was one of the group of officers whom he regarded privately as his inner circle brian mackie another of the select group did his best to reassure him the surgeon told mario that he expects her to be fine it was a brutal cut and her arm is full of internal sutures as well as the clips on the outside but if she behaves herself everything will heal up fine the dcc nodded good but when shes ready to come back to work its down to you to make sure she does toe the line office duties only until the surgeon certifies that theres no further chance of longterm damage mackie frowned you tell her that please boss i dont think ive got the guts you know what maggies like shell be desperate to get back into the front line as quick as she can ill tell her this very morning im going up to the royal when i leave here he looked around mackies office i came down here for a purpose brian allocation ofcid resources is andys responsibility but i dont want you to feel shy about asking him for a replacement for mags while shes off i know that overall were tight on manpower but if he asks me for another senior body ill accommodate him we have chief inspectors in uniform with cid experience i can transfer one of them on a temporary basis the superintendent nodded his appreciation thanks sir but let me try it on my own for a bit ill try and fill the gap myself by getting out of the office more skinner laughed who does that remind me of i wonder you mackie replied promptly youve got a lot to answer for this force is littered with reluctant delegators made in your image im not just indulging myself though he continued if i brought someone else in id just have to bring him or her up to speed on the weston investigation no ive got a great regard for young steele im going to team up with him myself skinner nodded i share your view of the lad hell get a commendation for bravery for what he did yesterday thatll be his second in a fairly short time the dcc paused is that bastard joseph still downstairs no boss hes off to court hell be charged released without bail so that we dont run into trouble with the hundred and ten day prosecution rule then rearrested immediately on suspicion of the birmingham murder he wont be coming back to this nick though hell be held in saughton until escorting officers arrive from down south just as well the dcc muttered every minute he spends here mario must feel like going down there and battering the shit out of him there was a sudden silence in the room it lasted for one second too long before mackie broke it yes indeed skinner looked at him an eyebrow raised opened his mouth as if to speak then closed it again josephs brief came up to see me before he went to court the superintendent continued hastily he said that his client was after a deal hed plead guilty to the birmingham murder if wed drop the attempt to murder charge and if the dss drop their fraud complaint over his false identity eh hed plead to murder to avoid a serious assault charge and a dss fiddle he doesnt want to do time in scotland apparently so what did you tell the solicitor what the book tells me to say that he should take it up with the fiscal but i added that personally i didnt give a shit about birmingham with one of our own wounded quite right too ill have a word with davie pettigrew myself just to keep his backbone stiff mr joseph will do time in scotland for cutting mags thats for bloody certain skinner rose to leave how about the weston investigation with joseph eliminated its dead in the water is it not mackie smiled maybe not ive had a report from that new orthopaedic hospital out in dalkeith the head pharmacist there wants to talk to me and she wouldnt tell me why over the phone the boy steele and i are going to see her this afternoon the job was relatively simple in most cases all that mcguire and neville were required to do was to take one look at a subject to confirm his presence at the event and to eliminate him from the list however it had to be done discreetly without anyone being aware that they were under surveillance the two officers had learned very quickly that they could work most effectively by ignoring those parts of the conference which all delegates attended the university organisers had split their guests into eight smaller groups and given them a programme of detailed study and discussion of eight key topics it was a simple matter for the detectives to cover one seminar room each and wait for their subjects to come to them karen neville sat at her desk at the entrance to room g as discussion group seven began to file in she wore a badge which identified her as a member of the conference staff and had before her a list of the members of the group beside some of the names she had placed a tiny innocuous blue dot smiling she checked each delegates pass as they reached her and put a tick against their name on the list there were thirtyone people in group seven which for a reason best known to the organisers contained twenty of the female attendees neville was accustomed to women sticking together at police events but somehow she had not expected economists to behave in the same way nonetheless she checked each ladys badge as carefully as the rest looking at the line she wondered for the third time that week whether there was an international uniform for academics not one of them was dressed in anything resembling a formal manner most of the women wore trousers several with shapeless cardigans only a minority of the men wore ties and one or two were unshaven of the eleven men six were from eu countries and therefore not on her landing card list every one was over fifty and overweight of the other five two were sri lankan one was a dourlooking bespectacled australian in a wheelchair another was a twentysevenyearold american from north carolina too young to be a disguised hawkins and the last was not there she realised she looked at her list wayne ventnor the incongruous chemical engineer had not checked in for the discussion as the group settled down and the event chairperson stepped up to the podium the sergeant counted heads once more sure enough there were only thirty delegates present as neville slipped out of the room she made a mental list of possible reasons for the mans absence illness alcohol and boredom were the top three she walked along the curving corridor heading clockwise towards room e where mcguire was stationed she had gone barely twenty yards when she reached on her right a makeshift refreshment buffet it was staffed by two whitecoated ladies standing guard over a tall metal um a large teapot and a range of biscuits but it had only one customer a big longlegged brown haired bearded man he was seated in a low chair a coffee before him on a low table and he was reading a copy of the independent through goldframed glasses instinctively she checked her stride and turned into the cafe area affecting diffidence she shuffled up to the man and leaned over him peering at the laminated badge which was clipped to the jacket of his navyblue suit it read w ventnor australia the man blinked and looked up from his newspaper not into her face if that had been his intention but at her bosom which was directly in his eyeline as she bent over towards him im sorry she began smiling i was just checking that you are mr ventnor im karen from the conference staff its my job to know where everyone is and your name wasnt ticked off from my list his eyes reached hers at last his sudden smile was dazzling secret police eh he said in a broad aussie drawl she chuckled covering her inward gulp hardly freelance conference organiser in fact the university hires my firm to help with the administration of events like this how have i missed you up to now he asked turning up the grin one more notch ive been around i promise it must just be that our paths havent crossed well now that they have karen can i buy you a coffee he nodded at the empty cup on the table its passable i promise that would be nice she said as he pushed himself to his feet and headed for the buffet table a chill ran through her he walked with a distinct limp on his right side one of the helpful ladies at the counter pleased to have customers insisted on bringing his purchases to the table on a tray as she placed coffee and a kitkat before each of them neville smiled at him again trying to keep a twinkle in her eyes rather than the naked excitement she felt so why are you playing hookey she asked have you crossed your boredom threshold as far as subnational economies are concerned i crossed it as soon as i walked into this place the man replied his hair was a very light brown she noticed with fair highlights and his beard was very definitely not false as he reached out to pick up his coffee she was struck by the thickness of his wrists im no economist i didnt think so he looked back at her a little too quickly for her comfort careful karen she told herself whys that then because youre wearing a suit she said in fact youre the only smartly dressed man in this building he laughed an easy relaxed confident sound they are a scruffy shower of bastards arent they so what are you doing here she made the question sound as light and inconsequential as she could im a minder of sorts for a second or two she was puzzled wondering whether their surveillance was being duplicated by another agency did you see dennis dennis crombie the guy in the wheelchair she nodded yes ive just checked him in well im looking after him thats why im here i work for blaydon oil on an offshore oil rig and im on a long leave dennis is an old mate so when he told me that he was planning to come to this conference i offered to tag along as his helper but why are you registered as a delegate she asked out of genuine curiosity as she broke a finger from her kitkat theres no other category of visitor we were told that with the minister being here there would be security dennis reckoned that it would be easiest if i registered just like everyone else he needs me close by him most of the time you see you must be quite a friend to sit through this sort of event for him ventnor smiled again ive never seen scotland he said ive always wanted to visit the original perth youre hardly going to see much of it given the conference programme ah but were staying on for a couple of months afterwards dennis wants to do some research here after the conference thatll give me the chance to spend the odd day sightseeing let me know if you need a guide she said it burst from her unchecked without a thought hey grinned ventnor thats damn white of you ill take you up on that he paused say what are you doing tonight dennis turns in around nine maybe i could buy you a pizza and you could tell me about edinburgh i shouldnt fraternise with the punters she began but what the hell where do you want to meet you tell me its your city giulianos opposite the playhouse theatre just take a taxi if you dont know it ill book a table for nine fifteen she rose from the table ill see you there right now though i have to find my colleague ill he really does have perfect teeth she thought even after all the roughhouses he must have been in his time theyre still straight and shining mcguires mouth hung open as he stared at her across his desk no he gasped she didnt really say that mario you just imagined it son with all the strain youve been under in the last twentyfour hours she didnt tell you that shes found a hawkins suspect and made a date with him no of course she bloody didnt his mouth came together in a grim line oh yes she bloody did said karen neville quietly but defiantly then what the hell were you thinking about sergeant or didnt thought come into it werent you listening when i told you how dangerous michael hawkins is yes now you listen to me please inspector i said that i thought at first that this could have been hawkins especially when i saw the limp but now i know that it isnt ive run checks already with the university of western australia wayne ventnor did graduate from there fifteen years ago ive also checked with blaydon oil they do have a senior production engineer named wayne ventnor and he is on long leave just now hes recovering from an onboard accident in fact he broke his right ankle in a fall fine mcguire shot back but you didnt know all that when you made the date with the guy you could have been putting your lovely blonde head on the block if this had been hawkins did it ever occur to you that he might have checked up on you too suppose he did and found out that you werent a freelance conference organiser he shook his head jesus he hissed it doesnt bear thinking about i could have handled him hawkins likes the ladies remember the cia plant he didnt rumble her did he karen when cia operatives are placed its done carefully with cover stories that stand up to investigation youve spun this ventnor man a yarn now youve got to stick to it you cant turn around and tell him youre really a copper or youve blown our operation he grunted the best thing you can do is stand the guy up she glared back at him but i dont want to stand him up now ive checked him out theres no reason why i should i could order you could you are you sure about that suddenly his eyes were like ice karen he whispered this is special branch i could have you locked up for twentyfour hours if i wanted and then his gaze softened again but i wont just watch the pillow talk thats all pillow talk the retort burst from her indignantly what sort of a woman do you think i am he leaned back in his chair as if he was recoiling from her attack okay okay im sorry i didnt mean that literally its just that in this section you can never forget who or what you are and you cant forget the nature of your work i cant even tell maggie about the hawkins operation andy martin cant tell alex i heard alex had chucked him said karen quietly a friend of mine lives in the same street at haymarket she told me she saw her moving out at the weekend mcguires eyes widened is that so well heres some more serious advice if you bump into him dont you go commiserating with him mr martin doesnt like his business on the bulletin board legend has it that there is in newcastle a hospital ward which is largely populated by drinkers of a famous local ale by the same token it is said that edinburghs orthopaedic hospital provision exists mainly to patch together the victims of motorcycle accidents neither fable stands up to close examination in particular the east of scotlands reputation for excellence in reconstructive surgery is founded on decades of exceptional work with patients many of them children suffering from congenital or degenerative conditions dalkeith orthopaedic centre had been open for less than a year detective sergeant steve steele learned from the plaque on the wall of its main entrance he vaguely remembered the wrangling which had preceded the decision of the previous government to commit funds to the project public and surgical opinion having been at odds over the construction of a specialist unit in times of financial shortage eventually the ministers of the day had given the nod to the electors mollifying the medics by providing the new hospital through a private finance initiative what exactly is a pfi sir steele asked mackie as they stepped through the main entrance to the centre passing into a welcoming reception hall well appointed both with furniture and potted palms the only thing i know about it is that someone makes a buck out of it longterm the detective superintendent answered dryly he stepped up to the reception point and introduced himself and his colleague we have an appointment with miss berry the head pharmacist the young man behind the desk gave him a cool appraising look then pointed towards the busy waiting area if youll take a seat gentlemen im sure shell be with you when she can something about his tone needled mackie he suspected that the receptionist had had other meetings with police officers i dont want a seat he said quietly ive got plenty of seats you just tell her were here the detectives stood by the desk watching the youth as he pushed a button on his telephone console and spoke quietly into its microphone your twothirty appointment miss berry he said they heard a bright voice answer ill be right there do you think this bloke was going to jerk us about sir steele asked loudly enough to be heard on the other side of the desk it happens stevie said mackie its an occupational hazard damn silly though for we coppers never forget he leaned towards the young man bloody elephants we are they had been waiting for less than two minutes when the chief pharmacist bustled round a corner she was a pleasant roundfaced woman in her late thirties with closecropped auburn tinted hair and big round spectacles she looked at the two men then settled on the older mr mackie she asked looking up at him with a hand outstretched im margie berry he shook it thats right this is ds steele he smiled you picked us out right away the little woman grinned back at him tugging the lapels of her white coat nothing odd about that you two can stand unaided most people come in here on crutches the superintendent looked across at the waiting area and saw that the patients clutched an assortment of sticks zimmer frames and other supports come along to my department said the pharmacist and ill tell you why i asked to see you they followed her round the corner from which she had come down a long corridor and through a door at the end the hospital pharmacy was smaller than mackie had expected margie berry appeared to have two assistants a man and a woman each in their twenties were working at desks and a third was vacant there was no room for anyone else bill jenny she called out as she swept into the room take your teabreaks now please okay marge the man answered with a grin well get out so you can play your game mackie looked at the door as it closed on the two assistants so they dont know what this is about either hell no that wouldnt have been fair either on them or on the person involved so said the superintendent youve found a discrepancy in your stocks miss berry shook her head no i didnt say that i keep a running check on my supplies mr mackie if i had a discrepancy within the pharmacy i would know about it in the week it happened everything thats gone out of here tallies exactly with the prescriptions submitted she looked at steele a hospital pharmacy operates just like a high street chemist sergeant she explained prescription drugs go out only on a doctors signature as for diamorphine and the like that has to be signed for again on receipt how about drugs held on wards asked the young detective theyre kept in a secure container and dispensed by a senior nurse thats the responsibility of the ward sister i see so if anything was taken the chances are it would go from there no the certainty is that it would in this hospital at least and can you pin it down to a single ward easily margie berry replied a record is kept there of drugs administered to each patient i can tell by looking at it and at prescriptions issued exactly how much should be in the drugs trolley at any given time every so often i will visit a ward unannounced and verify the figures when your department called asking me to check on diamorphine stocks i did very discreet spot checks on all wards going back several weeks and found discrepancies on two of them not huge in themselves but added together were talking about a significant dose of diamorphine enough to kill asked mackie intently enough to kill a pony never mind a person in what form was the stuff taken in phials for injection diamorphine is used here mainly in postoperative situations so we shove it into the patients arm or bum with a hypo rather than administering it through a pump as they often do on medical wards when did the stuff disappear over a fourday period around two weeks ago and is there a linking factor the pharmacist looked at the superintendent only one that i can find the drugs were all issued on the prescription of the same doctor but what is really unusual is that he rather than the ward sister or senior nurse signed for them personally she paused so gentlemen its in deepest confidence and this is why i asked my assistants to vacate the premises that im giving you the mans name hes doctor surinder gopal a registrar on the staff of derrick strang the clinical director but guess what hes missing im afraid your informant was exaggerating officer there was a patronising tone to the mans voice for which stevie steele did not care but he let it pass derrick strang had been in the operating theatre when the detectives had gone to seek him out and so mackie had called up a patrol car to take him back to st leonards leaving the sergeant to cool his heels in the clinical directors outer office for over an hour drinking coffee and making small talk with his middle aged secretary dr gopal is not missing from his post said the surgeon at least not in the sense you mean hes on leave to which incidentally he is more than entitled theres not a doctor in this unit who works harder than surinder does he stripped off his white coat and hung it on a hook behind the door then leaned back throwing his arms above his head forearms together stretching the muscles of his back and shoulders for the first time he smiled and became less formal sorry about the exercises ive just done a hip replacement on a very large man lay people dont appreciate it but orthopaedic surgery is very demanding physically on the surgeon as well as the patients by the time were ready to retire most of us need new parts ourselves he touched the tip of his nose with his fingertips then pulled his elbows back sharply whats all this about anyway he asked the detective shook his head im sorry mr strang i cant tell you that not until ive spoken to your colleague is it a professional matter is it something i could help you with no it isnt we just need to talk to dr gopal thats all we believe that he may have information which is relevant to a current investigation when did he go on leave last monday or rather tuesday morning if one wanted to be pedantic about it what do you mean i mean that he called in on tuesday and asked me if it would be all right if he took three weeks leave with immediate effect i told him that would be okay that i would arrange cover for his list steele made no attempt to hide his surprise did you ask him why he couldnt give you notice of course he said that he was burned out and i accepted that it happens to hardworking young doctors you know policemen too the detective murmured i must try that one on my superintendent some time he looked up at derrick strang where does dr gopal live edinburgh thats all i know our personnel people will have his address on file ill ask my secretary to get it for you he opened the door and leaned into the outer office for a few seconds are you close colleagues steele asked do you know each other well the clinical director shook his head i wouldnt say that we have a cordial relationship but its purely professional surinder is a member of my team and he does very good work hes a very conscientious young man as ive said and a pleasant person into the bargain but we rarely socialise away from the hospital other than at the christmas lunch and the burns supper nothing racial about that by the way he added hurriedly golf is the main outofhours activity among the clinical staff but young dr gopal doesnt play the game how long has he been with you strang eased himself into his chair facing the detective he scratched his chin lets see hes been with me here since we opened before that around eighteen months at the pmr two and a half years give or take a month before that he worked up at the western as a junior on nolan westons staff steele managed to maintain a casual tone is that professor weston thats right chair of surgical oncology at edinburgh university surinder thought about specialising in that area but he decided that the future lies in orthopaedics hes right too the trend in cancer is away from surgery whereas in our field we have all sorts of new ground being broken ten years down the road sergeant well be transplanting a lot more than organs thats a certainty he raised his right hand and extended the index finger we can do these now but thats only a start as he spoke the door opened strangs secretary came into the room and handed him a note the consultant took it and passed it to steele there you are sergeant surinders address maybe once youve spoken to him you can tell me what the mystery was all about with every passing minute karen neville grew more uncomfortable as she sat in the centre of the restaurant facing the door watching each shadow cast on its glass panel by the street light outside giulianos is at its quietest in the middle of the evening since most of its trade comes from theatregoing diners before and after the nightly performances at the playhouse she took yet another sip of her san pellegrino and glanced at her watch yet again it showed nine thirtythree and her aqua minerale was almost finished she was sure that the young waiter was laughing at her as he sidled up to her table can i bring you a glass of wine perhaps madame he asked no thanks she said grimly you can leave a menu though you are waiting for a gentleman si she knew that his accent was authentic since most of edinburghs italian restaurants employ genuinely italian waiters karen fixed him with a look that would have frozen south miami the waiter simply shook his head he mus be a crazy man to keep you waiting he grinned on another night she would have gone along with the joke perhaps flirted with the oliveskinned youth who was not bad looking she admitted to herself on another night in fact she might have called his bluff but the beginnings of anger were stirring in her at that moment he was simply a nuisance to be blown away no she said he has responsibilities at home he has to put his partner to bed every night dennis is very fussy about that im used to it at that moment the door swung open and wayne ventnor swept into the restaurant as he approached she noticed that his limp seemed more pronounced than it had at the conference centre karen i am so sorry he burst out i was afraid youd have given up on me by now he smiled as he sat opposite her and she felt her annoyance dissolve another ten minutes she replied and youd have found me eating but its okay did you have trouble with your friend no that wasnt it edinburgh is a bloody awful place to find a taxi thats all no dennis is never a problem he might look a bit grumpy but hes a good bloke really whys he in the wheelchair wayne frowned hes got some sort of degenerative disease not ms but something similar i dont know im ignorant when it comes to medicine how about you where did the limp come from from falling off a ladder on my rig he smiled at her hardly your stereotypical aussies are we one in a chair the other with a bent wing youre not limping just now she said softly they concentrated on their menu cards for a few minutes once the deflated waiter had departed for the kitchen with their orders karen turned to the australian so how did the rest of your day go just like the part you saw the sandwiches at lunchtime were okay though if it hadnt been for you that would probably have been the highlight of the day how about you the oh i just went back to base and got on with the preparation of our next event inwardly she groaned dont chuck in unnecessary detail she scolded herself and whats that came the inevitable question a group marketing seminar for a big insurance company she offered hoping that it sounded sufficiently boring to end his interest whats your company called he asked her for a second she wondered whether it might be a trick question i thought i told you this morning im freelance i have an associate we trade jointly as mcguire and neville we dont have an office though we work from home she imagined that she saw a shadow cross his face ah he said you live together no we dont im sorry i meant from each of our homes hes married and i she lowered her voice im gay in the silence that followed she asked herself what had made her say that did she still suspect him or had she simply laid down a marker of her determination to follow mcguires advice on pillow talk whatever the reasoning behind her instinctive remark his reaction made it superfluous thats all right then he said taking her breath away as she had taken his so ami they laughed spontaneously and simultaneously i know a joke about a gay australian karen offered sure he preferred women to beer suddenly all her uncertainty was gone she felt completely relaxed which one are you by the way he asked mcguire or neville you realise i dont even know your second name didnt you read my badge at the conference centre or are you dyslexic on top of everything else im karen neville she smiled as she offered her hand pleased to meet you youre certain that its dr gopal whos been nicking the diamorphine asked andy martin as he nodded brian mackies dome gleamed under the fluorescent tubes which lit the head of cids office as i see it theres little doubt about it he signed for the stuff it was spread between two wards we went back out there this morning and interviewed the sisters and the nurses in charge of the drug trolleys the only way the discrepancy could have arisen was if there had been collusion between at least two of them but they all know that margie berry makes regular checks gopal didnt know that he prescribed the diamorphine and signed for it everything points to having kept some for himself then delivered the rest to the wards how far back did the pharmacist check her records i asked her to look back over the past year and to check who signed for drugs issued on prescriptions written by gopal there were no other discrepancies this was a oneoff event a few days before gaynor weston died and a couple of years ago gopal was on nolan westons staff i see said martin leaning against his windowsill that puts the professor firmly back in the frame doesnt it on the face of it mackie agreed at the very least it means that we have reason to go and interview him again want to come not a lot i will though if you want however i think you should find dr gopal before you do anything else theres aprimafacie case against him so he should be our priority until youve talked to him anything you say to weston will be pure supposition incidentally i know we initiated the check but has the hospital made a formal complaint about the missing drugs not as such but we know about it so we have a duty to investigate whether they do or not yes i suppose so theres no need to be a stickler for the book but still i think ill have sammy pye draft a report to the fiscal just to cover our legal tails after all we are dealing with the theft of a significant quantity of a class a drug i take it that dalkeith was the only hospital to report a discrepancy yes thank christ the superintendent confirmed right ill head off to find dr gopal he lives in the old town apparently he paused before i go i hope you dont mind my asking you this andy but are you all right martin glowered at him what makes you think im not he said curtly you seem a bit preoccupied with something and if that wasnt the case the fact that you just bit my head off is a good indication the head of cid shrugged his shoulders sorry if i hurt your feelings brian but the fact is im becoming a bit pissed off with well meaning friends asking me if im ok listen up ill tell you this and then the subjects closed because i dont like my problems being public property alex has moved out okay shes saying all the usual things about giving ourselves room to develop as a couple and yes maybe to save my own face im agreeing with her making all the right noises and so on she could probably argue that i pushed her into making that decision but i didnt really think that she would i dont like it and privately i dont agree with all that growing space crap either are you still engaged oh shes still wearing the ring brian but only on her finger if you know what i mean not in her heart whats the big man saying about it nothing bobs maintaining a determined neutrality but i know him better than that he wouldnt admit it under torture but deep inside i reckon hes pleased he has ambitions professional ambitions for alex and i suspect he was worried that she might have been giving too low a priority to her career he glanced at mackie how do you feel about sheilas career brian its a fact of our life it doesnt bother me but longer term dyou think it might andy said the slim detective she and i have only just started living together right now id settle for knowing that we have a longer term we might split up i might come up against the wrong bloke in the job and get shot sheila might get cancer like poor olive if you learn nothing else from the mcllhenneys you should learn this fuck the longer term concentrate on now because thats all the certainty youve got mate martin sat on the edge of his desk with a wry smile my trouble is that im not certain of anything any more where alex is concerned but maybe youre just a selfish bastard where shes concerned think on that not all of edinburghs old town fits that description the spine of the original city rests on a hogsback which runs from the castle invincible on its great volcanic rock down through the high street past st giles and the council chambers and through canongate to the palace of holyroodhouse the seat of generations ofmonarchs of scotland and of the united kingdoms rather than having been preserved as a monument it has evolved as a living community many of its buildings have stood for centuries those which did not survive have been replaced under the critical eye of the powerful civic watchdogs some elected others selfappointed dr surinder gopals address was in the lower part of the royal mile on the outer limits of a stones throw from the palace it lay at the foot of a narrow close which ran beneath a modem tenement and connected the canongate with calton road brian mackie surveyed the grey stone building trying to make sense of the numbering of the apartments what do you think this was sir before it was turned into flats asked steele i believe it was a brewery the superintendent pointed to double doors which opened out on to a small balcony at third floor level i reckon they used to store the barley up there you can still see the spar for the hoist look the brewing would have been done in this part he nodded towards a square twostorey block which looked as if it might be an entire house rather than flats they found the name gopal alongside the first of a row of buttons above a speaker grille mackie pressed it leaning close to be sure that he caught the reply he waited for thirty seconds but none came he pressed again still there was no reply he pushed the buzzer for a third time bugger it he hissed at last the soandso must have gone on holiday right enough suddenly there was a click from the grille and a low buzz yess it was a female voice nervous and tremulous detective superintendent mackie ds steele st leonards police station wed like to speak to dr gopal that is my son but he is not here the woman replied even through her accent which was heavily asian she sounded frightened what do you want with him its something connected with his work thats all routine can we come in for a minute i dont know you really are the police yes we are but before you let us in call our office he recited the number of the divisional headquarters the names are mr mackie and mr steele remember theyll vouch for us wait there said the woman a few seconds later through the hum of the intercom they heard her voice faintly eventually she returned its all right they say you can come in come all the way up to the top floor there was a click as the lock on the heavy green door was released inside the building was a warren doors opened to no discernible pattern off the narrow winding stair on one floor it divided leading them on a brief wild goose chase eventually at the top of yet another flight they turned to find themselves facing a small middleaged darkskinned woman she wore traditional indian dress bright cloths wound around her embroidered with golden stars her oiled greying hair was swept back from her forehead upon which a caste mark was imprinted mackie took out his warrant card at once and held it up steele following suit good morning gentlemen she said in clipped proper tones no longer apprehensive wont you come in she stood to the side and allowed them to walk past her into the flat stevie steele whistled softly as he looked around nice he whispered to mackie i fancy this not on your wages the superintendent murmured the apartment was virtually open plan divided by sliding panels rather than doors short flights of steps at either end led to galleried areas one was a bedroom while the other seemed to be a study the decoration of the rooms was fresh and their pictures and ornaments displayed a mix of western and asian influences as you can see detectives said the woman my son is not here we didnt doubt you mrs gopal mackie assured her but we do need to find him we hoped that you could tell us where he is the surgeons mother shook her head no i cannot tell you that he is away she looked up suddenly making eye contact for the first time the kettle is just boiled you will have tea both policemen nodded thank you said steele darjeeling of course shesmiled what else in this house they watched her as she stepped into the small kitchen took a tea caddy from a shelf then picked up a big porcelain pot no tea bags here she called out to them in a singsong voice as she heaped in four measures do you live with your son mackie asked her she looked over her shoulder no of course not i live with my husband surinder is on holiday so i come here every morning to get his mail to clean and to feed his bird she pointed to one of the long rooms two windows there was a cage on the sill and in it a blue budgerigar sat on a swing eyeing a piece of cuttlefish bone which was clipped to the bars how long has he been gone about ten days maybe i dont know she put the pot on a tray together with three china cups and saucers and carried it out of the kitchen area to a carved wooden table in the centre of the room sit gentlemen please she insisted as she began to pour the tea what did he say to you when he left asked steele he told me that he was going away for two or three weeks on holiday he said that he had not decided on the places he would visit but that he would take his car and tour around go to europe maybe for the sunshine he told me that he had been working too hard and that he was in terrible need of a rest i said fine son you go rest i take care of your house i havent heard from him since but that doesnt worry me does dr gopal ever talk to you about his work mackies question seemed to set the womans dark eyes sparkling superintendent that is all he ever talks about surinder loves his work his only ambition is to be the best surgeon in the country does he ever mention his colleagues he talks a lot about mr strang he admires him very much one day surinder will be mr gopal like him he tells me that the most important doctors are the ones who are called mister what about the place where he worked before he went into orthopaedics does he ever mention that not often its been a while since he left there does he still have friends there mrs gopal nodded professor weston he is still a friend it was he who say to my son that he should go in for another sort of surgery since there would be more opportunities there the professor still takes an interest in surinders career he have them here for an indian dinner once professor and mrs weston not so long ago suddenly she looked around towards a low bookcase which stood against the wall between the windows she pushed herself to her feet walked over to it and took a slim volume from the top shelf they gave him this as a present she said handing it to mackie he looked at the cover it was a copy of the jungle book by kipling idly he opened it at the title page it had been signed the words jumped out at him for surinder in memory of a delicious evening nolan and gaynor he handed the book to steele still open at the dedication neither detective said a word they simply sipped their tea do you know if your son intended to go on holiday alone the young sergeant asked eventually to break the silence more than anything mrs gopal stared at him as if she did not understand his question might he have taken a girlfriend with him my son he does not have girlfriends she spat the word out as if it was something distasteful our family is traditionalist he is traditionalist when he is ready to marry he will tell his father and a marriage will be arranged for him until then he works does dr gopal keep a diary she frowned at mackies question an engagement book no if he did i would have found it when i dusted does he have a telephone answering machine or service no i see he really is out of touch then as i told you mackie nodded yes indeed he took out a card if dr gopal should phone you would you please ask him to contact either sergeant steele or me on this number tell him its important mrs gopals forehead wrinkled when detectives come looking for my doctor son i know it is important a i should have asked you before how was the hot date then leaning against the wall of the small office karen neville looked at mcguire he wore a mischievous grin cool actually he was nearly halfanhour late then when we started to get to know each other he turned out to be gay the inspector gasped in surprise what him and the bloke in the wheelchair you mean i asked him that no theyre just friends apparently from their younger days i dont think dennis is up to any sort of nookie these days straight or bent from what wayne told me he has to lift him in and out of bed and on and off the toilet unless its disabledfriendly that is plus he has to help him dress bath and everything where are they living in one of the big hotels no the university found them a serviced flat thats been specially fitted out for handicapped people whereabouts down in canonmills wayne said i think i know where it is at least i hope i do im picking him up from there tomorrow night what but you just said he was she smiled in which case you dont have to worry about me giving away secrets in the heat of passion will you mario anyway hes a nice guy good company and if hes only in the market for friendship well that makes a nice change from the usual she paused and blushed slightly plus i told him i was gay first i thought if i did it might avoid complications mcguire laughed out loud drawing a stem look from the customs officer across the room jesus he shook his head inspector the customs man called out the people from the amsterdam flight should begin coming through in a minute well check the noneu passport holders at that desk there he pointed through a oneway window which looked out on to a narrow corridor apart from the four cards that were drawn to your attention by the dutch people there have been six more completed during this flight five of them by males mcguire and neville crossed the room to stand beside him weve seen a lot of your unit out here in the last few days the officer said casually is there a major alert just business as usual mcguire murmured as the first passenger a tiny arab wearing a headdress made his way to the passport control point he was swaying slightly as if he had spent too long in the bar at schiphol hmm the man grunted moodily meaning mind your own business i suppose mcguire treated him to his most dazzling smile absolutely he said thats nice we are on the same team after all no were not the policeman murmured youd nick me in a minute if i was out there with a extra bottle of duty free he pointed through the glass at the arab who was almost weighed down to the ground by the polythene bag which he was carrying just like that bloke there what exclaimed the customs officer excuse me for a moment please he hurried from the room left alone mcguire and neville looked on in silence as one by one the passengers who had completed landing cards were checked through three were asians one had an arm missing none bore the remotest resemblance to any of the hawkins photofit treatments you know karen said the inspector as they made their way out of the edinburgh airport terminal building and headed for the car park i am beginning to get just a wee bit bored by this surveillance just ever so slightly i know how you feel huh he chuckled at least youve got something out of it even if he is bent the missing heroin brian asked skinner enough to do the job was it at least twice sir or so the hospital pharmacist told us and theres a definite link between gopal and gaynor and nolan weston he entertained them to a curry night up at his place the mother showed stevie and me the present they gave him she assumed that the prof had brought the current mrs weston must have been her night off the dcc chuckled so what do you propose to do now he looked at mackie across the desk then switched his gaze to andy martin were going to have to reinterview weston said the head ofcid brian and i were contemplating picking him up and taking him to st leonards for a formal interview under caution if he was an ordinary mr joe criminal wed do that without question but he isnt look gentlemen professor weston isnt going anywhere he doesnt know that hes still under suspicion wouldnt it be better to get some answers out ofdr gopal before you do anything to unsettle him mackie frowned that could take another couple of weeks unless we put out a europewide alert for his car you know what he drives a silver alfa romeo the superintendent answered registration t vsg but i wasnt serious about the alert not at this stage anyway i should hope not we can wait for the boy to get back from his holidays i do not see him and weston as potential fugitives skinner shot a glance at martin how are the press on this one they havent forgotten about it if thats what you mean alan roystons a bit worried that if we dont give them something concrete soon the tabloids will start writing speculative stories joan balls had a couple of reporters at her door christ knows what shes told them wed better quieten them down then said the dcc andy have a word with the fiscals office ask pettigrew to schedule a fatal accident inquiry into mrs westons death for some date in the future and to let the media know thatll get them off roystons back without him having to tell them any porkies what if we dont turn up anything before the fai date asked mackie what if gopal doesnt come back skinner shrugged his shoulders in that case it goes ahead we put the facts before a sheriff and jury and let them decide if they bring in a suicide verdict and you never know they might juries have done dafter things in the past then thats what it is if they call it unlawful killing the investigation stays open but gopal will surface again ill bet this pharmacist person isnt going to tell him about your visit is she no not a chance then he doesnt know that hes got anything to run away from not even if he injected mrs weston skinner shook his head and pushed himself out of his chair as if he hated it which in fact he did if he did that and whether or not the prof is involved he pointed a finger at mackie you must not necessarily assume one from the other there could have been an entirely separate relationship between gaynor and gopal for all you know the likelihood is that hes taken himself off for a while just to ensure that theres no aftermath if thats the case when he hears that an fais been scheduled hell assume that no ones connected him the big man beamed at his colleagues you came to me for counsel and advice gentlemen you might think im the last person who should be telling you this but be patient for what its worth i dont believe that professor weston played any part in his wifes death hes been interviewed twice by senior policemen brian youve seen him both times and from what ive heard his story hasnt wavered you guys are used to dealing with professional liars this mans an amateur yet you havent seen a chink in him as far as gopal is concerned who knows about him if i wasnt still tied to this office i might have a go at finding out myself but since i am let this investigation simmer for a bit lads its a mystery now but it wont be for ever okay boss martin sighed wearily how much longer will you be on this side of the corridor dyou think a few weeks yet probably skinner replied i had some good news from jimmy yesterday though the spanish consultant was a pleased with the results of the tests they did last tuesday hes given him the all clear to drive so he and chrissie will be starting home on monday once hes back home well see what his own doctor and our own me have to say about coming back to work whatll you do when he comes back boss asked mackie with one of his rare smiles brian said the dcc earnestly i think ill spend a week just cruising the streets neil mcllhenney sat in the waiting area of the department of clinical oncology becoming acquainted with a new companion he had never known fear before not until sarah had made the introduction after bringing olive home from her first visit to the western general of course there had been the odd scary moment in his life the occasional anxiety he remembered he must have been seven or eight at the time waiting for his father to come home having upset his mother and suspecting that he might be in for a real leathering then there was the hour he had spent in the corridor of the maternity unit waiting for lauren to be born on another night early in his police career he had found himself in a culdesac in uniform with his back to the wall and four large threatening youths blocking the exits those had just been minor crises mere butterflies in his expansive stomach and each one had had a happy outcome his father had decided that the wait had been punishment enough and had lashed him with his tongue rather than his belt there had been the indescribable miracle of laurens birth the moment of holding his first child for the first time and on that third occasion constable mario mcguire had appeared behind the four young thugs a satanic smile on his face as he contemplated the mess that he and mcllhenney would leave behind them in the alley this was different though this was something which threatened to consume him yet which he knew had to be conquered and contained within him never allowed to show on the outside least of all to olive since the illness had been diagnosed he had experienced a succession of horrors now waiting for his wife to come down from the ward he sat contemplating apprehensively the weekend to come they had been warned about the treatment about the sickness that was the most common sideeffect of the drugs these are very powerful and toxic chemicals olive their supervising nurse had warned as she had talked them through what would happen their job is to seek out and kill the cancer cells but they will have a hell of an effect on your entire system well give you steroids to control it but the chances are that youll be very sick for a couple of days after your first treatment at that moment he was fearful of that imminent crisis more than anything else his mind had simply locked away the longterm possibilities refusing to contemplate them but right there and then he dreaded the very thought of watching his wifes distress mr mcllhenney the calm voice broke into his fearful anticipation how are you getting on he looked up from his chair to see derek simmers standing over him okay he replied trying to smile just waiting for olive as instructed ive just left her said the consultant shell be another twenty minutes or so dont wait here come on through to my office ill tell reception where you are so she can find you when she comes down neil nodded he stood picked up his coffee and followed the tall fairhaired simmers to the desk at the entrance where he paused then round a corner and into a small office opposite the room where their initial consultation had taken place there was no desk only a few chairs and a low coffee table sit down sit down the physician insisted and then unexpectedly he sighed you know he began ive lost count of the number of patients ive treated in this place ive lost count of the number of husbands and wives that ive seen in your shoes but still i cant really imagine how it must feel for either the patient or her partner i can try i do of course but not having experienced it for myself not having sat on your side of the desk at the consultation seeing with your eyes listening with your ears not even having sat out there being ministered to by the wrvs ladies in their canteen i dont suppose i even get close to the reality no mcllhenney answered quietly i dont suppose you do maybe thats a good thing though because it ensures that i remain objective and as long as i do i have something to offer my patients beyond the mechanics of the treatment the gentle blue eyes settled on the policeman and he felt the same wave of inexplicable relief which had swept over him at his first meeting with simmers i will never lie to olive or to you he said earnestly i will always tell it to you like it is to a great extent the success or failure of her treatment will depend on the interpretation which both of you place on my words i am dedicated to the preservation of life neil for as long as that can be i will prescribe and administer the most appropriate treatment for olives physical condition but once ive done that your job begins you have to remain positive and you have to remain mentally strong from what ive seen of you both you will be able to do that the next couple of days will be tough for both of you make no mistake about that but in the course of this treatment which will last for up to six months they will probably be the worst youll experience my best advice to you is to set yourselves targets for example in a couple of weeks maybe even next weekend you might be able to contemplate an evening at the theatre after two months treatment you might want to go on holiday if you do ill make a gap in the schedule for you working towards and achieving objectives like these will be a tremendous psychological help to you both and will improve olives chances of keeping this thing at bay simmers paused and mcllhenney saw pain written in his soft eyes the hardest thing for me he continued is to tell devoted partners like you and olive that one of you has an incurable disease i dont discuss survival rates or make prognoses anyone can pick all that stuff off the internet if they have a mind i can tell you this though from long experience the people who believe from day one without doubt that they will wind up on the positive side of the ratio whatever that might be are the people who do best you do believe that neil dont you the policeman felt his jaw tighten as he returned the consultants gaze absolutely he said thats good hold fast to that belief its the best advice i have for you the physician rose to his feet wed better go back out there olive should be down from the ward any minute mcllenney nodded thank you he said thank you very much mr simmers the man laid a hand on his shoulder listen neil over the coming months you and olive and i are going to have to maintain a close trusting relationship so please drop the mr simmers stuff dont call me derek either ive never cared much for that name call me by the name my friends use call me deacey she found the apartment without difficulty a short taxi trip across the bridges from her own small flat offnicolson street down broughton street through the traffic lights at rodney street and there it was facing her as wayne had described it he was ready to leave when he opened the door tall and handsome in jeans and a red lacoste waterproof his beard looked as if it had been newly trimmed am i late she asked untypically concerned that he might think she was evening the score for giulianos not at all he drawled i saw your taxi arrive thats all say before we leave come on in and say hello to dennis hes ready for bed but hes decent karen was not entirely certain that she wanted to meet waynes friend again remembering his sourness when she had checked him in at the conference centre but she followed him inside the paraplegic was in his wheelchair dressed in pyjamas and a silk dressing gown his hair was damp at the edges and his skin slightly pink as if he had just come from a bath he seemed to be concentrating hard on the scotsman crossword say hello to karen mate the tall australian commanded dennis crombie looked up peered at her through his spectacles and barked a quick hello she grinned back at him and pointed towards the newspaper on his lap fridays usually the hardest she said thats what i find anyway eh the crossword oh yes its tougher than yesterdays the faintest smile seemed to cross the economists face and a gold filling in one of his upper canines caught the light for an instant too many scottish words thats the problem for me dont worry if youre staying on for a few weeks youll learn the language the smile vanished as long as i can stay warm i dont give a stuff about the language i never thought scotland would be so cold hey its not that bad she protested it is when you cant move about she felt a mixture of guilt and sympathy im sorry dennis i didnt think no said crombie people dont they cant imagine what its like to look at the world from this angle he smiled again but it looked forced hey dont mind me im just an embittered old cripple you two get going wheel me though to bed first though mate wayne nodded and took the guide handles of the chair as karen stepped back into the entrance hall she heard dennis call out have a nice night now dont do anything i cant her escort joined her in a couple of minutes breathing a heavy sigh as he closed the door behind him you sound tired she said relieved more like it it was bath night for dennis thats always a performance never mind karen chuckled the best is yet to come where are we going well he answered slowly i thought we might have a couple of pints in the pub on the next corner the northern bar and then go for a chinese in the place a few doors down the loon fung absolutely she agreed you couldnt have chosen better that place does lemon chicken to die for three hours later he had to agree with her that was just magic he murmured as the last forkful disappeared an extra couple of pints and half a bottle of red wine had taken the rough edge from his accent in the course of the evening most of which wayne had spent talking about australia aboriginal rights and life on board an oil rig do you know any more places like this he asked she nodded a few maybe well get round to them all in good time maybe youre all right you know wayne she whispered feeling as relaxed as she had in years she smiled broadly for a poofter that is its a pity she went on that malefemale relationships are usually so hopeless most of them just start and finish with that sticky business all that pushing and shoving and sweating and shouting its nice to be able to enjoy an evening with a man just as two sensible people couldnt agree more what sort of a bloke are you back home she asked i mean are you an action man dyou play rugby are you a wallaby or is it a kiwi he frowned i aint a kiwi thats for sure i hate nicking kiwis she reached forward and tapped the back of his right hand lightly with one of her long fingernails so dont fuck any she said straight faced the chinese waiters looked across at them as they collapsed in laughter heads touching across their table then they looked away they were used to friday night customers fresh from the local bars coffee she asked eventually not here my place ive got some really fine colombian grounds and some decent spanish brandy sounds good karen insisted on taking her turn to pay for the meal you come again the head waiter called as she stepped out into the night which had gone from chilly to frosty christ she said dennis will be freezing his balls off nah that apartments like an oven plus hes got an electric blanket he paused and she could see his smile under the street lights theyve been numb for years anyway they stumbled through the door of the flat almost comic in their efforts to be quiet she followed him into the dining kitchen and watched him as he made the coffee admiring the care with which he measured the grounds into the filter and tamped them down the brandys in the cupboard behind you he told her without turning from his task as he poured water into the coneshaped filter in that moment karen realised that more alcohol was the last thing she wanted yet what she did have in mind was not it seemed on offer i wont thanks wayne ive had well enough i wont either then i dont really need a bad head in the morning he waited until he judged the coffee to be perfect then poured two medium sized mugs lets sit through there he said nodding toward the living room he placed the mugs on a glasstopped table and sat beside her on the comfortable sofa how big is this place she asked quietly youve seen most of it theres this the kitchen diner bathroom toilet and one bedroom why dyou ask i just wondered she said like whether you have a room of your own this sofa is a convertible i sleep on it mmmm she looked at him suddenly catching him offguard catching him in a glance which told her all she needed to know he told her anyway im not really gay you know i only said that to make you feel more comfortable i know she murmured neither am i i only said it because i wanted to keep you at a distance for a while until i could work out if i really fancied you as much as i thought at first and do you oh yes he leaned across kissed her hearing her soft moan as she responded feeling her tongue searching for his his touch was light even his beard felt smooth against her cheek as they embraced his hand slipped under her sweater fingers gently sensually counting off her vertebrae one by one until they reached the clasp other bra it came unfastened with a single flick and as it did he broke off the kiss to draw the loosefitting jumper up and over her head jesus he said softly as she unfastened the buttons of his shirt her breasts never failed to impress at first sight they were huge and firm nipples hard thrusting at him he stood drawing her to her feet with him as she unbuckled his belt reaching behind her once more for the zipper of her skirt greedily lustfully they tore off the remainder of each others clothing karen gasped with surprise in her turn as she saw the size of him gimme she said huskily sinking back down on to the sofa bed throwing her legs wide apart hands on his buttocks nails digging in as she drew him pulsing deep into her moistness she gave a quiet little scream but remembered even then the man next door and muffled it almost at once by biting waynes shoulder she drew up her thighs and wrapped her legs around him driving with her hips her thrusts in time with his feeling his velvet hardness clasping it within her all of it and then the sudden delicious pulsing heat as he climaxed unstoppably oh damn karen he moaned in her ear too soon too soon im sorry im sorry what for she laughed in a throaty growl theres more where that came from surely and we wont be interrupted she chuckled again wickedly the wheelchairs in here remember holding him inside her as she felt him subside she began to move again however much sarah would have liked it to be otherwise saturday breakfast in the skinner household was usually an impatient affair mark was allowed two hours surfing time on the internet and would be on the edge of his seat from the moment his cereal was put in front of him until the last of his bacon tomato and mushroom disappeared james andrew would eat determinedly in his toddler chair knowing that a clean plate meant that he would be turned loose among his toys and bob often bob had gone off to an early teeingoff time on the golf course a slice of toast clamped between his teeth as the door closed behind him this saturday was different though the family sat around the dining table in the conservatory augmented by lauren and spencer their weekend guests there was toast in a rack milk for the cereals and for the coffee in a jug and scrambled eggs and bacon keeping warm in the hostess trolley bob smiled as he looked at the children from one to another isnt this just great he said civilisation comes to the skinner household lauren frowned back at him through her solemn ageless eyes dont you do this every saturday she asked my mum does she makes spence and me use our napkins and everything she makes my dad say grace and then she makes him clear the table when were finished spencer was staring at her as she spoke no she doesnt he protested loudly she gives us our breakfast on trays while we watch live and kicking its only on our birthdays she does that the little girl glowered back at her brother for a few seconds until her head dropped and until the first big tears fell into her lap hey lauren said sarah gently come on through here with me for a bit bob you dish up the cereal they were gone for around five minutes when they returned the child was pale but smiling her eyes red but dry she took her place without a word and began to tuck into her breakfast spencer reached across and gave his sisters arm a quick squeeze hey lauren look out there he spluttered his mouth not quite empty weve been watching an oil rig he pointed out of the conservatory towards the estuary where two tugs were hauling a great threelegged structure out towards the open sea sometimes they bring rigs in here for maintenance said mark in his matteroffact voice he was younger than either of the mcllhenney children but carried himself automatically as their equal as often he did with adults bob and sarahs stepson adopted after the death of both of his parents was a remarkably assured and gifted little boy if they had a concern about him it was that somehow through all his experiences part of his childhood had passed him by okay sarah interrupted briskly what are we going to do this morning internet mark replied at once jazz simply laughed and slammed his spoon down on the tray of his high chair stop splashing young man his mother said mark you can go on the net any time during the weekend ive got a better idea lauren spencer i asked your dad to pack your swim stuff so what say i take the three of you to the commonwealth pool and we all go on the flumes spencers eyes lit up phwoah yes please that would be nice lauren added as long as i dont have to go on the big one mark whispered always he made that proviso sarah knew yet always when it came to it he plucked up his courage and made the vertical slide right she said thats a done deal as soon as breakfast is over you can go and get ready what about jazz spencer asked cant he come james andrew is still a bit young for the flumes his dad will look after him while were swimming hear that kid bob laughed its just you and me maybe well go fishing how about that you can do what you like as long as you meet us afterwards at the bar roma ill book a table there for one thirty the pace of breakfast picked up soon the three older children were excused from the table to go and pack their swimming trunks and towels how was lauren skinner asked as soon as the little girl had gone scared his wife answered shes a very perceptive kid she doesnt really understand whats happening to her mother but she knows its not good i told her that olive had an illness and that she was having treatment that wouldnt hurt her but that would make her sick for a day or two before it made her better i told her that after that she would need lauren to be very grown up to help by doing things around the house that she might be too tired to manage sarah smiled know what she said then bob shook his head she asked if her daddy would be all right what did you say i told her that neil needed her to be brave just as much as olive did she broke off as the children reappeared okay she called out line up lets count heads and lets go bob ill take your car just so we dont have to swap over jazzs safety seat skinner nodded reached into the pocket of his jeans and tossed her the key he walked them to the door waving them off as the bmw pulled out of the drive then returned to the conservatory where his younger son was shifting impatiently in his feeding chair so young man he boomed here we are the toys is it or would you rather do something else a slow wicked smile spread across his face how would you like to come to work with your old man no youre never too young to learn about being a detective there was an empty parking space at the back entrance to the veterans nursing home in calton road next to dr surinder gopals flat skinner lined up sarahs x against the white wall and looked up at the top floor of the old brewery store where brian mackie had said that the missing doctor lived she comes here every morning he said to his son over the noise of the spice girls they were jazzs favourites he was still short of his second birthday but there was something about their music which could keep him happy for hours she does the dusting feeds the budgie and takes in his mail the boys mammys good to him isnt she lets just check whether shes here just now back in a minute he jumped out of the car paid the parking fee grudgingly as always then walked to the entrance door to the old building he found the buzzer marked gopal and pressed leaning on it for several seconds eventually a womans voice answered yess is mary in skinner asked pardon is mary in he looked at the names beside the other buzzers mary blake there no mary here said mrs gopal impatiently aw sorry hen said the policeman must have pressed the wrang bell he was still smiling as he climbed back behind the wheel of the freelander sitting with his back turned to the door he looked into the back seat at his son who was still listening to the spices and mangling a picture book in his strong hands shes in right enough lets just wait and see where she goes next this is what cid work is really about jazzer he murmured long hours spent sat on your bum bum the child repeated or worse stood out in the could freezing your chuckies off but every so often he smiled you get lucky and that makes it all worthwhile he sighed i miss it you know wee man times like this theyre bonding experiences the detective and his neebur or neighbour as we say in edinburgh his partner sharing the hours of boredom then sharing the buzz when they do get a result i have to tell you too that i still get a perverse pleasure out of stealing a march on the lads he laughed softly as jazz began to sing nonsense sounds along with stop making a passable effort at following the tune i almost told mackie yesterday that he should try this but then i thought no keep it for yourself robert take the chance to get out of that bloody office he was still smiling when he heard the soft knock from behind him on the drivers window he turned annoyed by the interruption to see steve steele looking through the glass a shade anxiously he had to switch on the cars electrics before he could lower the window what the hell are you doing sergeant he asked the same as you i think sir just being curious do it in here then get in the young sergeant nodded walked round the back of the car and climbed into the passenger seat being careful not to scrape the door against the wall skinner nodded towards the back seat this is my oppo he said my younger son jazz he looked over his shoulder wee man this is stevie theres worse detectives than him on the force believe you me he paused did you tell mr mackie you were going to do this he asked steele shook his head no sir i suppose i should have aye said skinner heavily guilt setting in so should i he glanced at the entrance door as he spoke and saw it open thats her sir steele burst out as the woman emerged wearing indian costume as before she had a small handbag slung over her left shoulder and carried a handful of mail in her left hand they watched her as she walked up to a blue toyota picnic parked nosein to the building opened the drivers door and climbed in okay the dcc murmured on your way mrs youre probably only going home but lets just make sure do you know where she lives he asked steele as the picnic reversed back from the building and headed off up calton road he started the freelander and followed a safe distance behind as mrs gopal turned into new street she and her husband have a shop up in slateford sir they live not far from there in craiglockhart avenue indeed said skinner slowly watching the car indicate a right turn into market street whys she going that way then probably going shopping in the town sir i know the probabilities stevie its the improbabilities were looking for they followed her along market street across waverley bridge and princes street then left into queen street so much for shopping skinner muttered to himself as the picnic turned right towards howe street the midday traffic was heavy as they neared stockbridge and so skinner was forced to close up on their quarry bets he asked somewhere close steele murmured you dont go through stockbridge to get to anywhere else not on a saturday at any rate half a mile later he was proved correct indicating at the last minute the woman took a left turn off comely bank and drew to a halt in a space no more than a hundred yards into the narrow street beside a grey stone tenement building skinner parked the freelander twenty yards further along pulling across to the opposite side of the road mrs gopal seemed completely unaware of their attention as she stepped out of the toyota stepped up to a ground floor flat opened its bluepainted door with a yale key and stepped inside and just look at whats parked there the dcc exclaimed as the door closed behind the missing surgeons mother a silver alfa was it stevie registration t vsg thats the one sir skinner beamed at his spiceentranced son over his shoulder what did i tell you wee man every so often you get lucky maybe so sir muttered steele following his glance but what are we going to do about it i mean we cant thats true ill tell you what you mind the baby ill go in and lift him the dcc laughed out loud at the sudden consternation which showed on steeles face its okay stevie i think ive got that covered he took his mobile phone from his pocket and began to punch in a number less that ten minutes later the acting chief constable and the detective sergeant stood together at the blue door skinner rang the bell leaning on it for a few extra seconds as he had at the calton road building eventually the door creaked open a tall young man stood in the murky hall of the flat peering out at them he was brownskinned and wellbuilt his muscles emphasised by his white teeshirt dr gopal asked skinner the man nodded were police officers i think youd better talk to us dont you i dont believe it sarah gasped i know i said you could do what you liked but you took a toddler on a surveillance operation sure bob grunted ive done it before with this one here he nodded towards alex who stood beside the table carrying her half brother on her hip jazz was hungry he was beginning to wriggle restively its true his daughter confirmed i was a bit older than james andrew maybe but sometimes pops would take me out with him if he was working on a stakeout at weekends of course he only ever did it if he was certain that there wouldnt be any action but today there was action said her stepmother no no said bob mollifying her not action stevie and i just decided wed better talk to the guy just in case he moved on as luck would have it we were just round the corner from alexs temporary digs so i raised her on the mobile and got her to come round and babysit in a car in the middle of stockbridge sarah shook her head and took the baby from alex youre a bigger kid than he is in some ways the three older children sat on a row on the far side of the bar roma table gazed at her reassured by her gentle reproving laughter bob signalled to the waiters to set an extra place at their table when it was ready he sat between his wife and his daughter jazz sat in a high chair next to his mother so she asked quietly as alex began to quiz the three youngsters about their morning at the pool are you going to tell me about my sons first day on the job what the hell was it anyway there could have been a connection with gaynor weston he answered some diamorphine vanished from one of the hospitals just before her death stevie and i did a bit of extracurricular work trying to trace the doctor who was suspected of taking it i didnt really think we would find him but we did we trailed his mother from his flat to another place in comely bank we had to go in sarah you must appreciate that she grinned i suppose i do at least you didnt have jazz watching the back door bob whistled hey i never thought of that she punched him on the shoulder playfully and was there a connection with gaynor she asked he glanced at the children to make sure that they were engrossed in their conversation with alex no we found something we didnt expect at all suddenly his expression changed the cleft above his nose deepened with his frown what dr gopals younger sister he said his voice almost at a whisper the kid went off the rails a while back started mixing with altogether the wrong crowd and got herself hooked on smack when he found out her father whos a real oldtimer a disciplinarian chucked her out into the street literally he forbade the mother and surinder to have anything to do with her mrs gopal poor woman almost went crazy eventually surinder decided that for her sake he would help even if his father never spoke to him again he would try to rescue the girl so he rented the flat in comely bank short term then he went round all her haunts until he found out where she was living it was a squat a real dive of a place down in muirhouse one morning about ten days ago he turned up there out of the blue battered her boyfriend a real smackhead by the way and took her out of there the bugger had got her hooked he even had her on the game to fund his habit as well as hers gopals had her under lock and key ever since weaning her off her habit thats why he needed the diamorphine was she that bad asked sarah apparently so surinder was afraid that if he cut her off cold the shock might kill her so hes been giving her decreasing doses lengthening the intervals between each one hows she doing skinner grimaced she wasnt too well when stevie and i saw her but her brother said that she was actually a hell of a lot better than she had been hes almost ready to take her off altogether he broke off as the waiter arrived with the menus ordering soft drinks for the children a glass of white wine for alex and mineral water for sarah and for himself so what are you going to do about it she whispered nothing at all the girl was well enough to confirm her brothers story and to say that she agreed with what he was doing but what about the stolen diamorphine ah bob countered but was it stolen surinders a doctor he could say that he prescribed it in an emergency situation okay he broke all the hospital regulations but thats between him and his managers and they havent reported anything to us couldnt he have taken the kid to a rehab unit he considered that but he was afraid shed have been dead by the time they got round to treating her no sarah in the absence of a formal complaint from the hospital im satisfied that the police have got no locus in this situation other than to find that boyfriend and put him out of business steviell start the ball rollingon that on monday she looked at him doubtfully i dont know she began he stopped her well i do ive seen the situation and as far as im concerned that man is a hero ill make no trouble for him she shrugged its your call i suppose so where does that leave you as far as the weston investigation is concerned up the creek sans paddle he said ruefully its a mystery and that could well be how it stays sarah sighed maybe like with your young doctor no action could be the best outcome bob nodded could be ill think about that over the weekend he reached across the table and tapped mark on the shoulder so young man he asked did you go down that big slide after all this is nice andy alex looked at her fiance across the dinner table as the waiter topped up their wine glasses it makes me feel a bit special again i like it the candlelight shone on his green contact lenses as he met her gaze you make me feel special all the time he said softly once the girl was out of earshot but if this is what it takes to make it work for you ill go along with it he smiled ruefully you know brian mackie of all people gave it to me straight between the eyes this week he told me i was a selfish bastard where you were concerned however i try to twist it around i have to accept it hes right im sorry if ive been suffocating you honey ill give you room to breathe from now on promise she shook her head lets not go over all that again she whispered across the table lets just enjoy ourselves now it was a nice idea of yours coming back to the place where we told dad and sarah we were engaged it was an even better idea that we should come on our own this time you coming back to my place later he asked her abruptly of course good he grinned thats the awkward bit out of the way now what sort of a week have you had workwise interesting as ever mr laidlaw had a big instruction from an insurance company this week theyre fighting with a travel agent over who should compensate a man who was taken ill on holiday hows that the chap had a previous medical history the insurers say they werent told about it and that such a material nondisclosure invalidates the policy and does it we say it does and in the absence of proof from the travel agent that he did make the full circumstances known to our client thats what the court will say as well the other partys case is that they made disclosure orally to an employee of the insurer no ones arguing about whether such a conversation took place it did the dispute is over what was said meantime what happens to the guy alex shrugged he waits im afraid thats a bit rough maybe but its not our fault of course it is andy insisted its your client whos refusing to pay the guy bloody insurance companies they take the money then look for ways to weasel out of meeting their obligation and firms like yours help them what should they do then she shot back at him pay the client then sue the travel agent over the alleged nondisclosure itd make no difference to you and laidlaw youd still get your fees i tell you this if the victim in this case wants to make a fraud complaint against your client ill investigate it keep your voice down she hissed ieyou this andy its the last time ill discuss my work with you christ i thought you just resented my job i was wrong youve got a down on my whole bloody profession change the subject change the subject he said im sorry lets not ruin the evening they finished their meal in virtual silence alexs outrage still simmering quietly okay andy ventured gently as their coffee cooled in front of them lets start again forget work tell me about your day the start of a smile came back to her face well she began this is the second restaurant ive been in today i had a salad up at the west end with pops and sarah my brothers and the mcllhenney children after pops recruited me as a babyminder while he went off to sort someone out she explained the events of skinners extracurricular morning and her own fleeting involvement in it andy was frowning at her by the time she finished thats incredible he said the frown deepening into a glare what taking jazz with him old established practice as far as hes concerned i remember when i was six we sat outside a bookies for three hours one weekend just checking on who was going in there pops let me take the photographs martin shook his head not that whats incredible is the fact that he just swanned into brians investigation if anyone did that to him hed paper the walls with them alex stood up abruptly and threw her napkin on the table right thats it she snapped no longer caring who heard her this is obviously knock the skinners night well not any more it aint you can pay the bill ill get a taxi back to my place give me a week or two to myself andy i dont think i can handle this special treatment too often he was still staring as the double doors swung shut behind her with a bang which echoed round the restaurant i didnt expect to see you here at st leonardos boss said brian mackie as skinner closed the door behind him he glanced at the clock on the wall not first thing on a monday morning at any rate the big dcc grinned a touch sheepishly maybe not but i didnt think it would be right for me to summon you to fettes just so i could give you an apology eh mackie looked puzzled from me for my excess of zeal on saturday morning ah said the superintendent understanding him at once yes ive heard about that stevie called me on saturday evening and told me the whole story funnily enough he apologised as well for acting off his own bat it was excusable in his case said skinner hes young hes enthusiastic and though he wouldnt admit it hes ambitious theres no excuse for me though christ andy martin made that clear enough he called me yesterday after my daughter told him about it and took it upon himself rightly i must say to tear a strip off me so i confess i involved myself in your investigation without a by yourleave and thats no way for a commander to behave whatever his motivation to tell you the truth sir mackie began tentatively i thought you might have come to give me a rollicking for not showing more initiative myself and why should i do that the dcc asked as i keep on drumming into people ours is a team operation anyone can feed ideas into the pot the commander considers them all and decides on the lines of inquiry but no one expects him to do all the original thinking what isnt acceptable is an officer acting on his own without the commanders knowledge it would have been no bother for steele or me to have picked up the phone on saturday and told you what we were doing i was unprofessional and undisciplined and for that im sorry and then he smiled mind you he chuckled we picked a winner the divisional commander nodded you sure did appropriate or not it was good work and i wish i had thought of it myself i think maggie would have if she wasnt out of action how is she by the way asked skinner shes coming on while you and steele were chasing that woman all over edinburgh i was visiting her shes giving mario a hard time poor bugger doesnt have a moment to sit down but she is taking note of the surgeons warning about keeping her arm immobilised until its had a chance to heal properly thats good talking about hard times i had one myself on saturday after we were finished with dr gopal untypically mackie laughed did you really take the baby on surveillance boss sure i did he loved it too a real bonding experience it was just like gopal and his sister i hope the superintendents normal expression was restored at once he swung round in his chair frowning up at the dcc do you think hell succeed he asked in the short term im sure he will hes had the courage to take her this far so id expect him to make it the rest of the way beyond that though itll be up to the girl what about the father will he take her back not a chance according to surinder he said that his mother will be out on the street too if the old man ever learns what shes done no the girl her names ayesha will live with him once shes better but given the hours he works well lets just say it could be touch and go for a while yet mackie nodded i guess so well help her in the only way we can steeles gone to find the boyfriend ive told him to throw the fear of christ almighty into him plus a few other deities as well if we can keep him away from her for good then her chances will be better i hope he gets the message said skinner quietly because if there was a next time im pretty sure surinder would kill him and he sure isnt worth that no the two detectives sat in silence for a while so exclaimed the dcc at last back to basics the weston investigation yes boss not one of my great successes not a failure either brian by any measurement youve taken it as far as anyone could but come up empty apart from a dna trace and a possible print from an envelope with no one to match either no one for now maybe for ever who knows time will tell and thats how i want it left ive spoken to andy about this maybe at first his line on this was a bit harder than ours but now he agrees the superintendent looked up close it boss skinner shook his head no not formally leave it open but just let it lie until the fatal accident inquiry for now its used up all the resources we can justify once the jury records its verdict well see where we go from there theyll say unlawful killing wont they maybe it depends on the evidence that the fiscal chooses to lay before them he may just present them with cause of death without going into missing syringes and complications like that the family arent pressing for full disclosure said mackie thats for bloody sure in that case im more convinced than ever that weve fulfilled our public duty there may be another lead out there brian one that will lead us straight to the person who injected mrs weston but theres no more we can do if we find it well have tripped over it rather than unearthed it through orthodox police work so call this one a job well done regardless of the outcome and concentrate on the rest of your workload he turned towards the door now i must get on with mine see you hey boss skinner stopped and looked round as the superintendent called after him did you enjoy yourself back on the street on saturday morning he grinned did i ever neil mcllhenney was in the chief constables outer office casually conversing with gerry crossley as skinner stepped in from the command corridor having called in on acc elder morning gaffer said the sergeant the dcc nodded an acknowledgment the big chaps jacket s hanging on him a bit he thought go on in neil he said following his assistant through the door how goes it he asked as he sat behind the big desk quiet weekend sir mcllhenney answered leaning across and laying a folder before skinner what there is of it is in there ah i didnt mean that first things first man hows olive sarah said that she was in bed when she brought kids home the big sergeant leaned back in his chair wearily yes thats right she was asleep in fact shes a lot better this morning in fact she insisted on getting up to give lauren and spencer their breakfast but the weekend was pretty rough ach she was sick from the moment we got back on friday evening right through till sunday afternoon we had a bit of help on saturday though a woman from a medical charity came in to see us a nice lady her outfit works with the hospital in supporting outpatients not just cancer all sorts by the time she arrived i was fair glad to see her i tell you boss i cant thank you enough for looking after lauren and spencer i would not have liked them to see that skinner winced in spite of himself well have them next weekend too if you want mcllhenney shook his head thanks i appreciate that too but our nurse said that she should be all right after the second treatment its only a topup and the drug they use is easier on the patient on top of that the visitor we had penelope dark she said her name was reports back to the hospital and that helps them judge the amount of antisickness medication they need to give he sighed heavily can i ask you sir how was lauren over the weekend our spence is on the young side to understand it all but my wee lass was about twenty when she was born i worry something hellish about the effect this could have on her and you know what neil shes worried in just the same way about you the sergeant closed his eyes and for just a second his chin looked as if it might wobble but then his whole jaw tightened in a resolute line she had a wee moment over breakfast on saturday skinner went on quickly but she and sarah went away and had a woman to woman talk and she was fine after that shes a great kid they both are aye said their father they are that he pulled himself up in his chair anyway boss he said briskly to business if you look in that folder youll see its a succession of nil returns from all over the country i spoke to mario over the weekend he laughed unexpectedly the pair of us bloody nurses eh can you imagine that he told me that neville did have to check one bloke out last week but that he was okay the big sergeant chuckled again so much so that she went out with him bloody hell skinner gasped shes what its okay boss calm down calm down mario said that he read her the riot act or his version of it about secrecy about keeping her mouth shut on the job so to speak she was quite offended about that apparently he did also double check the guy himself just to be sure hes absolutely squeaky no doubt nonetheless skinner growled she shouldnt let her work cross over into her private life maybe not sir but havent we all done it to an extent and the guy was only really a suspect because she saw him limp a smile flicked at the corners of the dccs mouth as long as thats the only way she saw him he muttered for sure i reckon his executive assistant retorted according to mario he turned out to be gay jesus laughed skinner it sounds as if no ones getting a return out of this business at all first the mad mr impey has mcguire nearly shooting an interpol agent then fettess answer to mata hari pulls a poof fucking typical of this hawkins investigation i tell you neil this guy better turn up somewhere soon before this whole operation descends into farce i think it has already boss mario said he was at the airport on thursday checking some tips on the amsterdam flight all he got was a wee drunk arab trying to smuggle six litres of bells into the country imagine smuggling whisky into scotland and a couple of hari krishnas hes completely pissed off and if the boy mcguire is you can bet that all the other sb guys around the country are as well dont i know it the dcc exclaimed i tell you if it was just down to me and if the stakes werent so high id bin this bloody operation as well the day was almost gone when the surprise visitor arrived very few people other than his personal staff could walk into bob skinners office unannounced sir james proud jim elder andy martin sarah alex and one other the digital clock on the wall opposite the window showed forty minutes after five when chief constable sir john govan security adviser to the secretary of state for scotland peered round the door got a minute bob skinner smiled and stood up as many as you like jock he answered walking round the desk to greet the newcomer would you like a coffee or something else he pointed to his drinks cabinet well since ive got a driver outside if youve got a macallan skinner nodded opened the cupboard and poured some of the smooth malt into a heavy glass since he had no chauffeur he poured himself a ginger ale then sat facing his guest on one of the rooms low soft chairs the veteran strathclyde chief sipped his whisky and nodded approval so he said hows your poisoned chalice then pure fucking hemlock jock hows yours and im not talking about that glass as if i thought so the older man smiled yes i can understand why you turned anderson down when he asked you to stay on in the security job i have long experience of ignoring politicians at a local level reporting to one nationally is something new to me and i cant say i like it i only learned one thing in that job jock and that was never to trust any of the bastards it doesnt matter what colour of rosette they wear theyre all the bloody same still maybe itll be easier when you retire from glasgow and do the job fulltime how long have you left six months dyou fancy succeeding me is that why you came here to ask me that partly then the answers no im awaiting jimmys return with mounting excitement hows he coming along very well im glad to say thats good govan produced a pipe and put it in his mouth but made no attempt to reach for his matches sorry you dont fancy my chair though you being a lanarkshire man and all i hoped i could talk you into it the secretary of state asked me to try as well skinner felt anger rising within him that bastards taken too great an interest in my career in the past he can piss off now be sure you tell him that jock those exact words mind my pleasure bob my pleasure but if you change your mind in the next couple of months give me a call mr committee chair has told me privately that the labour group will support my nominee without question thanks jock but i wont go for haggerty thats my advice ach i cant do that willies too much of a rough diamond not politically aware you know what i mean aye and thats exactly why you should appoint him sir john govan sighed in an ideal world my young friend in an ideal world now about this hemlock of yours ive got some good news for you skinner looked up intrigued at once i was in london this morning the veteran chief constable continued and i was asked to call in on our associates at ml where i was received by the director general no less he told me that he had just come from a joint briefing with ml given by an envoy of sorts from the central intelligence agency that sounds lethal the dcc interposed youre right in this case the subject under discussion was our friend michael hawkins at the beginning of last week there was a fatal air accident in poland a light plane came down in a field the pilot the only person on board was a kenyan passport holder a white man named matthew reid the trouble was that when the poles tried to trace the next of kin they discovered that according to the kenyan passport office there was no such person it took them a few days to think of a connection with hawkins but eventually the possibility dawned on them the body was badly burned so they had to send for dental records when they arrived guess what i dont believe it skinner gasped neither did the cia at first when the south africans told them neither did our sis people they each sent their own people to confirm the identification before they were convinced hawkins had a ruby set in one of his lower teeth and several gold fillings at the back they all matched theres no doubt it seems everybodys satisfied that hawkins is dead in poland of all places what the hell could he have been doing there govan smiled grimly without humour there was a briefcase in the plane and its contents survived the blaze there was nothing in it but the phoney passport plus a series of maps and scribbles notes written over a period on the movements of a celebrated individual hawkins had been stalking lech walesa god alone knows where the contract came from but he seems to have been the target the big dcc let out a whistle so for the past week guys like us have been crawling all over europe looking for a target who all that time has been a cinder in a freezer drawer in warsaw youve got it my son govan paused so now the panics over the details of the global economic summit will be announced next week and we can all relax in your case until it happens and you have to police the bloody thing skinner looked at him steadily and what about you jock he asked are you relaxed do you believe it ive been convinced the older man said more important than that ive had my orders from the top and im passing them on to you as the man in charge of the operation in scotland the game is over you can stand down your team thats the best news ive had in a long time sir said mario mcguire that carryon at the airport last week was just about the last straw for me those dutch guys made no attempt to go through the landing cards at their end if they had done that and filtered out the obvious nousers instead of just collecting the bloody things and handing them straight on theyd have saved a hell of a lot of our time blame the poles first inspector skinner told him they were included in the hawkins alert yet it took them the best part of a week to make the connection to the dead man with the phoney passport the identification was made from dental charts asked andy martin thats right verified by a cia agent from berlin or so jock said after his third whisky and by one of our own spooks so the body was a mess flame grilled chief superintendent flame grilled he caught martins eye i know what youre thinking andy youre a suspicious bastard just like me but the dental pattern was absolutely unmistakable right down to the ruby and the bridge work on the left side of the lower jaw on that basis the director of the cia and the dg of mi have pronounced hawkins dead we humble beatpounders have to accept it so like i said you can stand down mario and you neil can forget about coordination and daily reporting mcllhenney smiled and nodded andy karen neville will be back on your staff as of this morning he looked back towards mcguire by the way whats this i hear about her pulling a suspect he asked sharply i think it was the other way round boss he pulled her mcguire answered more than a little defensively come on mario she didnt exactly batter him with her handbag did she didnt the words no thank you occur to her she did what she thought was best at the time sir she saw this guy he had no obvious reason to be at the conference he fitted the hawkins profile and he had a limp when he asked her to have dinner with him she accepted as a means of making contact rather than anything else the dcc grinned finally okay i accept that mcguire continued the first thing she did after she made the date was to check him out before she even told me about it the guy is legit hes who he says he is beyond doubt i know because i did a backup check myself even had the guys photo faxed across from australia thats fine but once shed checked him outthere was no need to keep the date was there no the inspector conceded other than the obvious she likes him but he turned out to be gay she told him the same thing she did skinner laughed and he believed her ah well mcguire murmured hesitantly im not so sure about that karen seemed very pleased with herself yesterday morning i think those cover stories might have been blown the dcc shook his head lets just draw a veil over the whole thing he said sounds like neville was the only person who got anything out of this operation if thats so good luck to her she raised herself up on her elbows with a broad smile on her face god she said at last you dont know how satisfying that was she felt the heat radiating from her body glancing down she saw silver in the moonlight which shone through the secondfloor window the sheen of sweat on her breasts and clinging to it a few light curly hairs shed from his downy chest ive got a fair idea her young lover laughed you told me often enough while we were doin it as he looked up at her she seemed to see him in a new light his face was gentler than she had appreciated before his eyes softer his hair more lustrous his features more fragile in some ways he looked as feminine as his cousin in whose flat they lay ah but you dont she assured him nor why usually when i have sex however good its been ive always feel just a wee bit flat afterwards and sometimes more than a wee bit not this time though this time i feel she searched for the word triumphant she chuckled at his expression dont flatter yourself though boy its got a lot more to do with me than with you energetic though you surely were for a beginner she patted his chest approvingly look we havent known each other long and i dont want this to get complicated all ill tell you is that for a while ive been in an enveloping relationship with someone my fiance as it happens i love him theres no question of that but he loves me too much lately its become worse and worse until ach ive just felt overwhelmed by the need to be myself again to express myself in all sorts of ways she threw back the duvet and took his balls in her hand luckily i moved in with gina and i found you just in time to help me she grinned lucky for us both maybe rolling his testes gently in her fingers she lowered her head down upon him and took him in her mouth sucking licking swirling her tongue around him until gently yet firmly with his lean youthful strength he raised her up eased her back as she yielded to him and rolled on top of her once more yesss she hissed still holding his sack as he slid into her long and slender delicately made in that part too just like the rest of him were all two people really she moved supply as she spoke taking him deeper theres the one everyone knows and then theres the other one with all those secret lustings and desires that we feel but were afraid to satisfy myra wasnt afraid though she let the other person out she lived her wicked dreams whos myra he whispered in her ear my mother she answered he raised his head and looked at her yes she thought he really is only a boy you said wasnt you used the past tense she was killed when i was very young in a car driving way too fast she did everything too fast did myra and paid for it in the end i didnt have the chance to get to know her like i said i was only a child i barely remember her but when i became a woman i discovered her and how i read her diaries no one ever had not even my father i found out what she was like i learned about her other self and how she let it loose it shocked me at first then i was frightened because i sensed the same thing in me the same wantonness if you like she smiled bent her head down and bit the young man lightly on the nipple but now i understand myra completely and im not scared of myself any more i know why she was as she was it was the power you see she loved having power not over other people but over herself over her own life the sort of power that most men take for granted yet deny to their women she smiled far away for a moment she loved my dad but she never surrendered herself to him not completely there was always that other person that other myra the wild one the free one the one she kept from him she squeezed the youths scrotum quickly teasingly heard him gasp felt him stiffen even more within her just as theres this other alexis she whispered the one that andy almost smothered the one who broke free just in time heredity reveals itself always you cant suppress it i know that now ive taken power over myself and ill use it in the way my mother did i have the same hunger she had sure ill be a giver for andy as she was for my dad but i have to be a taker too for me what do you want he asked her his voice hoarse and cracking in her ear what do i want to take from you her eyes shone fiercely nothing much only your body in all the ways that we can use it what do i want to give you for tonight the time of your young life after that maybe a few more nights then the memory thats all at the same time on the other side of the city kaien neville propped herself up and looked at the bronzed bearded man who lay beside her his eyes were closed but there was a satisfied smile on his face you see she murmured i told you there was more where that came from and more she chuckled and more she laid a hand on his chest are you sure you cant stay the night she asked you have to admit my beds a damn sight more comfortable than that sofa contraption you sleep on youll get no argument about that said wayne opening his eyes but i really gotta get back to dennis i thought you said he took a sleeping pill he does well the australian looked up at her well if you set your alarm and run me home by seventhirty its a deal thatll leave me plenty of time to get to work what have you got on tomorrow he asked is it that marketing seminar you talked about she frowned thought for a few moments then reached a decision no its not she said then reached across and switched on the bedside light so that he could see her eyes wayne ive got a confession to make i told you a lie what he laughed you mean you really are gay after all silly bugger no im not and im not a freelance conference organiser either im a copper detective sergeant im on the staff of the head of cid in police headquarters in fettes avenue he whistled a bizzy eh he leaned forward and nuzzled her breasts with his forehead and what are these girls traffic wardens she pushed him away wayne be serious for a minute im not kidding you mean you really are a copper yes and if you say anything about working undercover so why the story about being a conference organiser she giggled in spite of herself because i really was working undercover we had a big security crisis on the heats off now though the whole business was a false alarm and im back in my normal job so now i can be straight with you appreciated youre not angry are you wayne shook his head and grinned at her course not girl its exciting ive never been with a copper before a couple of girl soldiers yes but never a plainclothes police officer hey maybe i should tell you about my real identity i know your real identity he frowned for a second youre wayne ventnor you work for blaydon oil on an installation off western australia and youre recovering from a broken ankle i can tell you that for sure you checked me out she decided to economise with the truth mario my boss did youre not alone though it was a pretty wide sweep but like i said the panics over now we can have a normal relationship as far as thats possible when your partners liable to run off chasing bank robbers at all hours of the night that wont happen as i said im on the head of cids staff i hardly ever get involved in the active stuff my job involves coordinating between operating divisions im in the office nearly all the time except when youre scrutinising economists that was a oneoff honest great he laughed again wait till i tell smelly dennis that he was a security risk for a while wayne she said her face serious you mustnt mention this to anyone promise me okay sarge the australian replied i promise he reached back and switched off the light then slid his arm around her naked waist and now come here its time for some more of that undercover investigation it was not a tuesday to which bob skinner looked forward with any great enthusiasm whenever he could he would delegate meetings with the police board to assistant chief constable elder but he realised that he could not ignore the forces elected managers completely his smile was a little superficial as he swept into the small outer office he had been late leaving home and had been caught in the inevitable tailback at the jewel and then through town so it was well after nine am when he arrived at fettes morning gerry he said briskly to his secretary mail on the desk yes sir the young man replied and without breaking his stride skinner swept into the chief constables office and his tight smile widened into a beam as he saw comfortable in the old swivel chair the chief constable jimmy he called out in his delight my god you look great sitting there sir james proud chuckled at his friends surprise i dont feel too bad either he exclaimed dont get the wrong idea though im not here to stay not yet at any rate ive got an appointment at ten this morning with the force medical examiner a cardiac consultant from the royal nominated for the purpose of passing me fit for duty gerry arranged it for me a week ago but i told him to keep it as a surprise you look fit enough to me said skinner it should be a formality what he said was true the chief constable looked a different person from the tired ageing overweight man who had gone on holiday a few months earlier indeed he looked like proud jimmy once more he looked twenty pounds lighter and five years younger as he swung round in his chair his deputy on the other hand had put on five pounds and a few lines in his absence skinner had visited his friend on the day after his return from spain he had been pleased then by what he saw and it was obvious that progress to a full recovery was being maintained so come on bob said sir james youve got time before the police board give me a rundown whats been happening during their earlier meeting the dcc had refused point blank to discuss work he smiled and nodded okay i guess youre up to it the truth is that for the last couple of weeks sweet fajust about covers it we had a very awkward investigation last month into the death of a woman out in east lothian cancer victim someone gave her significant help to kill herself the team didnt get a sniff as to who it was though a few false trails thats all ive chucked it at the fiscal hes decided to lead minimal evidence at the fai and just bury it has he indeed mused the chief aye cant say im sorry these things raise all sorts of moral questions not for us bob the laws the law and we are merely its servants i know imperfect servants in this instance im not too unhappy to say speaking of cancer patients on his visit to the chief skinner had told him of olive mcllhenneys illness shes coming on he replied at once we saw her at the weekend in fact neil brought her and the kids out to gullane on sunday shes finished her first course of chemotherapy and come through it well shes a bit greyfaced but sarah says her coughs a lot better i tell you jimmy shes a study in human courage how about neil hows he handling it as youd expect said skinner i can sense a tremendous tension in him but outwardly hes very calm and determined i keep an eye on him dont you worry dyou never think about sending him on compassionate leave doesnt want it and hes right its better for olives morale if she sees him going to work as usual she has a cleaning woman in a couple of mornings a week and her head teacher visits her quite often at lunch times so shes not without company shes doing some school work at home too computer stuff what are her chances though the chief asked quietly skinner looked him in the eye slim proud jimmy sighed ahh well lets just hope eh so what about the rest of it i read about this global economic conference thats going to be a bugger for us eh jeez tell me about it jim elders been working on that for the last month putting together a policing plan we had a security scare too with sb deployed all over the country looking for a guy who might have been out to target one of the guests of honour he paused thats history though the man was reported killed a couple of weeks back our problems arent over entirely though weve been dropped deeper in it just in the last twentyfour hours ive scheduled a meeting with andy and mcguire for three this afternoon after the boards finished and the councillors have been fed thats when ill break the bad news sir james sat up in his chair attentively oh yes he said whats this all about then skinner looked at mario mcguire across the head ofcids conference table you seem pleased with yourself he said is maggie taking her turn with the vacuum again his own spirits were high the police board had been at its most docile noting every report and agreeing every proposal without debate the inspectors smile widened not quite boss shes not up to that yet but shes well on the mend her tempers healed up faster than her arm thank the lord when does she expect to be back at work andy martin asked a shade brusquely the dcc thought all being well the hospital said she can go back on light duties office only no driving in a couple of weeks shell start physio then and with that in another month or so shell be back to normal how the hells she going to get to haddington if she cant drive couldnt she work in st leonards for a while sir asked mcguire yeah i suppose she could the head ofcid conceded ill speak to brian about it hell be glad to have her back anywhere his divisions clearup rate has gone down in her absence as long as you dont expect it to shoot up when she goes back andy said skinner now gentlemen to the reason for this meeting he glanced at mcllhenney who was seated on his right neil knows this story already but i brought him along anyway because i want him involved he gave a thin smile ill bet that ever since michael hawkins was taken off the active list you boys have been laughing up your sleeves about the economic conference what a christmas present eh something this size and no cid or sb involvement he gave a quick wicked smile well tough luck colleagues you might have known it was too good to be true great mcguire muttered as mcllhenney grinned at him whats coming now you can guess im sure the dcc retorted now that the south africans failed his pilots test the people in london have had a rethink on security theyve decided that in the absence of a specific threat they do not want edinburgh to look like a fortress to the worlds television viewers so they have stood down the ministry of defence security team and have thrown the ball back to us what does that mean asked martin frankly andy it means a rucking nightmare under the original plan the soldiers would have done the lot now the intention is that each head of state will be accompanied by his own normal protection people under normal conditions we will be responsible for liaising with them all checking all booked accommodation before they arrive accrediting them and devising and issuing some form of discreetly visible identifying badge so that every officer in that hall knows whos meant to be armed and who isnt but thats crazy sir mcguire protested theyre all going to be carrying thats how it will be the americans always insist that their secret service carry arms they wont come otherwise and if they do the russians must and if they must the germans and so on so the decision is that everyone can bring their toys if they want just as long as theyre declared to us well be responsible now for the whole vetting operation including the journalist accreditation the foreign office will pass us all the names of everyone who applies to cover the conference and well have to run pnc checks on them all before theyre issued with their badges by the fo press office people oh aye and just in case that isnt enough for you theyve added a bit of extra spin as they say he paused with an eye to the elections to the scottish parliament the government has decided that the conference will be opened by an address from the potential first minister in other words dr bruce anderson the secretary of state for scotland mario youll be responsible for looking after him reporting both to me and to sir john govan martin frowned where the hell will we get the manpower from everywhere said skinner i want you to oversee the whole operation you and your team will become an expanded special branch if you want to look at it that way merging with mario and his people neil will work with you too if you find that youre struggling let me know jocks said that hell lend us people from strathclyde if we need them but im proud enough of our force to want to do without that he paused the word proud reminds me the chief had his official medical this afternoon im enormously pleased to tell you that hell be back at work as of next monday morning aw thats great exclaimed mcllhenney spontaneously as martin and mcguire both smiled with pleasure at the news now like maggie hell be on light duties only initially hes been told that its mornings only for the first month and ill make damn sure he sticks to that but still hes looking great and itll be a relief to have him here even on that limited basis it will also allow me to play a proper part in the conference policing ill be there most of the time in overall command skinner pushed his chair back from the table the foreign office is sending us by close of play today a full list of contacts in each country attending the shindig ill have neil circulate it as soon as it arrives until then andy and mario youd better call your troops together for an initial briefing he stood and the others followed mcguire and mcllhenney headed for the door at once but the dcc held back here andy he asked failing to sound casual have you seen our kid lately martin nodded we went to a movie on saturday night then for a meal he chose not to add that they had spent the night at his flat how was she she was okay in fact she was better than that he paused gnawing selfconsciously at his bottom lip a strange gesture for him skinner thought just lately bob its got so that she and i couldnt sit down together without a fight starting we had a big bamey oh more than two weeks ago now in a restaurant and we sort of stayed away from each other for a while just to let it cool off it seems to have worked for when we met on saturday she was great back to her old self bubbly full of chat and looking like two million dollars almost hyper youd have said i guess she was right to move out it seems to have done the trick for us he glanced towards the window smiling to himself at the memory of saturday night and sunday morning skinner looked at him in turn frowning slightly thats good he said thats good im glad to hear it i only asked about her because she hasnt been in touch for a bit she was out when i called her at her temporary digs last night and i dont like phoning the office listen if you hear from her before i do ask her to give me a ring ive got something to tell her he paused sarahs expecting again as martin turned skinner realised that it was the first time he had seen him smile from the heart in all of three months bob thats great when did you find this out just yesterday for certain whens she due months yet next may she reckons a girl this time sarah wants that i know he let out a laugh that was half growl as for me i know how much bother daughters can be dont we just pal bob skinner enjoyed the drive back to gullane in the relatively short period during which he and sarah had made their main home in edinburgh he had missed the winddown time which it afforded him the opportunity to return to his family freed from the tensions of an invariably fraught day at the office a seal cd was playing in the car as he turned off the roundabout at the foot of the milton link and headed past the hypermarket out towards east lothian a light rain was falling but nothing to make the road conditions hazardous or to lessen his pleasure as he reflected upon the success of the police board meeting and most of all anticipated the pending return of the chief constable to the office its the loneliness thats the killer the singer whispered youre right there pal the policeman said aloud thats what gets to me most of all about doing jimmys job while youre hauling yourself up the ladder you hear them talk about the loneliness of command and you think what a load of crap how can you be lonely when theres a whole force at your disposal then you get there and the door shuts and for the first time in your life youve got no sounding board no senior officer to look in on and ask am i doing right here and if you do that with a subordinate youre seen to be unsure of yourself and as soon as that happens you lose their absolute trust and as soon as that happens youre no longer truly in command lit by the orange light of the dashboard he laughed out loud welcome back jimmy welcome he broke off as the car phone rang killing the cd sound he pressed the receive button yes he said anonymously to the handsfree mike above his eyeline popsalexs voice bubbled into the car its me never he retorted dont be so smart she told him andy called he said you needed to speak to me i rang fettes and they said you had just left yes bob replied i tried to get you at ginas last night didnt she tell you i didnt see her i got in late from her cousins place she thought smiling wickedly at the other end of the line and she left early this morning whats the panic no panic far from it something i have to tell you thats all youre going to be a sister again there was a silence in the car pops she exclaimed at last that is great sarah told me you had another baby in mind im really chuffed for you both thanks kid i hoped you would be looking ahead at the road he imagined he could see her face but just for a moment there i thought dont be daft i couldnt be more pleased ill phone sarah now yes you do that shes dead keen to share it with another female he paused howre you doing i havent seen you since yon time im doing fine pops never better youve no regrets then about claiming your life back none it was something i needed to do for andys sake as well as mine i think he realises that now ive done it ive never been happier thats good thats certainly how you sound a lot more settled in yourself he felt himself frown you know alex im pretty sure thats what went wrong with your mother she gave up too much of her youth too soon thats why she went off the rails im glad that youve spotted that danger and done something about it before it was too late you and andy will be the better for it im sure of that im sure we will pops he heard her laugh softly we are already believe me thats good in the dark he sighed you know kid ive never really thought about it before but you sound like her you sound just like myra my god bob youd think there was a war on sir james proud looked around the headquarters gymnasium where normally there was a clear area three rows of desks were arranged each with its own telephone line id rather there was skinner muttered much less complicated its been like this since last wednesday i thought you should see it on your first day back its andys show he decided that it would be best run under one roof and hes right until you get down to doing it you couldnt imagine how complicated this exercise could be were having to make contact with bodyguards of all sorts from the thirtyplus countries that are going to be attending for a start thats run us into a significant sum for translators thats why there are so many desks in here the chief constable frowned not off our budget i hope no no ive got that sorted the foreign office will pick up that tab theyve actually supplied some of the people translations only a minor problem by comparison though were having to gather in personal details for every protection officer nominated by every country as were doing that they all have to be vetted through the intelligence agencies arent their domestic vetting procedures sufficient asked proud jimmy looking trim and neat in his uniform which for the first time in many months fitted him comfortably not for the american secret service i thought the fbi were sticklers until i ran into these boys i had a word with my pal joe doherty in washington about them he says they make their recommendations direct to the chairman of the national security council and he turns them directly into commands whos the chairman of the nsc the president and its his arse thats on the line so he isnt usually open to persuasion when someone outside the service thinks theyre going too far their argument in this case is that since a number of the nations taking part in the conference are openly hostile to the us its not without the bounds of possibility that a fanatic might infiltrate one of the delegations thats why they started this ball rolling by insisting on carrying their own weapons theyve vetoed one bloke from pakistan already they claimed he had links to the taleban how long is all this going to take almost until the opening of the conference at this rate sir andy martin answered welcome back he said shaking hands with sir james thank you andrew said the chief i dont suppose that while all this is happening the local criminals are showing consideration by taking time off things have been quiet actually that probably means that theyre all out casing the various hotels thats another security problem one for mr elder fortunately but youre right sir i do have to keep a foot in both camps in fact ive just been given a note to phone clan pringle about something so if youll excuse me of course of course on you go proud turned back to skinner as the chief superintendent headed off my goodness bob he said looking at this makes me sort of glad im going home at lunchtime where are you clan asked martin having phoned the edinburgh central divisional cid commander on his mobile number up in raymond terrace andy off the western corner superintendent pringle replied i was just about to leave actually i called you when i was on my way out here but its turned out to be a bit of a false alarm it looked a bit colourful when my two detective constables turned up but its just a suicide sorry to have bothered you the head of cid chuckled dont mention it mate you got me out of the madhouse for a few minutes im grateful for that what was it made your people jumpy anyway ach it was just the way it looked the stiff was a single bloke the cleaning wumman came in this morning and found him sitting in his armchair wearing his pyjamas and dressing gown stone dead she screamed and all that and phoned us in hysterics help murder polis youve heard it a million times my boy and girl responded along with a couple of uniforms the thing that made them call me and made me call you when i was told was that the guy had a bag over his head it looked a bit weird ill admit but i saw when i ot here that it was like wearing a belt and braces the bloke had injected himself with something the syringe was lying in his lap the doctors been he added he certified death due to asphyxia then left martin felt the hair on the back of his neck prickle he leaned forward in his chair the bag clan he asked what was it like just a clear poly bag nothing fancy how was it secured round the neck of course wi black tape and the roll that the tape came from was it there aye on the arm of the chair and the scissors there was a pair on the floor andy martins expression was growing more troubled by the second have you called arthur dorward he asked what said pringle the scene of crime team no i havent because i dont see a crime here well you get them out there clan wait there for me and dont let anyone touch a bloody thing are the press on to it not as far as i know thats good i want it kept that way be as discreet about this as you can detective superintendent pringle was surprised when brian mackie stepped through the front door behind the head ofcid it was unusual for divisional commanders to venture on to each others territory dcs martin saw the raised eyebrows i asked brian to come along with me clan theres something about the way you described this situation thats familiar to us both remember the weston investigation a few weeks back out in east lothian pringle nodded i remember you mentioning it at a commanders briefing and i remember reading about it in the papers but thats all really i dont know any of the detail it sounded like no one was very clear what it was mackie shook his head no clan we all knew exactly what it was from the off someone injected the woman then tried to make it look as if she had suffocated herself it was a real amateur job though whoever did it took the black tape and the scissors away with them yes said martin when you described this scene to me i felt like i was back out at oldbams again and i began to wonder could the same person be involved here and could they have learned from the experience one thing you might not know clan mackie added or might not have remembered from that briefing gaynor weston had a terminal illness so it was a mercy killing use any term you like andy martin sounded grim but i know what it was and so do you lets have a look at him pringle nodded and led them along the narrow hall of the victorian terraced villa towards a sitting room at the rear dorward here yet asked the head ofcid not yet andy but as you ordered i havent let anyone near the body since i called out his team has anyone touched the syringe the tape or the scissors i think i saw the doctor pick up the syringe then lay it back down silly bugger make sure hes fingerprinted then well have to eliminate everyone who might have touched it pringle stood to one side to allow his colleagues to step into the small sitting room but for the plastic bag the man in the chair would have looked as if he was enjoying a peaceful dreamless sleep he was sitting back in the big soft armchair his head resting against the high back cushion his eyes were closed martin stepped across to him leaned down and looked into his face at once he noted contrasting with its overall waxy yellowish colour the small red blotches of the burst capillaries around his nose and his mouth which hung open slightly the man was very thin there seemed hardly anything of him in his cotton pyjamas and silk dressing gown he looked closely at the polythene bag black insulating tape had been wound several times round the dead mans neck effecting an airtight seal then cut off at the back towards the left side whats his name the head ofcid asked quietly almost as if he was afraid the sleeper might awake he straightened up and stepped back from the chair careful not to step on the scissors which still lay on the floor anthony murray according to the cleaning lady pringle replied he used to be a bank manager but he took early retirement over a year ago he was a widower lost his wife about five years back has the cleaner worked for him for long aye since before the wife died is she still here naw andy poor woman was in a right state i sent her home in a panda car fair enough clan this is a very similar setup although it isnt as clearcut as the weston case just looking at him you have to say its possible that he did all this himself nevertheless i want you to keep the body here until after dorwards people have photographed it and the surrounding area then i want him sent to the mortuary up at the royal leave the bag in place though leave everything in place send him just as he is dr sarah skinner did the postmortem on gaynor weston i want her to take care of this one as well and i want her to see the victim just as you found him was there a letter pringle nodded and pointed to a small sideboard beside the door a single sheet of paper lay on it martin stepped across and looked at it the suicide note was short and to the point three words better this way the dcs read aloud its signed anthony murray he glanced back towards the chair and the body in it maybe it was better for you mr murray i hope so its left a right mess for us though and no mistake im sorry i had to insist on your coming to see me superintendent said the assistant general manager clan pringle heard the words but picked up no hint of apology in his voice im afraid its our policy never to discuss the business of bank personnel over the telephone even when theyre dead the detectives thick moustache twitched slightly in a faint attempt at a smile even then im afraid now which employee do you wish to discuss my secretary should really have asked you when you made the appointment pringle looked at the neat darksuited humourless little man and tried to imagine asking him for an overdraft he shuddered at the thought and resisted the temptation to tell mr william drysdale in his own special way that detective superintendents did not necessarily need appointments a man named murray anthony murray ah yes mr murray tony yes i remember him he was a manager in our queen street branch until he ran out of steam around the middle of last year it happens more and more these days as banks transform themselves into properly run businesses instead of gentlemens clubs drysdale leaned back in his chair and puffed out his chest there was a time not so long ago either when a chap would join a bank straight from school in the confident expectation that he had a job for life with status in the community and a comfortable pension at the end of it not any more in the current banking environment if you dont perform consistently well and hit your targets youre out people pay the ultimate price these days for poor lending decisions what muttered pringle not quite under his breath you mean you shoot them pardon nothing sir nothing just thinking aloud and mr murray what about him was he drummed out of the cubs what ah yes i see hah very funny yes i wouldnt say that exactly tony had thirtyeight years service so when he asked to retire early the area general manager was pleased to accommodate him and if he hadnt asked then yes he probably would have been told to go why was that drysdale shrugged he just wasnt cutting the mustard any more he knew it too the chief executive had asked a couple of questions about his performance review and thats all it takes to end a career these days is it pringles voice was loaded with irony but the banker gave no sign of noticing instead he hooked his thumb into his waistcoat pocket and looked blandly across the desk there is a time he pronounced in every mans life when he should just go and play golf so mr murray was a golfer was he drysdale blinked and looked bemused ive no idea i was speaking figuratively ahh im sorry thick of me the superintendent glanced out of the window of the opulent office on the skyline he could see the top of the scott monument surrounded by scaffolding as usual when mr murray left he asked did he strike you as being in a good state of mind did he seem depressed to have outlived his usefulness to you he was never a very cheerful sort to be truthful morose sometimes when he spoke to me at least im not bloody surprised thought pringle did he seem worse after his wife died did she i didnt know that its my policy you see not to become involved in the family situation i mean if i did that all the time id be a damned counsellor rather than a businessman but isnt a happy employee an efficient employee drysdale frowned at this radical thinking my job is to make the shareholders happy mr pringle im afraid in this day and age you can spend very little time treating the wounded before to borrow your word you have to shoot them oh aye said the detective heavily the ultimate price eh thats right said drysdale rising to his feet to signal the end of the interview tell me superintendent he asked as he walked his visitor to the door do you bank with us who do you bank with sarah clan pringle asked the bank of scotland but before i was married i was with the royal why dyou ask ive decided to change mine are they okay yes both of them as far as im concerned thanks ill bear that in mind now what have you got to tell me first of all let me ask you something how closely did your me at the scene look at the body he just pronounced life extinct and gave me a probable cause that was all i asked him to do i saw no reason for anything more mmm said sarah no harm done but if he had looked a little closer hed have seen that the deceased was wearing a colostomy bag what does that mean in this case clan it means that he had cancer of the bowel he had most of it removed at some point the survival rate from colonic cancer is better than some forms but not for this man mr murray had secondaries in his liver and bladder plus a developing spinal tumour which must have been approaching the unbearable stage im slightly surprised that a man in this condition was still at home i see murmured pringle would he have been given drugs to control the pain almost certainly the drugs in his system didnt kill him though in this case the injection rendered him unconscious and he suffocated your mes probable cause was absolutely right thats whats going to give you all a headache im afraid eh how come if its as simple as that two reasons first of all i dont think this man would have had the strength to tape the bag so that it was airtight second he didnt inject himself someone else did the syringe went into the right thigh ive traced the angle and theres no way that dying man could have administered that shot himself pringle whistled down the telephone is that right he paused for a moment or two so how does that give us a headache weve got a murder investigation on our hands thats a bugger i know but routine sarah laughed sharply the unexpected sound making the divisional commander hold his phone away from his ear ah she exclaimed but have you i cant say for certain not under oath that mr murray didnt fix that bag on himself and it was the bag that killed him remember not the injection so was it a murder or was it a suicide i dont see how youll ever prove either way until you find the person who gave him that shot and persuade them to tell you what happened bob skinner smiled at his wife as lying sprawled on the sofa he pressed the television remote youre getting too sure of yourself doctor bbc scotlands trademark red balloon drifted across the big wide screen for a few seconds before the portentous signature music of the nine oclock news boomed out into their living room what do you mean i mean my love that postmortem evidence isnt the only sort there is a way of proving whether the late mr murray topped himself with the poly bag or had someone do it for him whats that mr detective the scissors the roll of tape the poor chap wasnt wearing gloves was he sarah shook her head quickly right then if his fingerprints dont show up on those scissors or even better if theyre clean most juries will accept that as proof that he didnt cut off the tape roll wait a minute she argued that doesnt prove that he didnt secure the bag himself though conceivably he could have wound the tape tight round his neck then the person who injected him could have cut it off i cant rule that out bob grinned hugely ignoring the latest political drama from america which was being played out on the television screen thats fine he exclaimed with a touch of delight in his voice in that case well still charge the accomplice with murder he took part in the act of securing the bag an act which killed mr murray as you will state under oath thats enough for me and itll be enough for the crown office will it be enough for a jury to convict on though as long as we have other evidence that places the person in the house at the time then it probably will be of course if hes left us a print on the end of the tape roll as well and there are none of mr murrays thatll be game set and match i doubt if well be that lucky though assuming that this is the same person who was with gaynor weston you are sure sarah interrupted ach of course i am and sos andy and so are you look at the similarities clear poly bag it would be undignified to end your life in something with tesco printed on it would it not secured by black tape victim injected theres no doubt about it as i was saying on that assumption the way i see it is that the helper assumed that the weston death would simply be seen off as a suicide when we started to make ambivalent noises after the body was found he realised just how sloppy hed been thats why youve got a different pattern with mr murrays death this time the tape scissors and syringe have been left there hes getting better but there are still flaws in the setup bob picked up the remote once more and snapped off the television picture then swung himself into a sitting position actually he said you and i can sit here having a detached professional discussion about this thing but ive got to remind myself at the same time just how serious this is how come how come he repeated listen if someone walked into a bank shot a teller and ran off with a pile of money we and every tabloid newspaper in the country would go bananas about it but if the same person walked into another bank a few weeks later and did it again christ love just imagine the reaction yet thats what were dealing with here forget the semantics forget our clever technical debate about the whys and wherefores of murrays death we have a double murderer loose in our city we made a porridge of catching him first time up and now hes done it again sarah frowned yes i hear what youre saying but what about the moral issues involved in that respect the two situations are completely different you say that to andy martin who tends to be our collective conscience in situations like these and hell tell you that there is only one black and white moral issue involved the taking of a human life by another person maybe in personal ethical terms you can argue that there might be shades of grey but in legal terms you cant it doesnt matter whether someone gets on their knees and begs you end my life i cant stand it any more if you do that youre breaking the law and its the oldest law that our society has now the fact is that when we didnt get a quick clearup on the weston case some of us werent too sorry we saw it as a oneoff and maybe our private beliefs let us sympathise with mrs weston and even with whoever helped her but it isnt a oneoff any more sarah im were faced with clear evidence that same person has done it again and our duty is just as clear catching him goes right to the top of our priority list consider this gaynor weston and anthony murray were both terminally ill they were going to die nasty drawnout deaths but what if someone else asks for help someone who does have a chance of survival no he said emphatically it has to be stopped here she looked at him soberly yeah she murmured looked at like that you have to be right he leaned back into the sofa and nodded and theres more to be investigated what do you mean she asked him for the second time that evening his eyes narrowed very slightly what if gaynor weston wasnt the first what if theres been a death in the past that has been written off as a suicide at divisional level or more than one even christ there could be a network operating here youre seeing the worst arent you said sarah he shrugged with a sad resigned grin honey thats my job the trouble has been that from inside the chief constables office sometimes you just dont see it early enough i know the dcc isnt the best delegator in the world said andy martin but normally he waits to be asked these days before offering advice on investigations so when he does call me to raise something especially when its halfnine on a monday evening it emphasises how serious it is i dont have to remind you two that hes back on the prowl mornings at least he looked at detective superintendents mackie and pringle as of now the investigation into the weston death is reopened full strength ive spoken to the fiscal and had the fai postponed indefinitely it will run in conjunction with the murray investigation with you two in joint daytoday control reporting everything to me id take full responsibility myself but for my involvement with the preparations for the economic conference the head of cid hunched over his coffee we dont need a big team on this since there isnt any door to door work involved but we do need integration so that we pick up any overlap between the two investigations brian i want you to review the weston papers yet again and see if theres anything we might have done that we didnt clan murrays death happened on your patch so youre the leader on that one in maggie roses continued absence since ds steele was heavily involved with weston hes going to work with you directly on murray as the principal link between both inquiries pringle nodded fair enough he said i like young stevie if we do come across any coincidences hes not the boy to miss them where are you going to begin then i have already the superintendent replied remember i saw the guy at the bank he was worse than fuckin useless mind you today were looking for relatives mr murray had no children apparently but theres a younger sister shes the next of kin ive got a car taking her to the royal this morning to make the formal identification after that ill go and have a chat with her to see what she can tell me where does she live down in sunny joppa by the sea he glanced at the window of the head of cids office rain driven on cold northeast wind lashed against its panes itll be really nice down there today he added mournfully ill envy you every minute of it said martin grinning as he stood okay gentlemen thats it remember keep me informed all the way he walked with the two divisional commanders to the end of the corridor waving them off at the top of the stairs then instead of returning to his office he walked along the length of the command corridor and down the flight of stairs which led almost directly to the makeshift conference control centre looking around he noted that all but two of the desks were manned as usual mario mcguire was seated in the far corner from where he could see everything that went on in the big room he ambled across towards the special branch commander hi mario hows it going mcguire shot him a mock scowl exciting as ever he grumbled ive rejected a journalist from the financial times thats been the highlight of my day so far no scratch that the highlight of my week why did you bomb him out her the inspector corrected him she wouldnt put her date of birth on the application form refused point blank so we couldnt run a full computer check couldnt you have done it through her national insurance number not this one shes south african her name wasnt hawkins was it martin asked with a faint smile mcguire shook his head naw and she isnt dead either the head of cid shrugged well its up to her but if she doesnt have a ticket she cant come to the party he paused listen mario can i ask you a favour the dark eyebrows rose in surprise of course you can right its like this the weston case the one that maggie was working on when she got cut has gone pearshaped again theres been a second apparent suicide with exactly the same pattern the boss has ordered me to check the papers on every reported suicide in our area over the last three years to see if any of them could possibly have been related trouble is im stuffed for peoplepower and i dont want to call in outside help any more than he does im going to have to take neville or pye back from you unless look i know mags isnt allowed back for a couple of weeks but would you mind if i asked her if she could help on this one it doesnt involve anything more strenuous than reading and maybe the odd phone call so shed be able to do it at home i wouldnt ask her behind your back though so whatd you say i say go ahead sir i dont have a problem with that mcguire grinned now if i said no way and she found out about it later that would be a problem clan pringle peered across steele and out of the drivers sidewindow as the young sergeant drew to a halt outside the big stone terrace the houses faced more or less due east and on a fine day they would have enjoyed a clear view all the way down the coast to north berwick and the bass rock beyond however as the detective looked across the promenade and out to sea all that faced him was the grey wall of drizzle which the howling wind drove onshore my god he said i hope their draught excluders are working the two policemen jumped quickly out of the car and hurried up the steps towards the front door fortunately the woman at the tall bay window had seen them arrive and opened it quickly mrs paterson im detective superintendent pringle and this is sergeant steele aye aye the woman answered quietly come in quick and let me get this door shut steele looked at her as he stepped into the hall georgina paterson was a thin pinched woman of indeterminate middle age she wore a grey cardigan pulled tight around her shoulders in there she pointed to a door off the hall to the left to pringles great relief a coal effect gas fire was blazing away ushering the detectives to a settee the woman sat in the chair closest to it im very sorry about your brother mrs paterson pringle began he meant it he was a kind man by nature were things er all right at the hospital she nodded yes thank you the staff there were very nice to me they made anthony look very peaceful all things considered the superintendent looked up at the high mantelpiece above the hearth various family photographs were set upon it including one of a wedding group bride groom best man and bridesmaid he pointed to it is that yours he asked georgina paterson nodded aye thats our wedding mine and berts thirty years wed have been married but for her voice faltered im sorry said pringle once more has your husband been gone long sixteen and a half years she answered composing herself he was a miner he was killed in an accident underground hit by a runaway truck she looked across at stevie steele saw him glancing round the big room i know what youre thinkin son she said not unkindly a big house this for a miners widow but there was negligence you see my brother got me a good young lawyer mr laidlaw a customer of his at the bank and he took up my case the coal board settled out of court and i got a great deal of money plus a decent pension it was anthony who said i should buy this house he and i used to like joppa when we were bairns and he thought it would be nice for me here also since there are five bedrooms he thought i could do bed and breakfasts in the summer an earn a bit more money and do you asked pringle smiling yes indeed i do very well too especially in the summer although ive got folk that come to me all year round salesmen and the like as usual anthonys advice was right hes aye been very good to me rina she was his wife used to help me down here sometimes mrs paterson shook his head my brother never got over her death ye ken after she went i think that he was just waiting to go himself the superintendent glanced up at another of the photographs above the fireplace it showed a young man in a university graduation gown is that your son the woman beamed with instant pride aye thats francis in his graduation gown hes twentyeight now hes a doctor you know she added proudly pringle felt a tingling sensation in his stomach very good he said do you see much of him not nearly as much as id like he works in london in great ormond street the hospital for sick kids and hes still studyin so he doesnt have much time off hell be up for his uncles funeral though i spoke to him just there at lunchtime is he your only child no no ahve a daughter andrina named after her auntie shes twentyone shes a nurse up at the western ah where her uncle was treated asked pringle casually the woman looked up at him her eyes suddenly sharp how did you know he was there we know that he had been ill mrs paterson in edinburgh all of the cancer patients are treated there oh i see she hesitated wringing her hands in her lap ahm sorry to be so abrupt with you mr pringle the thing is my brother was extremely embarrassed by his illness and by the way it was anthony was a very fastidious man so after the operation it was just mortifying for him to have to wear that bag he never went out of the house afterwards and he never saw anyone other than andrina and me or francis when he was up from london no one at all mrs paterson well there was mrs leggat the cleaning lady she used to do his food shopping for him no that he ate much poor man and the outpatient visitors from the hospital and such and dr lennie his gp but no one else other than us no friends from the bank he didnae have many of those his main friends were in the rotary and he cut himself off from them but the bank no none at all really did they know he was ill when they gave him early retirement the bereaved sister shook her head no he knew but he didnt tell them he told me that if he had they wouldnt have let him retire but put him on sick leave instead so that if he had died theyd have had to pay out less to his estate than to him in his lump sum and pension he was gey disillusioned towards the end of his career mr pringle i can understand that said the policeman he knew he was ill himself though before he went he knew for over a year superintendent he had symptoms all that time but he kept them to himself eventually just after he retired he mentioned it to francis and he made him go to dr lennie by that time she broke off for a few seconds i went with him to the western for his first appointment jist taste hold his hand you know how it is his consultant mr simmers was a very nice man he explained that the tumour was very large but that there was still a chance if it was removed and if he had followup treatment so they operated and they gave him radiation treatment he was all right for a few months but towards the end of the summer he began to lose weight again until he had trouble even walking about the house did andrina nurse her uncle at all mrs paterson asked pringle when he was in hospital i mean no mrs paterson replied she works in the cancer place right enough but in the breast unit in ward one some of her friends looked after him though and they let her know how he was doing she sighed im glad you know that anthony went suddenly like that he was a very dignified man was my brother it would have been awful to see him just wither away totally helpless i know that thought frightened andrina she really loved her uncle you know and he doted on her in the last few weeks shed been visiting him just about every day her boyfriend used to go with her too before he went off to university anthony was very fond of him too hes a nice lad is young raymond sometimes the best detectives find that the key questions ask themselves raymond who mrs paterson looked across at stevie steele as he spoke raymond weston son his fathers a professor up at the western andy when was the last time you took a holiday he looked at her his elbow on the high round table which circled one of the pillars in the standing order bar i seem to remember he replied that you and i were in spain this summer at your dads place i seem to remember that you and i were all over each other then and im sure we will be again next year said alex but youre dodging the question you know bloody well what i mean when was the last time you took a few days to yourself to play golf or to go windsurfing that spare room of yours is full of sports gear gathering dust and here you are looking unfit dogtired and if i may say so just a wee bit podgy he smiled at her sourly gee thanks go on give us a quick chorus of you fat bastard you fat bastard you ate all the pies so the whole pub knows ive put on a couple of pounds for your information girlie ive started working out again in the fettes weights room and im back playing squash with your father twice a week now that the chiefs back in semiharness good but none of that gets you out of the office what are you doing to relax and to help you get away from the stress thats what im asking he shrugged this for a start having a relaxing stressfree pint with my fiancee going for a tandoori afterwards and hoping that shell come back to my place for b and b or who knows maybe even invite me to hers you can forget the latter she said quickly too quickly she feared for just a moment im not having gina ogling you over the corn flakes when i get my own place and i looked at a really nice wee flat this lunchtime down in leith itll be different as for the other possibility if we can keep up our recent run of not falling out across the dinner table you might just be on now back to the point when are you going to take some time off work he capitulated as soon as this summit conference thing is over and once we get a result on a major investigation that brian and clan are working on i promise you i will book a holiday some january sunshine in the canaries or florida maybe for two though she shook her head sorry weve got a major proof scheduled for january anyway im taking some time before then next week in fact youre what you never said well im saying now im going to marbella on saturday with gina im not sure how hot itll be but well get some sun i see the two words seem hang in the air just as well you do said alex firmly batting them away then you wont go moody on me listen i want to marry you andy but as ive tried to explain ive got to get a life first or it could be a disaster once we are married i wont be able to bugger off with a pal for some fun nor will i want to so if i choose to now dont give me a hard time about it instead of that go ahead and book your january holiday maybe ill just do that he murmured taking a mouthful of draught becks for two he added into the glass out of earshot good now lets talk about our respective working days like we used to whats with this conference he looked around the busy bar sorry love he said i cant discuss that here what about your big investigation then that neither that sort of chat was all right at home when we were living together but i cant talk to you about operational secrets in some damn pub your dad would tell you that look youre the one who wanted change girl this has to be part of it fair enough she said lets just go and eat then nah he murmured wearily finishing his beer and stepping off the high stool you just go and catch your plane its no use alex i cant share you not even with you bob skinner swivelled in his own familiar chair and gazed out of his office window he smiled as he looked down the driveway which led to the main entrance of the headquarters building watching the rush of the arriving staff uniformed cid and civilians the third category having grown in numbers during the later years of sir james prouds reign as he watched the scene the chief constables vauxhall omega driven by lady proud rolled slowly up towards the doorway sir james emerged from the passenger side with a brief nod to his wife it would have been out of character for him to kiss her goodbye in front of his office and completely unprecedented for him to do so while in uniform excuse me sir he swung round in his chair at the sound of ruth mcconnells voice even although she had been only a few feet away across the corridor he had missed his longhaired longlegged secretary while he had been filling the chiefs shoes sorry ruthie didnt hear you come in i was admiring the view she smiled back at him your morning meeting she said the men are here and sarahs just arrived as well christ skinner muttered rising to his feet dont keep my wife waiting is she looking okay ruth stared back at him puzzled he had told no one in the office other than andy martin and the chief of sarahs pregnancy morning sickness he explained briefly watching her eyes widen just as he stepped past her come away in everyone he called into the corridor one by one they filed in and took seats around the low coffee table sarah brian mackie clan pringle and stevie steele the young sergeant looking very slightly nervous to be in the vaulted heights of headquarters its nine oclock he said these days sarah and i dont drink coffee this early so you gentlemen can do without as well ive called this meeting and im running it rather than mr martin because hes asked me to give an overview of the investigation and because hes snowed under with the security work for next months conference ive asked sarah to come along since shes done the path work in both cases and since she was at the first murder scene he suppressed a smile skinner could never admit it to his men but his wifes presence on an investigation team always gave him added confidence such was his respect for her abilities ive been reading the file on the weston death it seems to me that there are only two leads left the mysterious mr deacey and the dna trace which arthur dorward turned up and which may or may not have been left by the person who helped mrs weston take her life after the disappointment of the bogus deacey and the serious injury to maggie rose both of those are stalled for the moment he looked at pringle clan give us an update on murray bob skinner never encouraged formality but often there was something about him which simply inspired it very good sir the thickset superintendent nodded and straightened in his seat as if coming to a form of attention weve finished talking to the neighbours none of them saw or heard anyone come and go thats hardly surprising murrays house is in a culdesac and theres nobody directly across the road i have a report from inspector dorward he glanced at mackie relaxing slightly he hasna been as helpful this time brian there were no prints at all on the black tape it was a brand new roll of the sort you can buy in any diy place he even went over the tape that was taken from round mr murrays neck after it was removed and sent to him not a trace it was the same wi the kitchen scissors arthur says that must mean they had been wiped for there were bound to have been old traces on them and the syringe asked skinner clean too sir what about its packaging sarah put the question quietly but the two superintendents looked round as if it had been fired at them pringle frowned what packaging the sterile packaging from the syringe the container for whatever drug was used the superintendent shook his head we never found any sarah no she said nor did i expect it the assistant lets call him that was a bit more devious than at the first death leaving the tape scissors and syringe but he couldnt have left the packaging those items would have had batch numbers on them that would have led you straight to him do you have any other thoughts at this stage skinner asked just this his wife responded this person is a doctor or some sort of paramedic in each case the needle went straight into a vein in the thigh upwards because thats the least awkward way when youre injecting someone a lay person might have been lucky once but not twice not nohow finding a vein for a needle is quite a skill some people are good at it and some aint and it doesnt matter whether youre a doctor or a nurse ive known middleaged gps spend five minutes prodding about with a needle trying to take a blood sample and ive seen junior nurses who could slip a transfusion line into a vein inside five seconds every time whoever administered these injections had that sort of skill gaynor weston was a young wellfleshed woman her veins would not have been easy to bring up anthony murray had been bombarded by drugs so much so that the lab couldnt pinpoint what was used to help his death and his were very fragile yet the injection in each case was done clean as a whistle id have been proud of them she looked at the two superintendents id say that narrows down your search quite a bit more than you think said pringle it points to one person in fact staff nurse andrina paterson whos she asked sarah anthony murrays niece and raymond westons girlfriend wed never have known of that connection had clever young stevie here not asked the right question at the right time skinner nodded yes indeed well done stevie some day son youre going to make a mistake but im not going to spend my life waiting for it so what do we do about this we could pull the girl in and sweat her right away but i think not not at this stage at least just lets keep an eye on her and try to make sure that shes got no other friends or relatives who are terminally ill weve had our lucky break at the start lets keep it on ice and do the rest of the proper police work clan you and steele complete the rest of the interviews talk to the cleaner talk to the out patient visitors talk to the consultant see what they can tell you about mr murray see whether he told them anything about his niece which might corroborate her intention to help him do this meanwhile brian you go back and check up on young raymond weston i know his mother wrote him a letter but that could be a smoke screen find out whether he really did go out on the piss with his pals on the night of his mothers death can i say something sir asked stevie steele diffidently of course the sergeant nodded thank you sir i just thought this might be corroboration of a sort the differences between the two scenes the way the tape scissors and syringe were left behind the second time all over the body i mean thats pretty specific the assistant surely didnt guess that from the little that was in the papers after mrs weston died it says to me that they were pretty close to the investigation that they might have had a whisper of what was going on oh jesus yes brian mackie exclaimed and nolan weston knew didnt he straight from us whats the betting that he told his son and he told his girlfriend at the moment superintendent said skinner id say its a shade of odds on but lets make sure there are no other horses in the field before we place our bets aw he was such a nice man sir he really was mrs leggat moaned pressing a handkerchief to her eyes she looked at least seventy years old steele marvelled that she was still doing such a demanding manual job the late anthony murrays cleaning lady lived in a threeroom flat in clermiston which was as neat and tidy as that of her employer had been before arthur dorwards team had torn it apart in their search for forensic evidence which might identify his visitor so weve been hearing said clan pringle we have to talk to people after every sudden death for the fiscals report youll miss him im sure how long had you worked for him nearly fifteen years sir rina that was mrs murray god rest her took me on taste help her in the hoose when she was still working she had a wee dress shop down in blackball did awfy nice things she gied me a wee frock for ma christmas yince the year before she selt up i thocht she would let me go then but she never did och it was terrible when she took ill she had cancer same as him only hers wis in the liver she dabbed her eyes it was awfy watchin him taste the poor man and sich a shock when i came in and found him i knew he didnae have long taste go like but i never thocht it wid be that quick mind you it shouldnae have come as a surprise jist the day afore he died he smiled at me sitting in his chair and he said im ready for the off now mrs leggat jist like that lookin back it wis as if he wis trying taste tell me somethin the poor man ah thocht nae mair o it at the time no reason why you should have said steele sympathetically maybe no hell be happy now anyway he missed rina that much hes had nothin taste live for since she died did he have many visitors pringle asked the woman shook her little grey head no when ah wis there a nice wumman frae the support services she came yince dinna ken whit her name wis though his niece came in a few times too at lunchtime mostly in her nurses uniform wee andrina no sae wee now mind its jist that ive kent her since she wis seven or eight year old the day afore he went in fact he said that she was comin taste see him that evenin her and her boyfriend he said whit was the laddie called again thats right ray mr murray said it wis he said they were comin taste help him wi something the office of home support was nowhere near the western general hospital to the mild surprise of the two detectives instead it was in the city centre just off princes street in an attic above a pub in frederick street clan pringle was breathing hard by the time he and steele reached the top floor of the building a refreshment will be order after this sergeant he gasped very good sir said steele his breathing normal as he looked at the anonymous door with its greyglass upper panel he knocked lightly and stepped inside the room was small its space curtailed even further by the steep coomb ceiling beside the bay window it was furnished by three grey metal filing cabinets a chipped table four chairs and two desks one was unoccupied but behind the other near the window sat an attractive ashblonde woman hello the younger man began im ds steele from edinburgh cid and this is detective superintendent pringle the worker rose from her seat extending a hand to the breathless pringle penelope dark she said my colleague faye told me that you had phoned and asked if you could come to see us what can i do for you pringle nodded to steele as he shook the womans hand and gratefully took the seat she offered you could begin by telling us a bit about your organisation the sergeant answered penelope dark nodded certainly at that moment stevie steele fell in love with her voice then she smiled and his capture was complete were a registered charity and we work as an extension of the national health service were an additional resource helping patients in a variety of different situations once theyve been discharged from hospital there are three of us faye reynolds me and a chap called john goody the people we see might be geriatrics whove had fractures amputees after surgery those with hip replacements and others our main service has to do with mobility we help our clients get back on their feet sometimes figuratively but usually literally but you visit cancer patients too is that right clan pringle was recovering his breathing was only slightly heavy in certain circumstances yes the woman agreed our definition of mobility is a fairly broad one sometimes the problem can be a psychological one in those circumstances our job is to help the patient regain the confidence to face the world again how about anthony murray was that why you were sent to visit him penelope dark frowned i cant discuss a client superintendent were bound by the normal rules of confidentiality we couldnt work otherwise i think you can talk about mr murray said pringle gently hes dead the womans hand flew to her mouth and a shocked expression swept across her face oh dear she murmured i knew he was terminal but it still comes as a shock he must have deteriorated quickly i saw him on monday of last week and he still seemed to have some vitality in him you cant have had much hope of getting him mobile again i wouldnt have thought his was an attitude problem we were sent to counsel him about his colostomy bag he could move around well enough but that damn thing was like a ball and chain to him it happens with some people men usually we had no success with anthony im afraid latterly i came to realise that he simply didnt want to go out again he was happy to sit in his own house waiting for god as they say she frowned but tell me she said why are you asking these questions frankly ms dark said stevie steele we think that someone may have made the introduction you know what id love to do mario maggie asked wistfully scratch your bum with your right hand her husband suggested she smiled at him thats true but its not what i was thinking no i was thinking that id love to start all over again chuck the police and become a social worker what the hell brought that on he retorted she nodded towards the pile of folders on their small dining table cant you guess its this job that im doing for andy martin when i said id take it on i didnt appreciate what it would be like ive spent the day reading my way through a whole succession of private hells that have passed for peoples lives those fiscals reports over there theyve got stories in them that would tear your heart out with the odd exception like a father who hanged himself after he was caught abusing his daughters every person in there is a victim of one sort or another there are people who were hounded to death by bad neighbours people who were allowed to run up ridiculous amounts of debt by shops and credit card companies people who overreached themselves in business simply trying to fulfil the promises they had made to their families people who were driven to it by loneliness and people who were just plain depressed suicide is a significant cause of death among people of all ages and as far as i can see every one of them is preventable mario frowned i dont know if id have wanted to prevent that father you mentioned from topping himself of course you would if you could have done it by preventing the abuse through better family support all these people needed someone who just wasnt there when it mattered the most it just made me feel that im in the wrong job far more people want to be police officers than social workers and the effect of thats showing over there on our table he reached out a thick hand and rubbed the back of her neck gently kneading the muscles soothing the tension that he felt there listen darlin he said you are a social worker so am i were both of us doing jobs that benefit society okay on some days the benefit might be more apparent than others but youve got to take the long view look at me today i spent it stuck in a converted bloody gym vetting security men and journalists yet because of what my team did the worlds leaders are going to feel a bit safer when theyre in our care next month look at you and that arm your injury wasnt for nothing through it youve rid society of a wicked vicious man whod killed one woman and was living off another in the worst possible way sure there are more boys and girls who want to join the polis and strut up and down in the paramilitary uniform than there are those who want to be social workers and work with the poor and needy but its a bloody sight harder to recruit a really good copper than it is to recruit for a profession which is far more of a vocation and where just about everyone comes through the door with stars in their eyes and bursting to do good he turned her face towards him youd be a good social worker mags theres no doubt about that but youre an outstanding copper and for my money that makes you even more valuable to society blushing slightly she grinned at him youre not so bad yourself i know that im a good officer but im not as good as you better in a roughhouse maybe but youre brighter than me you see things that i dont ill tell you one thing mcguire she said i can see that within that hardman exterior there lies a sensitive soul he laughed you youre as sensitive as a wrecking ball your hard man pal neil now hes sensitive but you what i was going to say was that youre the most sensible man i know you never get flustered youre always controlled and you always do the right thing youve still got a lot to do in this force there are people in the queue ahead of me theres you for a start and theres brian count me out my next billet will be something specialist like drugs plus we are going to have kids sometime in the next five years as for brian hes good but hes peaked youve still got the potential to wear a lot of silver on your uniform have i told you lately that i love you he murmured oddly embarrassed for a moment okay he said thats neil mackie and me assessed sensitive peaked and sensible how about the big man i know how hard he is ive seen him in action how would you describe his inner man the boss hes different hes got an amazing mind for a start hes a brilliant analyst volatile unpredictable but inside i dont know other than sarah i doubt if anyone knows what hes really like deep down ill tell you this though theres something about him that frightens me he looked at her his expression sombre the too he said shifting his position beside her he looked back towards the table what about that lot he asked any possible matches for these other two deaths maggie shook her head not yet but i have to look at every detail of every folder very carefully and there are about three hundred of them ive got a way to go yet im glad i have this chance to talk to both of you before you go across to the ward for your treatment olive said derek simmers its early days yet and i am not one to raise expectations unrealistically nevertheless when i see a positive indicator i cant keep it to myself thats just not in my nature neil mcllhenney felt his wifes grip on his hand tighten suddenly to the point of pain excitement rose within him but he fought to keep it from showing on his face ive had the result of the xray which was taken when you were in last week it shows a small but significant shrinkage in the area of the principal tumour after only a month of chemo thats pretty good going it tells me that the tumour is especially sensitive to the type of treatment which were giving you and encourages me to proceed with the rest of the course the small downside is that your blood is sensitive too that shows in the various counts especially platelets but there are things that we can do to manage that on the basis of that ive scheduled another scan for two weeks time if that shows further progress he smiled i think we can give you a week off to take that holiday we talked about at the start neil felt his hand tremble but realised that it was being transmitted by his wifes grip thanks for telling us that deacey she said her voice steady as always and matteroffact as a teacher ive always liked fridays i wont forget this one in a hurry the neither said her husband sincerely the consultant smiled at her straight into her eyes breaking news like this makes my day too he said on you go now theyre for you waiting across the road he showed them to the door as he held it open he glanced at neil there are two people waiting for me too upstairs in my office colleagues of yours in fact i have no idea what they might want simmers waved his patients goodbye at the entrance to the clinic then turned the corner and sprinted up the stairs his visitors were seated in his tiny room when he arrived there he looked at them one by one with his physicians eye as they introduced themselves superintendent pringle middleaged heavily built florid probably drank too much arguably in the coronary atrisk category detective sergeant steele tall stronglooking around thirty physically at his peak good morning gentlemen he said moving behind his desk as he spoke in what way can i help you pringle in his turn looked at the consultant seeing a big sturdy man yet struck at once by the softness of his eyes which seemed to betray a vulnerability in him wed like to talk to you about a patient of yours now unfortunately deceased mr anthony murray simmers frowned ah yes poor old tony i heard that he had died a blessing really he was being very difficult about going to the hospice but that was the only place for him in a very short time hed have been in great need of the sort of pain control that theyre used to providing did you expect him to die the consultant stared at the policeman wondering if he might be mad of course i did superintendent he had advanced metastasised cancer which was beyond all treatment of course i expected him to die no sir i mean did you expect him to die so soon ah i see to be frank i didnt i visited him at home fairly recently not something i do as a rule but he was a neighbour and he was so sensitive about his bag that he simply would not leave his house and he seemed frail but still with us he was away short of turning his face to the wall as cancer victims can do on occasion however that said someone in his condition can deteriorate very rapidly so while i didnt expect it when i heard he had gone i was not overly surprised ill miss him though a good gentle man i liked him very much stevie steele spoke softly you must miss more than a few people sir i dont envy you your job although i admire you for doing it derek simmers looked at the young detective with a mixture of surprise and gratitude thank you sergeant he murmured but the fact is im rotten at it weve been told the opposite sir ah maybe you have maybe you have speaking clinically i suppose that whoever told you that has a point but they dont know about my failings though i so admire colleagues like nolan weston i admire them their detachment in the face of the most awful personal tragedies christ nolan even operated on his first wife poor gay to find that she had a ferociously malignant tumour i know how fond he was of her and yet he held himself together he kept his detachment i find that almost impossible sometimes and yet thats what my job as you put it sergeant is about inspiring and maintaining hope even on those occasions when there is none you are for your patients and their nearest and dearest a bridge across an abyss sometimes you see them across to recovered health but all too often your treatment is hopeless and they fall in its worst of all when you know from the start what the outcome will be as the policemen looked at him they saw tears mist the gentle blue eyes only this morning i saw a patient a couple in fact for i regard both partners as being in my care i gave them what was for them good news and they thanked me with all their hearts yet i know that my patient will die gentlemen in all probability within a year for the very factor which is positive at the moment will turn negative and very soon these are remarkable people yet all i can do for them is help them make the most of the very limited time they have left together knowing all the while as i knew in tony murrays case what the end will be like i hate situations like these even more that i hate those when my patients collapse into inconsolable fear i tell you the oath we doctors take has a lot to answer for simmers drew a deep breath and pulled himself up in his chair blinking to clear his eyes im sorry for that outburst gentlemen please do me the favour of forgetting that i said any of it all of us have safety valves of a sort although god alone knows where nolan westons must be now is there anymore i can tell you pringle shook his head no sir i dont think so he and steele rose and eased themselves out of the tiny office as they turned to leave steele asked casually out of interest sir did you know that mr murray had a niece in this department simmers nodded vigorously and smiled andrina you mean yes i did know that shes a very talented young nurse they tell me that shes a wizard with a needle a great gift in this place ill tell you im pleased your boss could spare you for this job sergeant garland said brian mackie as the car pulled away from the station in the sleety afternoon rain which soaked the drab street its a pleasure sir i dont know what your force is like but up here in grampian when youre asked to be the head of cids exec you dont turn it down for all that you know that youll be tied to a desk for the duration that doesnt mean you have to enjoy that side of it whenever a request for assistance comes in i always grab it for myself and just tell the dcs im doing it usually its okay with him mackie looked idly out of the window as garland drove he had always had a soft spot for aberdeen despite its winter chills there was something about the orderliness of the grey granite city which appealed to him the aberdonian detective turned off union street into broad street then turned left past marischal college i did my asking around yesterday just as you asked i found this roommate of his the lad beano his real names brian litster the superintendent grunted funny that i was called beano at school too is that right sir said the sergeant politely as luck would have it weve got something on this one an official caution for possession of cannabis just two weeks ago the university doesnt know about it and he wants to keep it that way so im pretty confident that he wont have said anything to the boy weston about your visit ive arranged to meet him in the union at robert gordons rather than at the college back there thats where young weston has most of his classes why not down your nick asked mackie i didnt want to scare him that much sir just make him a wee bit nervous fair enough youve met him i havent as he spoke garland reached robert gordons aberdeens second technologicallybased university he parked in a space marked official visitors only flashing his warrant card at a curious janitor as he and the edinburgh superintendent stepped out as they stepped through the main entrance a tall gangling youth stepped out of the shadows beside the door sergeant garland he began anxiously hello beano ive booked a tutorial room said the student half whispering even though the hallway was empty save for them i thought it would be better rather than being out in public in the reading room fine the sergeant replied this is detective superintendent mackie by the way from edinburgh mackie nodded a solemn acknowledgement but did not offer a handshake the boy led the way up a single flight of stairs into a corridor and along to the third door on the right as they stepped inside garland flipped a brass catch changing the word vacant to engaged second wednesday in october mackie barked even as they were taking their seats around the old wooden table its varnished top scarred with graffiti where were you in the evening i cant remember beano protested of course you can it was the night before your roommate was told his mother was dead concentrate on that the young man gulped then burped the hoppy smell of beer filled the room pardon he mumbled and for the first time the detectives realised that he was a little drunk he screwed up his eyes to emphasise that he was thinking there was a party for first years the drama club staged it so we all went we reckoned that there would be plenty of birds at it he added with a gawky grin did ray weston go i suppose so mackie glared at the young man forcing him to look back it was a skill which he had tried to learn from bob skinner your suppositions arent good enough son now use that sodden brain of yours you share a room with raymond weston did he go to the drama club do or did he not im not here to piss about with you out with it beano gulped again for a moment the detectives thought that he was going to be sick but he steadied himself no he said almost fearfully no ray didnt go so where did he go he told me that he was driving down to edinburgh he has this girlfriend down there he broke off for a quick leer a cracker he says shes a nurse she lives in a flat with some other nurses but shes got a room of her own so theyre all right for you know what i mean mackie nodded i think i remember he said dryly but try harder are we just supposing again or did he actually say that he was driving home for a quickie with the girlfriend as the policemen looked at him beano began to shiver you wont tell anyone about this will you he begged especially not ray why not asked garland more gently than the superintendent are you scared of ray beano the student nodded briefly he didnt look very tough to me said mackie well hes tougher than me the boy exclaimed suddenly almost shouting at the policeman he scares me and he knows people the aberdonian looked at the boy was it ray who gave you that grass beano he asked his gentleness gone i bought it in a pub dont bullshit me now the sergeant snapped or im going straight to your principal then itll be suspension and your parents will know why was it ray brian litster stared at the floor yes he whispered he can get other stuff too what kind of stuff asked mackie quietly pills diazepam tablets he says they are he sells them and does he take them himself he smokes a wee bit of grass he doesnt do anything else though he just sells them cheap too a pint for a pill the boy looked up at garland can i go now it was mackie who nodded yes you can go although i may want to speak to you again in edinburgh thanks for your cooperation i mean that bear this in mind though if you were to decide that it might be safer to tell your roommate about our chat and warn him then youd be guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice im sure my boss would want to interview you himself about that i tell you son if ray weston scares you then no way do you want to meet dcc skinner abruptly beano stood and bolted for the door leaving the two policemen staring at each other across the table bingo said garland do you want weston lifted he asked christ no said the superintendent i want him watched though every step of the way as long as hes in town and i want to know whenever he heads back to edinburgh this boys a very hot property all of a sudden sarah she looked up from changing jazzs pampers the infant his strong legs getting straighter by the day kicked and struggled as she fastened the pad and slid him into his sleep suit yes can i borrow that brain of yours she picked up her son and held him out at arms length sure if youll take charge of this fellow for a bit i know its lads night and you have to go in half an hour but see if you can tire him out first bob accepted the burden and without a word hefted his chortling son on to his shoulder fireman style ill bet youd fancy coming along with me wouldnt you pal for many years he had been one of a small select band who gathered in north berwick every thursday to practise their limited footballing skills in the sports centre games hall he stood jazz on his feet on the nursery floor and rolled a soft rubber ball over to him lets see what you can do the toddler swung his left foot at the ball missed it completely and fell on his padded bottom just like your dad said sarah try the other peg said bob puskas did okay and one of his legs was only for standing on he retrieved the ball and passed it again to his sons right jazz kicked out again and made contact there you are know what kid i think ill buy a set of goal posts for the back garden for you and mark and for you as well you know now why do you need my brain he smiled at his wife as he passed the ball back its to do with the weston and murray investigations youre really getting your teeth into those arent you i wonder if andy knows what a favour he did you by asking you to take them over from him he didnt go that far like i said he asked me to give an overview i quote listen he knows you even better than you do in some ways what he gave you was an open invitation to take over those investigations and just looking at you i can tell youre doing just that now what do you want from me bob rolled the ball into the corner of the nursery sending jazz chasing after it ive been thinking about that heroin he began the stuff that was used to see gaynor weston on her way we ran out of leads from the hospital pharmacies and officially were satisfied that it didnt come from any of them given the priority that has been attached to the investigation up to now we didnt look at the possibility that it might have come from other than a hospital pharmacy i was thinking about asking other forces for assistance asking them to check pharmacies in their areas until we came up with this link between westons daughter and murrays niece then brian mackie called me this afternoon to say that the boy raymonds been selling pills up in furryboots city thats made me wonder is there another way that the diamorphine could have been obtained would you like to think about that while im out tonight and see if you can come up with any theories sure she said bending to sweep jazz up from the floor ive been pondering on that for a while as a matter of fact i can give you a workable theory right now take someone with a steady hand whos good with a hypo then give that person access to phials of diamorphine if you use the finest needle you could puncture the rubber top of the bottle and draw the heroin into a syringe its a clear liquid so you could leave the needle in place attach another syringe and simply replace it with water that done you return the phial to the drugs trolley no ones going to notice the microdot for thats all that would show on the rubber seal the only person wholl be any the wiser will be the poor patient whos injected with water bob frowned as he stroked his sons head gently with his big hand how many phials would it take to kill haifa dozen and youd go out like a light yet there was only one puncture mark on gaynor westons thigh wasnt there so what jazz was dropping off to sleep so sarahs voice was a whisper if you were a doctor or a nurse youd just put a line in and administer them through that one after another what about murray he asked her you said you couldnt pin down the drug that was used on him i couldnt for the purposes of evidence the lab report showed a whole cocktail of substances in his bloodstream there were steroids morphine ibuferon and two sedatives lorazepam and temazepam all of those could have been administered orally and would have been normally prescribed to someone in mr murrays condition was the morphine the same as the other stuff no this was oramorph it comes in ampoules usually you break off the top and the patient swallows it could you extract that from the container without anyone knowing no way anyhow youd need too much of it ill tell you what i did find unusual though the use of two different sedatives from the same family one or the other but not both does that tell you anything specific no but ill take a guess i would say that whoever did this took a look at mr murray made a judgement on his condition then took some morphine tablets and temazepam ground them down with a mortar formed a solution with boiling water then later on injected it you would do that for speed of absorption rather than feed them it in solid form the shot didnt kill him but it rendered him unconscious and allowed him to asphyxiate without distress she shrugged one shoulder since jazz was weighing down the other those are my theories for what theyre worth theyre all youre getting out of me tonight professionally at least now if youve got some time to spare before you go to kick the crap out of your pals go and check marks homework while i put this one to bed alex mitch laidlaw gave you a raise last week you had confirmation this afternoon that youve bought a flat youre getting plenty of jollies from your toyboy even if he is a bit of a dweeb and were off on holiday the day after tomorrow so why the hell is your face tripping you he is not a dweeb she shot back at her friend and temporary landlady he has the body of a young greek god ill have you know well hell have to give it back sooner or later hes my cousin i can say what i like about him anyway hes a minor issue think of all the fun youre going to have in marbella now that youre free and more or less single lighten up girl brighten up she glowered at gina i dont feel very bright okay im still pissed off at andy okay he sat there on that bloody bar stool the other night and came right out with it i cant share you alex even with you she mimicked he hasnt been listening to a bloody word ive said sure hes been listening gina countered hes just having a hard time understanding it thats all so would i in his shoes one minute you and he are a perfect menage a deux the next youre kicking over the traces and asserting your right to fuck anything in long trousers if you so choose i didnt assert any such thinga brief smile flickered across alexs face well maybe i did that wasnt in my mind when i moved out but when your cocky and i use the word advisedly young cousin came on to me a whole lot of things fell into place i felt like someone again i thought that i was succeeding in improving my relationship with andy after a difficult beginning he seemed to be accepting my independence but then on tuesday he started behaving like a possessive old fart all over again then switch on the xpelair my dear said gina and blow him away break off your engagement but i dont want to do that hes my old fart dont grin like that you know what i mean its the possessive bit that gets to me i want to marry him but in my own good time then give him back his ring and tell him to offer it to you again in five years or so i cant do that if i break it off itll be the end of it i have to stay engaged to him if you do are you going to tell him about alexs look cut her off short it would have done her father proud are you kidding but dont you think you owe it to him no i do not its my body gina he has no ownership rights none at all now lets drop the subject im sorry ill cheer up i promise she grinned as of now in fact come on weve got no gentlemen callers tonight either of us lets us girlies go an have a bevvy brian mackie was in his office in the earlyafternoon dictating a sanitised note for the record of his interview with beano litster in aberdeen when the phone rang he picked it up and heard to his private delight maggie roses voice at the other end he had just been thinking of how much he missed his deputy good afternoon brian she said this is a lefthanded phone call just to keep you in touch with my trawl through the suicide files god if id known that i was taking on i can imagine depressing is it you dont imagine thats the trick you switch your imagination off for the duration poor old mario hes come home to serious grief every night since i started doing this job did you know that there were over a hundred suicides in our force area last year alone and ive got three years worth to go through do i get the impression that youre not calling to tell me that youve made a big breakthrough maggie laughed shortly you do indeed superintendent im just calling to let you know that i am now one third of the way through without finding the slightest hint of anything that reminds me of the weston or murray deaths i am also calling simply to blow off steam after all why should my innocent husband catch all the flak why indeed mackie answered hows the arm by the way itching like what im too much of a lady to say ive got a light cast on it at the moment to immobilise it that comes off on monday then the rehab work should start thats good youll be glad to hear that the maggot who did it has been charged with murder in birmingham remanded in custody and sent back up here theres a pleading diet at the sheriff court on tuesday at which i am reliably informed he will admit to serious assault and be sent to the high court for sentence hes pleading is he im surprised at that i didnt think he was the type mackie grunted david pettigrew gave him a straight choice plead to the assault or be tried for attempt to murder he thinks hes got a deal but big bob told me that hes had a word with the lord advocate when the case comes up for sentence the crown will lay it on thick say that this was a hairs breadth away from murder and ask for fifteen years they doubt if hell get that but they reckon that the judge whoever he is will be scared to give him less than twelve in case the crown appeals against it the bench doesnt like being accused of leniency especially in cases like this hell do his stretch down south though wont he asked rose itll take at least a year to bring him to trial for the other offence if they ever do because one of the key witnesses is dead theyve discovered whatever happens hes got at least one winter in peterhead to look forward to youve made my day said the chief inspector im glad i phoned i feel better now thats good laughed mackie see you soon the phone was hardly back in its cradle before it rang again yes the superintendent said curtly hello sir said a voice at the other end its craig garland here from aberdeen im just phoning to let you know that raymond weston just left the city heading south ive been following him ever since at a discreet distance hes just stopped and gone into a pub in stonehaven lets hope he doesnt get nicked for drunk driving do you want me to follow him all the way sir my boss has given me clearance to do so no sergeant you dont need to leave your patch whats he driving a red polo registration mark f tjl thats fine ill make arrangements at this end we know where hes going ill drop a formal note to your boss but meantime thanks craig for all your help mackie hung up then dialled superintendent pringles direct number on his handsfree clan he announced as soon as the call was answered brian here the boy raymonds coming home for the weekend right pringle grunted he needs taste be met then what do you think as i see it we just keep westons house and the girlfriends flat under observation do we know where she lives aye stevie sweettalked her address out of the hospital personnel department lets just watch them both until he shows we dont need cid for that job just a couple of uniforms in unmarked cars with their collars turned up and their hats off wherever and whenever he shows up they can call us then fair enough i think we should wait till they get together before we lift them and wherever they are we should have a legal excuse to search thats no problem said mackie at once i have information from aberdeen that ray westons been using and supplying prohibited and controlled drugs ill go and see the sheriff this afternoon and get a warrant to search the girls flat and professor westons place both of them if necessary ah dont think the prof like that then itll be tough on him wont it mate this is a double murder investigation mind you he added after a moments thought i think ill run it past the dcc just to cover our tails aye pringle agreed just as well if you do mines getting too near retiring age for it to be left exposed hi dennis karen called out as she stepped into the apartment as her relationship with wayne had developed so the hemiplegic had become more friendly towards her evenin missy he greeted her in broad aussie tones as always when his attendant was going out for the latter part of the evening he was in pyjamas and dressing gown hows your research work going she asked him its everything i hoped it would be i will leave scotland a wiser man and ill bet you not too many people can make that claim dont you be so cheeky she chided him weve been exporting knowledge for a long time now come to think of it thats all weve got left to export hi waynes voice came from the bathroom door at the far corner of the living area she looked at him with his newly trimmed beard and his bright shining eyes and felt her stomach roll over with anticipation as he walked towards her she noticed that his limp was almost gone ready for the off he asked she nodded ive booked two seats for the ten oclock screening out at the uci you quite sure you want to see saving private ryani ive heard that the opening is one of the bloodiest things ever filmed we can close our eyes at the bad bits he suggested remember in jaws when theyre looking over this wrecked boat and a head comes rolling out god i almost wet myself when i saw that nothing can be any worse how are we going to know which are the bad bits until weve seen them karen asked roll me through next door mate said dennis crombie from his wheelchair then you can go and find out the cinema complex was thronged as it was every friday evening making karen pleased that she had booked the seats and the beginning of the film was as realistic as every critic had described it for the first twenty minutes and more she felt as if she was half a century back in time and on those normandy beaches in fact neither closed their eyes but watched fascinated hand squeezing hand involuntarily with each explosion each awful onscreen death eventually private ryan saved they emerged from the uci complex impressed and emotionally sodden it makes you feel lucky you didnt live in those times doesnt it said karen yeah the australian replied then smiled your place or yours an hour later they lay in the dark listening to the rain assaulting the bedroom window nice night huh he whispered in here it is she slid even closer to him drawing on his heat wayne she asked suddenly where are we going with this thing where would you like to go with it thats just it im not exactly sure ive never been in a relationship when ive thought further ahead than what i was going to give him for christmas hell i dont even know whether youll be here for christmas but i find that i want you to be on top of that i sort of think that i want you to be here next summer too how long are you staying when does denniss research end and when do you have to take him back to australia she looked up and saw him smile its just about over he said but that doesnt mean were going home yet youve read about the world economic summit read about it i spend every day planning for it vetting joumos and the like alls smooth i trust yes there will be so many security guys in that hall all of them vetted carrying guns and wearing their wee eagle badges it should be the worlds safest place for the duration well im pleased to hear that he said emphatically the reason being that dennis has been asked to join the iranian delegation to the summit as an adviser as usual ill be rolling him in there thats quite an honour for him too damn right it also means that the iranians are paying our expenses from now to the end of the conference not to mention a fat fee thats great but once its over he settled down into the bed afterwards well neither of us have any close ties back in oz so hell it would be a shame to pass up a chance to live through a scottish hogmanay she hugged him tight after that mind he added holding her off for a moment i have to go back to the rig but since all my work is offshore i have decent leave intervals fares paid to wherever i want to go theres no reason why i cant spend my time off here why dont we plan next year on that basis and see how it goes she wrapped herself around him once more why dont we just do that she murmured you know wayne you really are a lovely man brian mackie stared out of his bedroom window into the night it was raining hard in musselburgh too he looked across at sheila still and asleep on her side facing the opposite wall then crept softly out of the room and downstairs to the hall he picked up the telephone dialled clan pringles divisional office number and asked to be put through to the cid office a sleepy voice answered dc regan hello he said its detective superintendent mackie here what the hells happening with the weston and paterson stakeouts nothing sir replied the detective constable awake all of a sudden mr pringle phoned twenty minutes ago and i checked then with both cars the girls in her flat but the boy hasnt shown up yet at either place ive checked with grampian tayside and fife he hasnt been in a traffic accident and he hasnt been lifted for anything he seems to have vanished sir er theres one of these rave events on at ingliston all night tonight maybe hes gone in there thats a possibility i suppose mackie conceded well have officers there get control to raise one of them on the radio and have the car park checked oh aye and have the pandas in the city centre keep an eye out for his motor in the streets near to the nightclubs long shots both but better than sitting all night doing bugger all he hung up the phone and walked into the kitchen wide awake he made himself a coffee and settled down to read in front of the gas fire gradually the warmth got to him the pages of his book became more and more fuzzy until he sprang back to consciousness with the ringing of the phone jumped out of his chair and dived into the hall sheila was there before him at the foot of the stairs picking up the receiver he heard her answer hello clan yes hes here he doesnt look too sure what time it is but hes here hold on brian checked his watch it was eight twentythree he took the phone from his partner and grunted into the mouthpiece the boys turned up said pringle gruffly he showed up in his motor at his dads house ten minutes ago the girl still hasnt stirred ive told the uniforms to stay on station and let us know whenever either of them makes another move the girl could be on duty today clan naw i checked yesterday the breast unit doesnt work at weekends lets wait and see then aye i hear you phoned during the night mmm couldnt sleep the neither its a bastard this job brian is it no tell me about it speak to you later he had just stepped out of the shower when pringle called back sheila wellgroomed even in her dressing gown appeared in the doorway of the en suite bathroom clan says she announced that and i quote the wee bastard is on the move already heading towards the girlfriends flat in saughton he says hes told the watchers to do nothing other than follow them if they move on from there failing that he says hell meet you there at ten oclock he made a face sorry i really feel guilty about working on saturdays thats all right she said you can do the asda run on your way home he smiled domesticity was still a new experience for brian mackie he rather liked it theyre still inside clan pringle growled as mackie slid into the back of the vectra behind stevie steele in the drivers seat watching live and fuckin kickin likely ah dont know chasing kids on a saturday morning the rain had eased but the day was still grey and damp they were sitting in a street made up of blocks of threestorey flats with flat roofs and steel framed windows which and seen better days ray westons car sat outside the second block along potential double murderers said the younger superintendent and the girls a bit more than a kid i wonder where young master raymond disappeared off to last night probably a disco right enough if he didnt take the girlfriend lets go and lift them and find out have you got the warrant mackie nodded took a folded sheet of paper from his jacket and handed it across there you are remember now this warrant relates to specific offences so weve got to treat this as a drugs raid at first maybe technically we should have called in the drugs squad but its okay ive cleared that with the boss too stuff the drugs squad anyway pringle muttered lets just get them fine which floor top sir on the left steele replied do we know how many people are in there the watchers counted three women in last night andrina paterson and her flatmates also one male unknown a boyfriend probably he and one of the women left together just after ninefifteen so that leaves paterson weston and one other girl right said mackie clan its your patch lead on sir pringle nodded with a grim smile and stepped out of the car into the soft drizzle as the other two detectives followed he waved to a car behind two uniformed officers emerged donning their caps the burly superintendent strode briskly along the street his colleagues in his wake and turned into andrina patersons block saving his breath this time he climbed steadily to the top floor finding a door with a paper pinned to it bearing three names paterson gallagher smith he nodded a signal to the others and knocked firmly after only a short wait the door was opened by a woman in her early twenties wearing a long tshirt which reached down to her knees her impatient frown turned to one of alarm as she saw pringles grim expression and the paper which he brandished in her face i have a warrant to search these premises for controlled substances he barked stand aside please the girl had no option but to obey as he barged past her ray weston where is he asked mackie evenly she pointed to a door at the end of the hall pringle stepped up to it thrust it open the naked couple on the bed leapt apart ray weston started at the intruder whitefaced and openmouthed with surprise andrina paterson clutched the cover to her chest and screamed at pringle what the bloody hell is this who the bloody hell are you brian mackie put a hand on his colleagues shoulder and stepped past him ray he began weve met before on a couple of occasions im sorry for the embarrassment miss paterson but we cant give advance warning of this sort of visit mr weston i have information that you have been in possession of and dealing in prohibited and controlled substances the sheriff has given us a warrant to search this flat and your fathers house well do all that if we have to but personally id rather not so tell me if youre holding anything right now and spare everyone the bother the palefaced boy stared at him for a while then pointed to a black leather jacket which was slung over a chair beside the window it was the only garment in the room which was hung up the rest jeans a nurses tunic shoes socks male and female underwear were spread on the floor there he whispered mackie stepped across and picked it up he felt his way into the righthand pocket and produced a tin of tobacco a packet of cigarette papers a lighter and a roughly wrapped package laying each in turn on the windowsill then he reached into the lefthand pocket and produced a small white round plastic bottle he shook it and heard it rattle what are these he asked diazepam ray weston replied for which you do not have a prescription i take it the boy shook his head and in the package marijuana andrina paterson was no longer looking at the detectives she was staring instead at her boyfriend with fury in her eyes you stupid she began later lass later said pringle he took a dressing gown from a hook behind the door and tossed it to her away somewhere else and get yourself dressed we need you to come with us you son you get your kit on right here what about me the woman in the tshirt was standing in the doorway as andrina paterson slipped into the dressing gown and opened a dressing table drawer the policemen turned mackie held up the package and the pill bottle did you supply him with these she drew in an indignant breath id have chucked him out of that window if id known he had those before this mornings over pringle growled with an ominous glance back at the bed the boy might wish you had im glad you could come in to sit in on this karen i need a woman for this interrogation normally it would have been dci rose but thats all right sir i was sitting on my hands today anyway waynes taking dennis for a drive up to perthshire what said mackie on a miserable day like this hed promised whatever the weather was like he said dennis has to get himself worked up for trips like that i just hope his wheelchair doesnt rust where is the paterson girl neville asked in the bathroom we whipped the pair of them out of there pretty sharpish so i said that since we were waiting for you she could go and freshen up as he spoke the door opened and andrina paterson came into the room a uniformed woman constable behind her karen eyed her appraisingly she was a short girl with a trim waist neatly built but with strong wellmuscled arms a trait that she had noticed before in nurses join us please said mackie standing and showing her to a chair across the table from where he and the sergeant were seated i repeat my offer to you you can have a solicitor if you wish ill delay this interview for that purpose staff nurse paterson shook her head no like i said before let me hear what this is about then ill decide i havent got the money to splash out on lawyers if thats how you want it we can stop the interview at any time if you wish he reached across and switched on the black box tape recorder identifying himself and neville formally stating the time place and subject of the interrogation miss paterson i want to ask you a few questions about the death of your boyfriends mother mrs gaynor weston the nurse stared at him in apparent astonishment but what about rays drugs theyve got nothing to do with you as we both know anyway thats a relatively minor matter now gay weston you recall the circumstances of her death yes she killed herself she had cancer and decided to opt out so you approve of that asked mackie quietly andrina frowned i approve of people having the right a lot of nurses do at the end of the day its often the drugs rather than the tumour that take people out anyway when did you learn that mrs weston had cancer ray told me before she died the girl thought for a few seconds no afterwards he definitely told me afterwards did he say anything about the circumstances he told me that his dad had discovered it he told me that she had taken an overdose did he say how by injection mackie frowned didnt it strike you as unusual for someone to kill themselfwith a syringe why should it people kill themselves with syringes often enough in this city druggies and such dont be flip with me andrina this is too serious come on now youre a bright person i can see that havent you worked this out yet she looked at him silently okay he said ill spell it out for you im looking at a situation where i have two apparent suicides ive got rays mother and ive got your uncle tony a big coincidence for sure youve been having a bad run of luck in the relative stakes of late andrina patersons eyes narrowed and her mouth tightened the superintendent continued regardless this is where you really get unlucky though our pathologist has determined that neither gay weston or your uncle were alone when they died they both had help and that help came from the person who injected them both someone who was skilful to professional standards with a hypodermic i hear youre damn good with a needle andrina the girl gulped her hands began to tremble but only very slightly i think id better have a solicitor now dont you i think that would be a good idea said mackie switching off the tape ill bet you wish you were next door raymond barked clan pringle looking round the drab windowless room next door with your nice girlfriend and that nice mr mackie he glared across the table at the boy well youre no he snapped youre in here with me and youre not getting out until you tell me what i want to know that remains to be seen superintendent said the solicitor the man was frowning more than a bit pissed off to be hauled away from the golf club even on a wet day the policeman surmised listen mr lesser he rumbled youve got a right to be here but dont you think that youre running this interview dont you think that for one fucking minute were in charge here sergeant steele and i he glanced to his left now lets cut out all the crap ray son where did you get the grass the tall youth lifted his eyes from the table you dont need to admit anything the solicitor whispered but his client waved him away with a long slim hand from a guy i was at school with i bought it from him are you going to tell us his name no hes a friend pringle shrugged fair enough you posh school lads stick together where did you get the pills raymond weston looked back at him across the table there was something about the lad pringle admitted to himself a sort of wild rangy presence not physically threatening to a grown man perhaps but he could understand how he was able to dominate his roommate beano and to attract a tasty wee girl like that andrina even though she was a few years older than him i took them from my dads study did you sell them not exactly i swapped them for beer the superintendent nodded right you can regard this as an official caution dont do it again understood or youll be banged up in aberdeen rather than studying there youd hate that son inside a week your arsehole would feel as if it had been cored like an apple the solicitor stared at him across the table not knowing whether to be relieved astonished or to be flattered that his mere presence had made the formidable detective crumble well if thats it he began to stand come on raymond ill take you home sit down man pringle growled dont you know when the decks are being cleared im going on to the real business now can you guess what that might be the tall youth leaned back in his chair i could try he said im bright enough to know that you dont send two superintendents out on a saturday over a wee bit of smoke and a couple of junior aspirins id say this has something to do with my mum and andrinas uncle why would you say that because i cant think of anything else as it happens youre right weve got evidence that both of them were helped to kill themselves wrap that any way you like it means murder now wipe that smug look off your face and get serious because theres only two people in the frame for it you andandrina now wait a minute raymond exclaimed im telling you son someone gave your mother the jab that killed her someone did the same for uncle anthony your girls a nurse with access to drugs where else would we look but youre thats crap the boy was rattled at last stevie steele saw convince us ray he said quietly where were you when your mum died we know you werent in aberdeen i was with andrina i spent the night with her in edinburgh so why didnt you tell us that right away because my dad thinks i see too much other i didnt want to start another row and what about the night mr murray died you saw him then didnt you ray weston nodded andie and i went to see him in the evening hed phoned her and asked us to come round so so we had a coffee with him andie fixed him a gin and tonic and we left with him alive when was this we were gone by about half past eight and afterwards i took her home and after that what did you do how do we know that you didnt go back on your own later and help the old man on his way the boy shook his head i cant tell you that youd better son rays lips set into a tight line no way do you want to be charged with murder now just a minute the lawyer began shut up snapped steele do you ray no the youth looked desperate but i cant tell you i was with someone else another girl he nodded you must give us her name you dont understand i cant youve got no choice i have he pointed to the tape recorder its red light on i will not say her name into that thing pringle shoved a notebook and pen across the table write it down then he said darkly or you are locked up name and address raymond weston sat in silence for over a minute fidgeting staring at the table top and at the book eventually at last he pulled it towards him picked up the pen and scribbled two lines on the blank page pringle reached across and picked it up as he read the words his thick black eyebrows came together oh shit he said heavily passing the note to steele oh shit said the sergeant you took your time said pringle as mackie stepped into his office id to stop to get the girl a lawyer aye i thought that might be it what did she have to say for herself in the end she said that when gaynor died she and the boy were spending the night at her flat but the flatmates were on nights so there were no witnesses to that she says that they went to see her uncle early on last sunday evening and that afterwards raymond took her home and went back to aberdeen what about you the burly pringles moustache drooped mournfully the first part of that agrees with his story weve got that dna trace havent we mackie nodded then we should take samples off the kids in that case just to see if either of them matches up if theyre lying about that i dont think the dna will help us much even if it does turn out to be a match for one of them we couldnt actually prove when it was left on the glass and the kids could argue that they had been there on another day anyway andrina seemed like a pretty straight girl to me i didnt think she was lying youll better hope she was chum the boys version of last sunday varies from hers he says that after he left her when the old man died he was with another girl young raymonds got something or so it seems i just hope he turns out to be a lying wee bastard why because this is who he says he was with he handed the notebook to mackie the younger man ran a hand over his domed head as he looked at the page oh shit whos going to break this news toss you for it no clan he said wed better do it together first thing monday morning meanwhile i suggest that we take saliva swabs from these two for the dna comparison then let them go to await developments whats wrong pops asked alex as she stood in the doorway of the deputy chief constables office youve got me worried sick have you got bad news for me has something happened to sarah has she miscarried or is it one of the boys skinner sat at his desk gazing at his daughter unsmiling sarahs fine and so are the kids grab yourself a coffee sit down and calm down calm down she exclaimed im no sooner off the plane from my holiday and through the door than you phone me and tell me to meet you in the office on a saturday afternoon and you wont tell me why she looked tanned but tired as she filled a mug from the filter machine on the side table early start he asked yes wed to be at the airport for eight that meant getting up at half six she moved across to the group of low chairs in the corner of the big room no dont sit there said skinner he pointed to a chair which faced his across the desk she shrugged and did as he said did you have a good holiday he asked alex looked at him there was an edge to the question something behind it she sensed a bomb waiting to explode yes she replied looking him straight in the eye we did now what the hell is this why are you sitting there like a smoking volcano there was something about his daughters anger which made him back off slightly sorry he said i promised myself id keep my cool its just that ive been sitting on this for the best part of a week i thought about dealing with it right away i thought about hauling you back from marbella in fact she glared at him astonished but still on the front foot and why would you have done that what right would you have had in the circumstances id have had every right my reasons for not doing it were personal not professional ah im your daughter so i got to finish my holiday this mystery gets deeper and deeper actually said skinner i wasnt thinking about you at all i was sparing someone elses feelings he leaned forward elbows on the desk and engaged her aggressive stare with one of his own i dont like it when my daughters name is given to me as an alibi witness by someone whos under suspicion in a double murder investigation i find it really bloody embarrassing as did the officers involved especially when the man in charge of the inquiry their direct line commander is her fiance like i said ive been sitting on this for a week waiting for you to get back from marbella so we could have this conversation im actually way out of order here you know by rights its clan pringle and brian mackie who should be interviewing you in a smelly wee room at st leonards or torphichen place but im bending the rules again just for you so please love do one thing for me before we go any further get off your high horse but her anger had vanished already to be replaced by a look of concern okay pops im sorry now tell me what this is about skinner picked up his mug from its coaster held it up to his mouth in both hands and sighed he took a sip then deliberately put it back down last week he said clan and brian were on a joint investigation into the deaths of two people in very similar circumstances we were treating it as murder they identified two suspects one male one female there was a very strong circumstantial case against them their defence in the first case was pretty poor they said they were together at the time miles away from the scene that was all no independent witness to corroborate their story but when it came to the second death the boy produced an alibi he said that around midnight when it happened he was in bed with someone other than his girlfriend with you as it happens the lads names raymond weston lets see it was the sunday before you went to marbella so is that true suddenly alex could feel her heart hammering her pulse racing she gasped then took a deep breath to steady herself then another and a third he was gazing at her across the desk not angrily now for he had his answer the detective the man she had never looked in the eye before was gone her anxious father sat in his place yes she sighed its true okay said bob the boys off the hook there was a dna sample left at the other scene anyway it didnt match either of them it was his turn to sigh what is this alex with this lad he asked wearily i know you and andy were having a bad time but i thought you were still committed to each other we still are i still am its just that he was being so so stifling at the time he was choking me emotionally and part of me was so angry and ray was there an attractive interesting boy who fancied himself and me there were no ties with him it was all under my control and so i said to myself girl youre only young once dont let anyone rob you of that and i had a fling with him its over now the night before i left for marbella i told him that his time was up she paused and frowned i didnt know about the girlfriend though serves you right then kid he went straight to her more or less after he left you last saturday morning hah her quick laugh took him by surprise and strangely lightened him so we were using each other really fair enough ive got no complaints about that she looked at him pops when you were my age didnt you ever feel like that didnt you ever fancy being with someone else didnt you feel oppressed alexis when i was your age or a bit older maybe i was the oppressor for most of the time however since were shaking out the skeletons here just after my twentyfirst i had a short but intense fling with an emerging young actress i wont tell you her name but shes quite a star now it ended as easily as it began no recriminations no regrets on either side except he paused and grinned scratching his chin afterwards the guilt got to me and i confessed all to your mother she and i were engaged at the time she forgave me there were a couple of tears but she forgave me just like that after id promised not to do it again she didnt write about that in her diary though it must have been too big a blow to her ego i guess to be committed to paper aye she was some ticket your mother and now i look at you and i see history struggling to repeat itself dont bring mum into this pops of course i will he exclaimed shes what this is about isnt she you hardly knew her as you found out fairly recently to your cost bob shook his head and laughed softly alexis my lovely daughter i knew your mother from when we were kids until the day she died you knew her for four years and for most of that time you were too wee to wipe your own bum you cant even remember her girl so dont presume to lecture me about her but you didnt know all of her you didnt know what was in the diaries no he admitted but im not stupid and i wasnt blind i knew what a devious and manipulative little bitch she could be i worked out way back that myra always got what myra wanted even me i came under that description but i didnt mind any of it you see because i loved her and i wanted her to have everything she wanted so if i had known about the tart in the diaries and i still try to kid myself sometimes that at least some of those stories might have been fantasies maybe i would have put up with that too or maybe not maybe id have broken her neck literally but no your being there would have stopped me from doing that alex you may be imagining that you are your mother reincarnated you may even have enjoyed the notion during your escapade with this boy but you can take it from me you are not myra im the linking factor between you i know knew you both i love you both oh yes i still love her inside he tapped his chest and i always will i promise you there are fundamental differences between you and her she was bright for sure but youre brilliant she had limited professional horizons yours are boundless but the most important thing of all is this essentially lets face it she was bad you through and through youre good ill show you proof your reaction when i told you about young westons steady girlfriend if youd known about her youd have patted him on the head and sent him home am i right reluctantly she nodded yes he continued at once because thats your morality when we were engaged and on holiday your mother screwed my best pal another womans husband why because she didnt have any morals she didnt have any control inside her to tell her what was right and what was wrong when thats missing from someone theres no telling what they might do ive spent my life dealing with people like that alex the fact that i loved your mother with all my heart doesnt prevent me from recognising now that she was of that sort if she was alive now and we were man and wife then that knowledge wouldnt prevent me from loving her still thats in me though i keep it to myself he stood up came round the desk and sat on its edge taking his daughters hand now as for you you can play the bad girl as hard as you like but you cant change whats at the heart of you goodness thats how it is pretending doesnt make you what youre not he reached under her chin and drew her eyes back to his look kid given my recent track record im not the guy to lecture you on how to run your sex life i wont presume to advise you about you and andy either about what you should do i think i know well enough but youve got to work it out between you there is this though youve put me in the most difficult professional position ive ever encountered locked in my desk is an almost complete report by mackie and pringle on their investigation and you feature in it as ray westons alibi on the night of anthony murrays murder now youve dropped in the last piece of the jigsaw andys my head ofcid hes been preoccupied for the last week but hell expect automatically to see that report and hes entitled hes asked me about it a couple of times already and i fobbed him off by telling him it wasnt finished now that it is there is no way i can keep it from him however much it might hurt him if i even try hell smell a rat so he said on monday alex nodded i know i know but youll let me talk to him first pops wont you sure that would be best do it tonight or tomorrow though yes but when i do theres something else that i know now i have to tell him its something you should know too andy looked at her across the kitchen let me sum up what youve just told me he said he was wearing glasses rather than his tinted contacts but still she could see the hurt in his eyes youve been having it off behind my back with some kid whos just about young enough to be my son now through some sort of murphys law that fact has become an important piece of evidence in a criminal investigation and three detectives under my command know all about it thats what youre saying is it alex nodded watching the ice cubes swirl round in her gin and tonic id say that was a fair summary of it andy im sorry it had to come out this way i really am as i said i may have done it because of you in a way but i never meant to hurt you by it ray didnt mean anything to me maybe not but he sure means something to me most men would feel very serious about someone fucking their fiancee you know youre not saying that he didnt know you were engaged are you no i told him i was jesus the boy must think im a right inadequate prat he must be laughing all over his face ill be the talk of the aberdeen university union bar right now and so will you hes not that sort of guy she protested crap hes eighteen and hes a little toerag listen you go on about not wanting to hurt me did you ever think about how badly i could hurt him andy you wouldnt you could break him in two his laugh was cruel a sound she had never heard before i wouldnt need to lay a finger on him clan pringle told me just before he forgot to mention westons horizontal alibi that he and the thin man caught the kid with a parcel ofcannabis and a bottle of pills that hed nicked from his old man your ray smokes grass and barters stolen drugs for beer with his student pals bet you didnt know that dans getting soft he let him off the possession thing with an informal caution i have the power to overrule that decision and have the boy prosecuted for theft and dealing minor stuff ill grant you but enough to end his university career and give him a record that hed carry for the rest of his life alexs marbella tan paled as he spoke oh andy she moaned you wouldnt do that to him tell me why not he barked if he was some punk from pilton and you were a tart off a street corner pringle would have sent him down the road without a second thought why should i give him preferential treatment its as if i was rewarding him for letting you work off your frustrations on his dick she winced at his expression then her eyes narrowed and what if he stood up in the dock or went to the papers and said that he was only being prosecuted because of me he stared back at her people stand in the dock and slag off the police all the time love does the thought worry you because it might hurt me embarrass you or damage your career prospects she nodded more to herself than him this discussions run its course i think as she spoke she pulled the engagement ring from her finger and laid it on the kitchen worksurface better luck next time she said sorry to have spoiled your sunday she started for the door but he caught her arm alex no he said i went too far im sorry for a moment she tried to pull free then stopped and let him turn her to face him im sorry he repeated i went over the top there i am not going to overrule pringle or do anything else to the boy you just gave me a serious kick in the ego that was all look you told me often enough but i guess i wasnt listening i had no idea that i was being as possessive and as constricting as that but i suppose i have to take some of the blame for whats happened remember that daft thing i said ten days ago in the pub about not sharing you with you well forget it please of course youve got to have your own space up to a point by that i mean that you can sleep anywhere you like as long as im the only person you sleep with can you handle that small restriction she looked up at him with a curious soft smile are you saying that youll forgive me if i promise not to do it again he drew a deep breath let it out in a sigh and grinned i suppose i am well she said since youre in a forgiving mood let me try you with something else over the last few months ive had a hard time sorting out my ambitions you made your agenda perfectly clear and that meant that i had to think about mine before i was anything like ready to do so for a very little while earlier on this year i thought yes lets put the career on hold lets have our family and get it over with so for a month i stopped taking my pill after a very short time i realised that that was not what i wanted however it only takes a second as they say i fell pregnant andy at the very time when you were going on about wanting kids now while you were still young enough to play hide and seek with them and i was just working out what i felt about the whole thing i was stupid enough to get myself knocked up i thought long and hard about it should i tell you should i keep the baby should i talk to sarah should i as she paused for a second or two he felt the tension build up within him once more are you going to tell me he began in the end i decided not to talk to anyone since i knew quite well what i had to do i had a termination andy on the day after i moved out of here i went into the eastern general and had it done he felt the rage well up within him far different in intensity to the anger he had felt when she had confessed her indiscretion a quarter of an hour earlier his eyes were blurred as he looked at her he felt his muscles tense he wanted to hit her not just once but many times he wanted to beat her insensible then go on beating her until his strength was gone his mouth opened then closed trying to form words he turned away from her and held on to the work surface tight struggling with his wrath until he had it under control you are telling me he whispered when he could that you were pregnant with our child and you had it killed i had conceived and i had a termination she murmured in reply dont bandy words with me girl you were carrying my baby and you had it snuffed he turned back towards her you didnt even tell me about it you didnt involve me in the decision why in gods name not because i knew what would happen i knew the argument we would have i knew that your beliefs wouldnt let you listen to me and that you would forbid it or try to i guessed that if i had told you about it then made my own decision wed be finished so i went ahead with the intention that you would never find out but yesterday afternoon when i was speaking to pops i realised that i had to tell you about it i saw that if we were going to have a life together and i really did want that then everything had to be out in the open but you didnt tell me when it mattered he repeated desperately you kept our kid a secret because you knew that what you wanted to do ran contrary to my upbringing and to my belief its my body were talking about here andy she countered i am sorry truly but no one be he husband lover or anyone else has the right to tell me what i will do with it i will only ever have a child when i want and with whom i want i always wanted to have a family with you my love but not yet when i had my termination it was with us in mind longterm dont give me that he spat back at her bitterly you had my baby killed because it was in your way that investigation that brian and clan are working on theyre looking for someone whos been helping people to kill themselves when they find him hell be charged with murder and found guilty quite right too because thats what it is from where i stand i cant see much difference between you and him i could forgive your fling with the boy thats easy but not this no way alex picked up the ring from the worktop and slipped it into the breast pocket of his shirt i came here for confession my dear not forgiveness its the fact that you think you have the right to forgive thats persuaded me finally that we have no future together i hope this temporary office is okay for you chief inspector our uniformed colleagues arent too pleased with me for pulling rank to have two of their inspectors moved in together for a while brian mackie grinned round the door at his deputy her right arm was in a protective plastic casing but she was using it nonetheless arranging folders into piles on the rooms small table i hope you didnt carry those in here he said no chance maggie rose replied putting the last small group of files in place on the table mario carried them up for me hows he doing these days hell be happier once next weeks conference is behind him its the sort of routine vetting and accreditation work that bores him silly the superintendent shrugged not all paths to glory run across easy ground he laughed pointing at the bundles on the table i can guess what those things are your homework for the last couple of weeks yes yes indeed three hundred and more sad stories i finished my trawl through them on saturday and have you come up with anything she wrinkled her nose in a typical gesture theres no single case here there that leapt out at me i was going to give you a report this morning but if youve got time now sure said mackie why not he closed the door behind him and sat down as she picked up the small bundle of folders and took her place behind her desk hows the main investigation going she asked casually a pained expression crossed his face dead in the bloody water again thanks to a phone call i had from the boss at the weekend what from andy no from the big boss hes been overseeing the investigation for the last ten days or so which is just as well clan and i happened upon a strong suspect for both deaths gaynor westons son no less we thought we had him until he came out with an alibi for number two a story which big bobs call on saturday evening confirmed while anthony murray was breathing his last raymond weston was under the duvet with the head ofcids fiancee rose looked at him momentarily stunned alex he was with alex skinner mackie nodded she confirmed it when she got back from holiday and that mags is now one of the deepest darkest secrets of this department apart from bob alex and now i guess andy only clan stevie steele you and i know about this and thats the way it will stay the report will be going into the dccs safe and it will stay there weston knows murmured maggie ray weston knows what if he brags about it after the chat clan and stevie had with him he wont be breathing a word believe me all that aside though it looks as if the kids in the clear apart from having made himself just about the worst enemy you could imagine and weve got a stalled investigation unless you can kickstart it that is i wish i could help you brian she said but i dont think so ive been through every one of these over the last few weeks theres not a single case in here where selfsuffocation was the cause of death i began by sorting them into categories as i was going through by the method used in each case i tell you people come up with some awful ways to top themselves that didnt take me any further really other than to confirm that there wasnt a single case of overdose linked with asphyxia among the files i was checking so i went through them all again looking at the background circumstances of each victim most of them were related to depression or hopelessness arising from a range of causes mental illness debt marriage breakup were the most common however i did find some where serious or terminal illness had been the reason for the suicide and i separated them out she lifted up the pile of folders mackie guessed that there were around thirty of them once i had done that rose continued i looked at the methods used some hanged themselves one woman jumped off salisbury crags predominantly though the victims overdosed they used a variety of drugs in pill or liquid form and the overwhelming majority combined these with large quantities of alcohol with one single exception in fact the fatal substances were taken by mouth she picked up the file which lay on top of the heap on her desk out of all of these reports this is the only one where the person injected herself i dont think its a winner though the victim was a woman from bathgate named nicola marston she had inoperable cancer of the liver with secondaries in most of her other major organs in addition to that she was an insulindependent diabetic she killed herself by injecting four times the normal dose lets have a look said mackie taking the folder from his deputy he laid it on the desk and leaned over it shoulders hunched reading carefully it took him over five minutes to read statements which were stacked together in the thick report and finally the investigating officers summary report to the procurator fiscal when he had finished he scanned through the documents once more i guess youre right mags he grunted as he closed the file the only common factor linking the three cases is that all the victims are single people living alone and suffering from terminal illness the consultant in this case derek simmers is the same man who looked after anthony murray but that isnt relevant since all cancer patients in our area are referred to the same small group of consultants he picked up the papers as he stood im going up to fettes this morning for the divisional cid heads meeting the dccs taking it himself today so ill let him see it i dont think itll make his morning though looks like thats it then gentlemen sighed skinner he was as frustrated as the two superintendents i agree with maggies view that the bathgate case doesnt fit with the other two so theres no sense in upsetting the family involved by raking the whole thing up again itd be difficult anyway sir said mackie theres a note on the file saying that the body had been released for cremation doesnt make any difference the dcc held up the folder for a moment theres nothing here which would have given us grounds to ask for an exhumation order no im afraid that for all your sterling efforts were back to square one all the bloody aggravation has been for nothing he glanced across the desk and to his left at neil mcllhenney since you two know the facts of the case and since you have to work with him ill tell you this neil you havent been involved in this inquiry in fact you know bugger all about it but youre my right hand man so you should hear this too andy martin and my daughter have decided to end their engagement i would tread carefully around the head of cid for a bit hes feeling very sore about it fortunately hes got the conference preparations to keep him distracted hes not feeling sore at us is he sir asked pringle a touch anxiously of course not nor is there any reason why he should you guys did a very professional job we could have buried it boss said mackie when the weston lad gave us alexs name in his alibi i mean the evidence against them was all pretty tenuous by that time we could simply have sent him and the girl home and forgotten all about it no you couldnt skinner jabbed the folder with a finger emphasising his words it was there it had to be followed through and confirmed if the boy had been lying hed have been firmly in the frame he wasnt though so it looks like weve run into the buffers agam with the two kids eliminated as suspects aside from the coincidence of the consultant simmers having treated both murray and the bathgate woman as far as i can see were stuffed mackie nodded short of finding this mystery man deacey id say we are boss and even if he walked off the street right now and gave himself up wait a minutethe urgency ofmcilhenneys interruption cut him off in midsentence who did you say the other three men looked at him mackies surprise tinged with annoyance at the outburst gaynor weston had a male friend that we havent been able to trace the superintendent said he was mentioned in her computer diary but no one knows who he is not her son not anyone we had one lead but that went badly wrong on us when maggie got cut it was him they were after the sergeant looked at him but that guys name was joseph or so mario told me that was his real name hed been living under an alias for a while he was our only possibility so now were left with this odd name deacey and we havent a clue who it fits but anyway as i was saying even if we did find him he doesnt link into the murray investigation mcllhenney leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling for a while in silence as if he was thinking something over very carefully eventually he pulled himself forward and looked at skinner im afraid he does sir and to the bathgate case but no way is he the man youre after i can tell you who deacey is hes derek simmers the consultant its his nickname you see he rarely goes by his christian name since his schooldays thats what all his friends have called him then wed better talk to him again brian said pringle emphatically two could be coincidence three looks like conspiracy i think we should try to have this guy suspended while we check back through his time at the hospital just hold on there mcllhenney exploded this mans in charge of my wifes treatment she has confidence in him and shes making good progress take him out of it and god knows what could happen if hes killing people the gruff superintendent countered he needs to be taken out killing them hes doing his fucking best to save their lives you fucking idiot neil was on his feet looming over pringle the divisional cid head was a formidable man in his own right but wisely he stayed glued to his seat and looked across the desk in an appeal for help easy sergeant easy said skinner gently he stood and took his assistant by the arm pulling him gently towards the door come on lets you and i step into the corridor for a bit mcllhenney was still shaking with rage and tension but he nodded and followed him outside just calm down now get a hold of yourself said the dcc when they were alone superintendent pringle doesnt exactly wear jackboots but hes old school nonetheless you know that christ you should youre a younger version of him if you werent so involved in this personally youd probably have agreed with him mcllhenney leaned back against the wall his eyes closed breathing slowly to steady himself maybe before boss he said hoarsely but not now not now as he finished speaking his voice cracked his chin dropped on to his chest and he started to sob helplessly as skinner looked at him he thought that it was one of the most shocking things he had ever seen and one of the saddest neil lets go along to your office he took the burly thickset man by the elbow and led him the short distance along the corridor to his small room just sit in here by yourself for as long as you need im sorry boss for losing it the sergeant whispered beginning to recover himself its just so fucking hard to handle thats all i know pal i know listen dont worry about what clan said back there thats not going to happen were going to have to look into this you know that but itll be done very carefully and no one will rush into anything i promise you that you just stay here for a bit now mcllhenney nodded yes sir give my apologies to mr pringle will you like hell i will the dcc retorted he was being a fucking idiot he closed the door on his assistant and returned to his own office he looked at pringle as he resumed his seat beside the window brain first mouth second clan aye sir im sorry i wasnae thinking at all okay let me do some of that for you brian when you saw nolan weston you mentioned the name deacey didnt you yes sir we did he didnt react at all he pursed his lips for a second then added slowly and theyre pretty close colleagues so exactly the name must have meant something to him before you do anything else i want you to reinterview him and find out what he can tell you about deacey simmers he glanced at pringle again with a faint smile but gently clan okay dont worry sir the superintendent replied ill kiss his you know what if i have to he paused going on from what brian was saying theres another thing someone didnt say that might be significant when the boy steele and i interviewed simmers up at the hospital he never once asked us what we were on about a detective superintendent and a sergeant turn up to ask him about the death of one of his patients yet he didnt ask us why in the light of everything boss does that no strike you as odd skinner frowned i wish i could say no for olive and neils sakes but i have to agree with you it certainly does of course i know who deacey is superintendent mackie when you asked for this meeting at my home rather than in my office at the western i guessed that youd worked it out too nolan weston smiled softly across the conservatory at the two detectives the last of autumn had gone from the garden outside save for a few wet brown leaves which clung on to the skeletal branches of the trees so why didnt you save us the trouble of finding out asked pringle he was about to add after all this is a fucking murder inquiry until just in time he remembered his promise to skinner the surgeons expression changed in an instant to one of contrition how controlled he is thought mackie how much tougher than simmers i can only say im sorry about that im afraid that at the time i decided that the tragedy ofgaynors death had touched enough of us and that i would keep it away from deaceys door did it occur to you that mr simmers might be that third arrow your wife mentioned the younger detective asked not for a moment or i doubt if id have brought it up we go back a long way deacey gaynor and i we were at university together a typical triumvirate of friends gay and i got engaged when we graduated and married shortly afterwards deacey went off to england to do his internship then he did some postgrad study in an oncology centre in canada we didnt have any contact apart from christmas cards until he was appointed a consultant at the western general were you surprised by the idea that your former wife and mr simmers might be having a relationship you still havent shown me that they were superintendent if that was the case then yes id be mildly surprised yes they were great friends as students but their relationship was always on that level deacey and i werent rivals for her hand or anything like that however i suppose they might have been having an affair if they were itd have been entirely their own business since they were both single but if you were to ask me id say that it was more likely that deacey would be someone shed turn to in time of need to help her end her life pringle asked in a voice which was for him surprisingly soft professor weston frowned and rubbed the top of his bald head anxiously no no no that wasnt what i was implying at all deacey simmers is a very special man hes a great friend in time of crisis he is also a very gifted physician she may well have gone to him for a second opinion before deciding on her course of action wouldnt he have needed your case notes if she had done that if gay had described the situation as i explained it to her and considering that i was involved he wouldnt have needed them there was no alternative prognosis in your opinion asked mackie once mrs weston had decided on her course of action as you put it might mr simmers have been so good a friend that he decided to help her through with it nolan weston looked him in the eye ever heard of the hippocratic oath superintendent yes but thats not an answer its the only one i could possibly give you i can only examine my own conscience no one elses ive already told you what i believe i would have done if she had come to me when we saw raymond at your house he denied any knowledge of the name deacey was he lying to us no i doubt if theyve ever met he frowned at mackie look go easy on my son gentlemen please he told me about his interview with you about the cannabis and the sedatives which he took from my personal supply i hold myself responsible for that to an extent while avrils been pregnant ive been taking them to help me sleep i mentioned that to ray and he did something very stupid as a result i assure you that will not happen again he smiled i hope i dont have the same problems with my new son avril had a boy three days ago congratulations said pringle thank you raymond told me about andrinas uncle also weston continued i can understand why you made the connection between his suicide and gays death not suicide there might be a legal grey area in mr murrays case but as far as were concerned theyre the same and the same person was involved in both did your boy tell you anything else about the chat he and i had he told me about the other young lady if thats what you mean i didnt approve of his treating andrina that way but then im not really in a position to throw stones am i he didnt tell me who the other girl was only that she was a friend of gina my niece professor mackies tone was sharper than before have you ever discussed the substance of our first conversation with mr simmers weston nodded i told him about it and did you tell him about the hypo and the roll of tape being removed from the scene yes i believe i did well do us all a favour said the superintendent heavily yourself in particular dont talk to him about this one okay i whats the betting westons called him not a chance clan mackie exclaimed the boy didnt mention alexs name even to his father after your talk with him the prof got the same sort of message hell have understood it all right this time deacey simmers was waiting for the two policemen in his little office two superintendents this time he exclaimed as he greeted them your investigation must be in trouble it was mr simmers said pringle easing himself into a tight fitting chair until we got lucky we were looking for this bloke deacey see then we found that we had interviewed him and didnt even know it see the surprises this job throws up from time to time so deacey tell us about gaynorweston were you and she having an affair simmers leaned back in his seat and looked back at the superintendent neither man was smiling i should have asked you this at out first meeting mr pringle what is all this about fuck that thought pringle me tarzan you jane i ask you answer then as it had earlier bob skinners face appeared before his minds eye in due course sir he said politely but first we have to ask you about your relationship with the late mrs weston you did know her sir didnt you you are the deacey she referred to in her social diary arent you yes superintendent i am so i ask again were you and she having an affair really mr pringle is that relevant possibly sir answer please the word affair in the context in which you are using it implies something illicit that was not the case as far as gay and i were concerned we had known each other for many years from our schooldays in fact i was at daniel stewarts and she was at mary erskine then we went up to university together i found myself on the same course as nolan weston he and gay met and fell in love did this upset you frankly it did for a while at least gay and i had had a little fling by that time but when nolan came on the scene that was that i got over it though and the three of us stayed pals after we all qualified i went off to extend my studies gay and nolan got married and had a son so that tied them to edinburgh it didnt hold him back though his career developed very well indeed when i was appointed to my present post eight years or so ago i found that he and i were colleagues did you meet up with mrs weston again at that time i saw her at a couple of parties about a year after i arrived here she and nolan split up that had nothing to do with you had it simmers glared at pringle bridling certainly not he snapped so when was your relationship with mrs weston renewed asked mackie not that long ago actually after the divorce she and i would speak occasionally by telephone me calling her mostly to make sure she was all right i think we probably met about three times in six years once accidentally in the street and the other occasions by arrangement for a drink during most of that period i was in a relationship myself so there was no question of us dating as such then maybe around nine months ago gay called me and invited me to oldbams for dinner i went out there expecting a party but it was just the two of us we talked for longer than we had since our student days in fact we hadnt spent that length of time alone together in over twenty years did she say why shed called you like that out of the blue simmers shook his head no she didnt but i suspected that there was some sort of crisis in her life she talked about nolan and their continuing relationship which i didnt really want to hear to tell you the truth since i know avril very well and like her very much and she spoke of this adman futcher which i didnt approve of either for similar reasons because he was married exactly for all that though and although she denied it i sensed that she was troubled at the end of the evening to answer your original question mr pringle she said come on deacey lets go to bed maybe youre the one after all so we slept together for the first time since the end of our schooldays after that we saw each other oh maybe once a month on occasion wed go to the opera or the theatre but usually id go out to oldbarns wed have dinner and id stay the night always though there was this thing that i felt hovering over us at the time i hoped that it meant she was thinking about putting an end to her other relationships now of course im convinced that she was worried about the developing growth on her leg didnt you ever notice it no she always wore jeans when we were together not always said mackie quietly she would only ever get undressed in the dark superintendent surprisingly for such a strong personality she was slightly shy i remember that about her from when we were youngsters he sighed yes even then the last time we had breakfast together i asked her to marry me she said that i should ask her again in three months and that was the last time you saw her yes he said firmly and when was the last time you saw anthony murray asked pringle the consultant frowned at him two days before he died and nicola marston nicola a patient of yours from three years ago yes i remember her when you have peoples lives in your hands man you never forget them the last time i saw her would be at our last consultation in dco when i had to tell her that her condition was terminal simmers looked back at mackie look please tell me what this is about otherwise this interview is at an end two patients and a lover sir all apparent suicides with injection involved the only three such suicides in this part of scotland in the last three years and you are the only common factor are you accusing me no sir we are not not yet at any rate if you would give us a sample of your saliva it might help to eliminate you altogether in that case said deacey simmers hold on while i find a swab well have to be present when you take the sample sir said pringle why the detectives diplomacy reserve was totally depleted because however nice and chummy my colleague here might seem were both suspicious bastards we have to make sure its yours andy martin looked around the converted gymnasium all but one of the desks stood empty the long table against the wall was heavy with row upon row of processed forms is that it then sergeant he asked it is indeed sir said karen neville the last parisian policeman the last japanese journalist all thoroughly checked out and cleared for action the supply of eagle badges for the armed officers is upstairs ready for issue at the security briefing on monday although ive no idea how we ensure that everybody wears them we dont its up to the head of each security team to ensure that his people comply once theyre issued however the boss or i will tell them at the briefing that anyone found with a gun and without a badge will be arrested and locked up for the duration hopefully thatll get their attention whats left to do now that the paperworks cracked we have to check everybodys hotel accommodation just to make sure that theres nothing ticking behind a bath panel or in a toilet cistern anywhere special branch will coordinate that but itll be done by major legges army team the first delegations or at least their advance guards start to arrive on saturday so that leaves tomorrow and friday to get it all done and the accommodation sealed off he glanced round the gym again everyone else has gone home i take it yes sir mario left to pick up his wife around fifteen minutes ago ive been waiting for clearance on a dutch joumo its just come though so im off too fancy a drink asked martin or have you got a date karen was taken by surprise im washing my hair tonight sir as we ladies say so im okay for a quick drink yes that would be nice where do you want to go how about oneills on the south bridge thats not far from where you live fine i can leave my car in chambers street overnight its close enough to home they drove in convoy across town karen leading the way as she had guessed parking was easy in the wide street so late in the day and they found adjoining bays for once the skies were clear and the night was cold and crisp as they walked the short distance to the bar one of several with an irish theme to have sprung up in the capital as the burly redhaired barman poured a pint of lager and a gin and tonic karen found a table in the corner martin set the drinks down and sat facing her so he began awkwardly how have you liked special branch very much she looked at him as he picked up his beer she had heard from colleagues that the head of cid had been a legendary ladies man in the days before his engagement but as he sipped his pint she found it hard to believe he seemed shy diffident and strangely insecure by comparison with the powerful assertive figure which he cut in the office dyou want to stay there his question took her by surprise and worried her for a moment or two only if youre kicking me out of your office she answered cautiously i prefer it there he smiled at her a quick dazzling engaging smile backed up by a sudden sparkle in his green eyes and in that moment she understood how the legend had come about thats good he said sombre once more i hoped youd say that but i thought i should ask mario would have you in a minute its nice to be popular mind you she added i thought i was in everyones bad books a few weeks back when you dated your australian suspect you mean yeah at first you probably were but when i heard the full story from mario i saw that you were right it was a means of keeping contact so you took it you made a professional judgement and ill always back that he took another mouthful things still okay on that front he asked she grinned back at him down under you mean sport yes thanks were getting along its not the most orthodox relationship ive ever had with him nursemaiding a wheelchair case but it has its moments what happens when he has to go home he goes back to his oil rig its off western australia but thats just another piece of ocean as far as waynes concerned he says hell give up his flat in perth and register my place as his home address that way the company will pick up the cost of his travel back here every time he has home leave good thinking ms neville what does he do on his rig hes the drillmaster an important guy makes a bloody fortune so he tells me thats even better youve landed on your feet in every respect im happy for you she nodded thanks i just wish i could say the same to you im sorry about your breakup he winced so am i he said hesitating before adding but better here than down the road a piece as they say youll still be friends though wont you well never be enemies he answered lets put it that way but we cant go back to how it was before when she was just my best friends daughter some cuts go too deep and is he still your best friend she asked quietly bobs been great after i told him about it he invited me down to gullane and the pair of us went to the pub and had a few beers no a right few beers it was his way of telling me that some things will never change neil mcllhenneys intray was empty he had worked his way through the papers which the dcc had referred to him for action or comment he had finished an analysis of the relative clearup rates category by category by each of the cid divisions as he waited for skinners monday morning summons he sat hunched over the desk in his small office staring out of the window he had done a lot of staring out of many windows over the last couple of months he realised almost invariably he thought of sunny days to come of he and olive lauren and spence enjoying a normal lifestyle once again no decisions were being forced upon them by the education authority but olive knew that even if she won complete remission from her illness her classroom days were over they had discussed the respective merits of her accepting an offer to switch to the expanding quality control side of education or of her resigning and setting up in business as a designer of computerbased teaching packages whichever option they chose neil understood that in reality it was another target to be pursued another piece of the scaffolding which underpinned his wifes tremendous determination to beat her enemy deacey simmers was the most important part of that support structure and neil knew exactly why bob skinner had excluded him from his meeting that morning with brian mackie and that tactless bampot clan pringle it was because simmers was the only item on the agenda as he stared out into the crisp winter morning he could picture the three of them grouped around the dccs desk the big man doing his trick of watching the driveway seemingly far away while absorbing every word that was being said to him he was expecting it but when the phone on his desk buzzed twice he jumped nonetheless he knew the signal so he let it lie unanswered rising instead and walking out into the corridor past ruthie mcconnells rabbithutch as she called it to skinners office the red light outside was shining but he opened the door and stepped in pringle and mackie had gone sit on the comfy ones his boss said pointing to the informal seating in the corner as he filled two coffee mugs i know i know he muttered as he poured must cut down on his tar but whats the alternative tea a right poofters drink that mcllhenney slumped into one of the low chairs took two coasters from a container and tossed them onto the rosewood table to protect it from the heat meeting go all right sir he tried to sound casual but failed you wont think so im afraid skinner replied quietly as he set down the two coffees clan and brian brought their lab results with them simmers saliva swab matches the trace that arthur dorwards lot found on a glass at the scene of gaynor westons death also his prints were on the envelope of the letter gaynor sent to her son when the lads interviewed him last week he admitted to them that he and she had been on intimate terms lets say but he said that the last time he saw her was more than two weeks before her death on top of that it turns out that he was a near neighbour of the man murray and called in on him quite regularly i cant take that lightly neil it looks bad for your friend shit mcllhenney hissed his mouth tight set still boss if he twigged the position he might be in we can allow him one wee lie cant we he still has to be asked about it though mackie and pringle have asked me to allow them to pick him up for a formal interview skinner continued they also want a warrant to search his house and his office for traces ofdiamorphine and any other incriminating material inevitably the hospital will have to know that hes under investigation in connection with the deaths of two patients theres no evidence left in the bathgate case you know what that will mean sure even if we dont charge him straight away hell be suspended right but i have to tell you this on the basis of the evidence i have before me his loving relationship with the dead woman his presence in her house that night his ready access to anthony murray with all that allied to his professional skills all my training and experience makes me believe objectively that hes guilty the dcc looked at his assistant almost helplessly neil he asked in my place faced with all this what would you do mcllhenney smiled boss you were right about me im out of the same mould as superintendent pringle if this was just an ordinary case and i was on it the suspect would be sitting in st leonards right now with a tape running and me shouting in his fucking ear but it isnt an ordinary case and my wifes life is at stake here so dont ask me for objectivity the big sergeant looked his boss in the eye ive been thinking about this for the last week boss since deaceys name came up in this thing and i can tell you its bloody complex it seems to me that youre telling me that you see him as a man who believes that he can exercise power over life and death and square it with his conscience skinner frowned then nodded i suppose i am he agreed well i have to tell you and i have hellish difficulty saying it because it makes me face up to something id rather avoid but deacey simmers greatest pain comes from the knowledge that he doesnt have that power people in his care people like olive and me we sit in his room and we listen to his words they come in perfect order words like inoperable incurable palliative and so on were literate objectively we know what they mean but subjectively thats another matter theyre very precise those words yet no way do they apply to olive even now as i sit here i will not admit to you or anyone else and most of all i will not admit to me that shes going to die deacey simmers though from the outset hes told us that her disease indicates that she is hes laid those words out for us then hes said okay now these are the treatments i have to offer you will have them then what happens is up to you and up to fate deacey is a caring person an inspiring person and hes totally helpless in the face of many of the cases that are sent to him everyone who goes into his room gets the plain unvarnished truth and yet he manages to send people out of there with feelings of determination and flowing from that hope against hope he will never slam the door on anyone if youre saying that this man imagines that he has lifedetermining power and that he interprets that as allowing him to put people to sleep then with the greatest respect boss and for the first and last time in my life i have to tell you that youre talking bollocks deacey knows better that anyone that for my olive and all the others like her his treatments have the same chance of success as a snowball has of putting out a furnace yet even in the absence of that power which you say hes perverting he gives us something a sense of purpose which makes our situation bearable he helps us to focus on that one chance in twenty no way did he kill gay weston or anyone else ill tell you this too behind that calm facade of his hes lonely and fragile and i get the feeling that sometimes hes overcome by what he does yet he carries on and thats what makes him what he is a great man you let those two arrest him boss let the fiscal charge him and ill promise you this when he comes to trial ill go into the witness box and give evidence in his support even it i have to leave the force to do it skinner reached out and put a hand on his assistants shoulder neil if it comes to it you can speak for him with my public blessing but lets see if we can avoid that it seems as if all of my best people have had a finger in this investigation at some time or another except for you the papers in these two cases are on my desk take them away with you and see if you can come up with another suspect ive told clan and brian to sit on their hands for another week thats how long youve got maybe youll turn out to be as important to mr simmers as he is to you there are those who believe that the edinburgh international conference centre is one of the finest pieces of late twentieth century architecture in scotland there are others who believe that the great drumshaped building is a blight on the skyline of the capital city andy martin did not regard himself as a philistine yet he was a confirmed subscriber to the latter view a constable in uniform checked the head ofcids warrant card as he pulled up at the car park entrance looking at it studiously before waving him on he knew the chief superintendent well enough but acc elder was on the prowl and he had no wish to start the week badly martin strode out of the car park and into the centre in the foyer area twin lines had formed as the delegates queued to have their briefcases searched and to pass through the metal detector gateways the policeman walked past the lines and round the barrier he was not carrying a firearm but nevertheless he wore a gold eagle badge as a shortcut into the hall since everyone without one was subject to the security check mario mcguire stood at the wide doorway of the main auditorium looking across its expanse morning sir he called out come for a look at the sardine tin have you god alone knows how they managed it but they did weve got thirtysix delegations crammed in here whats todays programme asked martin officials only finalising the agenda and order of speakers for when the big boys get here are the delegations limited in size yes the class two nations judged by gdp can have four delegates in the hall at any one time class one nations are allowed eight has the seating plan worked out all right the inspector flashed a smile they managed to do it alphabetically just he said i wouldnt fancy being one of the irish delegation though theyre the meat in the sandwich between iran and israel thats okay martin grunted my grannys irish once that lot start talking the rest wont get a word in any other awkward neighbours i dont know how the russians and the saudis are going to get on no problem the russians will be on their best behaviour otherwise the saudis might not buy them lunch then theres the uk and the us were still on buddy terms i believe cigars arent allowed in the hall are they mcguire looked at him youre in a chirpy mood today sir the head of cid grinned i had a drink with karen neville the other night it did me good it made me realise that if i go around being a miserable bastard all the time the only person wholl be the worse for it will be me so im trying to find the old andy again hes around somewhere i spent the weekend going through my address book looking for him dyou not fancy the bosss secretary ruthie mcconnell dont we all shes living with someone though the special branch commander shook his head not any more karen says shes chucked him shes plugged into all the gossip is that one ill bear that in mind about karen i mean i must be careful what i say around her as for ruthie shes a bit too close to the big man for me in spite of those legs mcguire shot him a sideways look listen sir take some manto man advice will you dont rebound too far in the other direction the old andy was always a bit of a myth wasnt he a legend in his own bedtime you mean aye he was he laughed to an extent thanks mario ill bear that in mind too he glanced into the hall once more and pointed to a wheelchair bound figure to the left of centre of the seated area i take it thats karens boyfriends pal dennis crombie aye thats him a dour bugger he is too so would you be if you had to be lifted on and off the crapper all the time is the wayne fellow around he was here earlier when he brought dennis in hes probably gone for a coffee its about that time not with neville i hope not here i doubt it shes on duty frisking the female delegates andy martins grin seemed to mcguire like a throwback i think ill go and help her he said what have you got there asked olive neil hunched over the dining table looked over his shoulder at her work i shouldnt have brought it home sorry what is it och its just the files on an investigation that the boss has asked me to take a look at its stalled and he wants a different perspective on it let me see she said pushing herself slowly from her chair and coming over to him he watched her as she walked she was pale and her movements betrayed her weakness but there was a vitality in her eyes which seemed unquenchable no he answered closing the folder you dont let me look at your school stuff no because youre not qualified and because childrens futures might be affected if i allowed myself to be swayed by something you said same here he countered rising from the table turning her how much more easily he could do that now and taking her back to the comfortable chairs in front of the television this is a murder investigation three actually and someone could go to the slammer for life if i let you see those files then was influenced by your half arsed analysis thank you very much since youve been the dccs exec youre getting too big for your trainers mcllhenney but not as big as he used to be he must have lost over ten pounds since this thing started she thought ill tell you what lets just discuss it hypothetically no names involved you just describe the situation and ill tell you what i think okay miss marple anything for a quiet life as long as you go to bed afterwards you look tired must be these platelets that suzannes been going on about she says that theyre going to put some more into me tomorrow once ive had my scan you still all right to drop me off of course and pick you up afterwards good now tell me about your problem he sighed wouldnt you rather watch taggartt what that rubbish no way the real stuffs much more interesting go on okay hypothetical though three deaths the first three years ago never investigated at the time the second and third fairly recent theres one thread that ties them all together an individual whos a strong suspect for the second and who lives in the vicinity of the third what about the first thats a fairly tenuous link that death may well have been straightforward misadventure with no one else involved thats how it was treated at the time misadventure what do you mean by that i mean suicide well dont mislead me now why is this person such a strong suspect for the second murder because he had a physical relationship with the victim was at the scene on the night and he kept quiet about the fact when he was interviewed by pringle and mackie two superintendents olive murmured serious stuff this what about the third case whats the connection there the guy lived near the victim so did thousands of other people i assume there has to be more than that what is the link between all three cases was the man related to all three victims no then what is it were they all masons or something no the link was professional he was their lawyer no doctor neil felt the water growing deeper by the minute yes he treated all three people she seemed to withdraw from him for a few moments as she thought it was a trait he knew well did he benefit from the deaths she asked him no they did in fact these people were dying neil werent they yes look can we stop the twenty questions now like hell they all had cancer hadnt they okay yes they had they were all terminally ill and they all appeared to commit suicide but in at least two of the cases the second and third we know they had help someone else was there and played a part olive fixed her husband with that look theres nothing hypothetical about this neil youre not describing a stalled investigation youre talking about one thats bloody well solved arent you youre not casting a fresh eye over this youre looking for an alternative dont be daft im a bloody ds its not for me to walk all over an investigation thats been signed off by two superintendents exactly she snapped so why are you looking over these papers and why are you quite clearly so bloody anxious about it this doctor its someone we know isnt it he leaned back beaten and gazed at her he should have known better than to give her the opening than to let that mind others loose on the problem aye he said its deacey simmers the guys want to lift him and ive got a week to show them why they shouldnt oh christ love i wish id never brought those papers home suppose you hadnt id still have known that something was bothering you and id have had it out of you she paused listen understand this and maybe itll help one thing ive learned from that man in fighting this thing the most important people to me are me you lauren and spencer deaceys a doctor neil not a faith healer hes shown me the road to remission and started me on it but he isnt leading me im finding my own way with long life you and the kids waiting for me at the end that said i dont believe hes a doctor goodnight any more than you do he didnt help these people to die so who did could it be an organisation he shook his head no there arent any of those not any more this is an individual and its someone that gay weston and anthony murray knew and trusted the problem is that everyone else has been eliminated were only left with deacey and hes done nothing to help himself theyve placed him at the weston house on the night and theyve found a book at murrays place signed best wishes deacey a book which was only in the shops in the two weeks before he died he doesnt know any of this yet itll all be put to him next monday when hes reinterviewed he can say what he likes but unless he can prove categorically that he was somewhere else at the moment of mrs westons death hes done for that one murray maybe not but whats in that file will convince any jury that he helped his girlfriend on her way the only thing that will help him is me finding the person who did is there another link between weston and murray there was but not any more thats been eliminated then what about the third case the one three years ago no theres nothing else connecting all three ive been through the fiscals report on nicola marston theres sod all in it okay but suppose there was something else linking her to either one of the other two people would that help he gazed at the fireplace pondering her question maybe yes maybe no itd be a place to start though ill give you that but where will i find it theres no evidence other than that suicide report over there and it takes me nowhere what about her case notes what dyou mean if she was a patient at the western general as you say then there must be a fair chance that theyll still have a file on her neil smiled maybe you should come to work for us once you leave teaching he said ill see what i can find i dont hold out much hope mind but at least its somewhere else to look now climb your weary way to bed big day tomorrow for us both and who knows maybe for deacey too im on reasonably good terms with the chief executive of the hospital nhs trust neil i suppose hes got the authority to let you look at the notes on nicola marston although you might have to go along to the western to do it ill call him when i get back from the eicc i promise thanks sir said mcllhenney sincerely i doubt very much whether therell be anything in it but its something to do truth be told easier than going out and reinterviewing all of gay westons neighbours mmm i dont think i want you to do that unless youve got something specific in mind im not going to tie your hands but i want you to tell me before you talk to witnesses fair enough boss right ill speak to you later but now id better put in an appearance up at the eicc skinner glanced out of his office window that looks like my driver he pushed himself from his chair and headed for the door the city centre morning traffic was minimal most drivers having been directed to temporary park and ride areas under acc jim elders policing plan and so a fifteenminute journey took five andy martin was in the foyer area which was brightly lit by the high glass front of the building when he arrived just before ten oclock all well the dcc asked if you fancy the tower of babel as a working environment his friend chuckled its fine all the security people are happy with our arrangements thats the main thing as far as im concerned this is the last preliminary session yes thats right all the procedural stuff should be agreed this morning the heads of government and finance ministers start to check into their accommodation this afternoon ready for the formal opening by the prime minister and bruce anderson tomorrow at nine sharp you want to see the setup yes lets take a look at it as they walked past the barrier one of the private sector security guards stepped forward to intercept the dcc but martin stopped him in his tracks with a quick shake of his head have all these blokes been vetted skinner asked thoroughly twice in fact by their employer before they were hired then again by us thats good i remember once turning up at a function in glasgow and finding on the door a guy in uniform that id lifted for assault and robbery a few years before the two police officers stepped out into the auditorium the staging was complete stateofthe art and impressive the union un and council of europe flags were set vertically on a background of very pale blue with to their right a giant video screen on which was displayed the delegate who at that moment occupied the speakers rostrum it and a small chairmans table were the only furnishings on the stage so the presidents and the prime ministers wont be up there the dcc murmured no there are too many our pms in the chair for the main sessions but the others will be seated with their delegations unless theyre performing wholl get to speak all the big guns in the course of the conference the russian and chinese presidents are the main speakers tomorrow on thursday the new german chancellor and the head of the european commission are the headliners and on friday its the us president and our guy hes winding it up skinner looked around the hall lets hope they achieve something otherwise the cost of this would have been better spent feeding the poor look at it all the bloody windowdressing our cost the travel and hotel bills bloody frightening when you add it up hello sergeant he said suddenly as karen neville stepped past him escorting a woman delegate into the hall good morning sir she replied carrying on down the centre aisle and directing her charge to the seating area allocated to new zealand everything okay skinner asked amiably as she returned no problems at all sir the dcc grinned is the boyfriend here then thats him there sir she pointed to a tall brownhaired bearded man who was walking back towards the main doorway from the direction of the left hand aisle im not supposed to talk to him on duty though ill make an exception introduce us why dont you okay she waved at the australian beckoning him across wayne come here someone wants to meet you dcc skinner she said as he approached this is wayne ventnor how do you do sir said the newcomer as the two shook hands ive heard a lot about you just lately about this man too karen added this is my immediate boss dcs martin hi wayne exclaimed the head ofcid good to put a face to the name at last maybe well see you at the office christmas pissup if youre still here its a deal mate ventnor replied enthusiastically im a real national stereotype pissups are my speciality youre going to love it here then have you been dropping off your friend yeah thats me free till lunchtime i think ill spend the time taking a look at this new museum of yours karens turning me into a real scotophile he nodded so long gentlemen nice to meet you both so long gal ill see you tonight yeah all things being equal she answered about nine as usual once sbs turned in skinner frowned as the australian walked away sb karen he said sternly we dont talk about that to outsiders no sir she replied hurriedly i didnt mean special branch sbs short for sleeping beauty its what we call dennis wayne helps him to bed around nine and then we go out the dcc smiled ah i see for a minute there i thought you were turning into a security risk on you go then she looked at him relief written on her face and headed back towards the foyer skinners smile vanished as quickly as it had arrived whats up with you asked martin im not sure she might not be a security risk after all he growled theres something about that aussie thats giving me a niggle maybe its just the voice maybe its just that all these surf burns tend to look the same its probably nothing at all and yet i cant help feeling that ive seen that one somewhere before here you are sergeant this is the one youre looking for neil mcllhenney murmured his thanks to the hospital records clerk a cheery little woman and took the thick file from her seating himself at a desk in the corner of the small office he looked at the green folder alongside patients name he saw nicola marston and in the space marked consultant mr simmers the word deceased in heavy red lettering was stamped across the cover staring at it he shivered for a moment before he opened the history and began to read he saw at once that the file was in reverse date order for the first document was a note which read patients death reported by police postmortem shows death due to overdose of insulin the scrawled signature was only just legible mcllhenney read it aloud d simmers the detective had not intended to read the history page by page yet he was unable to stop himself he pored over each entry from the top down with an eye which was no longer that of a total layman making his way backwards through the course of nicola marstons illness studying the notes in each stage of her treatment although the regime was far from identical to that which olive was undergoing there were some similarities most notably the concern of deacey simmers and his registrar for the side effects of their therapy on the patients blood before he was halfway though the file he found himself identifying with nicola marston sitting by her side at each consultation feeling her pain and distress as she struggled through the inevitable violent sickness which followed each chemical transfusion imagining her pleasure as he happened upon positive indicators from her scans and xrays all the while that he read he recognised the danger to himself of exposure to such a story but he forced that consideration to one side this was not olive this was not olive he told himself this was a woman who had given up very few pages remained unread when he found the name one that he had read in the police report on anthony murray one that he knew he raced through the rest of the folder closed it then sat at the desk his head in his hands thinking hard at last he nodded a decision made he took out his mobile phone and dialled skinners direct number yes came the snapped reply the impatience in the normally steady voice took the sergeant by surprise boss sorry neil said skinner at once ive got something on my mind i wont keep you then sir but so have i theres something in this report and id like to follow it up to do that i need to make one call and i need to go and talk to someone he chuckled softly into the phone i think i must have been working with you for too long gaffer im starting to get hunches sarah grinned of course were pleased to see you alex it doesnt matter that theres european football on television tonight does it bob what oh sorry girls i was miles away there no no sod the football his daughter laughed you know what they say about the secret of life pops its sincerity once you learn to fake that youve cracked it you still need to do some work in that area seriously i mean it anyway its only an english team so what did bring you out here alex shook her head rearranging her long dark curls on her shoulders and fixed her big blue eyes on her father a bonding trip pops with my brothers and with you two i dont suppose for a minute that you wanted to ask me how andy was getting along he said idly no that would have nothing to do with it bonding sure thats it you you she spluttered then smiled always could read me couldnt you hes doing fine kid he had a couple of days of moping and chewing people out but he seems to have pulled himself out of it in fact i didnt realise how much hed changed in the time you two were engaged the truth of the matter is i reckon that you were suffocating each other do you think theres a chance sarah began tentatively that once the two of you have had a chance to readjust and to get your own personalities back that you might get together again not as much as a flicker stepmother andys very easygoing in some ways but completely unbending in others so are you kid bob murmured maybe so but my principles are consistent andy has a selective conscience you know he squares it with contraception no problem but as soon as one of his tadpoles goes astray thats it he might as well be wearing a pointy white hat and carrying a shepherds crook you should have seen him when i told him about my termination you still cant say abortion can you okay she shot back at him her voice raised have it your way my abortion he went berserk all because id exercised my rights over my body yet that same guy would put a bullet in someones head tomorrow if the need arose then go out for a pint with the lads no said sarah intervening to calm her i guess it doesnt look like theres a chance does it what about this boy ray do you think you might see him again alexs smile returned in a flash god no hes got a brain the size of a pea i was only ever after his body no im footloose again just like my ex seriously though im glad to hear hes getting over it hes not sniffing around that neville woman is he bob shook his head no hell keep her at arms length hed have to with that chest others yeah its as well i got her out of uniform the tailors were having trouble but really karens not a factor shes spoken for and thats why i was preoccupied earlier to tell you the truth i still feel i should be able to place the guy the woman took a while to open the door it was understandable mcllhenney realised as soon as he saw her twisted clawlike hands miss ball he said good evening to you im sergeant mcllhenney i phoned you earlier yes of course she replied come away through ive been expecting you he followed her through an open doorway and found himself not in her sitting room as he had expected but in the kitchen before we begin sergeant can i ask you something i ask all my visitors would you please make us a nice pot of tea i can manage a bag in a mug these days but i do so much prefer it properly made so do i said the detective show me where the tea is and im your man five minutes later he poured perfectly brewed darjeeling into two china cups and placed them on a side table between his hostesss chair and his own well done she exclaimed now im at your disposal this is still about gaynor isnt it i havent read anything in the papers lately so i suppose the mystery remains it does miss ball now ive been asked to see if i can solve it so how can i help mcllhenney settled into his seat when you were interviewed by dci rose you mentioned that you have support from a disabled charity can you tell me which one it is the woman nodded yes of course its called home support its more than a disabled charity really it looks after the continuing needs of people whove been through the hospital system mcllhenney felt the first small pulse of excitement run through him when you have a visit is it the same person who comes all the time it is yes we all have case officers who looks after you a very nice lady called penelope dark the sergeant managed to keep his expression unchanged can you remember if gaynor ever met her joan balls eyes seemed to take on a knowing look but her voice remained even as she replied oh yes of course she did they were great pals one of the first times penelope visited me gaynor called in for something and i introduced them they hit it off and after that whenever she visited me in the evening or at weekends shed go next door to say hello when was the last time you saw her last week before that a couple of months ago would that have been during the time when mrs weston was at home in the two weeks before she died joan ball thought for a moment yes it was did she call on her yes she did that time she came during the day which was unusual for her she normally does her rural visits out of hours as it were she noticed that gaynor was in and popped in to see her both cups of tea were untouched and cooling mcllhenney took them into the kitchen poured them down the sink and poured a slightly stewed refill for miss ball thats been very helpful he said as he replaced the cup on the side table i have to go now but i may need to talk to you again if i do ill call you no she said sipping awkwardly come to see me you make damn good tea mcllhenney grinned ill try he promised ill let myself out if you would he had almost left the room when she spoke again very able woman penelope well qualified for her job too shes a doctor you know hey look at this brian mackie called down from the bar nodding towards the door the bomber is back mario mcguire maggie rose karen neville and stevie steele all sitting looked round together to see the head of cid heading towards them dressed in a black leather jerkin and black denim jeans neville and steele looked at each other puzzled that used to be andys standard uniform for a night out in the pub maggie explained bomber jacket and jeans until he went respectable that is mines lager if youre on the bell thin man martin shouted to mackie over the noise of a dozen conversations as he took one of the two vacant seats at one of the abbotsfords big rectangular tables glad you could all make it he said as he looked around the booth i thought about having a formal team briefing this afternoon then i said to myself shit we all know what weve got to do anyway we might as well get together in the pub thanks brian he drew his chair over a little to allow the superintendent more room for his long legs you do all know i take it he added quietly brian youre top gun with the secretary of state along with stevie youre on station at the official residence in charlotte square at eightthirty sharp ready to escort him up to the centre the pms leaving from there as well by the way mario karen youre with me in the auditorium as discussed checking people in then watching the action the boss will be floating about all over the place keeping an eye on everything he smiled at rose maggie youre lucky youre out of it he leaned across the table even though there was no one in earshot im not expecting any bother tomorrow not with all the firepower thats going to be in the hall but im not having us go in naked either so well all be wearing our wee gold eagle badges and carrying a friend inside our jackets he looked at neville and steele brian mario and i are all experienced cowboys are you two all right with that both sergeants nodded solemnly thats fine then he took a long pull at his pint so if everyones happy we can enjoy a night out he grinned in karens direction for those of you who havent been near something this big before let me tell you that the nerves the tension youre feeling inside they come with the territory it doesnt matter how often the three of us have been to the well we all feel just like you do this wee gettogether is to help us all chill out a bit this is my favourite kind of team building anyway we say far more to each other here when we can all put our ranks to one side than we do when were sat in our collars and ties round an office table we havent been doing nearly enough of it lately true brian mackie agreed we havent had a decent party for a while either tell you what sheila and i plan to have a housewarming round about new year time make a mental note for now and ill give you all a date later ahh said andy you may be gazumped on that one i happen to know that a certain greytempled deputy chief constable and his wife are plotting a similar event at their newish pad out east round about the same time mcguire whistled well need to watch ourselves out there he murmured you kidding bob could bevvy for scotland naw i didnt mean that what i meant was that if you get comatose in their house then given her new line of work sarah might have your insides out on the kitchen table shed put yours back again very quickly mcguire maggie murmured the inspector glass in hand pointed towards the main area of the bar dont know if youve noticed guys and gals but this place is suddenly filling up with journos i recognise at last halfadozen of them from todays session martin shrugged we can go somewhere else this is maybe a bit touristy they wont know about number thirtyseven though i like it here karen protested is the aussie picking you up from here or what asked mcguire no im not seeing him tonight he has to help dennis get ready for his big day tomorrow he said hey said andy softly its a big day for us all tomorrow ill get another round in here then we can think about moving on for the last one i want everybody checked in tomorrow at fettes by quarter to eight to sign out firearms so wed better have a ten oclock curfew yes as his five colleagues nodded agreement he rose to his feet and stepped up to the counter on impulse he called back over his shoulder final word on the party stakes friday night my place to celebrate this crap being over will it be a good party a small darkhaired girl asked him as he raised an eyebrow to catch the barmans attention she was leaning on the bar nursing a pint of guinness he grinned down at her they usually are you involved with the conference she had a clipped accent southern hemisphere he thought but he had difficulty in placing it catering he said in a voice loud enough to carry to his table you indirectly im a journalist but i cant get into the hall why not she wrinkled her nose not an unattractive nose he noticed because some bastard of a copper wouldnt give me accreditation all because i refused on principle to tell him how old i was as if that bloody mattered even though i had a commission from the ft i wouldnt give in so now im just hanging around the fringes doing colour pieces for my newspaper in joburg and hoping for some sort of a scoop the barman turned his attention to andy who shouted his order over the hubbub and a pint of guinness on top of that he added then gave the little reporter his most dazzling smile whats your name he asked estelle estelle lawrence im andy you stick with me estelle he murmured and you never know what you might come up with bob skinner worked hard played hard and exercised hard he liked to go to bed tired and ready for a sound peaceful sleep for he was wary of dreams there had been too many bad ones in the past there had been the weeks after myras death when he had wakened every night after an hour or so lathered in sweat from a nightmare of vague darkness and corruption there had been the hours after his lifethreatening stabbing when he had drifted in a fog of recalled glimpses of days so awful that his mind had taken refuge in amnesia there had been other moments too secret times in his career from which people would still return on occasion to visit him then there was her he was almost certain that he would never see her again and he did his best not to think of her during his waking hours yet at night even with sarah by his side she had crept through his defences once or twice into his dreams and in those dreams he was afraid other for he knew that she had the advantage of him in the pure implacable hatred that she felt for him now as he lay in the early hours of the morning a watcher would have seen him toss and turn yet it was none of his old foes who troubled his sleep instead he saw repeated flashes of the face of wayne ventnor visions of him lifting his friend crombie into bed with karen neville suffocating in her unfeasibly large breasts swinging from a ladder oily and perspiring on his offshore rig standing in a jungle clearing holding in each hand by the hair a severed human head he sat bolt upright in bed in the same instant that he awoke eyes wide cold sweat on his forehead hawkins he thought but no hawkins was dead and anyway when he had seen the australian in the auditorium there had been no trace left of the limp which had caught karen nevilles eye at the outset of their relationship calming himself he put himself back into his dream a form of selfhypnosis which he had learned from an expert and he realised at once what it had shown him no it was unfeasible he told himself at once he liked karen neville his mind was probably projecting subliminal jealousy of the australian but then he looked at his sleeping wife and dismissed that notion in times of crisis bob skinner lived by his instincts indeed they had saved his life this was something that had to be checked in the dark he glanced at the luminous clock by his side it showed five minutes before seven too early to call mcllhenney silently he slipped out of bed careful not to wake sarah and stepped into the bathroom he shaved and showered slowly and deliberately remembering the pressure under which he andy and the rest of the team were operating looking after the worlds leaders with their rival phalanxes of armed guards telling himself that such circumstances play tricks with the mind but failing utterly to drive away his concern sarah was awake when he came out of the bathroom youre early she mumbled hazily tousled hair hanging over her left eye reminding him of no she was sarah gods gift to him no one else couldnt you sleep were you worrying about the conference today no he laughed trying to make himself sound lighthearted i slept like a log too well thats the problem thats good thats good she said nodding to herself as he began to dress and swinging quickly out of bed be a love will you when youre dressed and make me some brown bread toast and piccalilli you what i fancy it thats all she answered matteroffact but first since its morning i think i might as well be sick she headed quickly for the bathroom door he was used to the ritual and although the sudden craving had him mildly surprised he did as she asked just as he replaced the piccalilli jar in the fridge she came into the kitchen carrying a blearyeyed jazz she looked at what was waiting for her on the plate oahh she moaned i dont think i fancy that now but thanks anyway bob looked at the kitchen clock it was twenty to eight he picked up the phone and dialled his assistant mcllhenney sounded weary as he answered neil hello sme sorry to dig you up so early but how are you placed to go into the office theres something needs handling quick the sergeant hesitated the thing is boss olives not too well this morning shes had a bit of a reaction to those platelets they gave her no problem said skinner at once ill just leave a bit earlier and do it myself before i go up to the eicc if i put the foot down i could probably be there as fast as you anyway you look after olive ill swear ruthie in as a deputy she can hold the fort in everyones absence thanks the sergeant grunted listen boss theres something else last night i got a result but i want to play it out myself is that okay right now neil the dcc replied anything would be okay do what you think best if you need any help just let me know he hung up finished his coffee kissed sarah and jazz goodbye then rushed towards the door ruffling marks hair on the way as his older son put in his first appearance of the morning normally he drove sedately in to fettes but when he had to he could make the bmw fly he overtook at least a dozen cars on the single carriageway between gullane and longniddry tore down the al at close on a hundred miles per hour then took every shortcut and ratrun across town that he could think of until he arrived at headquarters eight twentyfive he muttered glancing at the car clock just before he switched off not bad he strode purposefully into the building nodding only briefly to the men on the door then ran upstairs in the corner of his office behind his chair bolted to the floor there stood a small safe the combination was his mothers birthday he spun the dial three times listening for the clicks then opened it and took out a slim folder with one word written on the outside hawkins impatiently he flicked through the photographs and photofits until he found the awful image ofhencke van roost with his trophies one in each hand he had been right wayne ventnor looked nothing like the south african assassin he breathed a sigh of relief but there were other men in the shot behind their leader there were six of them in fact two were black one stood no more than five feet three two were balding but the sixth was tall and darkhaired he was cleanshaven and looked to be around the same age as van roost only the central figure in the photograph was fully in focus all of the figures were blurred the sixth man could have been ventnor but even with his sharp eyesight skinner was uncertain he took a magnifying glass from his drawer held it over the scene and studied the figure as closely as he could look at the eyes he whispered to himself its the eyes that give them away as he said the words he thought of hawkins burned to a crisp in tangled wreckage in a polish field no its not he corrected himself its the teeth suddenly a kaleidoscope of images and possibilities whirled in his brain he picked up the secure telephone on his desk and dialled a number the duty telephonist at the offices ofmi answered circumspectly with a voice which the policeman did not recognise this is skinner in scotland he said i need to speak to the director general urgently oh the mans soothing tone was that of a professional deflector im not sure if i can raise him at this time can i put you through to the duty officer no thank you now listen to me carefully i am on a secure line and i need to speak to the dg now dont try to fob me off with anyone else and dont put someone on the line pretending to be him either for i know him he can be reached at all times as you and i are both aware so connect me now the or else seemed to hang in the air unspoken but understood ill try his car sir hold on for a moment please the moment seemed like an hour but eventually there was a click yes said a calm plummy voice one that he recognised what can i do for you bob in the background skinner heard the noise of traffic you can pull out all the stops sir bum the line to your opposite number in south africa and find out all you can about the other members ofhencke van roosts platoon in particular i need to know about a man tall darkhaired who may have had an australian connection and whose name may have been wayne ventnor although like hawkins he could have been called something else then he recited his mobile number call me back on that as soon as you have anything ill be on the move but what about security bugger security skinner snapped he glanced at his watch youve got twentyone minutes after that im either going to embarrass myself before the whole nicking world or something very bad is going to happen stevie steele stood at the doorway of number six charlotte square looking out into the street since the last round of games which the citys traffic managers had played with a confused motoring public it had always been quiet outside the official residence of the secretary of state for scotland but on this momentous morning in the city it was almost ghostly the usual fleet of marooncoloured buses were operating steele saw two of them dropping off passengers on the far side of the square but there were no cars no delivery vans no crash helmeted cycle couriers and very few pedestrians other than the public transport the only vehicles in the square were two black jaguars parked outside the magnificent greysandstone terrace two police cars front and rear and four motorcycles they stood on the other side of the street three of their riders waiting beside them their crash helmets in their hands the young sergeant flexed his shoulders trying to work his firearm into a more comfortable position beneath his jacket feeling its weight in the holster strapped to his ribcage feeling his heart thumping slightly his pulse raised by the tension of his onerous duty he had done close protection work before for visiting vips but this was different this was big time the biggest he looked down at his dark jacket at the sun glinting on the small gold eagle badge in his lapel he checked his watch sixteen minutes to nine one minute to go the radio in his hand gave a small bleep and a voice spoke from it steele recognised acc elder even although he sounded strained charlotte square acknowledge the sergeant pressed a button sir delay departure by two minutes sergeant said elder the russians are late leaving the caley tell the outriders not to get too close if you come up behind them in lothian road understood sir he looked at the senior outrider a sergeant who was standing beside him did you get that aye the man replied no sweat ill get ma cowboys saddled up he headed down the steps and across the street black boots shining as his signalled to his men to mount their cycles steele counted off the minutes then the seconds at exactly thirteen minutes to nine on his synchronised watch he pressed the bell on the doorjamb of number six then stood aside and waited a few seconds later the heavy door swung open and the prime minister stepped out flanked by his two permanent bodyguards he gave the young sergeant a watered down version of his worldfamous smile and jogged down the steps dr bruce anderson the secretary of state for scotland followed in his wake brian mackie by his side and his civil service private secretary briefcase in hand bringing up the rear okay stevie said the superintendent as they headed for the second jaguar everything seems peaceful lets deliver our client a small crowd of people stood on the pavement in morrison street opposite the entrance to the edinburgh international conference centre apart from the scottish office minders and two uniformed police officers they were all journalists not accredited to enter the conference itself but given secondary passes to allow them limited access to the arrival they stood in professional dispassionate silence as the president of the united states stepped out of his armourplated car under the centres decorative canopy watching as he was greeted by the lord provost of edinburgh gold chain glinting by chief constable sir james proud silver braid shining and by the american consul general in a dark lounge suit andy martin was waiting in the foyer as the group moved inside the worlds most powerful man shook his hand as the consul general introduced him gave him a drawled good morning and thank you and moved on the chief superintendent had never seen the president in the flesh before on the basis of the documentaries he had watched on television and the studies he had read of his ascent to power he had always wondered how the man had reached the worlds most powerful office close to he began to understand there was a presence about him an aura which was almost visible and which had been lacking in all of the other world figures who had walked past him previously that morning even the formidable chinese and french leaders as he gazed after him the president walked through the security archway the metal detector having been turned off for that moment to ensure that his belt buckle did not set it off smiled and waved briefly over his shoulder to the police and officials gathered in the entrance two more to go sir said mario mcguire as he stepped alongside martin the russian and our pm dont forget the secretary of state easily done the inspector grunted as they stepped closer to the entrance dyou remember the saying about that old prime minister what was it an empty car drew up outside number ten and mr attlee got out that could have been told about anderson the head of cid laughed youve been spending too much time with the deputy chief constable thats how he feels about all politicians these days if someone told him there was a bomb in here i reckon hed clear out the civilians and lock the leaders in as he spoke mcguire nudged his elbow and gestured towards the group across the street theres a friend of yours over there martins eye followed his pointing finger estelle lawrence stood among the group of journalists waving at them with a slightly uncertain smile he grinned and gave her a brief wave in return here sir the inspector muttered you dropped us right in it last night bringing that one back to the table and having us all pretend we were catering contractors christ when maggie said she was in charge of dishwashing he shook his head laughing softly to himself after we all left did you manage to stick to your ten oclock curfew oh aye no problem i might have trouble tonight though im picking estelle up at nine from her hotel mcguire pointed across the street once more im not so sure about that see who shes talking to the head of cid looked back at the journalists and saw estelle deep in conversation with john tough a local news reporter whom they both knew well suddenly her expression changed she shot them both a venomous glare know what said the special branch commander i think us two catering contractors have just been dropped right in the soup skinner thumped the steering wheel in frustration and swore loudly as the stolid uniformed sergeant held up a big gloved hand he had already been stopped by two other officers either ignoring or ignorant of the call from control that the dccs car was to be waved through all barriers he sounded his horn but the man simply turned his back on him the dcc jumped out to rend him limb from limb but as he approached the main entrance of the caledonian hotel came into his line of vision the russian convoy was just pulling out a black rolls royce limousine with full escort sergeant he barked clear out of the way once theyve gone the man turned gulped as he recognised the angry figure behind him and stepped aside sliding back behind the wheel of the bmw skinner moved off heading for lothian road only to see the prime ministers convoy swing out of charlotte square at speed cutting across in front of him he swore again but knew that patience was now his only option and so he pulled in behind the rear outriders as they swept past the great hotel heading for the eicc one of the bikers dropped back and took up position alongside his window peering into the car from under the visor of his crash hat recognising and acknowledging him with the wave of a gauntlet he was snarling with frustration as the cars in front slowed almost to walking pace marking time he realised to allow the elderly russian president to make his ponderous entrance first but at last they turned right into lothian road the oneway system irrelevant under jim elders movement plan he looked at the car clock six minutes to nine he swung violently into the car park narrowly missing the young constable who moved momentarily to block his path but sensibly stepped backwards out of the way drew to a halt in the first available space jumped out of the car and moved quickly to catch up with the prime ministers party he was twenty yards short of the great glass entrance when the phone in his pocket sounded its urgent signal stopping in his tracks and snatching it from his pocket he pressed the green button and held it to his ear yes he snapped the dgs calm plummy tone was gone your man ventnor he said tersely is he on your patch right in the middle of it in that case you have a major problem you were right he was in van roosts jungle group he was his second in command in fact and it was he who saved his life when he took his leg wound hes half australian halfafrikaner and hes an explosives expert dyou remember the asian head of state who was blown out of the sky in one ofhawkinsjobs yes well the intelligence community suspected that he had help in making the bomb but they never worked out who you may have come up with the answer my hypothesis is that when hawkins was killed ventnor was brought in as a replacement thats a contradiction it would mean that hawkins wasnt after walesa he was on this job all along therefore he wasnt in poland and he isnt fucking dead hes here and hes posing as an adviser to the iranian delegation but he was identified the dg protested by his teeth alone somehow theyve faked that my guess is that his paymaster for this job came up with a body and put a dentist to work on the lower jaw who knows maybe they used hawkins own teeth when they found the stiff in the plane the top of his head was gone so the dental identification was only partial even against the background street noise the detective heard the gasp from the other end of the line you have to stop the conference skinner the dg shouted you have to clear the hall before theres a massacre its probably too late for that the prime ministers just gone inside the plan is that he goes straight into the hall up on to the stage with our secretary of state and at that point the event is declared open as far as i know hawkins and ventnor are in there now look if youre right and were dealing with a bomb they aint going to blow themselves up the whole place was checked by snifter dogs first thing this morning if there is a device in there the clever bastards have taken it in with them and i think i know how what do you mean i think hawkins is sitting on it the best chance weve got is if we can arrest them right now and take them by surprise in the process so they dont have a chance to trigger the thing and take us all out with them do you have to arrest them skinner knew exactly what the man was saying dont be daft he retorted this events being broadcast live i cant shoot two guys on worldwide television he cut off the call slipped the phone back into his pocket and began to run the uniformed inspector in charge of the detail at the entrance saw him approach and saw the look on his face wheres andy martin the dcc called out in the foyer last i saw sir the dcc sped into the auditorium as he dived through the metal detector archway it buzzed loudly the two civilian security guards who were manning did not recognise him and together they moved to stop him there was no time for explanations first one then the other went down winded by short disabling blows he left them gasping and ran into the wide passageway which encircled the main auditorium to his relief martin and mcguire were standing in the main doorway they had their backs to him and were looking into the hall beyond them stood the prime minister and the secretary of state if i can stop them he thought he moved towards them but too late as he reached the door the two politicians set off down the shallow sloping centre aisle and as they did the assembly rose to its feet in spontaneous acclamation skinner grabbed martin by the arm and hauled him out into the passageway andy he gasped breathing hard as he looked at his astonished friend problem bigtime problem mcguire spun round also at the sound and stared anxiously at the dcc wayne ventnor karens australian he was the sapper in michael hawkins squad of jungle killers find him and arrest him now get all the help you can split up and search the whole place but dont involve neville before you go the man in the wheelchair crombie is he in the hall he should be sir the inspector answered hes with the iranians in karens sector far side of the left aisle but why hes hawkins its some disguise right down to the false teeth maybe but im sure of it if hes not michael hawkins then my names camilla parker bowles and ive never been on a horse in my life now go on as his two colleagues ran off skinner stepped across to the doorway and looked into the hall down and to his left but his view was obscured by the assembled politicians and delegates who were still on their feet clapping the prime minister and the secretary of state onto the stage turning he ran round the passageway to the next doorway at the top of the next aisle karen neville was standing there unperturbed looking into the hall could she have knownl he wondered for an instant but no his ego refused to let him believe that his judgement of a woman could have been so badly wrong once again dennis crombie he said ignoring her surprise at his sudden appearance where is he sitting about halfway down the aisle sir on the left thats the iranian position israel nearest the gangway then ireland then them last in the row is he there yes i was looking down at him just as everyone got to their feet skinner felt a trickle of sweat run down his spine whats the betting he murmured under his breath he stood on tiptoe trying to catch a glimpse of the iranians among the many tops of heads he picked out several wound in white cloth standing in the area neville had described how many should there be in the delegation he asked eight sir seven iranians and dennis as she spoke the prime minister came to the centre of the stage beaming nodding and gesturing to the gathering to be seated skinner stared down their ranks as they complied counting the iranians aloud one two three four five six then an empty place and finally an empty wheelchair on the outside of the row neville looked where he looked saw what he saw her hand went to her mouth oh my g exactly lass skinner murmured either theres a faith healer in the house or your man crombies a wrong un now where the hells he gone because he hasnt passed us by he looked down into the auditorium on either side of the stage there were two sets of double exit doors those on the left seemed to be swinging very slightly beside it were two hardlooking men both of them wearing little gold badges he looked at the woman beside him and saw shock on her face no time for discussion he snapped how did crombie and ventnor get here by car she answered her voice cracking for an instant dennis got a disabled permit for the centre car park you know what their car looks like yes okay i want you to grab andy or mario the first armed colleague you see then go and find it meanwhile im going to get that wheelchair out of the hall but why sir because its a bomb karen your boyfriend and his pal have been planning all along to blow this place to kingdom come now go as she turned and sprinted along the passageway feeling her bolstered sidearm banging against her hip skinner stepped briskly down towards the israeli delegation reaching them he turned in and made his way along to the iranian position he recognised the prime minister at once from television footage the man glanced up at him with fleeting curiosity but then looked back towards the stage where the british prime minister was standing at the lectern surveying his audience good morning my fellow heads of government and good morning heads of state he began his voice ringing round the auditorium good morning excellencies and welcome to you all crombie or hawkins ne van roost had chosen his moment perfectly while everyone in the hall was gazing at the pm he had simply risen from his chair and quietly slipped away only the two or three men behind him could have seen his departure and they had clearly been too preoccupied to have been surprised or alarmed had they even noticed it skinner stopped by the empty wheelchair took it by the arms and tested its weight he could barely lift it christ how much explosive has he got packed in here he whispered he crouched down and looked under the seat between the wheels bolted to the steel chassis he saw a heavy box one that had not been put there by the chairs maker skinner took his phone from his pocket and was about to dial martins number when he paused he had no idea he realised how the bomb might be triggered for all he knew the microwaves from a cellphone might be enough for all he knew an arming device might have been activated causing the device to explode at the slightest movement for all he knew wayne ventnor might be sitting in the car park at that very moment his finger on the button of a transmitter which could atomise him and everyone else for yards around he bet his life on the third possibility grabbing the wheelchair he kicked off the brake then pulled it backwards out into the furthest aisle and began to roll it down towards the exit beside the stage the two guards looked at him in surprise as he approached open the door he mouthed as he wrestled with the impossibly heavy device steering an erratic course down the aisle hoping that they were americans and would understand him rather than triggerhappy russians who might do anything uncertain for a moment the guards looked at each other then finally as he was almost upon them threw the exit open and allowed him to propel the chair through into the corridor and out of the auditorium behind him he was dimly aware of the prime ministers inspirational tones as he continued to mesmerise his nations guests he was sweating heavily as he looked ahead to see another pair of doors twenty yards away their paintwork heavily scuffed and marked dropping his centre of gravity skinner pushed as hard as he could his legs pumping until he had worked himself up to a run once more his mind was a blank as he drove the lethal object at the second doors sending them flying wide apart as it hit them at speed and bursting out into a concrete loading bay beyond hoping against hope he looked around and saw only cardboard boxes in which some of the technical equipment had been delivered mercifully the area was empty of people giving the chair one last push he turned and crashed back through the doors running back along the corridor as fast as his powerful but tiring legs would allow he had made it halfway to the auditorium doorway when he heard the blast and when the shockwave caught up with him lifting him bodily then slamming him senseless to the ground karen was racked by sobs as she burst out into the foyer as she fought them back and wiped the tears from her eyes she saw inspector jack good the officer on duty at the door staring across at her the two security men sat on the ground beside him but she had no time to think anything of it has anyone gone out of here she demanded i dont know good replied ive been looking after these people whats up anyway mr skinner came tearing in here a few minutes back these two tried to stop him and he just laid them out she ignored him and called across to the two constables who were flanking the door you two have you seen anyone leave the taller of the men on the right of the entrance door looked over his shoulder three guys went out of here a couple o minutes back he said a welldressed bloke with a beard another fella scruffy like both of them big chaps and an arab guy wi a turban thing on his heid ah asked them if theyd had enough the scruffy bloke said just about they went along there he pointed to his left neville turned back to the inspector find mr martin or di mcguire she ordered tell them the targets have gone to the car park and that im off in pursuit he looked after her bewildered as she ran through the doorway and out into the street the centre car park was by no means full but it was busy nonetheless most of the spaces taken up by suppliers vans and staff cars she looked over the low wall as she approached the gateway but saw no sign ofventnor or hawkins the constable whom skinner had almost run over was still at his post three men recently she gasped he understood away over there at the back he said pointing to the furthest corner of the park tucked behind the east wing of the centre she nodded and ran down the roadway scanning the rows of vehicles realising how difficult it is to spot a single car among dozens of productionline clones at last she caught a glimpse of a metallic green roof and a flash of white material a second later the soft clunk of a closing door reached her ears drawing her pistol she stepped into the rank of parked cars holding it in both hands arms outstretched as she approached the green vehicle she saw that the bays on either side were vacant wayne she shouted almost a scream as she reached it all of you get out of that fucking car hawkins was behind the wheel ventnor was in the front passenger seat while the third man sat in the back she stood directly in front of the vehicle her pistol levelled at a point between them so that she could react to any sudden movement out she called again this is loaded the safetys off and i will fire her lover grinned at her as he opened his door calmly and stepped out on the other side hawkins did the same he no longer wore his heavy glasses and for the first time she caught a resemblance to the man in the photographs she had been shown weeks before youre not going to shoot me karen love wayne drawled she saw that he was holding a small box in his right hand dont bet your life on it you bastard right in the balls if i have to the other man i want him out too shapoors harmless love dont you worry about him old hencke and me were the dangerous ones now just you stand aside and let us drive on out of here no way he held up the box in his right hand and pressed downwards with his thumb she frowned for a moment then gasped in horror as a compressed booming rolling sound came from within the conference centre youre too late karen he said still smiling as he dropped the box the rest of the iranian delegation is cosmic fucking dust by now the paddies the israelis and every one else for yards around them have all bought it within an hour there will be a new government in iran and a whole new middle eastern power structure thats if theres any middle east left sometime in the next thirty minutes cnn will have a call from a socalled iraqi source claiming responsibility theres a fair chance theyll take baghdad right out in response his smile disappeared and a look which might have been a plea came into his eyes now come on stand aside and let us drive out of here youve been a great help to us so far dont screw it up now otherwise hencke might have to break his promise to me she realised that the man she had known as crombie was holding a gun and in the fraction of a second which it took her to register the fact waynes right hand came into view and she saw that he had one also please karen he said do the sensible thing like i said we both know you cant shoot me no but i can the voice calm and deadly twenty yards away andy martin stood barely in their line of sight his pistol drawn and aimed instinctively the two bombers looked towards him waynes right arm moved and that was it martin fired twice inside a second both shots hitting ventnor in the middle of the forehead in the same moment karen swung her pistol on to hawkins and pulled the trigger only once but it was enough her bullet took out his right eye and exited through the back of his head the iranian inside the car screamed and raised his hands out out out she yelled at him as the man opened the back door and threw himself on to the ground the chief superintendent was aware of another cry softer terrified female he turned towards its source as she stared at the figures on the ground at the spreading pools of blood what the hell are you doing here estelle he shouted i slipped our escorts the little journalist whispered i wanted to find out who you really were he frowned grimly as he reholstered his pistol well now you know i told you to stick with me if you wanted a scoop if they let you tell the story that is how is mr skinner karen asked i heard they took him away in an ambulance but nothing after that hes fine martin replied he was knocked out for a few seconds when his head hit the deck thats all bobs had tougher scrapes than that and walked away from them sure someone called for an ambulance but the big fella sent it back empty more to the point he continued how are you how was your interview with the fiscal this afternoon did it go all right yes mr pettigrew was very kind ive always imagined that when you when something like that happened the officer involved would be really heavily questioned sometimes depends whos doing the questioning davies a good guy plus the boss had a word with him before he saw either of us he was fine with me as well what worries me sir he raised a hand and glanced around their surroundings he had brought her to the rosebum bar because it was sufficiently far from the west end to be journalistfree listen up the road discipline says it has to be sir but in here its andy she smiled okay what worries me andy is that i didnt prevent that bastard from triggering the bomb how could you have done that i could have shot him as soon as he stepped out of the car sure you could suppose you had done just that and hed been unarmed the box had turned out to be smarties and estelle a foreign journalist desperate for a story had happened on the scene to find you with a smoking gun in your hand standing over the body of the guy whod let you down not even bob would have been able to keep the fiscal off your neck then she shuddered at the thought what about estelle she asked i thought you were seeing her tonight not tonight or any other he chuckled shes gone running off to talk to an agent about syndicating her story itll be worth a million to her she doesnt know about wayne and me does she no way does she know about that nor will anyone outside our force ever not even pettigrew estelle knows what she saw and what i told her he paused that the two dead men were international terrorists hired by an iranian dissident group angered by their governments softening line towards the west that shapoor bahwazi the third man in the car an attache with the iranian delegation was one of its ringleaders that their first objective was to kill the iranian prime minister but that the way the seating plan worked out they extended it to include taking out the israelis whats happened to bahwazi martin smiled coldly the prime minister no less ordered him expelled from the uk this afternoon and flown back to teheran that way therell be no fuss and no high security trial on our patch hell be up against a wall within a week after theyve got the other names in his group out of him youll probably catch the execution on cnn they had their telephoned communique by the way but by that time the cia had warned them off broadcasting it by then of course theyd already run the story as had everyone else of the explosion in the conference centre made safe by the boss she sighed heavily i still blame myself for that in spite of what you said and ill say it again until you accept it youve got nothing to blame yourself for except maybe for charging out there to tackle two dangerous guys on your own look wayne didnt give you any warning he just triggered the bomb which by that time was in a safe area thanks to bob no karen you did great but i couldnt shoot him andy she protested it was my duty and i couldnt do it if you hadnt turned up no it wasnt your duty at all there were no civilians about it was your life alone that was at risk and you had three options open to you if you had been on your own she frowned as she sipped her lager what were they one you could have let hawkins kill you unacceptable two you could have stood aside and let them go understandable three you could have shot hawkins in the hope that wayne couldnt bring himself to kill you either as it turned out thats what you did better that way he murmured better in the long term that you didnt put him down yourself believe me youve had to shoot someone before havent you he nodded twice the first time was the night mario was hit afterwards we never knew who actually killed the guy whether it was brian or me we both hit him more than once the second time id rather not talk about does the experience still affect you theres the odd bad dream if it gets to you too badly youll never carry a firearm again at my rank i suppose in theory i dont have to but if id made that choice in spite of himself he shuddered we wouldnt be sitting here right now she said nah ive got faith in you youd have popped hawkins and ventnor would have put his hands up and wed have walked away yeah she muttered suddenly bitter and id have had to go into the witness box and give evidence with him in the dock and his brief digging up all sorts of stuff about my sex life better the bastards dead except that her voice cracked and she looked away he took her hand enfolding it in his when you really mean that he said softly you really will be all right you know were wounded soldiers you and me with a terrible thing in common weve just got to make the best of it i suppose so she looked up at him again and gave his hand a quick squeeze andy she asked hesitantly i dont fancy being alone tonight would it be bad for discipline if i came home with you just this once of course he looked at her and he knew that he would never really be the old andy martin again however hard he tried his disappearance had had nothing to do with his engagement to alex either that man had died on a black night in another place just this once he replied i think it would be for the best olive mcllhenney was watching the television in the corner of the living room but with little interest she knew that upstairs in her daughters bedroom spencer and lauren would be glued to the small portable set expanding their encyclopaedic knowledge of coronation street but since the onset of her illness the characters had seemed flat and the storylines boring in comparison with her own reallife drama still she watched it though for something to do while she waited hoping all the while that her visitor would be on time since she felt illequipped for the mounting tension which she was experiencing when neil had wanted to call the visit off her insistence that she had got over her earlier setback was a little short of the truth she looked at the clock as the doorbell rang and saw that her visitor was in fact a minute early carefully in the slow steady way which had been forced upon her she rose and walked out to open the door ms dark she said good to see you good of you to come call me penelope please said the woman as she stepped inside its no problem at all im free every night for the rest of this week come on through then olive ushered her through into the lounge pointing her at the comfortable sofa there was a coffee table between it and her chair and on it sat a bottle of red wine and two glasses have a glass with me she insisted my list of pleasures is a bit curtailed but im still okay for sex and drink i insist on quality in both respects so this is pretty decent stuff she smiled as she filled both glasses most of the way to the top cheers said penelope dark taking a sip im glad to hear that youre trying to live as normal a life as you can thats very important now what exactly did you want to talk to me about woman to woman as you said olive took a breath stopping short of the point of pain i need some lifestyle advice penelope she began cautiously i have every confidence in deacey and in my treatment but im under no illusions that neil and i will ever walk up another munro together when this thing she tapped her chest is battered into remission what will i be able to do what plans can i make can i go back to the classroom can i have another baby if i want how physically fit am i going to be the other woman looked at her running her hand over her ash blonde hair playing for time as she considered her answer my dear she began i dont think you should be under any illusions here if you get some degree of remission for a period of years even you will never be fit enough to teach again as for having a child if you ever fell pregnant youd be advised to terminate youll have a life oh yes but in all honesty i cant say that youre likely to be able to do much more than you can now olive threw back her head jesus she whispered this is it im afraid so but i find this hard to take as it is her fists clenched i tell you this penelope she exclaimed as if she had been goaded beyond endurance at last by her fate if it got any worse i could not stand it the idea of a slow steady decline with neil and the kids having to watch with him having to do the most personal things for me the thought of that appals me i will do anything to avoid that i tell you if it happened id climb into a nice hot bath and cut my wrists her voice rose until she broke off in a paroxysm of coughing ssh ssh said her visitor soothingly dont even think such a thing that would be awful for them imagine neil coming in and finding you worse still imagine if it were spencer or lauren if they saw something like that it would mark them for life what else can i do olive shot back her breathing restored the hospital never gives you enough drugs to off yourself ive noticed theyre damn careful about that but if it comes to it ill find a way suppose i haveto shuffle down to the waverley station and chuck myself in front of a train penelope dark picked up her glass and took another sip there is a way she said quietly that would be less painful for neil and the children and most of all for you whats that neil has so much crap in the garage that i couldnt get the car in to do a hosepipe job the woman on the settee shook her head thats not what i meant listen im a doctor olive if it did come to it and you were really sure id be prepared to help you how the word was slow and feathersoft im about the hospital a lot i have access to drugs i could prescribe or procure something sufficiently powerful painless and virtually instantaneous if you could arrange for the children to stay with someone as youve done before and for your husband to be out one night i could visit you but youd get into trouble afterwards you could go to jail penelope no id arrange it so that it looked like you had committed suicide which is of course exactly what you would have done still olive murmured i dont know if i could let you do that that would be my ethical decision not yours all i would be doing would be offering you a better way to achieve something upon which you were already determined you can spare neil and your children from the thing you dread you can do it humanely i can offer you that choice olive whether you take it is up to you but i think its right that you should have it the trouble is dr dark said neil mcllhenney as the kitchen door swung fully open the law doesnt agree with you he stepped into the room with bob skinner following behind there was a dark bruise on the deputy chief constables forehead i shouldnt apologise for setting you up like this but i will the sergeant said the truth is it was olives idea when she heard what was at stake she insisted on doing this penelope dark looked at him apprehensively what do you mean at stake deacey simmers reputation and freedom he was right in the frame for killing gaynor weston and anthony murray she put her hand to her mouth but i never meant that she gasped im sure you didnt and maybe when he was arrested youd have come forward but it would have been too late by then the damage would have been done you know how sensitive mr simmers is the faintest whiff of something like this could have finished him she nodded youre right he might have been your next suicide how did you know i was involved in those deaths she asked i found your name in nicola marstons notes i knew youd been to see mr murray too so i went to see joan ball she told me about your connection to mrs weston did you help the marston woman she turned to look at skinner as he spoke nicola asked me hypothetically how much insulin it would take for a fastacting lethal overdose hypothetically i told her i wasnt there when she died though i didnt know about it until deacey told me i felt terribly guilty about it at first but over the next couple of years i thought about it more and more eventually having been an opponent i swung right round and became a member of the pro euthanasia camp that was as far as it went though till gay told me about her illness and asked me to help her end it she was a strong woman she had made a firm decision and in my view a correct one so i agreed i went out to oldbams late at night injected her made sure she was dead and went away i didnt realise how many silly mistakes id made until nolan weston let something slip in conversation at the hospital one day so you were more careful with mr murray skinner interposed yes although not careful enough it seems no not quite the dcc smiled faintly tell me this when you helped gay weston to die was mr simmers there no he had been there earlier in the evening for supper gay told me in fact that hed been a bit disappointed when she asked him to go he thought that hed be staying the night as usual neil and olive mcllhenney sighed with relief in unison what about mr murray skinner continued did he ask you to help him penelope dark looked up at him no she said i made the offer anthony was such a lovely man and he was struggling so hard to hold on to what was left of his dignity that i couldnt stop myself he jumped at the chance when i put the bag over his head the last thing he said to me was thank you and what did gaynor weston say it wasnt thank you mrs futcher was it neil mcllheimeys jaw dropped as he stared at skinner thats the one big problem i have you see doctor said the dcc the fact that gaynor weston was your husbands girlfriend when neil asked me to witness this and told me about you i made some inquiries through a contact at the bma he checked the files and told me that although darks your maiden name the one you qualified under and the one youve always used professionally youre also mrs terry futcher the woman jumped to her feet look she protested you have to understand about terry and me were happily married in our own way but i have my life and he has his i dont enjoy his attentions over much never have thats why we dont have a family and thats why i dont mind his screwing around although we keep up the pretence that i dont know about it i love him though and he loves me and we agreed a long time ago that wed stick together come what may i knew about gaynor almost as soon as it started terrys careless with his diary and i knew who she was through her work for the firm but id never met her until that day that joan introduced us i liked her at once all the more because i realised that she was no threat to my marriage she was a hell of a sight more independent than terry ever was and i knew early on that he wasnt her only boyfriend i know it looks bad but gay and i were friends did she know who you were i never told her and if she knew she never let anything slip i have no idea if terry ever showed her a photograph of me but her relationship with my husband had no bearing on my decision to help her end her life you have to believe that it doesnt matter whether i do or not said skinner if a judge saw malice there though that would matter bigtime as he looked at her penelope dark futcher sat slowly back down on the settee however the big dcc continued fingering the bruise on his forehead and wincing as he did it isnt going to come to that because more by your luck than your judgement we have no hard evidence against you dr dark nor the prospect of ever finding any and under scots law a person cannot be convicted on the basis of an uncorroborated confession all that i can do is have a quiet word with home support and make sure that you are never again put in a position where you might be tempted to offer your special help to a terminally ill patient make no mistake i will do that unless you promise to resign ill do the same with the bma too unless you promise never to practise medicine again will you give me those undertakings yes the woman whispered after a moments hesitation in that case youre free to go and take this both as a request and a warning dont ever be tempted to do such a thing ever again she had almost reached the door when olive spoke no penelope she said please dont because youre not god youre not the pope youre not infallible with what youve been doing you only have to be wrong once and my dear you were wrong about me about us you probably dont understand this given what youve said about your own marriage but my familys the driving force behind everything i do i dont have a choice at all i dont have the luxury of opting out i have to go on for neil and the kids sakes as much as my own because i will not entertain the idea of our being parted before our rightful time for them i have to fight this thing to my last breath if it comes to that and believe me lady i will where have you been sarah looked at him appraisingly as he stepped carefully across the threshold at the same time she noted the police cars tail lights which were disappearing down their driveway and why did you have a driver she asked suspicious of his deliberate gait have you been celebrating your victory over the forces of darkness by hobnobbing with the great and the good leaving aside my concussive injury he said with equal care tapping his forehead but feeling nothing i have to tell you that the real forces of darkness are bastards and cannot be swept aside by a few rounds from a browning that said i have indeed been hobnobbing with the great and the good drinking many toasts to them in fact to two of the finest and best people i have ever met
