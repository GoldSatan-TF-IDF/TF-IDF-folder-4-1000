immortalised and for their generous support of riding for the disabled one sometimes i think that if i was ever depressed enough to jump out of a window id fall upwards we made a show of making our marriage work my second wife primavera and i once i rejoined her in the states after our troubles in spain the deal was that i tried to put her past behind me and she tried to do the same with mine the parts of my past that she knew about that is i sold my flat in glasgow the one that had been jans and mine to a willing buyer at a quicksale price prim never even asked who it was thats how keen she was to cut herself adrift from scotland we thought about getting shot of the spanish villa at the same time but put that on hold for a while and rented it out instead for six months to a scots actor i had met on my first movie that was just about as long as our reconciliation lasted too not much more than half a year i suppose it was okay at first after all we were living a dream after cruising my way through my thirties fate and a trusting inlaw had thrown me into an acting career my confidence never in short supply at the worst of times had been boosted by some halfdecent reviews for my performance in my debut film and by some oneonone coaching from an old theatre pro who taught me plenty about phrasing timing relaxation and script retention the stuff you can either learn or you cant so i moved positively into my second role in a miles grayson production this one was supposed to be set in chicago but most of it was shot in toronto for a very good reason miles who was is and always will be married to prims actress sister dawn phillips as well as being the worlds top box office attraction is also a very sharp man around a pound note dollar bill yen euro or whatever currency happens to be appropriate at the time when it comes to dollars he knows that the canadian version buys a hell of a lot more than its long green neighbour hence his choice of location the downside of this selection was that miles is not alone in knowing that in fact torontos new nickname is the hollywood of the north and on any given week in the year there are so many american film crews roaming its streets that bumping into each other could be a real problem fortunately thanks to our directors clout with the mayor who was on a oneman crusade to round up as much bigname support as possible for his olympic bid that didnt happen to us the other problem with toronto is its mooses or mice or meece i never did find out what the plural is lets just call them a herd because there are more than enough of the things to qualify the moose is the civic mascot i asked many people why this is but nobody could tell me and they have really gone overboard on it lifesize replicas of the gormless animals are everywhere on just about every street corner and outside every public building replicas save for one thing very few of them have horns those have become a collectable item in the city by the lake miless movie had a long production schedule since he was running a documentary project simultaneously for australian television it didnt overrun but i was committed to canada on and off for more than six months whenever i could on weekends and offweeks i went back as was expected of one half of a happy couple to prim in los angeles and to the beachfront house we were renting when i was in toronto camping out in the spacious and elegant royal york hotel i played the faithful husband to perfection almost i wont say i never looked at another woman but i certainly didnt touch in fact i spent most of my spare time in the gym or watching baseball in the sky dome more fool me in spite of our director stars split commitment we wrapped the movie two weeks ahead of schedule the champagne corks were popped on set i said goodbye to the lady publisher who had offered me serious bucks for us distribution rights to my ghosted autobiography yes thats how bizarre my life had become and headed home to la to the warm and welcoming arms of my wife and fulltime dedicated matrimony as the beatles sang i should have known better it was a classic scene you know it from a thousand movies and telly soaps i actually did shout honey im home as i closed the door behind me there was no sign of prim in the big living room and so i walked out onto the deck which looked south over the beach and the pacific there had been a new compact jaguar in the driveway but id simply assumed that my wife had been shopping again so i frowned when i saw who was waiting for me i knew right then that something was wrong still i had an image to protect shit i murmured what a memory ive got im in the wrong house i cannot imagine anyone less fitted for the breaking of bad news than my sisterinlaw dawn shes a lovely scots girl in every sense and one of the kindest people ive ever met shes the ultimate collector of waifs and strays a trait that led her into some odd relationships before she met miles she cannot watch a charity ad on television without writing a cheque or phoning in with a credit card number she sponsors personally five hundred african children and her own kid is well on the way to being spoiled rotten but she is flakier than a summers worth of ice cream cones dawn will panic at the drop of a hat the first time the baby burped up some feed she wanted to call a paediatrician my nephew bruce well hes half aussie half scots so what did you expect them to call him was in her arms as she turned to face me as a matter of fact he was plugged into the mains as my old dad would say dawn is an enthusiastic breast feeder and so i realised as i watched him tuck in is the boy bruce she opened her mouth to speak but inevitably her pretty face wrinkled up and her chin started to tremble incongruous is too gentle a word to describe the way she looked with her child sucking on her right nipple and tears streaming down her cheeks bruce paused and looked up as the first big drop landed on his forehead la babies arent used to rain it always gets their attention its p p prim oz she stammered shes and then she cracked up again she didnt have to say any more though im no mind reader but shed told me the whole story in that one brief blubber besides i knew my wife well enough by that time just as she knew me my first thought was one of regret not about prim but about what id passed up in toronto with that publishing lady who is it i asked her taking bruce from her as she tucked herself back in and struggled to get herself back under control shes not dead i went on not giving her a chance to answer or the cops would probably be here and shes come to like this lifestyle so if shes gone theres a reason whats his name it was dawns turn to frown until then shed only known the laughingboy side of oz blackstone everyones favourite clown shed never seen the guy who was looking at her then i think she expected me to cry too she certainly expected me to care either way i must have been a big disappointment to her nicky johnson she whispered i actually smiled as i held bruce up to my shoulder and rubbed gently between his shoulder blades im a well experienced uncle dawns frown and no doubt her disappointment deepened ah him nicky the flying actor nicky johnson the guy whod given prim a lift from california to barcelona in his private jet a few months before hed probably had it on autopilot for a good chunk of the way where have they gone mexico puerto vallarta i think oz youre not going to do anything reckless are you this time i laughed out loud at her concern i wasnt trying to take the piss i just couldnt help it what you mean like go after them with a shotgun nan i wont bother ill probably punch the guys lights out the next time i see him maybe on oscars night that would be good for a story but only because its expected of me no if he wants her he can have her christ whether he wants her or not hes having her thats the best revenge i can think of next time you talk to her tell her to get a divorce when shes down there ill give her a millionandahalf sterling without haggling less if she wants to argue about it bruce burped contentedly and barfed a small amount of his mothers finest down my back how can you be so calm about it dawn asked looking at me as if i was a stranger and at that time i probably was easy i stroked the babys head its better now than later when there might be one of these guys to get hurt by it your sister would fuck anything in trousers love you must have known that my sister who prim who else thats not fair she protested showing some perthshire spirit at last maybe not but its true she was right though it wasnt fair when prim and i met up shed been on the straight and narrow it was only after the first time i did the dirty on her that she started casting her eye around after the second time it was second nature to her so i wasnt surprised that shed gone off with johnson what did nark me slightly was that id been trying to behave myself i didnt like the man id become no lets be honest the man i realised id always been and id been trying to clean my act up well bugger that for a game of soldiers love is blind they say its also very stupid at times does miles know about this i asked her if he had id have been majorleague angry with him for wed travelled back from toronto together no she said at once i believed her of course she couldnt lie to save her babys life i left a message with the maid telling him where i was and that id be bringing you back for dinner maybe i dont want dinner i suggested oz you must look after yourself i couldnt possibly leave you here to brood on your own the fact is i hadnt been thinking about brooding no id begun to mull over the possibility of calling carmen summers whod played opposite me in the toronto movie and trying my luck there when it came to it though i couldnt say no to dawn you cant its impossible so i agreed let me wipe the sick off my shirt and ill be with you i said handing her son back to her ill follow you in the corvette thats assuming its still there ill need to drive back later no you wont she replied still snuffling a bit youre staying with us tonight just pack a bag and come in my car i almost told her that this was nothing new to me that id lost a wife before bigtime but that was something else i couldnt have said to dawn it would have been too brutal even for me so i simply nodded and did as id been told miles was almost literally pacing the floor when we arrived at their place in beverley hills on the outside its every movie mega star house youve ever dreamt of but inside its part spacious family home and part corporate headquarters naturally miles being miles the floor that he was pacing almost literally was that of his office as he caught up on his mail and messages but he was worried nonetheless whats up he asked as soon as we walked in sounding like an aussie beer commercial wheres prim the way that his jaw dropped when dawn told him banished any last suspicion i had that hed been in the know that sonofabitch johnson he barked when he could speak he was a fucking hotdog vendor when i found him and hell be a fucking hotdog vendor again when im finished with him leave the sad bastard alone i advised him hell have enough to worry about please if you say so buddy but hell never work on one of my projects again he looked at me with those kind eyes of his but are you all right oz man im really sorry i was hoping that you two had yourselves sorted out for life while i was waiting for you here i thought that something had gone bad with elanore this never crossed my mind its mum i feel sorry for said dawn mournfully shes only just got over her cancer scare and now this shell take it very badly i had to shake my head at that one elanorell take it in her stride prims a force of nature like her in that respect at least she cant be controlled or confined and your mother knows that i was wrong for her from the start we should never have got back together after jan died of course you should have you were an ideal couple two peas from the same pod which is exactly why it hasnt worked miles laid a brotherly hand on my shoulder i admire the way youre taking it but you dont have to put on a show for us you can let it out if you want if i was a better actor i might have summoned up a tear for him but that was beyond my skills you know me i said instead with what i hoped was an appropriately halfhearted grin laughing boy oz smiling on the outside crying on the inside its my way i thought to myself that if he had known the whole truth my acting career might have hit a roadblock right there and then as it was he gave a sympathetic nod and led me through the small kitchen beside his private office and out to the pool stopping to pick up a rack of cold beer on the way i dont drink the stuff much any more ive become a wine buff since i bought a fully stocked in fact slightly overstocked wine cellar with my spanish villa but to please miles i took one they were victoria bitter imported from australia ripped off the ring pull and swallowed most of it in a gulp it might have been bitter to an aussie but it tasted like damn fine lager to me i finished it and held out my hand for another all of a sudden it seemed like a good idea after the fourth i began to realise just how tense id really been and i knew why it was sheer relief i hadnt really wanted to go back to prim in the first place i had only done it because of the leverage it gave me with miles now she and that idiot johnson had given me the perfect out as my sympathetic inlaw handed me another vb i decided id play the part he wanted i took out my hand phone found prims stored number and keyed it in as i expected it rang shes embraced cellular technology more keenly than anyone i know she must have looked at the readout and known who was calling for she sounded hesitant as she answered bitch i snarled at her that was enough to end the hesitancy at least i didnt screw anyone else on our honeymoon she snapped back what are you talking about of course you did well yes she conceded unabashed okay i did but only after i found out about you is that what this is about do i still owe you no she answered this is different i thought i could hear seagulls in the background and the sound of other people where are you i asked her puerto vallarta i know that but whereabouts in a cafe does your drink have ice in it yes why do you ask that because i hope it gives you the shits is he there yes put him on no listen sooner or later itll happen might as well be now okay she murmured after a while nick johnson tried to sound cool as he took the phone oz buddy im sorry you have to believe that but these things happen we just couldnt help ourselves sure i said as harshly as i could for miless benefit you just couldnt help banging my wife well heres something else thats going to happen youd better get ready to play ugly parts when im finished with you youre going to look like brando did at the end of on the waterfront oz please i heard the weasel protest this isnt your style dont act the tough guy im not acting johnson i am a tough guy ive trained with tough guys i know ways to hurt you that you couldnt even imagine that much was true my time working with my wrestler pals had taught me plenty i was beginning to look forward to showing him too put my wife back on he did as he was told i guessed id convinced him because when prim took the phone she sounded worried what did you say to him i made him a promise miles was going to blow him out of hollywood but i want that pleasure for myself now listen honey ill ask you this just once come home leave that bum hole sitting in the bar and catch the first plane back to la but i really mean it now or never i wont ask you again there was a silence the longer it lasted the more i worried christ maybe id done too good a job and she would catch the bloody plane so as she answered i concentrated hard on wincing and on not cracking an involuntary smile im sorry she told me i just cant do that i dont love you any more oz you never did love me i murmured with an oscarwinning edge of bitterness in my voice maybe not and maybe that cut both ways listen i have to go you do what you have to do see a lawyer i want a fair split thats all just dont hurt nicky please thatll be difficult but for you okay i wont touch him i decided that id leave that piece of business until shed signed the divorce settlement take care just dont trust that guy as if i would after you she replied goodbye i looked across at miles just as dawn appeared at the poolside and shook my head slowly and i hoped sadly you heard me i said yes mate i did i dont know if i could have done that in your shoes youll never be in his shoes exclaimed his wife indignantly she looked at me you called her after all yes more fool me miles opened yet another beer and handed it to me i took it but made a mental note to slow down i didnt want to get pissed not there not then bruce has gone down for the night dawn said i thought we might cook steaks and bake potatoes on the barbecue if thats all right with you boys couldnt be better i told her we threw a few chunks of texas beef on the outdoor grill and sat down to eat them with the spuds and a salad at the big oval table at the shallow end of the pool i was starving but i made a show of shoving my food around the plate and sipping morosely at my long flat red miles imports most of his booze from his home country he watched me for a while until eventually he leaned across towards me and punched me lightly on the shoulder i can see this has blown you right out of the water mate he began he was speaking slowly the tyrrells is heavy stuff me too i dont mind telling you i always thought primavera was a straight arrow and for her to go off with an arse hole like johnson that just makes it worse but you must not let it get you down he rapped the table with his knuckles hard enough to make him wince you have a future in our business buddy you were good in your first movie and better in the one weve just finished youre a natural actor oz blackstone and you could be a big star my advice is concentrate on your career and use it to get over what prims done to you i felt myself frown what career man i asked him okay ive made a couple of movies for you and im very grateful for the chance not to mention the money but my agent in london hasnt exactly been bombarding me with projects fuck him miles drawled earning a nod of disapproval from dawn well get you a real agent out here in california but even before that ive got a proposition to put to you i was going to talk to you about it in a couple of days but nows as good a time as any im making a sack of money from the last scottish project i knew this for myself i was on one per cent of the gross and up to that point id made one and a half million dollars so much in fact that im going back there for my next movie ill direct not act but dawn will have the female lead i want you in the secondguy role oh yeah i felt my ears prick up and my eyebrows rise what is it its a cop story based on one of a series of novels if it works out right it might even be the first in a series of movies wheres it set this is the bit youll like most of all its set in your old home town in edinburgh in two i made a show of thinking over miless offer of the edinburgh part i was even pretentious enough to ask to look at the script because of my grief he humoured me and i spent a few days at malibu reading it between teleconferences with greg mcphillips my lawyer in scotland and meetings with roscoe brown my brand new hollywood agent i briefed greg to draw up a legal separation from prim and a property settlement that was fair to us both yet left me well fixed financially he was gobsmacked when i told him of course hed known us both when we lived in glasgow and had played a significant part in our interesting lives his shock didnt stop him giving me some pretty sharp advice though and promising me his personal loyalty in the event that my ex decided to cut up rough i knew quite a bit about gregs practice having worked for him in the past and i reckoned that i was on my way to becoming his biggest private client roscoe brown was positive too miles sent him along to see me the day after prim dropped her bombshell he was a young black guy and he was offered to me as the coming player in the game i figured out why straight away the reek of sharpness coming from him was as strong as his eau sauvage i wasnt sure who was interviewing who sorry whom at our first meeting but whatever the truth of it was we both passed it took him three days to make me realise that i didnt have to go back to scotland he came back to see me on the following tuesday with offers of parts in three different projects two of them to be shot in the states and the third back in canada in vancouver this time he also brought with him an offer of a voiceover in a golf ball ad i admit that i went a bit hollywood when he tabled that one i thought it was a step back down the ladder until he showed me the money on offer it was enough to change my mind if its good enough for jack nicholson i told him its good enough for me when it came to choosing a movie roscoe was all for me staying in the states he told me what i knew already that sooner or later i had to cut the string that tried me to miles i heard him out but i decided that it would be later i would take the vancouver movie i said but first since the schedules allowed it i was going back home to shoot miless cop flick what i didnt tell him or anyone else least of all dawn and miles was that i had another reason for going back to scotland i had a promise to keep three i wasnt sure how id feel walking back into my old flat in glasgow it was part of a conversion of a classic nineteenthcentury building jan and i had bought it on a whim lured by its spectacular views across the heart of the city but it had brought us only a few months of happiness before it all went to ratshit i should have moved on straight after jans death but i didnt i was pretty numb at the time so i stayed there until it became home to prim and me as we renewed our ruptured relationship drifting eventually into our brief rancorous and disastrous marriage when i did sell it i had misgivings about the buyer call me superstitious if you like but if the fucking place was cursed as i thought i wasnt sure if i should take the risk of passing it on to her but she had insisted and when susie gantry digs in her heels it would take a pretty strong guy to deny her what shes after besides she offered me twentyfive per cent over valuation you cut it bloody fine she exclaimed as she opened the door that fair saturday morning but she was smiling big white teeth tan and freckles all framed by lustrous red hair she was right too although wed spoken about business a couple of times im a nonexecutive director of her company and exchanged a few text messages i hadnt seen susie since january eight months before shed been in fine shape then she still was only that shape was different for all she was wearing a big white housecoat you could tell shed filled out a bit so it seems i agreed as i stepped inside have you been hanging on for me not quite she answered but if you hadnt turned up this weekend i was going to get in touch with you officially im due a week on wednesday but when i saw my consultant last tuesday he was talking about inducing her a few days early her thats right pops the heir to the gantry empires going to be an heiress i wasnt sure how i felt about susie g when id first met her shed been going out with my copper pal mike dylan and her old man had been in his pomp as lord provost of glasgow neither of them were around any more mike had succumbed to a terminal case of greed and a policemans bullet while jack gantry had succumbed to several men in white coats whod taken him away to a place in the country with a very high fence topped off with razor wire after those misfortunes susie was left to rescue the family construction group from potential disaster which she did with a skill that made a nonsense of darwin and his theories not many people knew that jack wasnt her real father and many of those who didnt insisted that his business skills were in her blood the same sycophants passed over the fact that he was barking mad and that by their logic susie might have been too the business was all she had though that apart she had been a lonely wee lass when shed turned up on my doorstep in spain on the very day that prim had gone off to be with her sick mother she didnt stay lonely for long mind you i learned a lot in those few days most of it about myself i wont say that susie made me a better person but she sure as hell made me more honest with myself until then id gone through life subconsciously pretending to be like my father who is unquestionably the nicest man ive ever known macintosh blackstone does not have an enemy in the world and thats the truth made all the more amazing by the fact that hes a dentist the thing was that as his son i just assumed that everyone thought that the sun shone out of my arse as well everyone at school was my pal it didnt occur to me for years that in a small town no one in their right mind would have wanted to fall out with the local dentists lad and afterwards i was everyone elses i was good old oz short for osbert a laugh in itself the finest lad youd meet in a days march okay so my police career was so brief that afterwards i didnt even talk about it well were not all cut out for a disciplined service okay so i was a bit of a one for the ladies well we all sow our wild oats dont we okay so i was laid back to the point of indolence well we dont want to work any harder than we have to do we then i met primavera phillips my luck changed my life changed and somewhere along the line oz blackstone emerged from the chrysalis as the man who had been evolving someone who wasnt nice all the time but who stopped making excuses for his ruthlessness and his nastiness and who even enjoyed it on occasion i still think my dad is the greatest man in the world but i know now that hes too hard an act for me to follow actually i think the same thing may have dawned on my sister ellie since she dumped her apathetic husband shes turned into a midthirties raver and she loves every minute of it in time i would probably have worked all that stuff out without susie gantrys intervention but i thank her for it nonetheless she opened my eyes to me and she opened them to prim as well to what she was really like and what we were like as a couple as for what she taught me about herself lets just say that if the glimmer twins had met her theyd never have written you cant always get what you want on the other hand when steve winwood wrote while you see a chance take it susie saw me there on my own in spain and she knew me she was needing she saw her chance and she took it love had nothing to do with it as she said often enough susie doesnt love just as well i told myself neither does oz i liked her though i liked her frankness and i liked her honesty plus she was tremendous under the duvet she didnt turn up in spain with a game plan not one that involved banging me anyway if she had the baby probably wouldnt have been part of it but when she happened it just seemed right somehow it didnt alarm either of us and it didnt add to our expectations of each other we had sorted out our relationship by that time what are you going to call her i asked as i followed her into the big living space that i knew all too well what are we going to call her you mean shes your daughter as well or do you want to keep that a secret for prims sake theres no need for that were finished you havent left her have you she gasped i thought i caught an edge of concern in her voice one that had little to do with prim and more with the prospect of me as a single man you said you were going to try to make it work no i didnt i said i was going to go along with it at least until id finished the new movie with miles and no i havent left her i told her about nicky johnson and the mexican love nest serves you right i suppose she said when i was finished but with a smile no it serves him right thats not fair prims not a bad girl you treated her like shit on your shoe thats the truth of it so did you fucking someones husband on his honeymoon is not the act of a friend ah but i never said i liked her i laughed so youll not be calling the baby primavera then hell no actually i was thinking about calling her janet maybe jan for short i really did like her how would you feel about that i wanted to pick her up and hug her but i hung on to my cool one of my new life rules is never get emotional its the same as being drunk you tend to say things without a thought of the consequences right then i might just have asked susie to marry me and i couldnt have been certain shed have turned me down id feel fine i told her a considerable understatement i was hoping youd say that she smiled at me in a way she never had before i think i realised in that moment that what we had between us was the closest we were going to get to total happiness for the rest of our lives so what do you want to do now youre here she asked i scratched my chin well looking at the size of you i suppose a shagll be out of the question itd be a bit crowded she agreed in that case you pack an overnight bag ill have a shower a shave and whatever else then well drive sedately up to anstruther and see my dad and my stepmother sedately thats not like you girlie ive just flown in from los fuckin angeles so my body thinks its the middle of the night i can fool it for the rest of the day but please allow me just one piece of untypical behaviour she stepped up to me then stood on tiptoe and kissed me nothing you do is typical my love what did you call me oops she exclaimed sorry slip of the tongue wont happen again i promise okay well do it your way but how much have you told your dad ive told him the same as always everything hes up to date he knows prims gone he knows i was coming here and hes halfexpecting us he knows im that too the day i keep secrets from him im done susie grinned sometimes when she does that she can light up a room the day you keep secrets from me you might be done too listen she went on id offer to drive us but i have this problem with my feet just now i have to put the seat so far back to get behind the wheel that they dont reach the pedals she wasnt kidding either since id seen her last she had acquired a bmw sports coupe it was low slung and there was no graceful way she could lower herself into the passenger seat im not so sure about this she muttered as i drove carefully out of the parking area what do you mean i mean that id be nervous enough meeting your father but looking like this susie you havent been nervous since you were about ten and anyway youve met my dad before maybe but going up to him and saying hey mac ive got your granddaughter in here thats different thats a pretty fundamental statement sunshine my dad has two grandsons i reminded her hes bad enough with them but a girl hell think youre offering him the crown jewels i leaned on the accelerator as we turned on to the slip road to the m and had my first hint of the power under the bonnet ill have your crown jewels if you scrape this thing susie hissed i took her at her word and stuck to sedate as we cruised out of the city i played with the cd controls and found that ophelia by natalie merchant was lined up in the autochanger i was touched id bought that album for her in january but its late night music and wasnt best at that moment for my advancing jetlag i moved on to the next and found bob dylan lenny bruce is one of his greatest and angriest songs but theres a line in it thats pretty gross and not suitable for a lady in susies condition so i hit the button again quick and settled for blue views by paul carrack another of my january buys no said susie and moved back to where id begun i like that until that moment i didnt know she could sing the mother of my child is full of surprises she leaned back in her seat and let it all out wordperfect on each track her full rich contralto complementing rather than fighting with natalies sharp soprano i didnt say a word i just drove and listened as we cruised sedately out of glasgow and along the motorway that cuts lanarkshire in half smaller pieces would be even better a native of that county once said to me i didnt want her to stop but eventually she did during the long instrumental break on track four she smiled at me sorry she said almost shyly dont be would you like to make a record i could fix it i know you could and if i wanted to be sharleen spitieri thats who id be but i dont she leaned back again and picked up on track five with its simple piano backing leaving natalie in her wake as she embellished the song with some added twists that its writer never imagined she was into the last track singing about golden bells when she stopped abruptly i glanced sideways at her worried that maybe id looked as if i was nodding off she switched off the music do you think youre up to driving a wee bit less sedately probably but why she gasped and winced i could be wrong ive never done this before but i dont think im going to make it to your dads four for a while after that everything became a bit blurred ive been in a couple of dangerous situations in my time and ive managed to stay reasonably cool to keep thinking logically looking back on that day all i can remember saying is lets get you to the simpson its nearest after that my brain went into meltdown i drove that m like david coulthard with schumie on his tail while susie did all the sensible stuff like getting the number of the maternity unit and calling ahead to warn them words broke in susie saying calmly yes my waters have broken although that was not news to me by that time then there was something about less than a minute we got lucky on the outskirts of edinburgh i had to stop for a red light and i pulled up next to a police car i honked the horn the driver took one look and got the message we had a blues and twos escort all the way to the new royal infirmary even at that it was touch and go i drove right up to the door of the unit where a nurse hello dear im sister mickel a bit early are we and a porter were waiting for us with a wheelchair if it had had a motor it would have been revved up as the midwife helped her into the chair susie grunted christ oz shes coming faster than you somewhere behind me i heard a policeman laugh it got blurred again we were rushed along to a room with a funnyshaped bed nurses stripped susie just took all her clothes right off and stuck a gown over her head there was shouting all round go on thats a lass push hard now i realised that i was yelling as well and that someone was grasping my hand hard enough to crush it then all at once the pressure eased and there was a great collective gasp of satisfaction into which intruded a thin wavering cry sister mickel held her up a long sticky wet pink wriggly thing crying full volume now that she was fully released into the world i couldnt see her properly though i blinked and realised that my eyes q were full of tears i held on to susie my head between her breasts and let them all out the last time id cried had been when one janet had died now i wept for the birth of another cry for sad if you must but never be afraid to cry for happy its better well look at you i heard her say after a while susie as id never heard her before look at her oz shes just like you i did she was five dont you ever think about tomorrow son i gave that up a long time ago dad maybe you should start again what are you going to say to miles and dawn when they turn up in scotland for this new movie when they find out about the baby theyre going to run out of sympathy for you bloody quick that was a good question jetlag and the stress of the day were catching up with me fast so i gave my brain a few seconds more than normal to come up with a good answer i looked across the garden and out to sea it was early evening and may island bathed in sunshine seemed to be smiling at the life coast ive seen a few pretty spectacular things in my life but still i love that view more than any other its a doorway to so many memories and once the medical staff had pronounced susie and wee janet to be in the best of health and had bedded them down for their only night in the royal there had been nothing for me to do but carry on up the road to anstruther to add another to the list who says theyre going to find out i asked mac the dentist still looking out to sea through the kitchen window i heard the sound of rattling crockery as my stepmother resurrected the meal she had readied for earlier in the day there was a tension between mary and me i had expected it but it didnt make it any easier to take id been her blueeyed boy for a long time and she hadnt disguised the fact that she felt let down my dad gave a halfsnort halflaugh will the pram not give them a clue there wont be any pram around susie and the baby will be back in glasgow by the time they get here ill be in edinburgh were not planning to put a birth notice in the herald or the scotsman dad you might as well susies a prominent businesswoman and now shes become a single mother the tabloids are going to want to know who the father is and susies not going to tell them neither am i are you not going to acknowledge your child man of course i am i do already im just not making any public announcements thats all not yet at any rate not until the new movies well under way is that what youre saying if you like yes im contracted already so it would be bloody difficult for miles to fire me it would be a wee bit reckless of him too ive become box office to an extent still better safe than sorry once ive done this picture i can cut myself loose and look for other opportunities i have a couple of them in the bag already he frowned i surmised that he wasnt that pleased with me either so you have been planning ahead of course i have i flashed him a grin i might never think about tomorrow but im fucking good when it comes to next week youve changed osbert right enough for the worse no i wouldnt say that for the better in some ways for all your luck for all your success youve had too much grief in your life too young your eyes have been opened to the evils of the world okay youve grown hard and youre devious but you dont seem to be bitter and youre not living in the past youll survive and one day you might be happy again todays not bad i told him true he grinned i canna wait to see my new granddaughter i still wonder about you and her mother though is that it for the two of you your ships have bumped together in the night and now youre going your separate ways no thats not it ill be a good father to wee jan im on the board of the gantry group and ill be a support to susie that way but what if another father comes along what if susie meets someone else what if you do what if you find you miss prim after all i never did miss prim dad any more than she missed me really we settled for each other thats where we got it wrong im not going to do the same with susie if she meets someone else ill handle that ill protect my daughters interests but ill handle it aye son i guess you will in your own way like you handle everything else you know the thing that gets me about you i looked at him but he didnt give me the chance to hazard a guess youve never even had bloody toothache not once in your life toothache is natures way of letting the mightiest among us know that were fallible after all yet as far as i recall youve never had as much as a twinge dyou think jesus had it then maybe not but he had plenty in its place he stopped short and so i mustnt forget have you my father laid one of his massive hands on my shoulder dont be afraid of settling for susie son if you want to put it that way and if thats whats right for you you and prim should never have got back together and if id been up to my job id have told you that but you and jan should never have drifted apart and i kept that truth to myself too you and susie have this wee lass now and thats not a bad basis for a partnership thats not just up to me dad susies made her feelings clear maybe but its a whole new world now it changed about one oclock this afternoon when your daughter put in an appearance the great hand squeezed my shoulder hard theres just one thing i want to know if prim hadnt left you would you still be standing here right now telling me about your daughter i hadnt asked myself that question but i knew the answer at once yes if id had to make the choice i reckon i still would six mac the dentist was right about the tabloids was he ever we werent past the soup course before my cellphone played the yellow rose of texas it was susie sounding a lot less tired than i did the hospitals had a call from one of the sunday papers she said and i could hear the fizz in her voice theyve been tipped off about me having been rushed here and that it was you who did the rushing whod have done that oz she asked indignantly take your pick police hospital staff another patient it could have been anyone id bet on the porters myself but well never know for sure the newspaper will protect its source whos protected us were not entitled to protection at least im not what did the hospital tell them theyve referred the reporter to the trust press officer shes with me now and shes asking how we want to play it its decision time then what do you want to tell them thats up to you if you just want to say that youre a friend and you happened to be with me when the baby started to come thats okay by me it would be the sensible thing to do oz it was i knew that nobody at the hospital knew for sure that i was the father other than the people who had heard us in the delivery room and i reckoned they were bound by medical confidentiality if i played it that way there would be no comeback from susie ever no lawyer would allow the paper to say any different and miles would only find out if i chose to tell him there was only one problem i wont deny our daughter susie i found myself saying not for one second tell the press officer to give me the reporters phone number ill issue a statement through my lawyer saying what saying that youve had our baby that shes a wee cracker and that were both chuffed as hell she laughed i can just hear greg mcphillips reading that to the press word for word i promise you and whatll he say about the fact that youre still married the truth that prim and i havent been together for some time and that the last time i spoke to her she was in mexico with her new partner you sure you want to be that frank certain what about miles if he cant handle it fuck him mary frowned at me across the supper table i mouthed an apology indeed i will not susie chuckled you might be making a scarlet woman of me but im not going to live up to it hey i dont want to do that weve got things to talk about no we dont i can take care of myself i know that i didnt mean that shut up oz youre tired and emotional okay i will for now howre you feeling sore hows wee janet hungry lovely too look after her ill pick you both up tomorrow midday as arranged the only thing is were not going to be alone seven i was as right about that as my dad had been the day before there was a posse of reporters and photographers staking out the maternity unit when i drove up in susies car i recognised one bloke from my edinburgh days so i walked straight up to him being as showbiz as i could hi freddy i greeted him you guys expecting something not any more he answered as they crowded around me shoving mikes and tape recorders into my face youre a fucking dark horse big oz that wont be going out on radio i said the newspaper reporters grinned the woman from the local fm station scowled can we have a picture one of the photographers shouted you and miss gantry and the baby thats up to susie were going back to glasgow i was still amazed that maternity units let patients home so quickly these days i thought theyd have kept her in for a week maybe we could do something there wed rather do it now oz said freddy everest itll get the picture desks off our backs and yours for that matter we did what they wanted i had done some shopping for susie on the way in from life picking her up some normalsized gear since all she had packed for the weekend was maternity kit i have to say she looked terrific as good as any movie star ive ever met when we finally let the mob into her room she didnt look as good as janet gantry blackstone though dressed in a tiny gown id also found at the gyle centre and wrapped in my christening shawl which my dad had produced earlier that morning from the box in which it had been stored for thirty years the drive home to glasgow really was sedate susie sat in the back seat holding the baby as if she was made of nitroglycerine this time there was no music allowed although i dont think that bohemian rhapsody would have woken wee jan have you spoken to miles and dawn susie asked me out of the blue just as we passed harthill i called miles last night have you still got a career i laughed id been saving that one up i surely do he knew about you and me prim lied about that too she told me that shed said nothing to them about our thing because she didnt want to hurt my movie prospects that was rubbish of course as soon as she got back to the states she spilled the lot to miles and demanded that he fire me he told her that he never let personal things influence business decisions and he warned her not to say or do anything to upset dawn he was a bit pissed off that i hadnt trusted him enough to tell him myself but weve sorted that out well she muttered that was easier than you thought wasnt it i suppose so i was never really truly worried about that side of things but im glad its all out in the open me too susie paused tell me something oz if all this hadnt hit the press what would you have done about the baby you mean exactly what i have done in our own time maybe but id have gone public why i looked at her in the rearview mirror youre sitting there holding our daughter and you have to ask me that i just want to hear you say it okay because ive never been as proud of anything in my life as i am of being her father she threw me a dazzling smile good because there wont be any more you know this ones going to be a spoiled onlychild susie i began she could read my mind almost as well as jan was able dont go there oz dont give me the ill stand by you speech ive got everything planned out ill run the business mostly from home my managers and staff will have to get used to meeting me there ill have a livein nanny and domestic help someone to clean and someone to cater when i have working lunches and the like i dont need stood by lover especially not by someone like you youre just starryeyed over being a dad so dont go noble on me that shut me up in fact neither of us spoke until the charing cross turnoff what are you going to do while youre shooting this new movie susie asked me you mean where am i going to live yes i havent made my mind up i could take a suite in a hotel but i had enough of them in toronto so im going to look for a place to rent for the duration im not due there until the middle of next week though that being the case i thought i might bunk with you till then and use the time to get myself sorted out i looked at her in the mirror again or is that not a runner she grinned at me i think i can allow that the thought of sleeping with a movie star still has its attractions eight it was clear to me from the off that susie loved that apartment even if she had been ready and willing i saw that as a big obstacle to us getting together permanently since i couldnt conceive of myself wanting to lay down any roots there not again still our time together was fun while it lasted even if i found it difficult to concentrate on the script of the new movie a new baby is a bit like a quiet fart in that its presence pervades all the surrounding space a few months before wee janet hadnt been as much as a twitching in my loins never mind a gleam in my eye prim and i had muttered things about children but vaguely quietly as if we were each afraid the other might take us seriously my jan had been pregnant when she died prim had been pregnant too at one stage by someone else so each of us had our own mixed feelings even if they were unexplored and unspoken when susie and i had flung our fling i had made the classic male assumption that she was on the pill it had been years since a knotted condom had lain under my bed yet when she let me in on the truth i felt my heart take flight in my chest if prim had given me the same tidings it would have fallen like a stone id tried to explain my elation to myself but i couldnt and then wee jan was born and i understood things dont have to be conventionally right some just are she was perfect a doll growing more beautiful by the day as her face uncrumpled and her features began to define themselves both of her grandfathers came to visit my dad and joe donn susies natural father joe didnt quite know what to make of me but he made a fuss of the baby thats for sure i watched her all the time i watched susie feed her change her pampers dress her for the day settle her down for the night when she was asleep i couldnt stop myself from slipping into the nursery and standing there staring at her id always thought of myself as a clever bastard id just never realised how clever i was until her mother and i made her i was standing there on the wednesday after wed brought her home when i felt a small hand slip into mine susie stood beside me looking down just like me her mouth hanging open in a smile as gauche as mine joe donn had just headed back home to mother well and we were alone again with our child there wont be anyone else you know she whispered remember all that stuff i spouted back at the turn of the year about finding a titled twerp to give me a couple of kids and a place in the country that he could run with my money that was all crap ive got what i want so now i can piss off is that what youre saying no what im saying is that you can walk through that door any time you like and come back any time you like mmm i dont know if thatll work both ways i dont care as long as you provide accommodation suitable for janet when she comes to stay with her dad i dont care shell have a fulltime nanny as of next week and theyll arrive as a package i hadnt given any thought to that one in fact i hadnt given any thought to anything that might happen after the babys birth christ i murmured i dont even have accommodation suitable for me at the moment you still own the spanish villa dont you she was made there so where better for her to visit im selling that to scott steele hes been renting it for a while and he made me a good offer for it what have you got in america nothing the place where prim and i lived was leased and ive let it go if i was asked what my permanent address is right now id have to say that i dont have one i dont even have a car i sold those to scott as well susie stifled a chuckle oz blackstone millionaire vagrant look i mean it you have to have something im not having you take janet to some crappy rented condo okay lets do some supposing suppose you fancied coming to visit daddy with her to play families for a couple of weeks where would you like it to be anywhere safe where they speak english i gave her my arched eyebrows look what the fuck are you doing in glasgow in that case its disqualified on both counts she dug her nails into the palm of my hand janet started to stir and so we crept out of the nursery as quietly as we had come in how about life i asked her as she halfclosed the door behind us ive seen all these places but im still a fifer at heart my dads house has been lying virtually empty since ellie moved to st andrews i could take that over she patted my chest whatever makes you happy as long as its good enough for our daughter nothing will ever be good enough for our daughter she squeezed my fairly impressive triceps god help the lads when they come calling in that case indeed it takes one to know one susie grinned up at me slipped her arm through mine and led me along the hall howre you feeling now by the way i asked her still sore she stopped at the bedroom door not sos youd notice nine id left the edinburgh accommodation problem to greg mcphillips life is ironic he used to give me work now he was getting so much from me that hed almost become my personal assistant he called me on thursday morning with a proposition i know this chartered surveyor in edinburgh he began everybody knows a chartered fucking surveyor in edinburgh there are so many of them and especially in the city centre pubs but gregs a boy for long preambles so i let him stroll on the tale took a couple of twists before it settled down with a property developer who lived mostly offshore but retained a duplex apartment on top of a building which he had refurbished in the old town and which he was prepared to rent fully furnished of course to the right clients for the right amount of money greg hadnt seen it himself but his pal had assured him that the place was worth a look so i drove back to the capital that afternoon in susies m once again but giving it its head all the way this time subject to normal speed limits of course officer the surveyor a seriouslooking bespectacled guy named luke edgar met me on the pavement at the mound about halfway between the bank of scotland head office and the temporary home of the scottish parliament at first i had no idea where we were going but when he walked ten yards to an anonymous wooden front door i knew right away the building is probably the oldest surviving tenement in edinburgh and certainly the tallest it wasnt the cn tower as i looked up at it but it went pretty high by old town standards i knew the story it had been bought and tastefully refurbished by the developer a well known edinburgh guy with a celebrated midas touch and a reputation as the best spotter of opportunities in the business he had made a good job of the mound thats for sure the apartment towered over princes street and looked panoramically across the city west north and east i knew i was going to take it as soon as i walked through the door although i made a show of haggling with earnest edgar there was a big reception room downstairs i hit on that right away we could use it for cast meetings readthe roughs and even rehearsals i took a look at the kitchen everything was state of the art there were two bedrooms off the living area and two more upstairs a couple more than i needed but there would be plenty of room for a makeshift nursery if i could persuade susie to bring the baby through to see her dad at weekends to cap it all off there was a superb bang and olufsen sound system with speakers wired into every room in the place it didnt take long to do the deal gregs pal won the haggling hands down he didnt budge on his price and i caved in quick what the hell miles was picking up the tab anyway we shook hands on a threemonth lease with an option to extend on a monthbymonth basis if shooting overran and arranged that i would sign next day and move in whenever i liked i was pretty chuffed as i drove back through to glasgow i knew that susie would like the apartment and i was pretty confident that wed wind up playing house at weekends for a while at least life i thought was indeed a bowl of bloody cherries and great big red ones at that ten i persuaded susie to help me move in on the saturday and to stay over with the baby for the weekend shes always been very much a glaswegian and therefore pretty dismissive of edinburgh but when she saw the place even she was impressed youve got this thing about eyries havent you she said as she looked out across the mound your old flat in edinburgh was a loft then you bought the glasgow place which looks over everything and the villa in spain ill bet you had a view in california as well right i thought of the crashing pacific waves true i admitted its the way i was brought up rubbish she laughed its you blackstone youve either got a voyeuristic streak or its sheer paranoia youre afraid of the idea of anyone looking in on you i hadnt thought about it before but shed a point ive always liked high places i broke my arm once falling out of a tree not even that discouraged me i dont think im a voyeur as for being paranoid i said as i thought about recent events if i am its been justifiable a few times in my past you know that well enough a cloud crossed her face briefly i guessed who might have been behind it do you think about him much i asked her she chewed her lip mike i think about him as infrequently as i can possibly manage which is still quite a lot i envy you in one way when you think about jan you think warm i cant do that funny i dont feel bitter about jack gantry but i do about michael dylan then try not to mike was weak but most of us are he loved you no he didnt she snapped if he had hed have stayed with me and not got involved in all the stuff that got him killed and when that happened he was leaving me remember i couldnt argue with that one id been there and i knew she was right did you love him i asked her i thought so at the time but not now i really dont think ive ever loved anyone not till last saturday morning dont let him put you off susie ah but he has i wouldnt know where to begin loving a man all i want is to feel safe do you feel safe with me most of the time when were together i do i like being with you oz but ill never trust another man after mike and i sure as hell wouldnt trust you i know you too well how many women have you slept with since last january one she threw me a quick guilty grin ive misjudged you then sorry no you havent i never touched prim after what happened in spain neither of us wanted to she never forgot you and i never forgot barcelona there was someone else though someone in lescala but it was complicated it shouldnt have happened but it did im sorry you dont have to apologise to me remember youre a free man anyway whats complicated about nooky in this case the lady was married to the guy prim ran off with after she was tipped off about us i see you were all getting even then vero might have been but i wasnt you had shown me the real oz blackstone by that time youd taught me about myself completely devoid of conscience remember susie looked at me indignantly sounds as if i taught you too bloody well the look became a frown she doesnt do that too often but youve told me about her why you asked she snorted and you told me just like that do you think so little of me far from it i should have told you before it was a secret between us f why didnt you let it stay that way are you just trying to put me in my place i looked at her i had come clean without thinking but i knew why i had done it i told you because i didnt want it there any more its a part of my past that im not proud of and i didnt want it lying between us like a land mine i stepped up to her and put my hands on her waist you said you felt safe with me susie i want you always to feel that way and i promise you that you always will be her eyes softened so did her voice what does that mean she whispered i dont know just that you and the baby are now the two most important people in my life and it will stay that way i love wee janet with all my heart she turns my insides to mush and how could i love her without loving her mother as well she pressed her forehead against my chest and i held her to me shut up blackstone she murmured dont complicate things how am i doing that she looked up im afraid of you man dont you understand that im afraid that youll be another dylan he was a scheming ambitious bastard and so are you well ambitious at least mike didnt have the wit or the balls to achieve his ambitions but you do im afraid that if i commit myself to you those ambitions not to mention your heretofore extremely promiscuous dick will lead you away from me and ill get hurt again only worse youre wrong about me there i protested ive never had a properly thoughtout ambition in my life everything thats happened to me has been by accident until ive got where i am i like doing what im doing now i dont plan to do anything else until i go out of fashion by then ill have enough dough to enjoy a nice long retirement shit i have now and as far as my sorry our pal down theres concerned hes had a right few opportunities over the last few months in canada and in california and he hasnt risen to a single one she was smiling again i was happy about that are you telling me that from the time you went to the states at the end of january until last wednesday night you were celibate im afraid so that beggars belief why i wasnt sure until right now remember what you said the other night about me being able to walk back through your door any time i like remember i said that might not cut both ways well it does i dont want anyone but you one of those long silences sprang up between us like a barrier until susie knocked it down is that so well do you remember when i said i didnt care if you did or not that wasnt exactly true either i care all right youre not going to make me say i love you but i care she pushed me away and held me at arms length that doesnt mean i trust you mind when the baby and i go back to glasgow youll be a boyabouttown again itll be just like it was when you were here before youre on probation oz i want to make damn sure you dont revert to type before i start believing any promises her eyes narrowed you will be honest with me yes mine widened totally i meant it ill believe that much then we tell each other everything when youre working here we spend as many weekends as we can together agreed agreed what happens when this pictures finished im going to vancouver you and janet coming well see about that if we get that far eleven i wasnt one hundred per cent sure what wed agreed when susie took the baby back to glasgow the following night to be ready for the arrival of the nanny next day i knew that whatever it was i liked the idea and i felt more at peace than i had done since jan had died i knew also that id better get my head around miless new movie since there wasnt that much time left obviously id skimmed through the script before id taken the part the story was fastmoving and exciting with a slambang climax set in some familiar locations in and around edinburgh and i decided to read the book to get myself under the skin of my character the hero was a senior police detective called bob skinner a real hard bastard i was playing his sidekick a guy around my own age by the name of andy martin the first thing i read about martin pulled me up short the author described him as muscular i could manage that okay given the gym work i was in the habit of doing and as having curly blond hair and green contact lenses the dye job i could live with but i saw a problem with the contacts i cant stand having even a tiny piece of grit in my eye i was sufficiently worried to call miles the apartment came complete with a phone and cable television he laughed when i told him about my problem you say youre okay about the dye job did you ever see the remake of the jackal christ you might not be flavour of the month with dawn right now but i still wouldnt do that to you you can forget the contacts too dark hair and blue eyes will do for the part hows tricks anyway his amiability reassured me miles had given me an easy time of it as director of my first two projects i didnt know if i could handle it if he started to have a go at me on set fine everythings fine how are the girls the babys great and sos her mum susies going back to work herself in a couple of days once the new nannys settled in nothing changes eh shes a powerhouse that girl you two gonna live together parttime probably ive rented a place in edinburgh thats where i am now youll like it i think i described the apartment sounds great miles said when i had finished youre right i plan to shoot as much of this movie as possible on location so well need a place for rehearsals team meetings and so on in fact theres one ill set up right away ive hired a technical adviser an expoliceman hes got the script and he knows the book i want him to brief the cast before we start shooting but first i want to meet him myself your place will bg perfect for that dawn and i get into edinburgh on wednesday ill arrange it for thursday morning ten sharp then well have a cast meeting that afternoon gimme the address and phone number and ill circulate them to him and everyone else i did as he asked then went back to the book the more i read about the now darkhaired andy martin the more i realised how tough he was supposed to be i hadnt lifted anything heavier than susie for ten days so i called the edinburgh club the best fitness centre in town and checked out their opening hours i booked myself in for monday morning then went back to detective chief inspector martin id have read it from cover to cover had i not begun to feel hungry at around seven oclock i checked the fridge and found it almost bare apart from some milk a few tomatoes and an egg i was almost out of bread too susie and i had only picked up a few groceries and had sent out for pizza the night before i was also out of transport a car can be an inconvenience in central edinburgh but these days not having one is a bigger inconvenience still i had almost decided to take a taxi to sainsburys when the obvious occurred to me i was a lad alone in the city where else would i go i hadnt seen ali in a couple of years but i knew hed be there the boy really was open all hours his shop was a bit more than halfway down the royal mile round the corner from my old loft and still no more than ten minutes walk from my new digs he was behind the counter when i walked in his back to the door as i closed it silently as usual he was wearing a turban if it was meant to be white it wasnt so i gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided that it was cream i dont know what religion ali is and ive never asked i do know that with him the turban is a fashion statement nothing more shop i called out he spun round eyes widening as he saw me hey he yelled startling an old lady who was peering into the frozen food container its the fuckin oz man the fuckin movie star hullawrerr big man slummin it the night eh of all the bastards eh as well as being one of the most accessible grocers in scotland my old friend is also one of the most foulmouthed the old lady looked at me briefly sniffed and went back to perusing the frozen peas i recognised her vaguely from the old days in the lounge bar in the pub down the road ah saw you wir back in town ali proclaimed he sells newspapers so that came as no surprise fuckin big dark horse you eh you dont jist dip yer wick no you you dip it in the richest bird in glesca some man right enough hows the wean onyway my daughter is very well thank you ali eight days old and growing more lovely with every passing moment more than i can say for yourself hey there hey there he bellowed in an almost cautionary tone where did you get the patter you might be a big shite now blackstone but i kent you when you were just a barn pot round the corner i smiled at him happily aye and you still are he reached across and cuffed me lightly round the ear ach away wi ye he looked me up and down as he rang up a packet of birds eye fish fingers and a box of mccains microchips for the old lady you put on a bit o weight he asked ive muscled up a bit i work out you onna steroids nah i felt myself lapsing into alispeak all protein and weights speaking of protein gimme a pound of lome sausage half a dozen eggs and four rolls ill take some beer as well and a pint of milk between us we filled a box with enough food to keep me

she had you by the bas thats for sure on and off ali on and off its all over now though jist as well oh by the way another bird was asking after you member that lassie you went out wi a few years back

get out of here or ahll be talkin like you all fucking week see you i picked up the box making sure that my tins of lager were packed tight and made a sharp exit twelve ive looked all over canada and california for anything that even approximates to the square sliced lome sausage that my pal in the royal mile has stocked for years ive never struck it lucky though north americans seem to go for quantity not quality i had been looking forward to a good fryup since id known that i was coming home to edinburgh there had been no chance at susies since she was watching what she ate both for the babys sake and her own i called her once id demolished my supper and a can of harp the flat seemed empty without her and the baby i pondered on the fact that here was i back in what i regarded as my home city shacked up in the sort of pad id dreamed about back in the old days and i was bloody lonely not the sort of allembracing loneliness that had engulfed me after jan died nor the vague sort from my twenties when i was between steady women but a sharp biting feeling that i found unsettling even when i was indulging myself with my spicy supper hows the baby i asked as soon as she picked up the phone perfect as always she answered with a chuckle dont worry oz i really can look after her you know i know but i miss her im sure she misses you too but im not going to waken her to ask her i miss you a bit as well of course glad to hear it let me know when you miss me a lot now go on out for a chinky or something i dont need to i told her about my visit to ali and laid it on thick about the sausage stop it she said youve got me salivating i love square sausage too if its that good then next time you come through you can bring me some now bugger off and amuse yourself for a while im in the middle of getting things ready for the nanny i said goodnight and went back to the skinner book the story hooked me good and proper apart from cracking another can of lager i didnt put it down until id reached the explosive conclusion by that time id got to know andy martin pretty well and i was beginning to look forward to bringing him to life for the first time since id left the states i began to think hard about where i was going with the movie and how it would be different from the first two parts id played actually there was something id never told miles it wouldnt be the first time i had played a detective in our middle and senior years at waid academy in anstruther jan and i had joined the school drama club wed worked our way up to the leading parts and had got ourselves some decent reveiws albeit only in the east life mail we were pretty used to the greasepaint by the time we left for edinburgh but although we threatened to join the university theatre society other things like study and sex got in the way i had enjoyed those school day plays though i never had any inhibitions as a kid shy is a word that has never been used to describe me and i didnt have any trouble getting up there on stage and performing i never had any trouble learning lines either i was able to read the script a couple of times and my own part stuck i could even prompt my fellow amateur thesps on the frequent occasions when they dried up our acting highlight jans and mine came when our group took part in a county drama competition and lifted the trophy one of the judges was a scottish television producer who thought enough of us to offer us parts there and then as gormless country teenagers in a forthcoming taggart episode filming clashed with the runup to our highers exams though so we were forced to turn him and his money down when miles gave me my first screen test somehow it had all come back hes still quite chuffed that hes taken a complete beginner and turned him into a feature player and ive never got round to explaining that it wasnt quite that way i laid down the book and picked up the script and looked at the cast list it was impressive and i felt privileged that my name was on it right at its head was ewan capperauld undoubtedly scotlands best known movie actor apart that is from old i had seen him many a time in the television series that had launched his career and in most of his films miles had worked with him before having cast him for a ton of money in a key cameo part in his remake of kidnapped a couple of years earlier that film had been dawns big breakthrough in more ways than one the other feature parts would be played by my old chum scott steele who more or less cast himself as chief constable james proud by bill massey a smooth english actor who would be perfect as the bad guy by rhona waitrose an upandcoming young scot with big eyes and bouncy hair just like skinners daughter in the book and by masahi katayama a celebrated japanese actor who had one of the key roles and who would give the project added international appeal i knew scott well and dawn of course in a professional as well as a family sense and was comfortable with them but the idea of working with the others started the hamster running around in my stomach i didnt worry about it too much though id been in the business long enough to know that every performer has some nerves those who do best are those who overcome them best and so far id managed there was one other guy on the cast list who would give the movie added value and might widen its audience one of the minor roles was a halfirish halfitalian detective called mario mcguire id persuaded miles to give a test to my friend liam matthews one of the stars of the global wrestling alliance where id cut my television teeth as ring announcer all wrestlers these days are partactor as well and so he had sailed through his major contribution to the story would be to get shot at the end but no one can fake being hit like liam i was smiling at the thought when the phone rang so far only susie my dad and miles had the number but id put my cellphone on divert when id come back in i picked it up liam must have known id been thinking about him howre you doing i asked him word perfect yet christ man its hardly going to take me long ive only got about ten lines then i go down in this big gunfight im not exactly playing hamlet no but you get your leg over and thats more than he does true it has its compensations actually im a bit worried about that what do you mean well when she gets her kit off what if i sort of you know what i mean man become aroused you mean thats the polite term yes try to think of something else like jerry gradi throwing your arse across the ring mmm it might take more than that depending on the ladys appearance look man i told him its not a problem they put something in your tea thats what happened in toronto he bought it christ man are you fucking serious how long does it take to wear off not long after a couple of weeks you should see the first signs of life i heard him gasp a couple of weeks he stopped fuck it i think ill just wear baggy pyjamas when i stopped laughing i asked him why he had called to wish you all the best he began to ask after your new child who is all over the funny papers you never do anything conventional pal do you and to pass on a message whats that the office took a call today while we were all on the way back from a show in cardiff it was a girl and she was looking for you she said her name was alison goodchild and that she was an old friend of yours she said she needs to get in touch with you and that its urgent liam paused you havent got another one up the duff have you we took great pains not to do that i told him but that was a few years back now did they take a number yes he read it out after i had grabbed a pen it was a mobile not a landline she asked if you could send her a text message she said she doesnt like speaking on the thing funny i thought then i remembered that alison had always been a touch weird if it makes her happy ill do that have you been told about the cast meeting yet no whens that i gave him the date and time and told him how to find the apartment see you thursday sure hey were you serious about the stuff in your tea nah did you mean it about the baggy pyjamas what do you think a pair of boxers is probably all youll need i hung up and thought of alison our thing had been doomed from the start i could never take her as seriously as she had taken herself i used to call her tomorrow she thought it was after the song tomorrow belongs to me but actually it was because she never came eventually i found someone who did and that was that okay i was a rat in those days i admit it i looked at the number liam had given me then i switched on my mobile and keyed in a text message giving her my landline number and inviting her to call me i switched on the telly and was getting into david attenborough telling me how important field mice are to the ecosystem when my cellphone bleeped twice to tell me that i had an incoming text message i accessed it and read cant phone can we meet strange i thought but i sent back ok where when two minutes later i bleeped again tonight cafe royal i read i frowned i was getting into those field mice and there was a rerun of the afternoons premiership match on sky afterwards also i didnt fancy the cafe royal its always busy and im at the stage of being recognised and accosted by punters i dont know i dont mind but they can be hard to shake loose so i thought about it then sent another message time okay but not cr george hotel bar i waited only partly focused on the mice it took her less than a minute this time ok c u there is no doubt about it text messaging is changing the face of the english language as it is rote thirteen the great thing about my new temporary home was that it was less than ten minutes walk from anywhere in central edinburgh as i had hoped the george hotel bar was quiet there were a couple of japanese tourists and a table of loud american golfers but otherwise only the barman and me he had just finished pouring what looked like a perfect pint of lager when alison goodchild appeared in the doorway at least i guessed it was alison when we had been together she had been a thin pale understated wee thing with poorly cut midbrown hair little or no makeup and a bad habit of catalogue shopping for clothes in fact when id been watching attenboroughs mice she had come to mind this woman had changed and how her hair was shoulderlength shiny and honeycoloured highheeled blue patent shoes made her look a few inches taller and her clothes were closer to gianni versace than great universal other things were different too she wore eye makeup and either she had switched to wonderbra or shed been enlarged still it had been a while id changed too i guessed i waved to her then glanced at my reflection in the bar mirror i was bigger in the shoulders than a couple of years before and there were grey flecks in my sideburns and lines around my eyes that would be new to her my clothes were much the same though even if i was wearing lacoste jeans rather than the wranglers of old and my jacket was antelope rather than cowhide vodka and tonic i asked her as she approached my memory was spot on because she smiled and nodded the smile was new as well where before it had been hesitant and a little pinched to hide her slightly undersized teeth now it was wide and open i realised that shed had them all expertly crowned you can tell these things when your old mans a dentist thanks she said but slimline please and just a spot of lime juice rather than lemon the barman nodded and told us that if wed like to go to a table hed bring the drinks over i dropped a tenner on the counter i was pretty sure than a fiver wouldnt have been enough i looked around for a spot as far away from the japanese and especially the yanks as we could get as i did a chunk of their discussion floated over hey one of them called out intending that the whole bar should hear hey did you guys hear that the republican party is changing its symbol from an elephant to a condom its perfect see a condom stands up to inflation halts production destroys the next generation protects a bunch of pricks and gives one a sense of security while screwing others i threw the guy a sad bastard look and steered alison towards a table under the window she eyed me up and down as i settled into an armchair you look just the same she said check your contacts honey i told her i dont she shook her head oh youre older sure and theres a harder edge to you more serious but essentially youre just the same i dont know maybe i thought there would be sparks shooting off you now youre famous but there arent i still pee standing up i said i hope you hit the bowl more often she murmured now that definitely was not the old alison so tell me about you she went on ive read the odd article about you but they werent very informative what have you been doing since you and i split up apart from becoming a film star that is im not a star i corrected her ive taken to acting and ive been lucky to have made a couple of movies but ill never be top billing apart from that ive just been living a life ive been married widowed and married again now im in the process of getting divorced and ive just had a child by a woman i dont live with thats it her face fell a little i wondered if she had pumped herself up somehow for our meeting i knew the last part she said that was in all the sundays last weekend but i didnt know youd been widowed im sorry oz its not something i discuss with journalists what happened i dont like to discuss it with anyone now tell me about you for you very definitely have changed for the better she asked i dont know yet i dont know anything i dont even know why im here ill come to that okay about me ive you to thank for it in a way why for chucking me you were as nice as you could be when you did it of course but you still left me feeling that id bored you to tears so i took a look at myself and when i did i realised that i bored even me i looked like a bloody sunday school teacher i was hiding a pretty good body in drab awful clothes and i didnt even have the confidence to smile properly she paused as the barman arrived with our drinks and my change even less than id expected plus she said quietly as she picked up her vodka i wasnt any better when the lights were out not that you were any great shakes yourself mind you all cock no technique that was you thank you very much maam i muttered into my lager dont take it to heart we didnt really interest each other so we didnt try very hard thats the truth of it i thought about it she was probably right anyway she went on i gave myself a makeover i started with my teeth then my hair and then my wardrobe i chucked my job too remember i worked in the scottish office information department yes well i left and got myself a job as an accounts manager with a public relations company i did very well there and was promoted after a couple of years i also got myself a fiance he worked for a rival firm so we didnt announce our engagement in case our respective bosses didnt like the idea but we couldnt keep it secret forever neither of us was fired when it became public knowledge but our client lists were scrutinised to make sure there was no conflict i was taken off one account as a result and i wasnt allowed on new business pitches in case i wound up competing with david it wasnt an ideal situation for either of us so we did the obvious thing we both quit and set up on our own as she told me her tale i sensed something else that was new about her she seemed to be brittle inside in a way she never had been before the old alison might have been quiet serious and ultimately boring but she had never been nervous or anything approaching highly strung yet that was coming across the table in waves so how did it go i asked as she paused for refreshments very well she replied we called ourselves goodchild capperauld she picked up on my frown at once his cousin she said forestalling my question does the name help in business it does until the prospects see the letterhead and realise it isnt him still no it doesnt work that way he and ewan dont get on davids younger by about ten years so they werent close as children then something happened between them when david was at university and they havent spoken since let me guess it involved a girl naturally she was a student too david was going out with her and he took her to ewans younger sisters wedding big mistake its worked out okay for you though i glanced at her left hand as she picked up her glass again there were no rings curious are you mrs capperauld now i was going to be she answered we were going to get married last year but we had so much business that we postponed it we took on three new clients and set up a lobbying division to help people put their cases to the scottish executive first things first eh its not like that she said defensively we love each other lucky you and you get your priorities right too we think so im not disagreeing with you now before you eat the rest of that vodka and the glass as well do you want to tell me what this is about youre in love ive got a new baby we could have said all this over the phone but you wanted to meet me why for a moment the old alison seemed to creep out from behind the teeth the hair and the makeup i want to ask for a favour she murmured i shrugged my shoulders she gathered her confidence around her sat up in her chair and went on i have a client who runs an office equipment business his name is james torrent i recognised it from vans i had seen around town in edinburgh and glasgow he supplies everything other than stationery furniture fittings computers photocopiers the lot its a really big company mr torrent plans to go public in a year but first hes moving into new corporate headquarters on the outskirts of edinburgh near the airport hes a very important client for us our biggest in fact but the thing is hes very difficult to deal with what he wants he gets and if you cant give it to him youre out fired no appeal thats it my problem is that when we got the business part of my pitch said that we would arrange a big opening ceremony for the new headquarters and that we would have a national celebrity to cut the tape thats where i was hoping i gasped i couldnt help it you want me to open this guys office she flushed and let out a nervous sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a cough well not exactly i mean it would be great if you could come on the day as well but the thing is mr torrent wants ewan to perform the ceremony in fact hes told me that if i cant get him to do it hell give his business to another company he means it too it would be a disaster for us oz if we lost that account so quickly hes our biggest client and word would get around the marketplace like wildfire on top of that he owes us quite a bit of money hes a very slow payer and i reckon that if he fires us well never see any of it weve bought in things for him printed material high quality photography and weve paid our suppliers already we could go bellyup if he defaults on us i had a sudden vision of alison bellyup i also guessed what she was leading up to but i played it out i see your problem so how do you want me to help i can think of one way remember that guy liam at gwa who gave you my number he could pay your man torrent a visit with a couple of the boys you might not keep the business but youd get your money even if it did have blood and snot all over it lets hope it doesnt come to that she said gloomily im not so sure they could frighten this man though youve never met big jerry i laughed to myself at the thought of my enormous friend but if thats not a runner do you want me to introduce you to a good lawyer my guy greg would sue him for you im sure that would take too long the banks getting twitchy about our overdraft as it is no oz what im hoping is that youll agree to approach ewan on our behalf my guess had been spot on christ alison i dont even know the guy why cant you ask him okay so he pinched your boyfriends bird once big deal if you talk to him he might fancy his chances of doing it again thats one reason why i cant she shot back but it goes deeper than that ewan does not like his name being over the door of our company he wrote to us and asked us to call ourselves something else but david wouldnt hear of it he cant do anything about it i mean he doesnt hold the copyright on it or anything but his father told davids father that ewan thinks were cashing in on his fame and hes furious about it even davids father and uncle arent speaking now because of it no i cant talk to him it would be difficult even if david would let me help me oz youre our only hope fuck me you sound just like carrie fisher in star wars listen i may have entered jedi as my religion on the last census form but it doesnt mean i am one im a supporting actor he is big time ive got no grease with the man hell barely even say hello to me on set oz you could talk anybody into anything if you put your mind to it my god you talked your way into me and no one had done that before i raised an eyebrow oh yeah you reckon i could do it again then she looked at me over her glass i saw that her hand was trembling very slightly if thats what it takes to get you to talk to ewan she whispered i nodded towards the door in advance okay i turned to the barman and made a two more sign you can relax i told her you dont have to shag me into it ill talk to him for you ill do more than that if capperauld tells me to piss off ill ask miles grayson to do it mr torrent will not turn him down i guarantee you her face lit up it reminded me of the time i gave her a week in playa del ingles for christmas hey big spender you will youre wonderful oz i knew i could rely on you hell lets go to your place ill sleep with you anyway i laughed you must be really attached to that fiance of yours never mind him this is a special occasion we can call it for old times sake my dear bitter experience has taught me that going over old ground for the sake of it is always a bad idea if it wasnt right then it wouldnt be right now and anyway although i am astonished to hear myself say this i cant the way she smiled at me made me feel good the girl in glasgow the one who had your baby i nodded what are you doing in edinburgh then taking things one step at a time is it really her or is it the baby until now id have said it was wee jan but the truth is its her too im happy for you dont be not yet it might not work just let me be happy for you a cloud crossed her face as the barman put down two more drinks on the table i gave him another tenner and told him to keep the change whats up i asked as he left you not so sure about him any more i was ready to go to bed with you wasnt i millions are has the business got more important than him is that it it could be that way with susie and me you know up to now her companys been her life theres a lot of adjusting to be done maybe probably yes but thats not whats wrong or not all of it at any rate its david i dont know where he is what do you mean have you looked under the bed im serious anyway we dont live together no i havent seen him for nearly a week he hasnt been into the office since monday and he hasnt been answering the phone at home i went round to see him on wednesday and then again on friday but he wasnt in either time has he done this before alison shook her head no never hes mr reliable usually i dont know what to make of it one of two things id guess hes either lost his nerve over this problem client of yours and done a runner or hell turn up tomorrow morning smelling very faintly of a fragrance which is not on your dressing table she pouted he wouldnt do either of those things you were ready to do the second why shouldnt he be whats his phone number she recited it i took out my mobile punched it in and handed it to her she listened for a while then shook her head answering machine doesnt mean hes not there i do that all the time where does he live in union street opposite the playhouse theatre why lets go there now the two of us and thump on his door i couldnt do that you did already yes but not with you hell answer the door if hes in there and i thump it if hes got a bird in there hes hardly going to open it if he thinks its you is he she killed half of her second drink i suppose not okay lets do it but if he has got someone with him will you at least pretend that youre sleeping with me how big is he about half your size okay fourteen david capperauld lived in a maindoor flat that means that it opened directly on to the street no lights were showing in the livingroom window or in the glass panel above the front door it didnt look promising but it had been my daft idea and alison was pumped up to doit the playhouse was emptying its audience into the night when our taxi dropped us at the end of union street i didnt particularly want a large crowd to see me hammering on a door so we slipped into giulianos for a coffee to give them time to disperse and to allow me to lose some of that beer eventually we judged it to be quiet enough for us to go back capperaulds door was as solid and impressive as the rest of the building he could be inside there and moving around and we wouldnt hear him through it i made alison stand to one side so she couldnt be seen though the spyglass then i rang the bell as we expected there was no answer there was a big blackpainted knocker halfway up the door i grabbed it and thumped it as hard as i could then i did it again and again and again if there had been anyone inside he wouldnt have stood for that nah i told her your boyfriend has definitely done a runner her face seemed to crumple she was on the edge of tears but its not like him davids a decent guy he wouldnt run away and leave me to sort out the torrent mess he just wouldnt she looked at me with fear in her eyes she was the mouse again oz do you think we should go in i looked at her then at the door then back at her as if she was daft im not kicking that fucking thing in do you see how thick it is you dont have to ive got a key jesus the night had turned sharp and cold my breath came out as a cloud of steam now you bloody tell me after weve wakened half the street is this what you wanted to do all along only you wanted someone with you she sniffed i suppose so well bloody do it then get in there see if there are any clues to where the boy might have gone leave him an angry note and lets be done with it alison nodded and fished a brass key from her bag the lock was a complicated fivelever job with deadbolts built in for added security when she turned the key it sounded like she was opening a cell she pushed the door and stepped inside with me at her heels feeling more useless and awkward by the second david she called out nervously david are you here the place was pitch black and deadly still no hes fucking not i snapped at her impatience is not one of my usual faults but i had had enough for the night switch on a light and take a look around she reached over to the wall and felt for the switch eventually she found it and in an instant the hall was light fucking hell i heard myself exclaim the floor was tiled not carpeted from that and the solidity of the plaster work and door frames i guessed that the house had either been restored to its original condition or had never altered in the two hundred or so years since it was built the thing that lay at our feet was definitely not an original fitting he was face down his right arm stretched out as if it was pointing to something and his left was by his side his toes were tucked in sort of pointing at each other he hadnt been a very big bloke but a bit more than half my size as alison had said she gave a sudden mewling sound that was half scream half cry of fear and seemed to stagger then she turned as if to run i caught her and held her she looked down at him again her eyes wide with fear i was aware of a puddle forming on the floor david yes i asked her she couldnt speak she could only barely nod i held on to her until i was sure she could stand then let her go and went back to close the door taking care not to kneel on any wet bits i crouched down beside david capperauld and went through the formality of feeling for a pulse in his neck but he was stone cold to the touch so i wasnt going to find one without moving him i took a look at his face it was almost purple and he was staring wideeyed to one side i could see no signs of violence whats happened alison whimpered i cant say for sure but he might have had a heart attack or a cerebral haemorrhage but hes only twentynine it happens how long has he been love i only know a bit of first aid itll take a pathologist to tell you that i did notice though that we hadnt smelled anything unusual when wed stepped into the hall right at that moment all i could smell was pee so could alison she tottered off towards what i guessed was the bathroom i stood there looking down at capperauld looking for anything that might tell me what had happened to him but seeing nothing when alison reappeared around ten minutes later she was barefoot and wearing a mans dressing gown knotted tightly around her waist she was redeyed and she had scrubbed off her makeup apart from the hair she looked just as she had in the old days what do we do she asked me her voice still shaky i wanted to tell her that she would call the police and i would get the fuck out of there i didnt need any more publicity and certainly not like this i couldnt do it though i didnt answer her instead i took out my mobile and called directory enquiries they gave me the number of the gayfield square police office there was no background noise when they answered a quiet night i guessed it was time to liven it up i want to report a sudden death i told the officer on the other end of the line well need a doctor and an ambulance in due course i gave him the address and the name of the occupant and told him that the mans fiancee and i had just found him are you sure hes dead the young constable asked i threw him the line from the friends of eddie coyle if he isnt he never will be the boy didnt laugh why should he have it wasnt funny fifteen i woke up dazed and confused the phone was ringing beside my head and i had just emerged from a weird dream involving a stiff in a new town flat a girl pissing herself with fright only i realised it hadnt been a dream i picked up the phone and mumbled into it you lazy so and so i heard susie exclaim do you know what time it is no i answered truthfully half past nine did you go on the batter last night dont ask about last night she laughed like a bell that bad was it i pulled myself up in bed and told her the whole story oh the poor girl susie squealed when i told her about finding david capperauld it must have scared the life out of her it scared something out of her thats for sure did you get the police of course and a doctor and a wagon for the morgue will you be in the papers again my name wont be mentioned the guy who came round was a detective sergeant called ron morrow i met him once hes a good lad said hed leave me out of his report what did the doctor say much the same as me she said she couldnt be sure but that it looked like a cerebral incident rare but not unknown in a guy of that age theyll know for certain once theyve done an autopsy whens that going to happen i dont know today i guess wheres the girl now did you take her back to your place did i hell as like she phoned her mother and told her what had happened the police took her there mmm susie murmured i thought youd have bsen there with a consoling shoulder shes better at her mothers besides besides what nothing hows the baby she kept me awake half the night but other than that shes perfect ethels here now ethel ethel reid the new nanny she arrived at nine sharp and shes taken over already ah but can she breastfeed i shouldnt think so shes about fifty but were going to get janet on to the bottle quite soon have you thought that through absolutely im going back to work remember im a builder oz thats what i do its the world i live in and i am not repeat not whipping out a tit halfway through a meeting with my site managers no i conceded i can see that might distract them you might have houses being built in inches rather than centimetres was than an oblique reference to the size of my bosom not so oblique theyre pretty spectacular just now you have to admit enjoy while you can i paused if thats an invitation i thought i might come through tonight why i have to see greg mcphillips about the divorce arrangements so i thought id fit it in this afternoon i paused also am i allowed to say im missing you you are since i feel a bit that way myself see you later then okay you can take me out to dinner ive got a sudden urge to get dolled up in normalsized clothes i havent been able to do that for months i hung up swung myself out of bed and lurched into the shower half an hour later after finishing off the lome sausage and the last couple of rolls i began to feel human again i was looking out over the city getting ready to go to the edinburgh club when the phone rang once more it was alison she sounded sad but together i want to thank you for last night she said if i had gone in there on my own its okay you dont have to thank me you surprised me you know she murmured the way you handled it theres more to you than i ever realised i didnt tell her but ive seen things that were a hell of a lot more grisly than her late fiance for some reason i found myself thinking of a man called ramon fortunate i suppose losing your wife must have had an effect on you i understand that now being in the same boat myself i felt my forehead bunch into a savage frown brain first mouth second blackstone i tried to tell myself but i was too late what i said actually it was more of a snarl was david pregnant too youre not even on the same fucking ocean as me never mind in the same boat you were ready to screw me last night remember if id said the word wed have been at my place not his dont oz she pleaded and the wail in her voice got to me at once ive been torturing myself about that all night okay okay im sorry that was brutal of me but i still cant talk about that i never will i understand thats all i understand yeah truce good she paused about that thing we discussed last night she was back to business already she took my breath away torrent yes will you still do what you said of course i will ewan might feel a bit guilty now hell probably be a soft touch maybe we should forget him and just go with miles grayson youre right mr torrent would love that no i told her miles is fallback you stick with ewan capperauld if you can get him all right whenll you do it this week i hope i expect to meet him on thursday ill call you at your office when ive got something to tell you i take it youll be going to work regardless i have to theres no choice suppose not ill call thanks goodbye she hung up and left me shaking my head i hadnt understood alison before and i sure as hell didnt now her call had left me keener than ever to get into a gym so i caught a taxi on the mound and went straight to the club i signed up for a shortterm membership and let the instructor show me round the equipment although there was nothing there i hadnt used many times before i had a lot to get out of my system so once i had warmed up with a few hundred situps i benchpressed a shitload of weight first legs then arms in increasingly large lumps once i was through with that i worked my way around the rest of the machinery in my usual pattern and finished off with a tough twenty minutes on the exercise bike if ah the grocer could see me now i gasped as finally i swung off i hadnt been a total stranger to physical exercise on my last sojourn in edinburgh but we hadnt been the best of pals either once i had showered for the second time that morning i walked back up to princes street picked up some lunch in marks spencers food hall and made my way home via the national gallery which stands at the foot of the mound it isnt the biggest in britain but its one of the best and its always been one of my favourite places to chill out after id eaten i decided to do some more work on my script thursday was looming up i didnt know it but so was something else i worked for nearly an hour looking at my scenes and going through them in my head at first then aloud my own very early rehearsal process eventually i decreed a coffee break and headed for the kitchen when the door buzzer sounded it took me a second or two to figure out what it was then another few to figure out where i was puzzled as i reached out for it too late to stop it from buzzing again apart from susie and miles and neither of them were in town nobody knew i was there i guessed it had to be luke edgar i picked up the instrument hello i said tentatively hello blackstone a deep voice boomed in my ear guess what its a blast from your past it sure was and one that i had hoped with all my heart would stay there sixteen i could have left the bastard stood there in the street but if he was determined id only have been postponing the moment so i let him in and told him to take the lift all the way up to the top i left the front door open for him he strolled into my living room all swagger and menacing smile came up to me and without a word threw a righthander straight at my nose it stopped about an inch short ill never know whether hed have pulled it because i caught his wrist in midswing and held it steady i squeezed the bones together until the grin left his face and he winced then i threw him his arm back hello ricky i said evenly youre still underestimating me i thought youd have learned by now only kidding blackstone only kidding he rubbed his wrist when did you get tough it happened along the way i looked him up and down exdetective superintendent richard ross looked older than before and by more than the three years or so that had passed since our last meeting he was a bit slimmer too but he was still a pretty formidable specimen for a guy in his midforties he and i had enjoyed no thats the wrong word we hadnt only a brief acquaintanceship but it hadnt worked out too well for him he had ended up in a very embarrassing position after his piece on the side was charged with murdering her husband and his shiny career had come to a tawdry end serve the bastard right though hed been keen to do me for said murder at one point and had even broken into my flat in the process of trying to nail me for it then the obvious hit me and the pieces of the puzzle fell into place all at once let me guess i said to him youre our technical adviser for the movie miles hired you he gave you this address i might have bloody known he nodded the boy detective lives on eh thats right i just thought id pay you a call before we all get together to get a few things out of the way i sighed if you really want to have a go ricky try it that windows toughened glass you wont go through it but i promise you this youll hit it bloody hard ross gave me that loaded grin again no if i was going to do you son itd have happened by now and i wouldnt have got my own hands dirty either i just wanted to say theres no hard feelings about what happened back then ive got a good chunk of pension and im making more in private security work than i did on the force in a way ive got you to thank for that i still think you or your bird or her sister did that murder but im past caring well youre wrong i told him yes i know who did it but hes dead he was killed in an accident not long afterwards he stared at me i hadnt expected to take him by surprise i thought hed have worked it out by now yet you still let them charge linda too right did you know about a certain attempted hitandrun incident up in auchterarder what are you talking about it happened linda kane was the driver in a hired car she bloody near got all three of us too it was you who told her where we were ricky we both know that dont we he grimaced i never thought shed do that though first ive heard of it too did you make a complaint no i told mike dylan about it but that was all are you still porking her by the way thatll be right after they dropped the charges she was going to bloody do for me no i steer well clear of mrs kane youd be well advised to do the same he frowned mike dylan eh a shame what happened to him i saw in the papers that youve moved in on his ex actually he had it the wrong way round but i wasnt going to tell him that susie and i have both had our bereavements i said it suits us the way we are ross actually looked sympathetic aye i heard about yours that was a damn shame too that was some girl you wound up marrying mind that time i was following her thinking she was you she led me a real dance i never thought that he and i would share a laugh about that day but we did before i forget ricky i said and in case you do my birds sister as you called her is now mrs miles grayson i dont think miles connects you with all that stuff or he wouldnt have hired you best let it stay in the past point taken he glanced back at me i heard a story you were there when dylan got it is that true all too true what happened we tracked the guy we were after to amsterdam mike was with him apparently hed been his accomplice all along the guy made a move and the dutch policeman shot them both ross heaved a sigh aye thats what i heard only the bloke wasnt a policeman he was dutch special forces and he had his orders i had suspected that although no one had ever admitted as much was it quick he said something to me then died thats how quick it was ahhhhh that michael he was always getting in over his head was that boy i knew when they let him into special branch that something bad would happen but not that bad mike and i became good friends you know i was gutted when it all went wrong werent we all son but it was his choice remember that ill never forget it that made it even harder for susie to deal with i paused and glanced at my watch speaking of whom ive a train to glasgow to catch aye ill let you get on see you on thursday then by the way if grayson does remember it was me he was complaining about that time he phoned the chief ill tell him its sorted dont worry just behave yourself around dawn and whatever you do dont mention her sister he threw me a wicked smile with traces of his old nastiness i heard about that too then he laughed this is going to be some job taking a bunch of actors and chancers and trying to make them behave like real coppers is that what you were ricky most of the time son he headed for the door most of the time seventeen ethel reid opened the door when i arrived at susies with my travel bag slung over my shoulder she eyed me up and down with no pretence of subtlety so youre daddy are you thats me i admitted as she opened the door what do you think of my daughter so far she beamed at me like an auntie and won me over there and then shes an absolute wee treasure is baby janet takes after her mother then mmm ethel murmured i can see how you get on in the pictures and such id been called a smarmy bastard before but never in such a pleasant way susie was at her desk when i went into the living room working on a pile of folders the sight made my stomach twitch for a second or two jan and i had kept our desks in exactly the same place looking down on the city pick it out then i said to her as i kissed her hello what the restaurant the place im taking you youd have trouble seeing it from here were going to roganos ive booked for seven thirty in my name not yours gantry still gets a better table in glasgow than blackstone enjoy it while you can i told her my fame grows by the second plus i hesitated she looked up at me curious what i just had a meeting with greg prims signed the divorce settlement and so have i all we need to do is go through the petitioning process itself we can do that in scotland right now we dont have to wait for a year or anything like that ill be a free man in a few weeks and and all things will be possible she held me at arms length what are you saying i never know what im saying i replied defensively it was true i really wasnt sure i hadnt planned any of this the words were just falling out of my mouth like pebbles into a pond and i had no idea how far the ripples would go until my meeting with greg id had no idea that the ties between prim and me could be severed so quickly well when you do know tell me she said youd be interested in hearing then yes now if weve finished sparring drop the subject until you actually are divorced i felt myself grinning at her like an idiot i couldnt help it for the first time since jan had died i could see real happiness stretching into the future she laughed at me then kissed me again what do you think of ethel then magic where did you find her my father joe that is knew someone whose daughter had her until her kid was ready for school she gave me references going back twentyfive years and was happy for me to speak to her last employer wee jans in good hands and so are you for now i went off to see the baby she was awake and content so i did the daddy thing for a while carrying her around showing her the view across the city from the windows one day kid i promised her all this will be yours eventually she became restless maybe i was boring her but i think she was hungry i handed her back to susie she plugged her in for a while then i burped her id had plenty of recent practice with bruce but i still couldnt stop her barfing down my shirt luckily i had another when the taxi turned up at seventwenty i looked not bad at all susie looked much better than that she wore a blue sequinned dress which clung to her in a way that made the drivers eyes pop out like organ stops i couldnt object id just shoved mine back in the rogano restaurant is one of the most famous in glasgow its in the city centre and for several generations its been the top watering hole for the top people its decor goes back to the thirties when shipbuilding was king and its dining room is after the style of a liner of that period the food has kept pace with the times though so tlave the prices we went past the bar and straight to our table when we entered on the way several drinkers and diners nodded to susie one even gave her a half bow who were they then i whispered as we were seated a mix of council and business the woman near the door runs a staffing consultancy and the guy next to her is a big wheel in the city labour party new labour very much the man who gave me the wee bow is a steel stockholder i put a load of business his way as if to prove it a bottle of champagne arrived at the table in a bucket susie looked across towards the bar mr steel was smiling at her he dropped another courtly bow as she mimed her thanks id have shone up for the stuff myself but i wasnt about to turn it down so i gave him a wave also as the wine waiter popped the cork for some reason i thought back twentyfour hours to alison goodchild and her tale have you ever come across a man called james torrent in business hes very big in office equipment they say she nodded is he ever why do you ask hes my friends awkward client the one whos putting pressure on her to deliver ewan capperauld to open his headquarters i see her eyes narrowed slightly i dont envy her in that case yes ive come across mr torrent or at least the gantry group has back in the lord provosts time when joe was finance director he leased some photocopiers from him he never was the sharpest tool in the box but still torrents salesman took him for a real ride the contract had copy charges built in with a rolling inflation increase which was actually a blank cheque we wound up paying a quarter of a million over five years for a machine that would have cost us six grand if wed bought it and joe had leased six machines one and a half mil big bucks over five years but capable of being overlooked when shown simply as annual group operating costs it was jan who spotted it when i brought her in to look over my books id have been angrier with joe but she told me that he wasnt the only guy to have been stitched up that way she knew halfadozen law firms and at least two bigfirm accountants who had signed similar deals with torrent and with other companies did you take it up with him i asked no point the leases had just about expired when we found out what had happened i just didnt renew them that was all and i told torrents sales director that he would be getting no more business from me was that the end of it she grinned at me susie loves it when she puts one over on someone especially a man not quite torrent phoned me himself and asked me why i had put the black on him he got quite heavy about it after what alison had told me about the man i felt rising hackles did he threaten you not in so many words what did you say she lowered her voice until it was little more than a whisper i told him that i was about to ask our group chairman the lord provost to call for a review of the city council purchasing policy and second that i planned to show the original contracts to my boyfriend a detective inspector and ask him to have his experts check whether any of the figures had been altered after signature how did he react he got reasonable he told me that i was clearly upset and he asked how he could make it up to me i thought about asking him for one and a half million but if that had gone back into the books id have had to tell our auditors where it had come from so instead i told him i wanted six free photocopiers for the next five years he said yes just like that i told him that in that case he could tender for my business in the normal way ive bought a few things from him since then his service is very good and his prices tend to be sharp too ive let myself believe his story that he had a rogue salesman working for him when the dodgy contracts were signed but deep down you still think hes a great white shark yup what youve told me could be useful in that case dont tell your pal for christs sake no i wouldnt do that but if i have to i might let torrent know that im involved if hes that smart hell know of the connection between you and me and he might get the message to go easy on alison there wont be a problem though if you can deliver ewan capperauld im not sure i want to if the guys like that just do it if you can dont get yourself involved in an argument with torrent i grinned as someone said to me today i wouldnt get my own hands dirty i know the very guy who could carry the message for me whos that no one youve ever met as far as i know a blast from my past thats all eighteen ethel knocked on the bedroom door just after seventhirty but she didnt really have to wee janet had wakened the household by then susie took the baby from her and plugged her into the mains once more i tried to go back to sleep but it was no use there was too much gurgling and slurping going on do you two want breakfast ethel called once the process was complete and i was doing my burping bit its not part of the service mind but im making my own anyway itll be ready in halfanhour if you want to get up for it she makes bloody good scrambled eggs does our nanny plus she knows how coffee really should be made i asked her if shed spent any time in the states no she said but i did spend some time in canada when i was younger im very fond of maple syrup as a result but its hard to find over here the woman was growing on me by the minute susie wanted to get back into a working routine so she was at her desk by ninefifteen sorting through the letters that the postman had delivered and another bundle that had been couriered from the gantry group head office on the south side of the city she was engrossed in it and i felt a bit superfluous so after id played with janet some more i said my goodbyes and headed back to edinburgh i had nothing planned for that day other than maybe another session in the gym so i killed some time in the monster new shopping centre at the top of buchanan street on a whim i bought myself a new rolex to celebrate my impending divorce and who knew what else then headed for queen street station i was almost there when my cellphone rang i had put the apartment phone on divert to its number so it could have been anyone but part of me hoped it was susie saying hey do you want to stay for lunch it wasnt though it was ricky ross oz where are you he asked tersely no banter no funny lines he sounded like a copper again glasgow im just about to get the train back through okay get off at haymarket ill meet you there he hung up i must be getting too old or too prosperous for mysteries i was more narked than curious a couple of years before it would have been the other way around i checked the incoming number on the phone and called it back but there was no answer maybe ross was heading for the station already i picked up a scotsman at the station newsstand it was just the right length of read for the journey there wasnt much in it a row in the scottish parliament a tory split over europe and president dubya had pissed off his allies again i didnt see any of that as news but im not a journalist even if i am cynical enough to be one there wasnt a lot on the back page either scottish football clubs were on their way out of europe and rangers had signed yet another striker we were almost in edinburgh when i saw the small story on page five about the discovery of david capperaulds body stars cousin in sudden death tragedy the headline read i glanced over the story the wellknown parliamentary lobbyist and public relations guru david capperauld was found dead in his edinburgh flat late on sunday night the tragic discovery was made by mr capperaulds fiancee and business partner alison goodchild when she called to see why he had failed to turn up for meetings police and medical services were called to the scene but mr capperauld was found to be dead a police spokesman said that it appeared that the victim had succumbed to a brain haemorrhage ms goodchild was said to be distraught she was being comforted by relatives and was not available for comment they should have phoned the office i muttered as i read on goodchild capperauld has grown into one of the most prestigious lobbying and pr groups in scotland in the two years since its foundation it bluechip clients include banks insurance companies and leading scottish businesses including torrent the office equipment giant which is said to be heading for a flotation james torrent group chief executive said yesterday i was shocked to hear of davids death i will have to talk to alison and see how it will affect our association nice man indeed i growled loud enough for the passenger across the aisle to glance my way mr capperauld was the cousin of film star ewan capperauld who last night issued a short statement expressing his sorrow at the death the actor is expected in edinburgh this week to begin work on the film version of skinners rules to be directed by miles grayson and featuring his wife auchterarder s dawn phillips among mr capperauld s other costars is upandcoming life actor oz blackstone a former boyfriend of ms goodchild fucking hell i barked loudly enough to have attracted the attention of everyone in the carriage but for the sound of brakes as the train slowed into haymarket i didnt mind them getting my age wrong but i did take exception to a gratuitous mention in a story like that as i stepped down onto the platform i ran through the list of people who had known about alison and me and who might have spoken to the scotsman about us i came up with a few possibilities from the edinburgh days and decided that the likeliest was one of my tuesday football crowd whod been going out with a radio reporter when id seen him last i took a quick glance at the story but there was no byline ricky ross was waiting at the top of the stairs that led up to the exit he saw the paper in my hand and he saw the page i had been reading all publicitys good publicity blackstone he began is that the way it goes i glared at him not this its pure fucking cheek i took a deep breath mind you it could have been worse aye i bloody know i looked at the exdetective in surprise come on he said heading for a red alfa rorfieo parked in the station forecourt get in my car i hadnt time to wonder what it was all about i simply followed him young ron morrow ricky grunted he was a dc in my division when i resigned hes a detective sergeant at gayfield now and he keeps in touch he asks me for advice every so often and he tells me things in return i knew what was coming like for example he told me that when the goodchild girl found her boyfriend stiff and cold on sunday night you were with her thats right and he said hed keep my name out of it too i waved the paper he did that in there had nothing to do with ron the quote in there came from the press office he didnt speak to any journalists if you say so fair enough aye but he wants to speak to you now i said id take you to see him otherwise he was going to pay you a visit up at the flat and that might have been a bit public i take my job seriously son ive been hired by mr grayson as security consultant as well as technical adviser that covers a lot of ground i felt a bit uneasy id been on cloud nine for the best part of a day now when i looked down it looked like a hell of a fall should i be worried about anything here i asked you tell me ross answered can you think of a reason why you should be worried no i said at once no i cant so what the fucks this about young ron asked me not to tell you so i said i wouldnt he wants to tell you himself and see your face when he does the boys a good copper and hes going to be even better im training him well he swung the car out of the station and headed east through the lights then left into palmerston place the quickest way to gayfield i recognised we sat in silence for a while till ross broke it is it true what it says in the scotsman you and the goodchild girl were you and she we went about for a while it was four or five years ago though its ancient history its pure fucking mischief to bring it up now no its not son its news get used to it i thought about my pending divorce and wondered if that would reach the press so what were you and she doing together on sunday ricky asked i gave him a version of the story without going into the detail of alisons business problem but when i got to the part about opening capperaulds door he stopped me there was nothing wrong with it i protested she was his fiancee and she had a key even if she was bloody slow in bringing it out fine just leave it at that for now it took us over fifteen minutes even taking the short route to get to the gayfield square police office the traffics murder in edinburgh and getting worse every daft management scheme the people on the council introduce just adds to the chaos there was a female constable on duty at the enquiry desk she was only a probationer as i was once a long time ago but she recognised ross straight away she even called him sir when he told her to fetch ds morrow the sergeant and i had met briefly a few years before when id given him a witness statement he had remembered it straight away when hed turned up in union street he was still friendly enough when he appeared from his office but there was an air of formality about him that was new it was as if he was keeping me at a distance he called me mr blackstone and asked me to come with him to an interview room ricky started to follow but morrow shook his head better not sir he said ross frowned but stopped youre right ron better do this by the book that got my attention i wont say i was nervous but i had a keen interest in whatever was about to happen another officer a woman was waiting for us in the inevitably grubby room she deferred to morrow so i knew she was a dc before he introduced her this is gemma green she works with me nice to meet you i nodded to her then turned back to him as i sat in a hard steelframed chair now sergeant whats this about david capperauld morrow replied when you found him on sunday did you touch the body i told you at the time what i did basic first aid stuff i checked for a pulse but he was as cold as the floor stone ginger i knew it right away did you notice anything unusual about him anything at all i i began to see where this was headed but i could do nothing but think back and answer his face was purple and he was dead thats pretty unusual in my book morrow gave me a flicker of a smile ill be more specific did you notice any marks on him nothing caught my attention did you touch anything in the hall no did you remove anything from the house only myself as soon as i could fair enough now when you found the body how did ms goodchild react she was shocked she screamed sort of did you scream not that i recall i think my exact words were fucking hell her reaction it was instinctive yes i glanced at the young dc then back at morrow remember when you got there the floor was wet he nodded she wet herself that strikes me as pretty instinctive it would seem so yes she changed clothes didnt she yeah you saw what she was wearing when you got there his dressing gown she took her clothes with her in a bag when she left with your people the young sergeant leaned forward a lock of dark hair fell over his forehead that was my recollection too im glad you confirmed it why i asked he replied with another question of his own did you ever meet david capperauld when he was alive i never even heard of him when he was alive before last sunday when was the last time you saw ms goodchild four years ago did it strike you as odd when she contacted you yes it did until she explained that she wanted me to do her a business favour i told him about torrent and his ultimatum and about davids feud with his cousin so how did you come to go with her to union street i shrugged my shoulders she told me her troubles she and the boy hadnt been hitting the high notes and she was worried about him not having turned up at the office for a few days i told her that if she wanted to have another go at fronting him up id come with her it was a game really to see if hed answer the door to me rather than her i see ron morrow nodded and stood up the silent dc green who had been taking notes all through the conversation did the same okay oz thats fine thank you very much for agreeing to talk to us we may need you to make a formal statement ill call you if we do i laughed no no no ron im not walking out of here till you tell me what this is all about morrow looked at me for a long time as if he could tell by looking at me whether it was safe to trust me okay said the young detective finally but in strict confidence dont tell anyone about this he held my eye with a stare which i took to be meaningful especially anyone involved i knew what and who he meant fair enough we got the pm report on david capperauld this morning he died of a cerebral incident all right it was caused by someone ramming a needlelike implement into his brain through the base of his skull he was killed instantaneously thats why there was no blood there wasnt a mark either other than the puncture wound the pathologist found above his hairline id guessed it had to be something like that but i still whistled when i asked the times been fixed as last wednesday evening just for the record can you tell me where you were then i thought back sure i was in glasgow with my baby daughter my girlfriend and her father thats fine you understand i may have to check that out feel free i gave him susies phone number as i stood there i found myself hoping that alison had an alibi too nineteen i thought about phoning her to tip her off but didnt because i had given my word to ron morrow instead when i got back to the apartment i phoned susie the sergeant had been diligent right enough hed called her almost as soon as ross and i had left gayfield square what the hell was that about she asked indignant as well as curious when i told her she let out a soft whistle do your think your ex set you up to find him she asked i gaved her the same answer i had given morrow mmm she murmured with a dark chuckle a girl would have to have pretty good bladder control to fake that still she paused some girls do no i insisted she was just plain terrified if she had a key why did it take her so long to go into the place who knows i just dont think there was anything suspicious about it thats all ricky ross who was sitting on the couch drinking a beer and eating a sandwich gave me a sceptical look whats your problem i asked him when id hung up once a copper always a copper blackstone he said nine times out of ten when a guys found dead like that its a domestic here wait a minute i was a copper too once he looked at me again scornfully this time no you werent you were only a probationer and you were no fucking good at it that doesnt count no if i was ron id be having your girl alison in for a good long chat i could imagine him doing it too and since clearly he was morrows mentor from being mainly annoyed that she had got me into all this nonsense i began to feel sorry for her i checked my watch and reached for the phone hey said ricky you promised ron you wouldnt tip her off im not going to instead i dialled miles he had big bucks invested in the project and he was entitled to know about everything that affected it in the slightest especially the fact that a member of the cast of his cop movie had been interviewed by the real police about a murder it was very early in california but he was up and about if youd left it much later you wouldnt have caught me we leave for the airport in a couple of hours when do you get to edinburgh ill be there by ten am thursday to meet up with this guy ross well arrive in scotland early tomorrow morning but were going straight up to dawns folks place with bruce and maria his nurse elanore and david are going to have their grandson for the duration well rest up to get over the jetlag the best way we can then come down to meet up with you in the morning dawnll check into the caledonian ill come to your place you could stay here i offered out of habit as much as anything else thanks buddy he said but you need your space and so will we you dont want to be living with the director its a bad idea there were other reasons too but he didnt need to spell them out instead he asked me if that was the only reason i had called wish it was no the movies had another bit of vicarious publicity and its my fault again i explained what had happened in detail miles didnt say a word until i was finished has our security guy been on our side he asked i saw no harm in putting in a word for ricky sooner or later miles would remember their past connection very much so he smoothed the way today at the police station he still has strong connections in the force thats good ill thank him in person when i meet him he sighed capperaulds cousin eh could you wind up being a witness probably i found him but even if the police charge someone quickly itll take months before the case comes to trial okay no worries then i heard him grunt well maybe theres one i use a pr agency as publicists on all my uk projects part of their brief is to let me know whenever anything affecting me even remotely hits the press they should have told me about this story by now but they havent this friend of yours do you think she could do the job i took a deep breath i honestly dont know miles maybe you should take a day or two to think about that shes just lost her partner could be shed struggle with that sort of responsibility yeah i guess youre right hey youve changed buddy in the past youd have said hire her just because shes female no harm in sounding her out though i suppose not i said noncommittally then i thought of something else do you have a contact number for ewan capperauld i want to touch base with him on something sure he and his wife are staying with his parents ive got his number noted somewhere ill send you an email before we leave fine i hung up the phone ricky ross had finished his sandwich thanks for putting in the good word with the boss he said remember it what do you want to talk to ewan about i told sergeant morrow about it a business thing the reason alison wanted to see me i sketched in the part of the story i had left out before explaining the feud between the capperauld cousins and her predicament with james torrent when i was finished ross frowned i didnt know about that he muttered as if the omission was a personal affront thank christ you dont know everything i snorted i try to though oz i do try why are you so interested in ewan anyway im handling his personal security while hes in edinburgh its part of the contract his mr and mrs graysons steeles masseys the japanese guys the waitrose girls and yours mine i exclaimed aye youre a vip now son ive got a team looking after all the principal cast members ewan capperaulds round the clock and so will the graysons be when they arrive and the japanese guy the rest of you will have people responsible for you when youre filming on the streets and youll be given a number you can call if youre being pestered everyone will be told about the arrangements at the briefing on thursday apart from mr capperauld that is he knows already q something clicked in my brain ricky how did you get this gig through a guy i know from the old days a bloke called mark kravitz youll never have heard of him he was wrong there i know mark all right ive seen him in action too he had worked for miles on my first film project when wed had a bit of trouble hes a man of mystery and he has contacts all over the place both sides of the fence top to bottom if ricky ross was involved with him maybe he deserved a new degree of respect do you want mr capperaulds contact details he took a diary from his pocket flipped through it then wrote an edinburgh address and a phone number on the front page of my script which was lying on the coffee table he drank the last of his beer and stood up better be going he said ive got a lot of irons in the fire just now he scratched his chin i wonder if young rons making anything out of the argument between the two capperaulds i dont know if it was wise to let that slip he mused dont be daft hes not going to go after ewan capperauld i fucking would ricky grunted he was just about to leave when the phone rang again yes i said as i picked it up i never give my name these days when i answer a call mr blackstone it was a womans voice high and twittery and full of panic yes this is mrs goodchild alisons mother shes in terrible trouble she started to cry on the other end of the line okay okay okay i exclaimed now please try to calm down and tell me what this is about i had met alisons mother a couple of times when we had been going out she had been a widow for a couple of years then and she hadnt been handling it well alison had said that she had been flaky at the best of times listening to her burble on the phone it was clear that she hadnt improved mrs goodchild i said rosss eyebrows rose please take a couple of deep breaths and try to control yourself eventually she could speak again alison called me she said shes with the police and theyve arrested her she phoned me just a crt minute ago and asked me to call you and tell you she said youd help her oh shit i murmured pardon yes mrs goodchild i replied quickly of course i will now you just calm down take a pill or have a brandy or whatever and try not to worry ill sort everything out i sounded like the wizard of rather than just oz ill call you later i hung up and looked at ricky do me a favour and come with me sure but where are we going back to gayfield i might need you to use your influence with your protege twenty the woman in the public office looked a little more hesitant this time when exdetective superintendent ross marched in and asked to see detective sergeant morrow ill see if hes available sir she said reaching for a telephone hes available ricky snapped now go and get him her face flushed up but she stood and did as shed been told did you really leave the force i asked him they dont act as if you did oh yes he replied if youd been a fly on the wall at the last discussion i had with the former chief constable you wouldnt ask that the only choice the old bastard gave me was whether i resigned as a superintendent or was kicked out as a sergeant he smiled grimly i had my supporters though coppers whove actually been out on the trail of villains rather than building their careers pushing paper when i left they had a big dinner for me in the king james hotel it was organised by the superintendents association they invited the boss man but he declined so we drank a toast to him in his absence only none of us stood up for it theres a new chief now a bright young guy he was a detective sergeant under me before he went south for a spell so my face fits again even in the executive corridor the constable reappeared stonefaced with morrow following her he beckoned us through and led us into the cid office for fucks sake sir he began im in the middle of an interview we know you are ricky replied and we know who youve got in there you let her phone her mother and she phoned oz in hysterics now is the lassie getting home tonight or what morrow took in a breath then let it out i dont know its actually the second time weve interviewed her today i had her in this morning before i saw you shes been formally arrested and cautioned but we havent charged her yet what are your grounds i asked it was as if the sergeant was answering ross first she doesnt have an alibi for last wednesday and shes lying about it she told me at her first interview that she was at home but weve checked with the taxi firm that has a contract with her company and theyve got a record of her being picked up that evening and being taken back to her office its in york place and you could spit from there to david capperaulds flat on the back of that we got a warrant from the sheriff to search her house he reached into a drawer in his desk took out a clear plastic bag we found that we leaned over and looked down it was a carpenters awl small and needlepointed with a red wooden handle so i said i used to have one of those my dad still has why shouldnt alison or are girlies not supposed to have diy tools that one was found in her house but it has david capperaulds prints on it and one of hers they were engaged maybe he helped her put up a curtain rail or something and maybe he cut himself when he did it ron morrow retorted it also appears to have blood on it maybe he did cut himself and hair finally the sergeant looked at me im sorry oz but theres a real chance thats the murder weapon im just waiting for someone from the lab to come and collect it they should be able to tell us for sure it might take a while though ricky pointed out can you not let the girl out on police bail meantime im scared shed abscond release her into her mothers custody then morrows eyebrows shot up have you spoken to her mother shes a mr kipling job even i had to agree with that there was a strong hint of exceedingly good fruitcake about alisons mum i might release her into someone elses custody though how about you oz hey wait a minute i protested i thought about susie and for all her independence and her handsoff approach to me about how she might feel about alison spending a night or maybe more under my roof furthermore what if she had bumped off capperauld all round i felt uneasy im not fucking idle here ive got work to do i told him grabbing the easiest copout i could its the only way said morrow firmly i looked at ricky then shook my head yeah i know mrs ross wouldnt have it either he snorted mrs ross hasnt been having it for a while at least not off me there is no mrs ross not at the moment okay ill be responsible for the woman for tonight at least if youre sure about that morrow told him ill go and do the paperwork now go on then snapped ricky before i change my mind twentyone alison was tearful when morrow brought her to us she wrapped herself around me straight away and set about soaking my shirt eventually i peeled her off and once she had calmed herself down introduced her to her new minder ricky did his best to look like a friendly uncle but he didnt come close like he said once a copper always a copper we went to her place first so that she could pick up some clothes as usual the police had been less than tidy in their search and as usual they hadnt bothered to clear up once theyd finished she wanted to start in on the mess right there and then but we had more urgent things to do she started to talk to us about her headtohead with morrow as she packed her overnight bag but ricky stopped her dont tell us anything he warned her however innocuous it might be weve got no privilege just get on with packing the ross residence turned out to be a grey stone semidetached near kings buildings which are part of edinburgh university he showed his unexpected house guest her bedroom then sat her down in the conservatively furnished living room right he began first off whos your lawyer alex stein of stein and rothman she told him he does all my stuff hes no good that firm doesnt do criminal work leave this to me he went out into the hall within a minute we could hear him talking earnestly on the phone the conversation didnt last long but when he came back into the living room he had a satisfied smile on his face well i asked him he picked up a remote and switched on the television wait he flicked through the channels until he found an australian rugby league match on sky dropped into a chair and settled down to watch there were still seven minutes to go when the doorbell rang ricky went to answer and returned with a short balding middleaged guy in a dark suit this is charlie badenoch he said hes the best criminal solicitor in scotland the lawyer looked at me in surprise charlie and i know each other from way back his firm gave me quite a lot of work in the days when i was a private enquiry agent alisons a friend i explained before he had a chance to ask what the hell i was doing there he nodded then shook hands with his new client as she stood to greet him give us a pound charlie it was my turn to be surprised but badenoch simply smiled at ross dug into his pocket and handed us each a pound coin you are now both investigators in my employ in connection with this incident he announced fine ross looked at alison now weve got privilege you can say anything you like in front of us and we cant be called as witnesses okay did you kill him what she gasped if she was acting she was better at it than me did you drive an awl into the back of david capperaulds head and kill him no i didnt and whats an awl ricky didnt say anything he just turned on his heel and left the room when he came back a few minutes later he was holding an implement identical to the one morrow had shown us only its handle was blue thats an awl he told her pinching its shaft between his thumb and forefinger so that she could see it also known as a gimlet the police found one just like it at your flat your fingerprints on it and his and theyre going to prove that it has your fiances blood and hair on it as well she went chalk white even as i looked at her i helped him fix something up a few weeks ago in his kitchen she whispered i handled it then why did you lie to the police i asked her about being at home on wednesday night i didnt alison ricky said theyve spoken to the taxi firm they know you were picked up from home and dropped at your office theyll argue that you didnt go in that instead you went round to davids place and killed him with that thing theyve got theyll then argue that you took it away with you and four days later staged an elaborate charade with oz here so that he could find the poor guy but i didnt she wailed then burst into tears again ross threw badenoch a grim glance do you still want this charlie like her boyfriend needed a hole in the fucking head the solicitor replied but im in it now ill tell you one thing though im not pleading this one in the high court myself even though i could im going to instruct a top silk i did what i did best and calmed alison down again when she could she looked up at ricky i was at home last wednesday she said but i got a phone call from someone telling me that there was a light left on in my office so i called a taxi and went to switch it off who called you charlie asked i dont know he just asked if i was the goodchild in goodchild capperauld when i said i was he said that he worked in an office across from mine and he told me what the problem was he didnt give me his name when you got there was there a light on alison shook her head no she whispered why didnt you tell ronnie morrow this story ross demanded is it because youve just made it up no its the truth as far as i was concerned i was at home on wednesday night that was just an interlude i never thought to mention it i felt myself getting into the swing of this have you got call identification on your phone like a readout that gives you the number calling yes i have i looked at the other two guys then back at alison have you had many incoming calls at home since then no not really thats good said badenoch then glanced at ricky and me you two should get back to ms goodchilds place now and check that instrument but be bloody careful not to erase anything i cant ross told him the girls virtually in my custody at this address i cant leave her and i cant traipse her all over the city you and ill do it then oz the solicitor declared i almost agreed then i thought of the movie im sorry but ive got good professional reasons for not being involved any further fuck me charlie badenoch moaned is that all i get for a pound okay ill do it myself ill take my secretary with me as a witness we could arrange for morrow to go with you i suggested the lawyer and the exsuperintendent both looked at me as if i was daft well i demanded charlie took my elbow and led me towards the window so that our backs were to alison what if there was no call he whispered it must have been a flash of the old blackstone a poor sad gullible trusting idiot where women were concerned true i muttered we turned back to face the others lets not get too excited about this if alison was set up whoever did it was probably clever enough to use a callbox the police may argue that alison could have gone out and made the call to herself and had it picked up by her answering service yes but if that was the case why didnt she volunteer that story to morrow if i was going to kill david alison interrupted why did i take a taxi at all and why did i book one that could be traced through the company contract the crown could argue that you were either stupid or very very clever that you set up the whole callout thing to explain your presence in the area just in case you were seen what about the meeting with me i asked if she set me up to find the body then all that discussion would have been phoney the james torrent problem could all have been bullshit oz alison protested shut up i told her the police havent even started on you yet it wont be ronnie morrow who interviews you next time itll be someone nasty like ricky here if were going to keep your bum out of jail for any longer than a day or two were going to have to have all these questions answered before you meet whoever that is i ignored her and looked back at the other two if the james torrent story is true it helps yes they both nodded in that case ill follow that up are you sure about that asked charlie its iifvolvement oz sure but if the story is genuine it is alison shouted i told you before shut up if it is im the guy whos supposed to be delivering ewan capperauld to open this bloody office so it would be natural for me to come to see him if anyone else turns up and starts asking him questions he might react by firing alison and her firm on the spot youve got a point ricky conceded besides i added theres something else i want to meet the guy who was brave or stupid enough to try to rip off my girlfriend twentytwo i knew one thing when i left rickys that afternoon i had had enough of taxis for a while okay edinburgh may be a bit of a pisser of a city for a carowner but i cant help it ever since ive been eighteen ive had something at my front door into which i could jump and drive off at my whim the cab that picked me up from chez ross was twenty minutes late the driver pleaded traffic dont blame me pal he moaned when i shot a glance at my watch blame the fuckin cooncillors i wasnt interested in blaming anyone i just decided that if i couldnt beat the problem i would add to it so instead of taking me home i had the guy drop me at the western automobile showroom in willowbrae road where an exceptionally friendly sales executive called simon sold me a nice blue mercedes demonstrator with leather seats and all the toys in about five minutes flat the smile only left his face when he asked me how id be financing it and i replied credit card you serious he said surprised although still managing to be polite i was quite chuffed to know that clearly there was still someone in edinburgh whod never heard of me absolutely its a bit unusual ill bet it is theres a surcharge once a fifer always a fifer i couldnt let that one pass or my dad would have turned in his grave and he wasnt even dead yet why the companies charge us we pass it on to you do you hear me haggling over the price of the vehicle i asked no he admitted so ill need to ask my sales manager simon disappeared into a glasswalled office at the far end of the showroom and spoke to a thinfaced man he turned to look at me i gave him a wave and a smile and saw the slight inclination of his eyebrows that told me that he did go to movies or watched satellite television wrestling he looked away and i saw him nod the surcharge disappeared my gold card was authorised and i signed the paperwork i called greg mcphillips office which also deals with my insurance business and told them to have a cover note at the dealership next morning so that simon could register the vehicle and i could pick it up by the time all that was done there was no point in phoning james torrents office to make an appointment in any event i still had to work out a line to get me in there i didnt think id make it on my name alone back at the apartment i sat down and gave it some thought until eventually i settled on a pitch i called alison at rickys hows your business set up i asked her partnership or incorporated were a limited company david and i are were the directors fine youve just got yourself a new board member eh who me you daft bat i dont think it would be a good idea to lie to this man torrent and i have to give a stronger reason for visiting him than the one we discussed earlier that okay with you its a temporary measure mind of course its okay ive just had a onewoman board meeting and youre appointed ill minute it later as for the length of your directorship well have to see ross took the phone back from her when we were finished charlie called he told me he and his secretary checked alisons phone and it does show a call logged in at around the time she said i checked out the number with a contact its a box and its in the entrance to meadowbank stadium that helps oz if it had been just round the corner from her place the cid would just have laughed at her the fact that it was further away even than her office gives it a wee bit more credibility its pretty tenuous though isnt it aye it is that a lotll depend on what the lab turns up when will we know that i know it now im dead certain theyll match the hair and blood to the boy how else would they have found the thing at her place if it wasnt hers like she says and if it was he snorted however it turns out thatll be the murder weapon either shes lying or someone planted it there which do you think i dont know and thats the truth if i was morrow or rather if i was morrows boss like i used to be id probably sling it all to the fiscal and let the crown office decide whether or not to charge her twentythree the bedside phone woke me at sevenfortythree next morning as i reached for it blearyeyed i thought that it might have been susie but it wasnt it was miles calling from the vip lounge in heathrow hows tricks up there he asked any more headlines we dont need no i told him trusting that nothing had blown up overnight your security advisers got it well under control thats good said my soontobeexbrotherinlaw kravitz said he was a solid guy and wellconnected too how you feeling anyway i suppressed a yawn rubber ducked i told him lapsing in to edinburgh rhyming slang miles chuckled if that means what i think it does then it goes for me too any way you cut it that is one long haul flight ill be wrecked by the time we get to dawns folks place age is catching up with me my man hows brucie handling it like its an adventure he slept most of the way across now its just another new day to him hows your little one doing for some reason i thought of a tabloid feature that had appeared when we were in toronto miles and oz men about town if they could hear us now shes great i told him shes mastered the typical tendayolds repertoire eats sleeps and shits and thats it speaking of which i have a couple of those to take care of myself sure ill have my assistant call you as soon as she gets to edinburgh to set up the arrangements for tomorrow see you when i hit town myself okay i hung up and rolled out of bed i felt a bit stiff a late reaction to my gym work so i did some stretching exercises then followed up with a quick hundred situps the same number of pressups and fifty chins using the top of the heavy bedroom door as a bar q i was going to give shaving a miss and was heading for the shower when i remembered that with luck id be meeting mr james torrent later i still had half a face full of shave gel when susie called we talked about nothing much other than the baby for about ten minutes the second half of my shave wasnt quite as smooth as the first by the time i had showered dressed and eaten a healthy breakfast of whole meal toast and black coffee it was close enough to nine oclock for me to take a chance on phoning torrent to set up a meeting my call was picked up on the second ring then i had to sit through one of those really annoying automated multiple choice responses i didnt want to rent office equipment nor did i want to buy it i didnt want to buy specific items of office furniture nor did i want to take advantage of their spaceplanning service i didnt need any other office supplies and since i didnt have any of their equipment i didnt need their technical helpline either however i did have a miscellaneous enquiry i pressed button seven they must have had a few of those that morning for i was told that i had been placed in a queue without the option of listening to lou vega singing mambo number five or those two old geezers doing the macarena the trio los bravos performing their only hit black is black were at the point of doing my head in completely when finally i heard a real female voice on the other end but by that time i had begun to work something out about mr torrent i asked for his office in connection with what sir the operator asked his new suit i told her this is his tailor speaking i dont know if she believed me but she put me through anyway mr torrents office said another woman she pronounced the name with the emphasis on the second syllable how can i help you her voice was slow and cultured for some reason she reminded me of an ad for galaxy chocolate by making an appointment for me to see your boss this is oz blackstone speaking there was a silence of a sort id experienced before the oz blackstone she asked in a tone which implied doubt theres only one of me as far as i know ill be carrying oz blackstones driving licence when i come to see your boss thatll mean either that i really am me or that ive killed me and stolen it oh yes and ill also look remarkably like me what would you like to discuss with mr torrent she asked without as much as a chuckle this woman had no sense of humour thats something id prefer to discuss with mr torrent i told her i am his executive assistant the woman said humouring the mystery caller but youre not mine now do i get to see the man or not i paused for effect or do i have to pursue other means she thought about that one for a moment or two then clearly having decided that she didnt want to know what i meant she told me to hold on finally at least fifteen minutes after id dialled the number she came back on the line and announced that mr torrent had a meeting in glasgow that afternoon but that he could fit me in at tenthirty for half an hour at the very most that suits my schedule i told her then hung up i was fairly chuffed with myself at getting in there without having to spill any beans so much so that i almost forgot the reason why i was going there in the first place remembering i called ricky to check that alison hadnt done a runner in the night and to let them both know that i was going to see the man she sounded more nervous than ever when i spoke to her she was still waiting for the lab to report to morrow and ross had warned her not to expect good news you did tell me the truth about torrent alison didnt you i half expected her to be offended by my question but she wasnt yes honest she said her tone took me back a few years i guessed that the last of her carefully constructed image had been ground away by the pressure of the last couple of days i wondered whether shed be able to rebuild it i should have known better i was about to call a taxi to take me to see torrent when i remembered that id bought a bloody car its an everyday occurrence for us rich folk see so instead i had it take me down to willowbrae the merc was ready and waiting shining in the morning sun it seemed to have a personality of its own i took to it at once more than i had to susies m say what you like there is a difference between a mercedes and a beamer i mean could you imagine janis joplin singing oh lord wont you buy me a series bmw once simon had finished his delivery runthrough i headed off following the signs for the al then picking up the bypass and heading for edinburgh park following the directions that alison had given me the car handled like like like a pram fatherhood was having its effect on me right enough she had told me i wouldnt have any trouble spotting the new torrent headquarters and she was right it had a bloody great red t on a pole in front of the main entrance high enough and garish enough to be seen a mile away the visitors car park was full but i spotted a space in the directors area and slid carefully in there right in the middle of the bay to cut down the chances of my shiny car being bumped by one of its neighbours opening a door in a hurry the brand new readytobeopened office was a fourstorey building of fairly conventional design it looked as if it had been built out of solid stone blocks and it shouted money at me as i approached there was a man in uniform standing just inside the big marbleclad atrium i could see him as i trotted up the steps and as he swung the heavy glass door open for me some job still it was better than being a traffic warden you know you cant park there sir he said he had the same instincts though yes i answered one of my finest lifetime moments was being sick over one of those guys and headed for the desk which was positioned in the centre of the hall under the high glass roof oz blackstone for mr torrent i announced loudly the receptionist was chinese a plastic card clipped to her blouse identified her as anna chin she had a very nice one too with a dimple that deepened as she smiled at me on her desk there was a big wooden bowl full of red cherries and beside it a small ceramic dish for their pips good morning sir she said in an accent which might have been honed at mary erskine or st georges school then slid a thick folder across the desk if youd just like to fill in your details there she pointed and sign alongside a health and safety requirement sure i told her flashing her a quick twinkle im pretty healthy and relatively safe i filled in the form and signed it she ripped it from the pad and tucked it inside a plastic holder then produced a small book from beneath the desk if you could sign here too ill let mr torrents chief personal assistant know youre here i couldnt help it i hesitated i think i probably frowned as well doesnt matter how often it happens i reckon i will always be just a wee bit embarrassed when someone asks for my autograph she misunderstood me annas chin seemed to fall and her dimple almost vanished im sorry she began dont be i reassured her im flattered honest im just a dentists son from anstruther her smile returned even brighter this time not any more she said firmly youre a film star now and im still just a doctors daughter from barnton i shot a quick glance at her left hand as i took the autograph book from her no ring stop it blackstone i told myself and signed the blank page she offered me i flicked through some of the other pages its always good to know whose company youre in in the few pages back from mine i recognised the careful signature of scotlands first minister the flamboyant scrawl of my friend scott steele the names of two members of texas augmented by a tiny cartoon guitar a wellknown edinburgh novelist with a noughts and crosses trademark a football manager who had printed his name below his signature to make sure that everyone knew who he was and a couple of others which were just plain indecipherable of these the least decipherable was one that looked just like the picture on the screen of a heart monitor i wondered whether over time the signature would get flatter and flatter until one day it was a straight line where did you pick all these up i asked her as i handed back her book and helped myself to a couple of cherries i got all of them here she told me mr torrent has been running a series of cocktail parties for celebrities you wont tell him though will you he might think i was abusing my position i couldnt imagine you abusing anything i almost added except me old habits and all that but i stopped myself anna picked up her phone and pushed a button on her console mr blackstone she said her accent still impeccable without a hint of an oriental r even though she was from barnton she nodded into the handset replaced it then turned and pointed to two glasswalled lifts behind her desk please take the one on the left she told me it goes directly to the top floor i jerked my thumb in the direction of the guy in the uniform does he get to open the door for me she gave a quick tinkling laugh no its automatic she answered quitetly as if we were sharing a secret i liked that i gave her a wave through the glass as the lift started to go up it went fast i counted off the floors as i rose i assumed that it would stop at the fourth but to my surprise it kept going james torrents office suite was on the roof of the building out of sight from the car park surrounding the glass panel of the atrium like the capsule that had brought me up it appeared to be built almost entirely of glass although part of it was smoked to the point of blackness the back wall of the reception area was not through it i could see the tops of the two forth bridges and the hills of west life beyond a woman approached me hand outstretched mr blackstone i felt as if she was telling me who i was not welcoming me the galaxy chocolate voice and more imperious in the flesh somehow i knew that this woman was not going to ask for my autograph she looked me up and down as we shook hands so i gave her the same treatment she was tanned and tall with legs that seemed to be reaching for her armpits i touch six feet and i was barely looking down on her her dress matched her voice it was a warm brown colour in a clinging fabric that could have been cashmere it fitted from her throat to just below the knee and she looked as if she might have been poured into it there were no visible lines if she was wearing anything under it then it was even sleeker than the dress what she definitely was not wearing was a label like anna chins or like the one she had given me i glanced beyond her to an empty desk there was a triangular metal bar on it bearing the name natalie morgan natalie morgan she said im mr torrents chief of staff that makes him sound like a general i murmured she wasnt smiling so i didnt either a while back a woman like her could have eaten me for breakfast i think i must be less digestible now he is she replied soft and low youre a few minutes early but hell see you follow me please she turned on her heel and led me along a passageway the roof of the atrium was on my right on the other side was another panelled wall it was doubleskinned with a venetian blind between the panels but the slats were open and i could see through into a long room that looked eastwards towards edinburgh and the castle if id looked i could have seen my apartment from there i guessed that was where torrent held his celebrity parties at the end of the passage there was a black glass wall which qr stretched the full width of the suite a door was cut into it but you wouldnt have seen it but for its round gunmetal handle natalie morgan opened it and moved aside for me to step into the sanctum as i passed her i caught a strong fragrance that i recognised from hollywood that place floats on giorgio of beverley hills i stepped into the office and looked around for a while i thought that it was empty the door opened more or less into the middle of the room on my right there was an oval meeting table and beyond that a wall which looked as if it could have been made of ebony but also of the blackest glass another door was set in it to my left there was a big kidneyshaped desk with a plasmatronic computer screen and three telephones two leather armchairs faced it and behind it there was a third which turned slowly towards me as i looked at it james torrent pushed himself to his feet and moved round the desk to greet me a great podgy hand outstretched he wore what might have been described as a smile on someone else but which looked on him like something halfway between a leer and a grimace the man looked to be in his early fifties and he was massive he was no taller than me but tremendously solid not so much fat but more like a small mountain on legs he had sleek black hair which swept back from a receding forehead his facial features were as gross as the rest of him thick rubbery lips piggy eyes and ears and a great bulbous nose his complexion was so swarthy that i knew at once that my earlier guess had been right oz he said in a gravelly voice devoid of accent so glad to meet you likewise i lied with the same mock politeness spanish i asked my father was he left during the civil war i was born and educated here how did you guess from the way your staff pronounced your name ive encountered it before youve travelled in spain i lived there for a while more than me then i wont go back there franco shot my grandfather he pointed me at one of the two visitor chairs sit down he said returning to his swivel chair youll have coffee no thanks ive had my dose for today qq yes we tend to drink too much of it i always think so to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit i have heard of you of course quite the coming man in the film industry so they say its more than id say in that case im getting along though but thats not the only string to my bow torrent raised his heavy black eyebrows no no i have a couple of business interests nonexecutive directorships im on the board of the gantry group youll have heard of us im sure i looked him in the eyes as i said it not a single lash batted never mind an eyelid he didnt give as much as a twitch of course he rumbled you and susie have a personal connection dont you yes shes my fiancee the word came out without my even thinking about it christ blackstone i said to myself whats got into you youre in for an interesting life then shes quite a lady a businesswoman after my own heart as a matter of fact im glad to hear you approve but that has nothing to do with my visit no its my other directorship that brings me here i know youve heard of the unfortunate death of david capperauld this time james torrent did blink well as it happens alison goodchilds an old friend of mine shes asked me to join her board to help her through and ive agreed mmm the murmur sounded like a drill cutting into rock theres a turnup for the books he paused but you did say nonexecutive earlier i did but i take my responsibilities seriously i have some time on my hands so i thought i should visit all of our major clients to assure them personally that davids loss isnt going to cause a vacuum in the management of the business and that its quality of service will continue as before torrent gave me that halfleer again im delighted to hear it oz i value alisons advice greatly im glad to hear that too i confess to having had a doubt about that given the emphasis you placed on the importance of securing ewan capperauld to perform your opening ceremony she gave me the impression that it was a condition of continued employment in fact he shrugged his shoulders im sorry if she took me so literally its my style im afraid i like to keep my people on their toes this is a hard business im in son and ive been growing it for a long time i didnt get here by being everyones favourite uncle i have the greatest respect for alison and admiration for her as a professional of course it would be good to have someone as eminent as ewan capperauld visit this building and even more to have him open it but there are others im sure the first minister would be pleased to do the job if alison thought i was being threatening when i mentioned capperaulds name then please give her my apologies and tell her not to give it another thought he shot me a quick perceptive glance of course youre making a film with him arent you i nodded yes and ill ask him first chance i get ive never met him you understand but most actors are ego maniacs the chance to have his name on a plaque on an important building might be too much for him to turn down lets hope so tell him he can name his own fee within reason of course or if hed prefer it ill make a substantial donation to a charity of his choice in recognition of the event okay ill put that to him torrents affability had thrown me i had gone in there partly to check alisons story and partly to do battle i had expected him either to deny everything or to give me a hard time the last thing i had anticipated was that he would be reasonable i began to harbour my first doubt about ms goodchild maybe she wasnt good at all still having torrent in this sort of mood was an opportunity too good to miss i decided to push my luck just a little further one of the areas alisons asked me to look at is the companys cash flow this has all happened very quickly so i havent had a chance to look at the debtor lists can you recall if youre holding any outstanding invoices that grin again cheesy this time im sure we are he chortled were bloody slow payers im good at cash management too oz he picked up one of his telephones and pushed a button nat he said into the phone dig out all the pending goodchild capperauld invoices total them up and make payment in full today through the system then send out the usual notification he hung up and turned back to me the money whatever it is should be in your bank by close of play this afternoon we pay all our regular suppliers by electronic transfer these days this is a cash less business i hired a security consultant a few years back and that was his first recommendation good chap hes an expoliceman he was pretty senior before he decided to retire his name isnt ross is it the great head nodded yes it is do you know him hes looking after security for the movie youll be fine then hes a very sound man is richard fucking tightlipped as well i thought ricky had known i was going to see torrent and hed said nothing about his connection with him thats reassuring i said i knew him as a copper he was a real collar and front then i can tell you he looked puzzled at my slang for a moment then worked it out i stood and he followed suit i mustnt keep you any longer i told him im grateful to you for putting me right on capperauld and for your payment alison will be pleased on both scores thats good i glanced at him he seemed genuine oh yes he continued i should have mentioned this earlier please give the young lady my deepest condolences davids death must be a terrible blow to her both in personal and business terms i had very little to do with him but i found him a very pleasant young man when we did meet he gave a small sad laugh even if he didnt get on with his famous cousin he pushed a button on his phone im a great believer in family values oz he rumbled as he walked me to the door ive never married myself but i treat my late sisters daughter as my own i couldnt do without her in fact at that moment the door opened and natalie morgan appeared could i my dear could you what uncle james do without you she smiled for the first time in my presence it was supercharged and it made her eyes shine like deep blue pools absolutely not she said twentyfour i drove straight to rickys place without calling to let him know i was coming thanks pal i said when he opened the door you might have bloody told me you work for torrent why he retorted i treat all my clients on a confidential basis im in the security business for fucks sake anyway what difference would it have made you might have saved me a trip how i dont bug his fucking office i dont know what he did or didnt tell alison he had a point i cooled down how is she anyway i asked him ross shrugged his shoulders and nodded towards the kitchen at the back of the narrow hall nervous we still havent heard from ronnie morrow shes in the kitchen knocking up some lunch go and ask her yourself his tone was as he looked offhand i did as he suggested she had her back to the door as i stepped into the room do you want hp sauce on your corned beef she asked there was something in her voice too and i knew at once what it was even in that simple question she sounded just as she had a few years back when she and i had been together and shed been making breakfast at my place alison always sounded guilty after sex as if it was something she shouldnt have been doing for some reason she also consumed large quantities of brown sauce the morning after ill take mustard on mine thanks she jumped at the sound of my voice and turned round she caught me frowning at her and turned red did you shag him i asked her she turned even redder thats none of my business i know except for the fact that im out there trying to help my old friend the grieving fiancee and all the time shes doing the fucking horizontal mambo with her minder you know what im starting to have serious doubts about you alison why she protested im frightened and i was lonely i needed to be with someone you made your feelings clear the other night and ricky was kind to me so i reached out opened one of the kitchen drawers and took a look inside what are you doing she asked checking for icepicks or other sharp objects i told her oz she squealed my name no listen did you have any sort of a relationship with david other than business were you really engaged to him the blush left her cheeks she looked down at the floor and gnawed her lip not any more she whisphered he broke it off a month ago did he tell you why he was seeing someone else who i dont know and all that carryon on sunday night getting me to thump on his door what was that about i was hoping shed be there whoever she was i wanted to cause a scene to embarrass him so you used me yes im sorry a spark of the new alison flared up in her but why should i be you used me often enough in the past she had me there i taught you bloody well then i shot back at her okay i went on so david dumped you a month ago how did you manage to conduct a business relationship after that we didnt he walked out of the business as well and he demanded half the assets what assets you told me the business had a cash problem its still worth quite a bit though as a trading entity david had the shares valued by our auditor he was insisting that i buy him out or that the company bought his shares in i couldnt afford that and neither could the business anyway her voice rose and hardened it wasnt fair i would never agree to that he never pulled his weight at work i won most of the clients and i serviced most of them myself ill bet you did thats probably why he chucked you she ignored my wisecrack he did ten per cent of the work yet he wanted half the value i wasnt going to let him away with that i offered him one fifth of what the auditor claimed his shares were worth he laughed at me and told me that if i didnt give him what he wanted hed withdraw his personal guarantee of our overdraft and the bank would pull the plug on everything oh shit i heard myself bellow just as the kitchen door opened again behind me and ricky ross walked in indeed he said im afraid youre cooked dear i stared at him the offhand look had gone now he looked very interested and bloody pleased with himself too you son of a i hissed you might not have bugged torrents place but youve done your own havent you white teeth gleamed once a copper oz always that was as far as he got before i sank my right fist deep into his gut the breath rushed out of him and he folded up alison just stood there bewildered staring at us both hands pressed to her mouth ohhh ricky groaned then bizarrely he smiled up at me from the floor sorry oz he gasped i couldnt tell you though not with you having been close to the girl did you and morrow cook this up he pulled himself to his feet no it was all my idea if id got ronnie involved the tape probably wouldnt have been admissible as evidence maybe yes maybe not but it wasnt worth the risk what alison screamed we both turned to look at her she was holding the big kitchen knife with which she had been slicing the corned beef and pointing it straight at us you she screamed again and rushed at ricky he dived for his life but slowly as he was still feeling the effects of my punch he might not have made it but i grabbed her arm as she went past and twisted it up and round behind her compressing her wrist until her hand went numb and she dropped the blade keep her here oz said ricky breathlessly as he picked the knife from the floor ill get ronnie alison was still struggling against my grip straining wildeyed to get at him once her head twisted round and down as if she was reaching for my hands to bite them i didnt fancy that at all not with the fleck of foam in one corner of her mouth you keep her here yourself i suggested ill make the call that seems like a better deal to me he wasnt that daft though he was through that door like a greyhound out of a trap leaving me wondering how long i could hang on to this mad woman and wondering whether there were any more lethal kitchen implements lying around within easy reach she muttered something incoherent then snarled a bit then gradually began to calm down she still twisted and wrenched against me trying to free herself until finally she ran out of strength i still held her tight though keeping her arms pinned from behind i couldnt be sure she wasnt faking it and that she wouldnt go for my throat that bastard she exclaimed the words punctuated by a great gasping sob he made love to me and it was all a trick come on now i said be fair he didnt make love to you you shagged him that was the way it came out earlier and if the guy wants to plant listening devices in his own house i suppose hes got the right to do that lets stop blaming other people here alison if you hadnt killed your bloody ex none of this would have happened but i didnt kill him she said her voice was weak now with a wheedling frightened tone to it what i had to laugh at her after you try to fillet the two of us with that boning knife and after the story you told me about what david was trying to do to you you expect me to believe that yes she whispered because its the truth she tried to look back at me over her shoulder i wasnt trying to stab anyone oz i was just furious id forgotten i was holding the knife let me go please i cant do that i told her rickys calling the police apart from anything else youre on bail and we have to hand you over well at least stop holding me so tight i wont do anything silly i promise i thought about it for a bit then finally relented go and sit on that stool i said and keep your hands where i can see them if you try to run for it or have another go at me then i promise you girlie or no girlie i will knock you into the middle of next week she nodded i let her arms go and she did as i had told her she looked up at me through blotchy eyes i really didnt do it she whispered i could see that she was desperate for me to believe her but i couldnt sure i replied i crossed to the kitchen door and shouted to ricky is that tape switched off yes he called back morrows on his way i phoned charlie as well hell go straight to the nick hes not exactly speaking to me oh aye he added the lab reports in that was the weapon all right i closed the door and turned back to alison she was still on the stool behaving herself i guess shed believed what id said about thumping her wise girl now listen to me i told her before the coppers get here you should say nothing at all to them until youve spoken with badenoch again then you should come up with a story that he can use to persuade the fiscal to reduce the charge to culpable homicide rather than murder you went to his house to plead with him he laughed in your face and you just lost it the awl was there on the hall table you just picked it up and swung at him blind with rage you were in such a panic that you took it home with you where it was found by the police i paused to let her think about it that is how it happened isnt it i asked tears started to run slowly down her cheeks she shook her head no it isnt i really didnt do it you have to believe me oz again i thought that if she was acting she was worth a bafta okay lets say for the purposes of this discussion that i do that doesnt matter a damn this is what will happen youll be charged with murder on the basis of whats on that tape the fact that the weapon was found in your house and the fact that you can be placed in the vicinity at the time of death ill almost certainly be called as a witness to what you said earlier and ill have to confirm that the tape hasnt been doctored and that its a true record if i try to add that youre a good wee lass really and that you didnt do it the judge will give me thirty days for contempt long before im out the jury will have brought in a fifteennil verdict of guilty and youll be in cornton vale starting a life sentence its time for damage control alison if the crown offers you a plea to culpable homicide take it charlie will instruct the best criminal qc in the business hell put in a plea in mitigation that will make david capperauld sound like bill sykes and you like nancy with a lot of luck a hell of a lot but its happened before the judge might just take a fancy to you and put you on probation for a couple of years but i cant do that she wailed im innocent until youre proved guilty thats not the way it works love the way the evidence is youre as good as in the prison van already youve got one way to protect yourself use it cooperate and charlie might just get you out on bail until the trial at least she frowned at me after ricky tells them i went for him with that knife that never happened he wont say a word about that otherwise ill tell the world about him giving you one last night hes spent too long rebuilding his reputation to want that to happen as i looked at her i could almost see her brain start to work again i could almost see her start to pick up the pieces of herself and put them back together you really believe thats what i should do yes but dont do it on my word ask charlie what he thinks what if he doesnt agree with you then get another lawyer twentyfive badenoch did agree with me though once morrow had let him read the lab report and had played him what was on the tape he knew what the score was and he advised his client to face the facts i wasnt there when they had that conversation but he told me later that when she protested her innocence he had said straight out that if he found it hard to believe any jury was going to find it impossible he didnt let her make a formal statement to the police but they didnt expect that instead charlie went to the fiscal and told her what the defence would be if she proceeded with a murder charge she weighed the cost of a fullscale trial took an educated guess at the likely verdict and agreed to take a plea to culpable homicide she even told the police not to oppose bail which they had been inclined to do hes some operator that charlie badenoch once the deal had been cut they let me in to see alison again to deliver her some clothes for next day she had to make a formal court appearance next morning and she had opted for a night in the cells rather than the alternative which was still open of going back to rickys place i hoped that to quote the king one night of sin was all hed been praying for because i reckoned sure as hell that was all he was going to get after his trick with the tape i saw her in the usual interview room in the gayfield square office a constable stood on guard outside the door but they gave us privacy after they had checked what was in the bag id brought the police had still been at her house when id got there and they had watched me pack it then it had been searched again at the police station i thought that in the circumstances a cake with a file in it was an unlikely find but theyd given the stuff a goingover nonetheless she was calm even if she still seemed slightly stunned by what had happened do you really think ill get probation she asked me quietly i dont know i told her honestly there are plenty of precedents but it still comes down to what the judge thinks is the punishment that mo fits the crime there are a couple of women on the bench now maybe youll get lucky and draw one of them but i could go to prison i had to tell her the truth i mean i could only jolly her along so far couldnt i yes you could even though i didnt do it i sighed okay if thats the way you want it plead not guilty go back on charlies deal with the fiscal but if it goes to trial and youre convicted even if its only of culpable homicide the judgell throw the book at you you fancy ten years no she whispered her eyes glistening again thats why ive agreed to do as mr badenoch said but it still doesnt make me guilty oz please she begged believe me i have always been a sucker for a crying woman plus she had agreed to the plea she was going to get off lightly so why keep up the pretence now suppose i do i said grudgingly what difference does it make itll make a big difference to me itll mean that theres someone in the world other than my dizzy old mother whos on my side ive never been against you ive never thought you killed him in cold blood i was prepared to accept that you did it in a flash of blind rage at his deceit and his threats to destroy your business just as youre going to admit to in court but if you promise me on your hearts blood that you didnt then ill believe you i swear she burst out in a voice loaded with relief even if i have to go away for a while itll make it easier just knowing that even though ill have nothing when i come out and ill have the bank on my neck ill get through it somehow when you get out tomorrow and go back to the office you might find that youre suddenly in good standing with your bank what do you mean i told her about my meeting with james torrent and about his clearing her outstanding invoices he did that she gasped how did you manage it i take my responsibilities as a director seriously he also told me that youd taken him too literally when he asked you to get ewan capperauld for his ceremony he said he didnt mean it to sound like that and he apologised well it did sound like that she insisted how did you manage all this oz how did you get him to pay especially did you threaten him or something i in i dont think it would be a great idea to threaten that man he may have been impressed by my connection with susie whatever it was i just mentioned your bills sort of in passing and he whistled up payment on the spot the moneys probably there by now her face brightened theres nothing like cash for cheering you up thats great i was going to have to pay someone off at the end of the month now i wont time for a reality reminder i thought dont be so sure youre going to be in court tomorrow and the charge will go public even if the press cant report any details youre going to have a hell of a job holding your clients in those circumstances her sudden burst of optimism was hard to suppress though most of them will stick by me im sure of that and if i can announce that youve become a director thatll convince people too wont it jesus alison it wouldnt even convince me what are my skills im a ham actor thats all but theyll assume youre investing in the business she paused you wouldnt oz would you that was a shot i hadnt been expecting i did some quick thinking what are capperaulds shares worth the auditor valued them at a quarter of a million fine but now hes dead and the business is in trouble offer his estate fifty grand on my behalf and ill pick them up with a formal agreement that you or the company itself will buy them from me at valuation in three years time her eyes narrowed you could make a tidy profit on that when did you pick up the business brain along the way why three years if you do go away i reckon youll be out in a year eighteen months at the most you draw no pay other than what it takes to cover your mortgage and we appoint a manager to run things during that period ill supervise from a distance and keep an eye on the cash when you come out you pick up the reins again and at the agreed time i get paid off what about the bank my managers a grimlooking man he frightens me a bit no problem ill tell them to give you someone who doesnt how can you do that im not without influence by that i mean money its the only language these guys understand i still do most of my banking in edinburgh ill fix it for my guy to take over your account she looked at me as if shed never known me first torrent now this is there anything you couldnt fix i cant fix your problem with your late exfiance ill bet you could if you put your mind to it there was a crafty gleam in her eye now listen i am here to make a movie i am being paid a hell of a lot of money for it im still new to the game and it needs my onehundredpercent attention you want that problem solved hire a detective i dont know any detectives you fucked one last night i pointed out alison did not appreciate that reminder him she exploded ricky after what he did i wouldnt employ him if he was the last private eye on earth okay do your time if you have to ross might be a slippery bastard but he is very good you dont get to be a lothian and borders detective superintendent without being shit hot at the job okay he set you up today and maybe he shouldnt have but he took it hard when he got kicked off the force i reckon he was trying to prove a point still if you want help and hell take it on hes the man itll stick in my throat an unfortunate remark in the circumstances she giggled then suppressed it well if youll talk to him for me ill consider it but where would he begin with the murder weapon if you didnt do it someone planted it in your flat you didnt see any signs of a breakin last thursday or later did you no and i would have all my windows secure from the inside and i always doublelock my door when i go out so how was it done david had a key didnt you ask for it back when he chucked you yes but he still had it the killer must have found it and used it could be will that help she asked brightly who knows but at least its a place to start twentysix ricky wasnt too keen to take the commission when i told him about it later that evening in fact his exact words were no fucking way he hadnt been totally pleased to see me when id rung his bell i think he was still smarting over the way id rung it earlier on when i found out hed recorded my conversation with alison i didnt really feel like apologising for that but i did for her sake sorry about that mate i told him but if i hadnt belted you shed never have believed that i wasnt in on the act as well you think that quick do you he grunted doubtfully as he dug a couple of beers out of his fridge sometimes thatll be right im still not taking the job though of course you are come on ricky you cant turn down a challenge like that ill bet that somewhere inside that conniving head of yours theres a mad dream that your pal the new chief constable might reinstate you in the force if you could pull off something like this he looked at me scornfully theres no chance of that anyway i told you im making too much bloody money to even think about going back in fine so clear alisons name then sell your story to a tabloid you never know miles might even fancy it as a movie plot i saw pound signs rolling in his eyes like twothirds of a onearmed bandit maybe but theres a problem oz she fucking did it i dont think so dont give me it you thought so when you left here you were as sure as me so whats made you change your mind did she flash her eyes at you did she say hold me oz im scared was that it she tried that last sunday and it didnt work no she swore to me on her life that she didnt do it shes taking the plea but she still maintains that shes innocent silly lass shed better shut up or the crown office might hear her and call off the deal he sighed okay if youre convinced ill give it a go i owe her i suppose i feel a bit shitty about the way i set her up did you bug the bedroom as well i asked him jokingly of course i did im not easily surprised any more but that one made me gasp youre serious arent you you were banging her and all the time you were hoping shed confess to murder ricky looked at the floor go on i said get the tape out and play it ive got to hear this i wiped it afterwards he muttered very sanitary of you now get the tape give it up blackstone i feel guilty enough without you taking the piss especially now that im starting to like the girl what after she went for you with that knife mind you thats appropriate i suppose you bone her she tries to bone you ive told you chuck it he shouted but a smile crossed his face at the same time shes got spirit in her has alison she can hide it well at times but its there right im going to help her and whats more ill do it for free so where do we begin youre the detective i know that i was talking to myself not you we start with the murder weapon she didnt kill him so someone must have planted it at her place well go there and look for signs of a breakin i shook my head no youll go there im not involved in this but youll be wasting your time there were no signs of a breakin and there was no need for one either david capperauld still had a key to alisons flat ricky scratched his chin had he now he was even starting to sound like a copper again i know that chin trick i worked for a lawyer once who did something similar in his case he used to light his pipe in the middle of a discussion what he was actually doing was giving himself time to think id better get into his place ross said eventually if the keys missing we need to know that could be a bugger though i dont want ronnie morrow to hear im doing this or it could put alisons deal in jeopardy but i cant break into the place i recalled that once not that many years in the past the same guy had broken into my flat but i let that pass i also let him off the hook not a problem i told him she had a key to his place as well remember that was how we got in last sunday it was on the bunch of keys she gave me today so i could pick up her stuff although as it happened i didnt need them i took a brass chubb key from my pocket laid it on his kitchen worksurface and slid it across to him it isnt there any more ricky whistled and smiled twentyseven he was still smiling when he stepped out of the lift next morning i wasnt though i had phoned susie as i was having breakfast and told her how the alison thing had developed all of it not to put too fine a point on it she had done her nut youre telling me that this woman one of your many old flames is about to plead guilty to killing her boyfriend youve taken his place on the board of their company and youre in the process of buying his shares in the business at a knockdown price how the hell do you think thats going to look to the police when they find out are you completely off your head that aspect hadnt occurred to me for one second put it that way and the answers yes i probably am but ive made the offer love i cant back down now dont love me youre a director of the gantry group whats trouble for you is trouble for me tell me straight are you still lusting after this woman no im not i never did either just as well for you or id cut your balls off now you must get out of this daft agreement now how am i going to do that without leaving her in the lurch ill put up the fifty grand or whatever figure the boys estate settles for eventually ill advance the money to her solicitor in confidence and hell buy the shares on my behalf she can repay me on the same basis you agreed ill protect myself by putting my own accountants in place to oversee the business but no arguments oz thats whats going to happen but why would you do that for her i wouldnt im doing it for you why because youre the father of my daughter and i wont let you make such an arse of yourself and thats all an intake of breath so deep that it sounded like a wave winding up to crash on to a beach no because i love you and i dont want you to get into any more trouble than you can help after that i had to agree i was still thinking about it when miles phoned from the caledonian hotel to say that he and dawn had checked in and when ricky ross rang the entry phone buzzer at ten minutes to ten what i was thinking about was being my own man whats tickling you i asked him i went to david capperaulds place he answered he had her key all right hed still have it if he was alive it was in his kitchen cupboard hanging on a row of hooks with lots of other keys every one of them was on a ring with a plastic tag with a label in it hers said alison i took it up to her flat and tried it to make sure then i put it back where it was his door key was hanging there too labelled spare whoever killed him must have taken a look around or known where to look found alisons key there and used it to get in to plant the awl at her place and then put it back i said that was bloody crafty it doesnt really help her at all does it yes it does everything helps oz everything that backs up an alternative solution to the one the police are going for it doesnt prove anything but it suggests something if we can gather in more suggestions enough of them we can maybe okay its a big maybe we can undermine the prosecution case he smirked again theres another thing i dusted the key with powder and lifted a couple of prints from it they might just be capperaulds but i dont think they are what makes you so sure because i took prints from the razor i found in his bathroom and from his shaving gel canister they dont match none of them maybe theyre alisons theyre not how do you know i printed the knife she tried to slice me with i was impressed clever bastard eh ricky i have my moments okay so where to now cid manual page two he replied ill check on known associates there were no signs of a breakin at capperaulds house either so whoever did it he let in there not just that from the position of the wound he didnt feel threatened because he turned his back on him how do you start tracing them ill talk to alison once she gets he was interrupted by the entry phone i picked it up said lift top floor pressed the button to release the lock then walked across to the front door and wedged it open less than two minutes later slightly blearyeyed but still tanned and looking rockhard as ever miles grayson stepped into the apartment miles and i greeted each other like longlost brothers which was not a million miles away from what we still were then i introduced him to his new security consultant the change in ricky was instantaneous id never seen him awestruck before or even nervous but he was right then miles can have that effect on people the first time i met him was in the bar of a hotel in connell ferry he bought me a pint hes always buying me beer its the australian in him so youre mr ross he said its good to meet you in the flesh after all these years ricky blanched so miles had remembered their first indirect encounter and his phone call to the chief constable dont worry he laughed breaking the tension i dont let personal things get in the way of business unless theyre really personal i hired you on mark kravitzs recommendation thats always good enough for me oz tells me youve been a big help already in smoothing a couple of things over ricky grunted and gave me what might have been a nod of thanks then again it might have been a bad attempt at a headbutt ive already met the guy youve assigned to dawn and me he was waiting at the caledonian as you said he would be ive left him there with dawn word will get around that weve moved in so its as well that he stays with her ross nodded yes hes a good guy is mike reilly hes exarmy and he did a stint in the sas mark sent him to me when he was mustered out my people are a mix of expolice and exmilitary none of them are gungho types but they can do the business if they have to none of them are carrying are they asked miles no sir thats illegal in this country i know thats why i asked they dont the people who are with you dont need them people i asked brucie has his own minder up at auchterarder miles explained as backup to his nurse i felt my eyebrows go up his nurse miles grinned marias a fully qualified childrens nurse she was also an undercover officer with the lapd she was a detective sergeant working south central los angeles when we hired her out of there then the smile vanished people like us oz we cant be too careful were the superrich and to the wrong people that can make our children valuable commodities a cold shiver ran through me i thought of wee janet and of ethel reid facing up to a determined kidnapper in a block to which there was relatively easy access for anyone seriously inclined to get in i decided that susie and i would have to discuss that as soon as possible between us we were worth more than a pound or two miles looked around the apartment then took in the view from the big window hey he exclaimed youve struck it lucky with this place pretty damn good better than a hotel you and dawn can have it if you like i offered in a flash of toadying generosity that drew me a sidelong glance from ricky i can always stay at susies and commute thats good of you buddy but you stay here its ideal for the sort of cast gettogether were having this afternoon if were using it for that id rather not live here as well fine i dont mind cleaning up the leftover sandwiches he laughed dont worry thats down to the caterers by the way my assistant followed up that contact you gave me the asian firm but theyre too small we need a specialist operation one that can keep the cast and crew especially the crew fed and happy all hours of the day and night and therell be quite a few night shots on this one he paused okay this afternoons meeting mr ross hey what do i call you is it still superintendent not for a while now ricky usually gets my attention fine ricky i want all your people here so that everyone knows from the start wholl be looking after them and whos looking after everyone else well start at twothirty sharp id have made it two but our star is having lunch with his agent he made a sound that i took to be disapproval and glanced at me have you met capperauld yet no only his dead cousin you may have seen the family at its best he said emphatically uhh miles grinned maybe im being unkind ewans an actor of the old school or he thinks he is at least im a moviemaker i havent been on the boards in twenty years and ive never done anything like the west end or broadway ive used him once before and he was a royal pain in the ass he made it clear that he didnt regard me as qualified to direct him i made it clear that i was qualified to pay his fee and that that allowed for everything else hes going to look down on me from a great height then hed better not try i dont allow that on my movies from anyone but the word on the grapevine is that hes usually in humble mode just now being nice to everyone because hes next in line for a knighthood a couple of the old acting sirs have fallen off the perch lately so theres maybe a vacancy whos his agent that he has you reschedule for him for her its his wife margaret youre kidding couldnt they have had a working breakfast then a good question but ewan said that shes going back to london to work on the negotiations for his next two projects and that they have a lot to discuss shes a very capable woman is mrs capperauld shes as imposing as he is in her own way they make quite a team he chuckled fuck it oz ill humour him for now once i start spending real money ill have less time for any shit but the thing is hes the obvious man for the part i wouldnt have done this project if i hadnt been able to get him youve read skinner i nodded he is skinner in that case i thought he must be one impressive actor twentyeight he was when he walked out of the lift and across the hall into the apartment five minutes after twothirty i almost said hello bob id seen him on screen before and on television in costume parts contemporary parts comedy and tragedy in all of them hed looked handsome and slightly patrician a tall darkhaired man in early middle age the ewan capperauld who walked into my apartment was tall okay around sixtwo but that was as far as the comparison went his hair was steelgrey flopping loosely over his forehead his shoulders were wide and he walked looselimbed almost like a gunfighter it was a mild autumn day yet he wore a long black leather overcoat he looked as if he had stepped straight off the front page of skinners rules hello mr director he said spotting him across the room and extending a hand his accent had the same rough edges as the rest of him i took a closer look at his face and found myself wondering if his nose had always been just a bit off the straight or if hed had that done for the part as well hi ewan miles responded he looked him up and down then smiled i knew youd put in an appearance he turned to me i cast this guy in kidnapped and he turned up for the first meeting in highland dress he glanced around the room everyone else had turned up on time and was munching on sandwiches and drinking champagne the conversation had stopped though they were all staring at the newcomer scott steele was standing at my elbow fucking poser he muttered he was enough of an actor to make sure that his voice carried but capperauld never even twitched can i have your attention please miles called out unnecessarily dawn scott youve worked with ewan before but let me introduce everyone else he went round all the cast members one by one the star greeted us with a nod of the head held eyecontact for precisely two seconds then moved on to the next when the hellos were over he crossed to dawn took her hand and kissed it my dear he murmured how good to see you again im pleased you remember me ewan i heard her answer i guessed she was speaking the truth for she had told me five minutes earlier that she had never exchanged a word with capperauld while they were making kidnapped i hadnt been sure how dawn would greet me but shed been okay have you heard from prim id asked her i saw her the day before we left is she happy she says so are you i think slightly stunned covers the way i feel the baby is just great but i dont have to tell you that and her mother shes great too thats good i hope it works out for you its best that the pretendings over between you and my sister actors do enough of that in their working lives without having to face it at home too that was the most profound thing id ever heard dawn say when i met her she was just an exceptionally pretty face now there was a lot more going on behind it okay miles called again attention please everyone theres a lot of us here and i want everyone to know where everyone else fits in for a start theres the author of the book were filming he pointed briefly to his left towards a big grizzled middleaged guy with a mediterranean tan who was leaning against the wall nursing a glass of champagne which he waved vaguely in acknowledgement he isnt going to be riding shotgun on the production but hell be free to join us on set any time he likes he turned and beckoned towards a corner of the big room now i want to introduce mr richard ross hes our head of security and hes going to explain a few things to you hes a former edinburgh detective i guess you could say he used to be bob skinner in real life ricky liked that one i could tell as he stepped into the circle thank you mr grayson he began then looked around the group he was dressed to impress but in a different way from ewan capperauld he wore razorpressed slacks and a doublebreasted blue blazer with gold buttons embossed with a crest which i guessed belonged to one of edinburghs better golf clubs ill begin by putting you at your ease my firm hasnt been hired because of any perceived security threat were here as a precaution to guard against one that comes out of the blue our remit is to ensure that everything goes smoothly for the production and for its key people as individuals good pitch ricky i was feeling reassured already ill have a staff of five attached to the production theyre all expolice or exarmed forces theyre all here and i want to introduce them now first mike reilly a stocky man with light red hair and piercing blue eyes stepped forward and nodded mike will be responsible for mr and mrs graysons welfare round the clock next glen oliver big muscular fairhaired late twenties soft features hard eyes glen will cover mr capperauld third john takei oriental a small darkhaired package hell be looking after mr katayama the japanese actor a beaming man in his late fifties nodded to his minder and bowed finally alan graham and mandy ofarrell the first early thirties sloping shoulders tired eyes no obvious threat but he wouldnt have been there if he didnt possess one the second late twenties around six feet tall blonde and tanned angular features long hardedged martial artists hands alan and mandy will be responsible for mr steele mr massey ms waitrose and mr blackstone ricky looked around us all theyll never be far away and youll be given mobile phone numbers you can call if you feel under threat or youre being harassed by a persistent member of the public rhona waitrose grabbed my arm and squeezed hey this is cool she whispered ive never had my body guarded before i looked down at her in the flesh she was much shorter than she appeared on screen but just as pretty youll have had volunteers though i murmured yes she chuckled but i find that conscripts are best ricky looked across at liam matthews the wrestler was standing beside masahi katayama before the briefing had begun they had been speaking in japanese liam spent a few years on their sports entertainment circuit which can be very bloody indeed i hope you dont feel left out mr matthews he said ill give you cover while youre here if youd like it but i assumed you can handle your own security but sir liam replied at his most irish didnt oz tell you its all faked that got a laugh but ive seen my friend in real action i know what he can do when the crew is at work ricky continued our people will be there well work in cooperation with the police of course and between us well see to it that you can work without interruption any questions he asked i stuck my hand up if we are harassed by a persistent member of the public what will your people do he looked at me deadpan deal with it how by whatever means is appropriate within the letter of the law okay suppose my sister visits me one day and has a go at me as she often does im concerned about the form of your reaction will you do anything without my sayso absolutely not oz thank christ for that you dont have enough people here to handle my sister i wouldnt like to see any of them getting hurt ricky gave me a weak smile mandy ofarrell shot me a look that said i could take your sister any time i doubted that but i grinned back at her okay said miles seizing the moment to move on thats security now the rest of the team he went on to introduce ben cain the production designer dario de luise the chief cameraman phyllis baxter the unit publicist whod been given a reprieve after the dropped ball over the scotsman story and gail driver his and dawns personal assistant i knew all of them from previous projects and so did most of the cast the rest of the people on the team youll meet on sunday he paused and looked around us yes folks sunday thats the big day filming begins at seven am in advocates close off the high street those of you who are involved thats ewan dawn and oz who dont know the layout should familia rise yourselves with it before then tomorrow we begin rehearsals scene by scene ewan capperauld frowned rehearsals he boomed without a trace of a scottish accent i thought of dame edith evans and handbags thats what i said thats the way i plan to do it ive hired a firstfloor auditorium in the assembly rooms in george street for the purpose i want everyone there tomorrow at nine no excuses now enjoy the food and the fizz especially the fizz itll be the last you see for a while anyone whos worked with me before will know that all my sets are dry as he finished he looked at our star then beckoning him to follow moved towards the window where scott rhona and i were standing here the actress whispered have you read the script yes i replied what about our scene where we get up close and intimate thats not in the book true whatll the author think the money hes getting he wont think a fucking thing rhona chuckled im looking forward to it mind we can rehearse in private if you want would that make me a conscript it might i thought about that for a while when i looked down again she wasnt there i hadnt seen any signal but i guessed there had been one for she was off heading for dawn bill massey and masahi katayama leaving miles ewan scott and me in a group ive never seen miles grayson lose his cool but that doesnt make him any sort of a soft touch when he was younger in his preacting days he did some stuff with the aussie special forces and he is a very tough guy indeed listen ewan he said very quietly but in a way that got my attention straight away weve had this argument once before lets have it again one last time i do not believe in going to sleep on a grudge far less going into a multimillion dollar project on the back of one so if youve got something to say spit it out all three of us looked at capperauld he stared out of the window for a few moments then shrugged his shoulders okay miles if you insist i believe that film should be spontaneous i do not think that professional actors necessarily need to rehearse every minute scene before they step on to the sound stage and i regard the suggestion that we do as mildly insulting he paused to steele and me at least s hey boy scott bristled but i put my hand on his sleeve to stop him whereas for a fucking amateur like me its okay yes i asked the way ewan looked down his slightly crooked nose at me i thought about bending it some more to really make him look the part if you put it that way far be it from me to contradict he exclaimed loud enough for ricky ross and glen oliver to look in our direction okay said miles now that shits been dumped lets flush it away okay the last thing im going to do ewan is tell you how to act so you afford me the same courtesy in three out of the last five years ive directed the worlds top grossing movies that indicates to me at least that i know what im doing so if i say we rehearse every scene thats what we do furthermore a big word for an aussie i thought ive cast every featured player in this project personally forget what itll say on the credits the agency found the bit players thats all you might be getting more money than anyone else ewan but every member of the cast has equal status in my eyes and this is the really important bit in each others eyes as well when we worked together before you were in and out in a couple of days so maybe you werent there long enough to get to understand what im about my fathers a socialist politician in australia and thats how i was brought up theres no class system in my life or on my sets ive never hung a star on a dressingroom door in my life and when its been done for me ive ripped them down for the record oz is here because hes fucking good just as everyone else is he can play andy martin better than you or scott just as you can play your parts better than him because youve each been chosen specifically for them he fixed ewan with a steady eye so mate this is how it is i wouldnt have started this project if you hadnt agreed to do it now im committed but i wont do it with a star whos disrespectful to his fellow actors or who tries to undermine me as producer or director if you cant live with that ill negotiate the terms of your withdrawal with margaret i felt scott stiffen beside me i held my breath i could barely believe it but britains number one alist movie actor had just been threatened with his p and whod play skinner asked capperauld icily clearly he didnt believe it at all the biggest name in movies miles replied miles grayson ill make an early script change to account for the accent and ill do your part myself i think ewan was about to tell him that he couldnt do that when he realised that he could in the event he stopped himself at you we had one of those long silences the kind in which you swear you can hear peoples brains whirring and clicking miles stood there straightfaced with his back to the window capperauld looked at him then through the glass at the scott monument then at scott steele who can be a bit of a monument himself at times finally he did something that took me by surprise he turned to me and offered his hand im sorry oz he said the scottish accent was back i guess ive been living in london too long sometimes i forget myself and turn into a real fucking lovey that was an insult and i apologise to you too miles i looked at him to be sure he wasnt taking the piss when i was i accepted his handshake i got my first job by accident he went on as a boy in the very early days of take the high road you know the scottish soap a couple of years later i landed a film part ive seen your first movie you were a fucking sight better in that than i was in mine and ive still never been to drama college miles patted him on the shoulder thats why you dont believe in rehearsals mate he flashed him a grin the one that lights up rooms and makes him tower over everyone around him even though hes really shorter than most of them now thats sorted you guys get to know each other scott you come with me and meet masahi son the venerable actor beamed i did a war movie with him in malaysia over twenty years ago when you were still working on the docks in sydney you come with me and ill introduce you properly they wandered off leaving me alone with ewan half hoping that rhona waitrose would come back she didnt though not then how did your toronto stint go he asked conversationally pretty well i think the offers are rolling in anyway im going back to canada after this one ewan nodded the way things are headed well all be working there soon no they dont do beaches they do everything its a big place one of the catering staff who had taken over my kitchen passed by and offered us more champagne as she was filling our glasses another came up with a tray full of savouries i grabbed a couple with my free hand i read in the scotsman that youre an old acquaintance of the woman whos been charged with doing for my late cousin my new friend murmured as they moved on to the next group alison yes we had a relationship a few years back poor lass he chuckled not on that score i rush to say no i meant poor lass that she was mixed up with our david do you think she did it shes going to plead guilty to culpable homicide as we call manslaughter in scotland its on that understanding shes been charged with that and not murder mmm copping a plea as the americans say i hope the court goes easy on her then you seem to know a bit about it i nodded i do ive been trying to help her shes afraid that her business will go down the tubes even if she doesnt go to jail ive been trying to set it up so that it doesnt even if she does well if theres anything i can do to help you only have to ask i looked at him you serious absolutely well if youd agree to perform the opening ceremony at james torrents new corporate headquarters youd be helping her bigtime torrent the office equipment man he frowned furrowing his brow thinking something over yes ill do that for her i was slightly stunned will you thats great im seeing her this evening ill tell her itll brighten whats been a pretty traumatic day youre seeing her in prison no at her office she appeared in court this morning and the sheriff let her out on bail thats good i hope it goes well with her his concern seemed genuine alison told me you didnt like your cousin she wasnt kidding was she no she was not the little bastard made a pass at my wife once about ten years ago at a family gathering i caught him at it and i thumped him he told his parents my aunt and uncle a pack of lies he accused me of touching up his girlfriend would you believe my uncle tackled me about it and i told him that his son was a lying little shit and left it at that id forgotten about it inside a week but not david though he kept the bad feeling going his father and my father have been at odds over it ever since when he and alison started in business i thought it was a chance to heal the breach so i called him and offered to support them financially and with contacts he told me to fuck off he laughed and shook his head what an idiot he paused why did she do it do they reckon he twotimed her then broke off their engagement he put the screws on her over the business after that he was trying to force her to buy his shares for more than they were worth at least thats what theyre saying thats typical of the little bastard ive never met the girl you know but she didnt deserve him no one did he frowned again then nodded as if another decision had been made ill tell you what when you see her would you put a proposition to her id like to renew my offer of help if the business is saveable and if my unlamented cousins shares are still available ill buy them at an independent valuation obviously i wont be actively involved but ill let her keep the capperauld name above the door he looked at me do you think shed consider that i whistled i think shell jump at it ewan itll be great news for her i couldnt help thinking that it would be great news for susie as well i looked him in the eye a quarter of an hour before id been ready to deck him now hed turned out to be not such a bad guy after all ill tell her tonight assuming she agrees ill arrange for you to meet you do that why dont you make it here at eight tomorrow morning that early of course he chuckled it wouldnt do for us to be late for miless bloody rehearsals twentynine alisons office was one stair up in an undistinguished terrace on the south side of york place but i guessed that with its city centre location it was costing her a packet in rent the nameplates on the street entrance and outside her glasspanelled door must have been pricey items too i suggested as much when she let me in yes she said mournfully i suppose ill have to change them now not necessarily i replied how did it go in court she shuddered it was scary they led me up into the dock i said yes when the clerk asked me if i was who i was and again when the sheriff asked me if i understood the charge otherwise that was it mr badenoch made a short speech about my unblemished character then he asked for bail the fiscal didnt oppose and that was it im back again in six weeks when ill be asked to plead ive had to surrender my passport but there were no other conditions i dont have to sleep with ricky she snorted or anything like that i dont recall that being a condition the last time i reminded her the way i heard it that was all your idea well it was a bad one she sniffed even if it did prick his conscience into trying to help me that prick has no conscience you can talk anyway i suppose hes not that bad she poured me a mug of coffee from her filter added milk without asking and handed it to me he was here half an hour ago she said smoothing out her long straight skirt she looked not half bad in that and a sleeveless blouse he told me what hed found out about the key at davids flat and about the fingerprints he lifted from it it was real private eye stuff did you use to do that oz when you were in that business you know damn well i was never in that business i just worked for lawyers thats all sure i believed that too until ricky told me different he said that you were mixed up in a murder after you and i split up and that for a while he thought you might have had a hand in it i think he still half believes that but hes wrong youre mixed up in one now no you are he is im not im not involved what else did he tell you nothing he asked for a list of davids friends that was all was it much of a list she gave a short brittle laugh and shook her head not really i gave him three no four names to be going on with but the only really close friend among them was don kennedy she looked at me as if she expected me to know him i looked back at her blankly which don kennedy you know the golfer oh that don kennedy id heard of him right enough hed won quite a few events in europe and one in the states he was a ryder cup player but he wasnt exactly a household name at least not in any household id ever had the thought of households took me back to susie and our conversation that morning by coincidence alison arrived in the same vicinity at the same time what did you mean earlier she asked when you said i wouldnt necessarily have to change the nameplates i meant i told her that you have the most unlikely fairy godfather you could ever have imagined except that i wouldnt really say hes a fairy just a bit arch from time to time i told her all about my encounter with ewan capperauld in detail piece by piece when i got to where he agreed without a murmur to open james torrents building she gasped with surprise shouted yes and jumped up and down when i got to the end and his offer to buy his cousins stake in the business and put his own name behind it she looked at me in total amazement for a few seconds then threw herself at me and kissed me shed never done it like that in the old days this was a real tongueticklingtonsils job she didnt stop there either there wasnt an interesting piece of her that wasnt pressed and writhing against me eventually i peeled her off not too soon though for i was enjoying it a fact of which she must have been aware you are the most surprising wonderful man she whispered make love to me i held her away from me come on now i told her if you want to tuck someone to celebrate fuck ewan its only right hes the guy making the offer she smiled at me very definitely alison mark two yes but hes not here she began to unbutton her blouse something made me stop her susies face in my minds eye or maybe it was a subconscious image of her and ricky ross thanks again but no thanks you really are serious about this woman in glasgow arent you i was and it was worrying me no i just want you to be fresh for your meeting with ewan tomorrow morning eight oclock at my place she was still incredulous he wants to meet me of course if youre interested in his offer if im what of course im interested ill jump at it or for it i muttered but she didnt pick it up she was too busy planning ahead eight oclock she said mmm thats early oz maybe i could stay at your place tonight that would make sense maybe to you but it might not sound too sensible to me she waved a hand at me dont worry about your virtue itll be safe with me i wasnt sure id been in that situation before with susie and it hadnt been please she whispered last night was awful really in that cell i really dont fancy being on my own at home not yet i gave in okay i said but im warning you ill be locking my bedroom door i dont think she believed me we did a driveby of her place and picked up some fresh clothes for the morning plus her toothbrush and cosmetics i didnt notice her packing anything that looked like a nightdress but i let that pass it was going on for nine when we got back to the mound when i showed her the spare room and dumped her bag there alison smiled in a way that told me she didnt regard the subject as closed i still did i checked my resolve and found it holding up under the pressure we were both hungry but i didnt fancy cooking that late so i called the ever reliable pizza hut and ordered up a double whopper stuffed crust whatever no garlic please paid by credit card there were a couple of bottles of bollinger in the fridge left over from the afternoon i opened one poured two glasses then settled down to watch some obscure football match on channel with the sound turned down so that the awful screaming commentator didnt get on my tits the entry buzzer went ten minutes later alison jumped up i thought she was going to answer it but instead she headed for her room i picked up the phone myself and heard a female voice say pizza managing to make even those two syllables sound broad edinburgh top floor i grunted then pressed the buzzer and as had become my habit opened the front door ready for the lifts arrival i was looking out of the window as i heard it open but the voice from behind still took me by surprise my whos the hungry one then outside the lift closed again and headed for the street i turned to see rhona waitrose with a pizza hut carrier balanced on the tips of the fingers of her right hand and what looked like a script held in her left it was remarkable that i noticed these things for she was wearing a pair of black patent shoes a shiny raincoat which hung open and nothing else i thought we might do a bit of early rehearsing she said brightly then her smile faded as alison walked back into the room she was dressed much the same as rhona minus the raincoat and the shoes and she was holding a champagne glass between breasts that did indeed seem to have grown since the last time id seen them only i see youre auditioning this evening the pizza delivery girl finished my mistake sorry hold on i said weakly its no mistake she brightened up ah well the actress chuckled im all for improvisation in my work she looked at alison who seemed slightly bewildered but not too bothered by the newcomer what do you think dear does one go into two we take what we can get my ex replied positively i thought through my options i didnt fancy any of them well thats not true i fancied both of them but not in the same room at the same time can i just settle for the pizza i suggested and let you girls sort things out for yourselves they both laughed in a tinkling harmony then the bells stopped ringing as the lift opened again someone left the street door open susie called out as she walked in through the open door carrying her overnight bag surp ive never seen a volcano erupt but if i ever do then like the song says it wont impress me much not after seeing susie go instantly ballistic you bastard she screamed as she dropped the bag and advanced on me you indescribable fucking bastard i am mug enough to fall for you and to think that you feel the same way about me so i come through to bring some joy into your lonely life and what do i find youre waist deep in fucking whores hey wait a minute rhona protested susie didnt even turn to look at her she just threw out a hand behind her with a pointing finger on the end you shut your mouth she commanded rhona obeyed as for alison she just stood there her mouth was still hanging open but no sound was coming out love i pleaded with her this is not what it seems i wondered idly whether going down on my knees would help but i decided that it would only make it easier for her to punch me in the mouth well what the fuck is it then which scene in your bloody movie is this behind her the door slammed shut we all looked towards it the tall angular figure of mandy ofarrell stared back at us i was hugely relieved to see that she was fully clothed even if she was as astonished as the rest of us jesus christ she boomed in her full rich contralto is there no security in this bloody building i took advantage of susies momentary distraction to seize her firmly by the arm and march her towards my bedroom mandy i called over my shoulder get these two out of here dressed or otherwise alison go home go to ross go wherever you bloody like but be back here for eight tomorrow morning and rhona leave the fucking pizza i shoved susie into my bedroom closed the door behind us locked it and turned back to face her just in time for a small bare foot to slam into my testicles and take my mind completely off everything else that had happened that evening thirty it took me three minutes before i could think of anything but the pain and another two before i could even begin to croak let alone speak fortunately id fallen backwards against the bedroom door making it impossible for susie to get out it took me another fifteen minutes for me to get her to begin to believe me and the best part of an hour before she was completely convinced even then but if i hadnt walked in id have eaten the pizza love honest you can have it now then if those bitches havent nicked it she smiled at me afterwards if youre really lucky you can have me i do not think i have ever felt more relieved in my life we decided to change the order of events later quite a while later i went out to check that mandy had indeed evicted the visitors and to recover susies bag from the living room the pizza was intact if stone cold i squeezed it into the oven to reheat then checked the champagne on the kitchen counter it was warm and flat but it was still bolly so i poured us a couple of glasses and carried them back into the living room susie was waiting for me in a blue silk dressing gown sitting on the sofa with her legs tucked under her i handed her a glass she sampled it and frowned were you wasting this on that cow alison i was being hospitable i told her that was all i take it she was the one without the raincoat the one with the fake knockers how do you know theyre fake she snorted at her age if they were real theyd have started the long sad journey south like mine i sat beside her and nuzzled my forehead against them theyve got a long way to go honey you say the nicest things i might just stay the night stay for good i suggested we could move janet and ethel through here a nice idea but i cant ive still got a business to run and anyway id cramp your bloody style i dont have a style to cramp not any more i looked at her you scare me shitless you know i told her good she retorted with a grin thats the way it should be not that i believe it mind i know you oz blackstone i wont catch you offguard again i didnt mean that i meant that the way i feel about you scares me does it make you happy as well though does it conjure up pictures of a house in the country and two point four kids three point four actually be brave then face up to the prospect of life with me think how brave im being im taking a chance on a guy who slept with someone else on his honeymoon yeah but it was you i slept with so i left her smiling and went off to dish up the pizza i cut it into segments and laid them on a kitchen tray then i picked up the champagne and carried the lot through rhona waitrose hasnt changed susie said when i got back i was taken by surprise you know her before she got mildly famous she used to sing with a band in glasgow they played at a club i used to go to when i was fancy free she practically screwed the guitarist on stage and they said that off stage she screwed the whole bloody band you tell her from me that if she comes near you again i will fix her big time i think she may have worked that out i said but ill tell her discreetly you do that the other slut alison shes the one in whose business i was going to be daft enough to invest is she thats her she doesnt need our help any more though i told her about ewan capperaulds unexpected galahad act very noble she murmured whats he like the great man takes a bit of getting to know but hes all right once the ice is broken i told her about his runin with miles she whistled silly man then your friend mr grayson is definitely not someone i would cross theres something lethal behind that smile she frowned hes a bit like you in that respect i didnt know whether that was a compliment or not but eventually i decided that coming from susie it probably was we finished the pizza and bolly then went back to bed i set the alarm for sixfortyfive and we made love until we fell asleep when darren adam woke me next morning on radio forth susie was up and in the shower i decided that i liked that it felt like home but maybe i also liked just a wee bit the fact that she was going back to glasgow and leaving me to my own life hell i didnt know she was ready for the road by quarter to eight having called ethel to make sure that the baby was okay when will i see you again she asked as we stood waiting for the lift the first chance i get i promised and i meant it listening to susie talk to the nanny made me realise how much i wanted to see my daughter again too ill see how today goes if it works out maybe ill be able to come through tonight not tomorrow night though the fun starts on sunday morning very early she smiled sometime id like to come through and watch you work would that be okay could you fix it with miles yes i reckon i could once i see the schedule well set something up the lift arrived i put a foot in the door to hold it her eyes narrowed as a thought crossed her mind here she muttered that rhona waitrose do you and she get to you know what i mean weve got a clinch later on nothing horizontal though and we both get to keep our kit on hmmph susie grunted thatll be a change for her she patted my chest right im off before i go though ill make you a promise no more surprises thinking about it i suppose i was taking a lot for granted no i said i loved your being here eventually she patted my groin sorry about the kick in the balls it didnt do any lasting damage though in fact i stopped her with a kiss and pushed her into the lift ewan capperauld arrived ten minutes later shaved scrubbed and still wearing that black leather coat i gave him coffee and offered him toast he declined in favour of the last wedge of cold pizza which he spotted on the work surface i was getting to like the man more by the day he was halfway through it when the buzzer sounded again package for you said ricky ross bring her up then no ill put her in the lift he said tersely its a bit early for me to be mopping up blood i was waiting when alison arrived wearing the clothes she had picked out the night before youd better not be mad at me i warned her she smiled im not i just told ricky i was you went to his place then i asked that mandy girl to take me there she phoned him first and he said it was okay what an action woman she is by the way although nothing compared to your girlfriend did you calm her down eventually no thanks to you and that other one yes alison exclaimed what a brazen cow she is jesus i gave up and ushered her into the apartment ewan was still in the kitchen demolishing the last of the pizza i introduced alison who switched into business mode straight away she handled it just right i thought letting him realise that she knew how important he was but that she was not about to be overawed i went off to shower and shave i took my time over it leaving them alone for as long as i could when i got back their deal appeared to be done for they were shaking hands ewan looked at me as i came back into the room what do you think the chances are of the judge going easy he asked me dropping into his skinner accent pretty good the crown office is making all the right noises alisons lawyers pretty confident that they wont press for a jail sentence your involvement will probably help too if youre happy to have it mentioned in court that is he shrugged no problem he glanced back at alison who is your lawyer by the way his name is charles badenoch ewan laughed suddenly what a fucking village this is he exclaimed i was at heriots with charlie he was the classroom lawyer even then he used to defend guys who were accused of misdemeanours by the prefects he got a few off too until he became a prefect himself then he switched to the prosecution side he glanced at his watch then pushed himself up from the dining table at which they had been sitting come on oz he said glen oliver my minder is waiting downstairs in the car well give you a lift to the assembly rooms after weve dropped alison at her office mustnt keep the director waiting if we did that i doubt if even charlie could get us off thirtyone as it turned out we made it to the assembly rooms a couple of minutes ahead of miles and dawn the whole cast was there in a big upstairs room with a chandelier apart from liam matthews who had so few speaking scenes that he had cut a deal with miles allowing him to turn up for rehearsals only a day before he was due to shoot those of us who were there were each given a copy of the shooting schedule by gail driver it isnt invariable that the first scene in a movie is the one thats shot first but that was convenient in this case and so that was how it would be done i had thought that we might launch straight into rehearsal but miles began by gathering us all round as he had done the day before in my apartment this time he ran through the script himself from start to finish describing each of the locations we would use and giving us a picture of how he saw our work developing that took up most of the morning we didnt break for coffee until almost midday i had just picked up a mug and a couple of biscuits when rhona waitrose tapped me on the shoulder i took a quick look to see that she was respectable then gave her a noncommittal hello too bad about last night she murmured too right i replied maybe just a bit tersely my nuts may never be the same rhona winced sorry about that she paused that was susie gantry wasnt it from glasgow shes your girlfriend i nodded twice i remember her when her old man was king of the city before he had his breakdown and got put away she had guys swarming after her like wasps but she never gave any of them as much as a sniff none of them pushed it too hard either her father had shall we say a certain reputation he still has but hes not her father susies adopted lucky girl then falling heir to all that not at all she works hard she saved that business after jacks trouble have we fucked it up between you two me and that other girl who was she anyway the way it looked when i came in you and she were getting ready to make the beast with two backs she was an accident waiting to happen as it did happen i was getting ready for nothing but pizza how did you get the box anyway i saw the kid arrive and i just asked him if it was for you by any chance i got lucky you wont say that if you ever meet susie again since you asked no things are not bust between us she whistled you are one smooth bastard she said a little too loudly for my liking if you managed to talk your way out of that mandy ofarrell was on duty with the rest of the minder team rhonas voice must have reached her for she looked over her shoulder and smiled at me i excused myself to my costar and walked across to her she was standing between alan graham and mike reilly but she turned away from them as i approached i should thank you for last night i said quietly she looked at me her smile even wider her eyes very attractive blue eyes sparkling its all part of the service how did you happen to turn up there anyway i was keeping an eye on rhona i saw her pull her trick with the pizza delivery boy then i saw her unbutton her raincoat that told me the whole story id have left you to it but that other girl turned up and followed her into the building without using a key i watched her and i saw her get into your lift so maybe i was planning a foursome if you had been id have apologised and left she chuckled but i knew who the second woman was with rhona having her goodies on display and knowing what i know about her i guessed there could be trouble so i used my initiative you seem to know a lot about us all i did my research thats part of the job too alison was a surprise though that one every day another surprise whats her connection with my boss mandy asked thats a long story ill let him tell you is he trying to keep her out of the slammer or put her there ill pass on that too she looked as if she might have pressed me further but right at that moment miles called us all back on parade in planning the project he had decided that as much of the film as possible should be shot on location thats the way he usually works and given the backdrops that edinburgh offers it would have been a shame to do otherwise on this one for a while he had harboured a wild hope that he would have been allowed to shoot in the real police hq building but not even he had the clout to pull that off instead he had rented part of a rambling college building on the south side of the city and an authentic office was being set up there our first stop though was advocates close which connects the high street with cockburn street below and which takes its name i guess from the fact that in old edinburgh it was a favourite route of scottish barristers on their way from their new town homes to work in the supreme courts the book that we were filming opens there with a headless body right on page one a little bloody one might think but the victim turns out to have been a lawyer so that as far as most people are concerned made him fair game ewan was scheduled to make his big entrance as bob skinner right at the start with me hustling about as andy martin and dawn on hand as dr sarah grace the sceneofcrime examiner who also happens to be skinners piece on the side the script called for a degree of horizontal contact between ewan and dawn those scenes would be filmed on a specially built part of our leased college and were marked on the schedule as closed set that meant that only those with an absolute need to be there would get to see the producer directors wife in the scud i noticed that miles had ruled himself out from that part of the movie the scenes were to be directed by dawn herself however he was involved in our first scene and that was the one he rehearsed hardest in the assembly rooms that morning and afternoon we had to use a bit of imagination to transport the chandelier to the gloomy advocates close but he had brought along a prosthetic head which we would use in the real thing to give us a bit of added colour eventually he was happy with the way we were playing the thing especially with a scene in which skinner delivers a dressing down to an overenthusiastic young copper the rest of the cast had been rehearsing their own opening lines and scenes in other parts of the room finally he stood everyone down but us come on he said to ewan dawn and me and to the supporting players lets take a run up there now and look at the real thing do it today and we can all have tomorrow off with that incentive all of us and our minders piled into two of the fleet of peoplemovers which he had hired the city was really behind us i guessed when i saw that they had stickers that exempted them from the attentions of the blue meanies edinburghs detested traffic stormtroopers i had walked through advocates close many times before in the years id lived in the capital but id never really taken in the detail as soon as we stepped into the entrance i saw what the problems were going to be this is going to take a long time said miles we have to do this the oldfashioned way with a single camera because of the narrowness of the passage that means that many of the lines are going to have to be lit and shot individually you guys may have to shave twice on sunday just for continuitys sake where will we do that asked ewan theyre going to close off cockburn street to all but essential traffic well park the production trailers down there miles spent another halfhour walking us through our parts showing ewan how he wanted him to make his entrance showing me how he wanted me to crouch beside the headless dummy and taking final decisions on placing the camera by the end of it all we were knackered even dawn was getting irritable and thats unusual miles got the message from her if from nobody else okay he announced at last thats it for today ill see you all back here sunday sixthirty be sharp be rested be good thirtytwo their departure gave me a reality jolt glen oliver took ewan away in a taxi miles dawn and mike reilly took one of the peoplemovers back to the caledonian and the bit players commandeered the other to go back to the assembly rooms there was i an international movie star left on his own in a rapidly cooling advocates close mind you after the day id had a pint was an appealing proposition and deacon brodies tavern was only a few yards away then later with any luck i could escape to glasgow and the bosoms of my new family only i wasnt alone when i stepped out of the passageway into the high street who was waiting round the corner but ricky ross what the hell are you doing here i asked him waiting for you he told me cheerfully i thought you might fancy coming with me on a visit i have to pay on someone and why would i want to do that youre a golfer arent you i thought you guys were all groupies when it comes to meeting pros alison gave me a list of the boy davids friends right at the top is don kennedy the golfer as it happens hes not playing on the tour event this week hes had a couple of sponsors days up at murrayfield golf club and ive arranged to see him there i started to say that i wanted nothing to do with his games and that i had better things to do than run around edinburgh playing detective with some clapped out excopper but then i thought about a persistent slice that had been creeping into my game okay i said provided it doesnt take too long his car was parked round the corner in st giles street beside the high court where in a few weeks alison was due to take her chances with a man or maybe a woman in a wig and a red jacket i found myself wondering how rhona waitrose would look in that outfit shed certainly done a lot for a simple raincoat there was a parking ticket on rickys alfa romeo he ripped it off the windscreen and threw it away these wankers will never learn he muttered my numbers on a list and theyve all got it whoever wrote thats in bother when he files it he didnt say another word of any consequence on the journey to murrayfield id been expecting him to quiz me about alisons unexpected appearance at his place but he didnt maybe mandy had told him the whole story maybe she hadnt i was fairly sure that alison hadnt the traffic was light so the trip across the new town and into ravelston dykes didnt take long we pulled into the car park in front of the clubhouse building i was wearing black designer jeans and a ralph lauren polo shirt given the strict dress codes that operate in some of these clubs i wondered if theyd let me in they might not have but fortunately don kennedy was dressed in more or less the same way as i was and also he was waiting for us in the casual bar known in some golf clubs as the dirty bar id seen him maybe a hundred times on television so i recognised him at once he was shorter than id expected but like most golfers he had shoulders that looked capable of supporting a house and hands that were big enough to dig its foundations without a shovel when i was in my early twenties a bloke in st andrews showed me what he assured me was one of arnold palmers old golf gloves god isnt all that tall either while im not a little guy myself but i swear i could have got both my hands in there kennedy is not famous for smiling on the golf course but he was affable enough as he greeted us a weak sun was shining through the window and glinting on his trademark copper curls mr ross he began engulfing rickys hand in one of his then he looked at me and frowned i know you dont i he muttered but i cant place you my face gets around i told him oz blackstone im a friend of david capperaulds fiancee youre also an actor i saw your last film very good very good no way could i do that sort of thing i could say the same about your last teeshot i have this terrible bloody slice kennedy smiled get your pro to work on your setup he said but once you start slicing its usually terminal he turned back to ricky as we joined him at his table so mr ross you said you wanted to ask me about my poor friend david im happy to talk to you but whats the nature of this investigation informal he replied pausing as the barman appeared and took our drinks orders two diet cokes ross was driving and id gone off the idea of a pint the crown is convinced of the circumstances and it looks as if theyll proceed on a culpable homicide charge assuming the judge accepts a guilty plea the sentence will be determined by the extent to which her counsel can persuade him she was provoked what are you trying to prove she was out of her mind with grief when she did it not quite but something along those lines youll have a problem then i know alison obviously i knew them as a couple although we didnt see a lot of each other latterly since im touring most of the time and my family base is in the south to be frank i never thought theyd make it to the altar although i never thought obviously that the relationship would end like this i thought that they were committed to their business more than to each other and that david in particular was in it for the money the golfer leaned back in his seat they say you can pick your friends but not your relatives i dont believe that i have cousins i havent seen since we were children but im one of those guys who makes a friend for better or worse ive known david capperauld since first year at edinburgh academy juniors and weve been chums since then im not stupid and im not blind i know that he could be a cunning ruthless little shit and that he behaved very badly towards alison but he had his good side too he was funny he was devoted to his parents and if you were close to him hed always be there for you i think part of the trouble was that he and alison were never that close i was only there as an observer but i couldnt stop myself from picking up on him you said he behaved badly towards her alison told me that he had broken off the engagement or had told her as much and that he wanted her to buy him out of the business at a value which was his estimate as much as anything else kennedy nodded thats more or less the situation the way he put it she was trying to make him take less than market value by threatening the stability of the company i can see both sides of that one so could i i wondered whether ricky and i should stop our investigation at that point and let alison settle for what she had do you know anything of the relationship between david and his famous cousin i asked david hated him from way back the whole town knew that there were two stories about it eventually he told me the true one he couldnt let himself make it up with ewan though it was a macho thing with him a pride thing every time ewan won an award or had a hit he got more bitter what about the woman rickys question cut right across him the one he was twotiming alison with again kennedy replied thats not how he would have put it hed have said that the relationship had run its course and that he had moved on he looked at ross i could read the shrewdness in his eyes this isnt about a plea in mitigation is it he murmured then he glanced back at me you dont think she did it do you lets just say wed like to be satisfied that she did i told him but the police are arent they sometimes the police are too easily satisfied im with you on that one so davids other woman who is she kennedy smiled and looked out of the window nice little girl he mused david introduced us last time i was up in edinburgh shes a receptionist with a big firm out on the west side shes a doctors daughter chinese descent her names anna chin thirtythree you know what ricky i said as we drove away from the golf club theres truth in the old song eh life is indeed just a bowl of cherries what the bloody hell are you talking about anna chin you know her i met her the other day shes the main hall receptionist at james torrents new office building you never said when kennedy came out with the name you should have said why what difference would it have made kennedy isnt a suspect ross was silent for a moment or two how do you know that for sure he asked he was playing in a proam event in paris when capperauld was killed i checked the european tour website on my laptop clever bastard eh who me or him anyway im telling you now anna chin works for torrent okay where does that take us nowhere of itself said ricky as he took a right at the lights past the roseburn bar but its a connection it has a pattern of a sort theres torrent giving alison a hard time over ewan capperauld and over money and at the same time his receptionists having it off with alisons fiance whos also capperaulds cousin it doesnt fit right it sticks out a bit like that he took his right hand off the wheel and held it up i looked at it and saw that his wrist was slightly deformed i broke it playing rugby just after i left school the bones werent fitted together properly but no one knew until they took the plaster off by that time it was too late and a promising career was halted in its tracks ive had that as a reminder ever since it niggles me and now every time i see a set of facts that fit together like a badly healed fracture i want to know more about them maybe but remember one thing were after the person who killed david capperauld if it wasnt alison but whats your point lets say it wasnt and my point is im telling you it wasnt anna chin either why dont tell me she was playing in the proam with kennedy she might as well have been she didnt do it let me guess shes a wee cracker with big doe eyes and she couldnt possibly have stuck an icepick in her boyfriends nut if id given up on a suspect on that basis when i was in the force there would be at least a dozen women walking around now instead of doing time listen whoever killed capperauld either lashed out and got completely lucky or unlucky if you want to see it that way or they knew exactly what they were doing he paused to take a left turn on to the western approach road didnt don kennedy say that anna chins a doctors daughter she is i admitted she told me so herself but she didnt kill capperauld there you go again ricky laughed yes and im right ive known people whove killed or had the potential to do it this girl doesnt you say ill make up my own mind on that when i go to see her go easy then her boss is your client remember dont worry ill just have a gentle chat with the lass i tried to imagine him having a gentle chat with anyone but i let it pass i was tired and i wanted to get on my way to glasgow so much so that i took out my mobile and called susie to let her know i was heading her way we were heading up johnston terrace on the other side of the castle from my apartment when the phone rang in my pocket i took a look at the readout before i accepted the call the number was mine id left it on divert yup i answered best not to give too much away too soon i always say oz is that you is that you it was alison unmistakeably equally unmistakeably she was terrified yes now calm down what is it im at james torrents office she wailed we had a meeting oz theres a girl here and shes dead my brain seemed to shut down for a few seconds i felt numb and weary not again alison not again i thought i realised that ross was staring at me and so i forced myself back to the present is there anyone else there not as far as i can see oz im scared if youre on your own how did you get in by the side door it opens into the hall have you touched anything no then get out of there now what you heard me get off your mark as fast as you bloody can as i ended the call ricky pulled the alfa to a halt just down from the ensign ewart pub what was all that about he asked i stared back at him hard as far as youre concerned until i tell you different it was a hoax call now turn around and head for torrents place why youre his head of security right well im reporting an incident now shift thirtyfour ricky quizzed me all the way out to edinburgh park but i told him nothing other than that id had a call from someone reporting an emergency at the torrent group corporate headquarters but why you he demanded i dont know i yelled at him i dont shout very often when i do it usually has an effect he dropped the subject and drove while i phoned susie and told her that id been delayed what i did know from the start was that i didnt want him or anyone else to find out any sooner than necessary that alison had been there not until we found out ourselves exactly what had happened and to whom not that i was in any doubt about that rickys badly healed fracture was sticking out like an elbow in my mind the building was locked and unlit when we pulled up outside but the big red t on its pole was glowing as i looked at it it occurred to me that it was shaped more or less like a cherry ross jumped out and ran up the steps to the main entrance it was locked and brass gates had been locked across the glass doors he knew his way around though he headed straight round the side of the building with me at his heels until he came to a fire exit open he muttered then pushed it sending it swinging violently on its hinges i followed him into a short passageway which ended with another door we burst out into the main entrance hall it was just before eightthirty and it was a bright evening so there was still enough natural light coming down from the atrium for us to see what had brought us there no more than twelve feet from us the body of a young woman was sprawled across the reception desk she was on her back gazing sightless at the glass roof above on the floor all around us lay ripe red cherries spilled from the wooden bowl in which her head now rested i saw that several of them were squashed flat ricky tried to hold me back but i shook his hand off and made my way through them carefully up to the desk i looked down at the dead girl she was still wearing her plastic name tag but i knew who she was anyway i had guessed as soon as i had taken alisons frantic call anna chin i said quietly as if i was trying not to disturb her she looked peaceful the only odd thing about her was the angle of her broken neck apart from that there was not a mark on her i looked over my shoulder at ricky and saw that he was brandishing his twisted wrist what did i tell you he exclaimed that was alison who called you right yes now tell me what else doesnt fit what do you mean the words had barely escaped his lips when we heard the siren outside no its okay i told him thats what was missing listen when they get in here ask them when they got the call he frowned at me why just do it i glanced at my watch its about twenty minutes since i had that phone call ill bet you the police were delayed by about that length of time ill bet they should have been here sooner so they could catch her on the premises ricky isnt at all dumb he saw the same picture i was looking at okay he said dont tell me any more just at that moment two uniformed constables burst through the side door one was a youngster but the other was a veteran grey hair showing at his temples where the fuck have you been ross barked the older copper glared at him for about half a second until he recognised him then changed his expression instantly im sorry sir he said were the second car the one that was supposed to respond was in an accident at the barnton traffic lights the driver went through on the red and a lorry smashed his side in i got the call after that and id to come from granton okay were the other guys hurt i dont think so sir the lorry driver no thats a relief if he was thered have been hell to pay the veteran nodded he was only relieved that he hadnt been in the other car what about cid ricky asked him i dont know about that sir well call them in pronto and a doctor not that theres any helping this poor lass whatll i call it sir slowly and deliberately ross walked round the desk he didnt look down as far as i could see but i heard more cherries squash under his feet as he walked tell them its a suspicious death and that they should send a full sceneofcrime team you two wait here and dont touch anything well be outside i got the message and followed him along the corridor to the fire exit i hadnt noticed before but there were red marks on the floor that could have been made by the juice of crushed cherries as he walked outside and round to the main entrance rickys shoes and mine by that time made even more youre right he said as we stood waiting at the top of the steps speaking quietly as if there was someone around who might have heard this was a setup whoever killed that girl knew that alison was coming here and arranged it so that she would find her i guess they watched her then called the police expecting them to arrive with her still at the scene he took a deep breath then looked at me you did the right thing oz telling her to vanish first she finds her fiances body then shes caught standing over the girl hes been having it off with it would have been all over for her shed have gone down for twenty years she might still theyre bound to find out she was here i dont know that you never told me that what if they trace the call to my mobile what call you never had a call and you were with me all night why did we turn up at the scene then theres a sign on the gate saying that these premises are protected by ross security my phone numbers on it i had an anonymous call at around the same time as the police telling me that there had been an incident at torrent i came straight here bringing you along for the ride since you were with me at the time what if they check to make sure there was a call to you he gave me an offended look they wont most of the cid in this division used to be under my command their boss is my brother mason and so are some of them if its that cut and dried can i get out of here as soon as the cid arrive yes take my car and leave it at the mound when you go to glasgow but before you do any of that i want you to find alison call her mobile and tell her everythings under control if she isnt waiting there already tell her to go home as normal you meet her there get her calmed down and settled in and most important of all take the shoes she was wearing and scrub the soles make sure theyre spotless tell her to sit tight and wait for me id better stay at her place tonight you think shes actually in danger he gave me a be patient hes an idiot look someones tried to frame her for two murders and failed twice what will they do next of course shes in fucking danger thirtyfive thats how it went the cid arrived two detective sergeants they both knew exsuperintendent ross called him sir and accepted his story without question they didnt even talk to me ricky gave me his spare keys to the alfa and i headed off back into town as soon as i was out of sight i called alisons mobile number she answered on the fifth ring as if it had taken her that long to decide to take the call she was at home but she still sounded terrified i drove straight there she was in her dressing gown when she let me in her hair was wet straight from the shower that girl oz she whispered when i told her who anna chin was and what they had in common she slumped down into an armchair after a few seconds she began to cry someones got it in for me oz she moaned and i havent a clue why maybe not but youve got the good guys on your side well find out and put a stop to it the soles of her shoes were still stained dark red with cherry juice i went to work with bleach and a nailbrush until they were spotless she had stopped crying by the time i was finished i thought about questioning her but decided that already i was way more involved that id planned so i gave her a big drink drove the alfa back to the mound picked up some overnight kit and headed for glasgow it was midnight but susie was still pleased to see me no more though than i was pleased to see her my god she said looking at me in the doorway you look dead beat you must have had a hard day at the office i have i said and then i picked her up and hugged her for quite some time when i woke there was a strange middleaged lady leaning over the bed only when i could focus i realised that she wasnt strange at all it was only ethel she had been trying to put a mug of tea on the table by my head without disturbing me i dont know why she thought id like to wake up to a mug of cold tea but that appeared to be the game plan morning i mumbled sorry oz she said with the bright morning voice of the professional nurse i was trying not to wake you this isnt part of the service either she added almost as an afterthought but susies feeding baby janet and she asked me if i would bring your tea in i mumbled again as she left then checked the bedside clock it told me in big red liquid crystal numbers that id slept for almost ten hours i pulled myself up in bed and used a remote to switch on the television in the corner but all i could find was cartoons kids making a noise and that blonde girl with the tattoo on her bum who does the saturday morning football programme i gave them all up and settled for radio clyde one just as susie came into the bedroom with wee jan still attached maybe it was all the stuff that had been happening over the last few days but my heart and my eyes just seemed to fill up at the same time come here i said barely able to see them come into bed and lets be a family we did that we just lay there did susie and i for about half an hour with our child between us talking mostly nonsense i told her about ewan and alison having done their deal i told her about the rehearsal and the scene set visit to advocates close and i told her about meeting don kennedy the famous golfer and his gloomy prognosis for my slice but i did not tell her about anna chin that sort of stuff has no business invading a moment like that eventually we got up and each of us while the other showered took turns at playing with the smiling janet some people say its only wind at that age not a real smile but that is sheer nonsense i have two nephews and a daughter i know these things it was ethels hardearned weekend off she muttered something about going to see her sister in roseneath and headed off in her allsilver ford ka right susie declared janets fed now what about us saturday morning i replied glasgow ill go for the rolls and the papers like any other bloke you start the fryup and get the tea on like any other woman bloody chauvinist but i dont fancy going out looking like an unmade bed see stereotypical behaviour with her red hair tousled and her freckled face fresh from the shower she looked absolutely stunning so well do it your way she took the door keys from the kitchen table and tossed them to me the flat is in a building near the top of woodside terrace so i cut along to lynedoch street and down to woodlands road where i could take my pick of grocer news agents each one just like my friend alis place i went into the nearest bought four morning rolls baked that day the daily record and the scotsman the woman behind the counter gave me a knowing look probably marking me as an outoftowner because i hadnt taken the herald i had a reason for picking the edinburgh daily though i sprinted across the street and stopped on the other side turning to glare over my shoulder at a taxidriver who had blown his horn at me as i did so i caught a figure at the edge of my vision turning away from me of itself there was nothing unusual in it but something clicked in my head all the same i looked after the bloke but he was heading briskly off towards charing cross yes glasgow has one of them too paranoia blackstone not everyone is out to get you i forgot about it and opened my scotsman the death was worth a paragraph on page one and a longer story on page three that told me that the police had launched a fullscale murder investigation after the body of a twentyfiveyearold woman had been found in the new headquarters building of the torrent group the victim anna chin a doctors daughter from barnton if she had been a waiters daughter from leith would they have mentioned that i wondered was in the habit of working late on fridays to take weekend returns from the field sales team detectives were working on the theory that she had disturbed an intruder fine i thought ricky s put them off the trail for now at least i knew that it was a matter of time before they tumbled to the david capperauld connection but hopefully by that time there would be nothing that would tie alison to the scene i took out my mobile and called ricky on his ship to ship as a pal of mine used to say how is she i asked him okay he replied in a quiet voice there was a pause i guessed he was still with alison and that he might be going somewhere she couldnt hear him knowing her better by now than i ever had before i guessed that he was probably getting out of bed i heard the sound of a closing door ricky was probably in the toilet shes calm now he said more clearly did she tell you anything else only what we guessed someone called her and told her that torrent wanted to see her at the office who she doesnt have a clue she said that the voice wasnt clear the caller said he was passing on a message from natalie morgan that torrent wanted a quick meeting that evening what about torrent do we know where he was the records in his office showed that he signed out at three with natalie the police tried to get hold of him last night eventually they found them both at a dinner at gleneagles hotel i called someone i know there afterwards they checked in at fourfifteen separate suites of course shes his niece i couldnt help laughing there are some things that coppers cant contemplate cynical bastard blackstone he muttered even if they were they still wouldnt just take one suite he had a point i wasnt as smart as i thought no need to let him know that though it could still have been natalie who made the call i pointed out sure im betting it was she couldnt have killed anna though i said she must have been alive when the last person signed out she could she could have checked in driven back done the girl and been up there again for dinner and why would she want to do that thats a question id love to ask her but i cant risk it then get one of your tame policemen to ask i cant do that either theyre off chasing intruders remember yes i remembered we were boxed in good and proper or at least ricky was i had to remind myself that this investigation had nothing to do with me i had almost put it out of my mind by the time i got back home to the family i had got the best of the deal all round susies a much better breakfast cook than me and she always uses olive oil when shes frying ill use anything we stuffed the four rolls with fillet steak and egg decadent eh and ate them in front of the telly the tasty bird with the tattoo on her bum had finished and we were into previews from around the grounds thats enough of that said susie once we were finished she grabbed the remote and switched off we are taking our daughter out for an airing where i thought that kelvingrove would be nice we could walk there that sounded good to me okay i agreed if i can do the transport museum as well susie got the baby dressed for the outdoors we did the same and we headed out into the bright autumn day we walked janet in her pram a sort of multipurpose vehicle for kids down elderslie street and turned into sauchiehall street the most famous thoroughfare in glasgow if not the nicest we strolled along at no great pace but it didnt take us long to come to the old kelvin hall which houses the citys museum of transport when i had lived in glasgow before and jonny and colin my nephews came to visit they always made me take them there i took no persuading i love those old glasgow trams and id love to have ridden on one for real my dad did on a visit to glasgow as a child and he still talks about it the city was all the poorer when they were replaced by giant electric trolley buses whispering death they became known as as they came rolling silently up behind a number of unwary glaswegian drunks who had chosen exactly the wrong moment to step off the pavement wee janet was a bit young for the trams and susies an unromantic weegie so we didnt stay there long we had just left the building and turned into argyle street heading for the crossing to kelvingrove museum and art gallery when i saw a man step swiftly back into blantyre street on the far side of kelvin hall he was in my line of vision for less than a second but i was dead certain that it was the same bloke id seen earlier in woodlands road i saw a little bit of face this time or at least a flash of beard and the glint of the sun reflected from dark glasses for a moment i almost set off after him but that would have alarmed susie so i held myself back instead we crossed the road and carrying the pram mounted the steps to the entrance to the big baroque building at the top i glanced over my shoulder quickly while susie was looking the other way but i saw nothing out of the ordinary inside seats were laid out in rows and a man was playing the big pipe organ above the central hall sit there for a minute i told susie as wee janet stirred in her mpv pram im going to the gents i found a sign showing the two matchstick people one legs apart the other legs together shouldnt they be the other way around ah never mind and followed it i wasnt sure id get a mobile signal in the toilet in the great sandstone building but i did when ricky answered i could hear the unmistakeable sound of domesticity in the background have you got someone following me i asked him he hesitated yes he admitted at last alan grahams looking out for you i had to oz its in the contract if you have an emergency someone has to be on hand to respond you shouldnt have seen him though i warned him not to disturb you this isnt him this is someone else i told him about the man i had now seen twice in a few hours tell alan to stop looking out for me and concentrate on him i want to know who this guy is and what he wants if he comes near susie and the baby ill bloody well kill him and im not joking i must have been shouting because a guy standing at a urinal looked over his shoulder at me with a degree of alarm i glared at him and he went about his business okay oz calm down said ricky in his reassuring voice im on to it if i have to ill send someone else through as backup plus ill leave alan on susie when you come back to edinburgh at least until this man is identified and eliminated as a threat if he is one give me a description tallish long hair dark beard age i didnt get a good enough look to tell wearing jeans and a bomber jacket and shades okay thatll do ill get after him but please and i mean this if he does confront you do not touch him yourself leave him to my people when you said that just now i really did believe you thirtysix there were no more sightings of the stalker if such he was a couple of times people tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if i was me then asked for my autograph but they didnt bother me i had a hunch that the watcher knew bloody well who i was susie hadnt a clue what was going on of course so she sat and listened happily to the organ recital for a while then she and i walked around the museum the art gallery side is without a highlight now since they moved the dali i tried to stay a pace behind her all the time because it was easier than keeping up an unconcerned appearance it didnt fool her though even if she did get the wrong idea we were hardly back in the flat and i had hardly finished changing wee jan it was my turn before susie punched me lightly in the ribs go on she said away you go back to your movie youve been like a cat on hot bricks all afternoon she really did take me by surprise i thought id been pretty cool about the thing no i havent yes you have well okay maybe i have but i get a bit jumpy in public places especially today when i was trying to have a normal family day out she laughed all you wanted to see were your trams you couldnt wait to get home after that she was right even if she didnt know why ill tell you what i said why dont we take hospitality boxes at ibrox and celtic park we could go to each one on alternate saturdays and teach our daughter true ecumenicism susie frowned what are you talking about ive got boxes at celtic and rangers through the company my managers use them every week for clients and suppliers you can go any time you like youre a director remember just dont expect me to join in and dont expect to expose our daughter to the sort of language those crowds use she tugged my sleeve gently drawing me towards her on the couch i was holding the baby so i sat down carefully speaking of religion loosely she said how do you feel about having the baby christened belief was a subject id never discussed with susie its a subject i dont discuss with anyone as a rule i was an atheist pure and simple until my mother died then things changed but ive never gone in for denominations or such stuff as far as im concerned theyre only another excuse for people to fight i feel she should make up her own mind when shes old enough so do i lets just try to set her a good example okay i leaned across and kissed her not a letsgotobed kiss just a simple show of affection then i picked up the remote and switched on gillette soccer saturday on sky sports yes i said lets we watched as the pundits described the games from television monitors and as the final scores began to appear on a ribbon at the foot of the screen eventually the east life score came up a fournil home gubbing by east stirlingshire and my saturday afternoon was over while susie fed the baby again i made supper for the two of us i found all the ingredients for a very nice stirfry onions chillies shitake mushrooms bean sprouts and chicken breast i cooked them all up in a mix of olive oil soy sauce and lea and perrins and right at the end i cracked in a couple of large eggs and beat them in firmly to help bind the lot together nobody taught me to do that but ever since i heard a dodgy comedian claim on telly that whatever blokes cooked no matter what they called it it was always bloody stew ive made a point of being able to do other things who knows maybe if id liked that comedian rather than being annoyed by the smug sod the world would have lost a great stirfry chef this is great said susie as she tucked into a small mountain of the stuff she looked at me appraisingly across the table i think youre hired i couldnt think of something to say so i just shrugged my shoulders the thing was i wasnt one hundred per cent sure that id applied for the job i stayed for as long as i could but given my flying start next morning and a growing streak of professionalism which demands that im at my best when going to work i announced around eightthirty that id better hit the road i thought about telling her that she had a minder but i decided against it if id done that id have had to tell her why and i reckoned that would have scared her not for herself but for the baby besides the first time id seen the guy hed been following me alone as i saw it they were probably safer with me out of the way i had confidence in rickys people but i was half hoping that my friend would have a go at me okay maybe he was no more than a fan trying to get close but hed interfered with my family time and i didnt like that i found myself thinking about him for most of the way back to edinburgh and i didnt like that either i was starting work on my most important movie in the morning its like football but youre only as good as your next game rather than your last and here i was having to force myself to concentrate on it no i was annoyed and given half a chance the cause of it would pay when i got back to the mound i thought about calling ricky but hed know where i was and i knew that if hed anything to tell me hed have been in touch so i parked the mercedes and walked up the slope to the tall grey building i let myself into the apartment and went straight to my bedroom flicking on the light when i got there dropping my bag on the floor and heading straight for the shower ripping off clothes as i went i must have stayed in there for a good ten minutes trying to wash that man right out of my hair i suppose eventually i succeeded i towelled myself dry brushed my teeth and headed for bed focused fully on next morning i stepped out of the bathroom into darkness at first i thought the bulb had blown but then i sensed movement on my right i spun towards it then felt my world turn upsidedown i call myself a wrestler i mean ive been trained i know proper holds and throws and everything the real stuff i hadnt a chance my legs were kicked out from under me and a slim but very strong arm went across my chest in the same instant driving me down i landed on my back hard enough to wind me for an instant my arms spread out wide as i fell as i hit the ground i felt them pinned down and a weight pressing on me there wasnt much moon but a little light was creeping in from the outside through the slatted blinds i could see and feel that my attacker was naked and at the same moment i could feel and just about see that she was female she was straddling me trapping my upper arms with her feet pressing my thighs to the ground with strong arms my eyes grew more accustomed to the light i couldnt believe what they were seeing close up then i felt something else and i heard a voice that was more of a loud mumble lie still mandy ofarrell ordered or i may bite i flexed my biceps and used my leg strength to lift her clear of the ground and to pull the part of her that was nearest to me even closer still i could say the same to you i pointed out in the end we called it a draw the apartment was warm we were both covered in sweat from our brief struggle when she rolled off me and swung herself round she was grinning think youre so tough eh she was right half an hour before i had been thinking about filling in my stalker do you realise i asked her that i could have you fired she gave me a look of pure innocence but mr ross she exclaimed in a girlie voice unlike her own i was only obeying your orders i stared at her in what must have been amazement for she laughed out loud ricky told me that you were heading back to edinburgh on your own and that i was to get here and stay as close to you as i could couldnt do better than that eh so how did you get in i told you this building has no security well actually it has but im rather good at that sort of thing im good at all sorts of things as you know by now i have to move out of here i thought its bad luck i keep getting beaten up by women i could feel an incipient carpet burn on my bum so i pushed myself up from the ground and slid into the kingsizeplus bed mandy followed me under the duvet in the circumstances i couldnt be bothered protesting i caught another flash of her in the moonlight as she stood with her long powerful limbs high breasts and genuine blonde hair she made me think of a silver wolf is this the way you usually go about your job i asked her not very often in fact hardly ever sometimes clients expect it they think its part of the service those ones really have no chance youd think arabs might be the worst for that by the way but theyre not no its the americans you have to watch out for id have thought theyd have to watch out for you she laughed those who tried it on that is she ran a hand across my chest im glad youre one of the nice types she said youre a strong boy i dont know how id handle you if you got rough my selfesteem was restored very carefully i suggested she took me at my word and moved across me i found myself looking up into her smiling eyes mandy i told her fidelity has never come easy to me and youre making it more difficult by the second i can feel that she remarked so please and dont be offended because im having trouble asking this go and sleep in the spare room no she said ive got my orders thirtyseven i dont know how i did it but i made it to advocates close at the appointed hour next morning looking reasonably freshfaced and feeling fit and ready for work when the alarm woke me at six on the dot mandy was up and dressed she offered to make breakfast while i showered but i knew that the caterers would be taking care of that in the production trailers in cockburn street the location was so near at hand that i was able to walk there in only a couple of minutes the book says that its dark and raining when they find the body but miles had taken a liberty with that as well if wed shot in darkness wed have had to spread it over at least two nights and the cost would have shot up as i said the man knows the value of a pound advocates close was blocked off when mandy and i got there guarded by policemen who were actually extras in uniform the high street was open to traffic though and a small crowd of onlookers had gathered at the barrier some but not all of them were on the payroll once the cameras started rolling though all the punters would be cleared away continuity is everything in film if the faces in the background changed from shot to shot it would stick out like a sore thumb speaking of which as i eased my way through the crowd i saw ricky ross standing inside the alleyway i walked up to him and mandy strolled off to join the other minders she picked you up then he asked nodding after her she never left my side i told him as per your orders you should be so lucky he muttered sarcastically the ice maidens above the likes of you son her jobs to collect you from your flat and get you here on time and thats that so dont you get any ideas as if i would i changed the subject fast if mandys visit had been extracurricular i didnt want him to get more of a sniff of it than id given him already have your people spotted the guy who was following me i asked him sorry there hasnt been a trace you are sure about him are you of course im fucking sure okay okay keep your hair on youve probably spooked him chances are he was just an idiot punter and youll never see him again but well keep looking and ill keep the cover on susie thanks for the first time i wondered about his presence there wheres alison i asked still at home ive got someone watching her too though do you really think shes at risk im not taking any chances he said curtly i caught something in his voice here ricky i challenged are you getting keen on her he glared at me i like the girl okay christ its thanks to you she could be going to the slammer i dont need reminding about that thanks anyway she wont ive seen who the judge is likely to be he and i were at school together if i speak on her behalf shell get probation okay i laughed loud enough to turn the heads of the minders who were gathered in a group at the foot of the close is there anything in this bloody city i asked him that cant be fixed by the power of the old school tie cancer he said cheerfully but thats about all you wont be so sure of yourself if the police tie her to anna chin they wont ive had word theyve got a new lead they havent given up on the intruder theory but theyre off following the scent of annas boyfriend now that got my attention her boyfriend but thatll lead them straight to david capperauld and alison he shook his head not him he must have been on the side she had an official boyfriend a corporal in the parachute regiment hes on leave just now annas father told the cid they had a blazing row a few days ago sure about capperauld no thats not what the father said and its not what the soldiers saying their story is that he was pressing her to give up her job and go south to live with him and that she refused point blank because she was having it off with david im telling you his name hasnt come up for now i said gloomily behind me i heard a buzz among the punters in the crowd of onlookers i turned just in time to see them part as glen oliver led ewan capperauld on to the set i checked my watch dead on time okay came a voice from the foot of the close actors to makeup miles commanded lets make a movie thirtyeight the wardrobe mistress gave me a brown leather jerkin for my first scene it fitted pretty well as far as id been able to tell from the book andy martin rarely wore anything else she handed me a pair of black levis as well they were my size and had been washed several times to give them a worn look i tried to tell her that the pair i was wearing would do fine but she pointed out that a middleranking edinburgh detective would be unlikely to turn up at a murder scene wearing gucci the production trailers great articulated things stretched halfway up cockburn street two of them were split into reasonably spacious dressing rooms i had my own on this project a first for me since id had to share with other cast members before as miles had promised there were no stars on any of the doors only our names makeup didnt take too long all they had to do with me was to damp down what was left of my california tan and replace it with a more authentic edinburgh pallor ill never like wearing slap but its a small sacrifice for the money and the stuff they use now is nonallergenic unlike the makeup jan and i wore in our drama club days which brought me out in spots or maybe that was just my age by the time we were ready so was the crew miles led ewan dawn and me back up the close the truncated dummy and the scary false head were in place and pretty soon so were we the first shot was ewan in his skinner coat steelgrey hair tousled expression grim the camera focused tight on his eyes then panned out to take in the rest of the scene i was crouching by the side of the body and dawn was a few feet away the first line of the movie was down to me as i stood to greet him a tiredsounding morning boss it was hardly deathless prose but i did it in one take that was it miles called cut as directors do and we moved on to scene two as wed been warned most of the time was taken up by changing the camera positions we had a lot of standing around to do but we did it patiently ewan turned out to be a football fan or at least a falkirk supporter the poor sad bastard he lamented his clubs weekend defeat and its continuing failure to build itself a ground worthy of the name why dont you build it for them i suggested he raised an eyebrow creasing his makeup not all followers of the bairns are completely stupid he replied eventually around midmorning miles called a refreshment break the weather was holding up so there were no continuity worries on that score i stopped in at the canteen truck picked up a mug of coffee and a couple of blt rolls loaded them on to a tray and headed back to my dressing room if youve got it flaunt it awkwardly i unlocked the door with my left hand stepped up and inside and let it swung shut behind me then went to set the tray down on the table against the wall i only saw the thing because of the mirror and even then it only caught a corner of my eye i couldnt see what it was but it hadnt been there earlier of that i was sure at first i thought it was a leaflet but when i slid the tray to one side i saw that it was a photograph an a computer printout lying face up on the tabletop i picked it up and looked at it and as i did i felt the blood racing to my head it was a picture of susie and me pushing janet in her pram taken i guessed from the steps of the kelvingrove museum as we approached the kelvin hall it was my turn to go ballistic i jerked the door open again and yelled out into cockburn street ricky it was mandy who responded she jumped out of the canteen wagon and ran up the hill hes gone back to his office oz she said barely out of breath what is it what sort of a fucking operation is this i snarled at her dawns dressingroom door opened as i spoke and she looked out puzzled and curious i grabbed mandy by the arm and hauled her inside i waved the photo in her face someones been in here i told her making a conscious effort not to shout hes left me a calling card you people are supposed to be trying to trace this guy youre all over here and yet he walked into this closed street broke into my locked room and left this and nobody stopped him oz im sorry she said her face as pale as mine in my makeup i dont know anything about this what do you want me to do i want you to interrogate everyone on this crew and i mean everyone until you find someone who saw this guy getting in here then i want you to circulate his description to every one of your people then i want you to find the bastard and bring him to me so that i can find out what his fucking problem is with me and my family and while youre at it you tell that boss of yours that if this is how he protects me then im starting to get seriously worried about alison i shoved the picture into her hand and stepped into the street to cool down miles was waiting outside whats the problem mate he asked ive got a stalker i replied then told him the whole story his face grew more and more serious as i spoke through my stillopen door i could hear mandy on the phone to her boss dont worry he said eventually in that quiet dangerous tone he has well find this guy even if i have to bring in mark kravitz to do it he slapped me on the shoulder come on lets go down to the canteen truck and chill out i followed him down the street and climbed up the steps that led into our travelling canteen when he got to the top he stopped in his tracks and i heard him gasp i stepped up beside him and gasped just as he had facing us was my soontobeexwife primavera and her new lover nicky johnson hi she said without a trace of uncertainty were passing through on the way to auchterarder for nick to meet mum and dad yeah said the former hotdog vendor with a greasy smile i couldnt be here and not call in to wish you luck with the new movie id never actually met the man before id heard of him seen a couple of his movies and wed spoken that one time but id never encountered him in los angeles i knew right there and then that if i had i wouldnt have liked him whatever the circumstances as it was given what had just happened in my dressing room he couldnt have picked a worse moment to introduce himself i took a pace towards him winding up the great big left hook that ive honed to perfection on the heavy punching bag and with the serious intention of knocking his head clean off his shoulders then i felt miles grip my arm hard no he shouted stopping me in midstride nicky and the catering staff all sighed with relief especially nicky who had gone pale all of a sudden what happened next was just a blur miles took half a pace forward and hit prims new stud with the fastest righthander i have ever seen in my life johnsons quite a beefy bloke but still the force of the punch spun him half round and lifted him right up on his toes he held that position for a second almost like a foot baller going up for a header then pitched forward face down raising a small cloud of dust from the floor as he landed sorry mate said miles over his shoulder i know the sonofabitch was trying to rub your nose in it but i couldnt let you hit him if youd broken your hand the delay while it healed would have cost us a fucking fortune thirtynine nicky johnson started crying when he came round he was dazed and confused and somewhere at the back of his mind he may have realised that he had done something very stupid which would given miless wallop figuratively as well as fistic ally have a bad effect on his career in the long run prim knelt beside him as he stirred on the floor he was only out cold for a few seconds and soon she had him in a sitting position with his back against the trailer wall he looked like a big dummy sitting there dazed not quite knowing where he was with two big tears tracking down his cheeks it put a damper on prims show of outrage as she glared up at miles and me youre a couple of thugs she snapped i should call the police what did you expect i told her whose idea was it to come here yours or the boys we thought of it together she said we were in edinburgh and it seemed the right thing to do dawns my sister remember and miles is my brotherinlaw why shouldnt i come to visit them its got nothing to do with you youre nothing to me now i looked down at her and i could see in her eyes that she was economising with the truth if susie gantrys taught me one thing its that ive usually been more in love with myself than with anyone else there have been a few exceptions to that but prim wasnt one of them i think what bound us together was luck more than anything else theres no doubt about it my life changed irrevocably from the moment we met she was like a lucky charm to me when she was around at first at least everything we touched turned to money we believed that we cared for each other and we probably did but looking back it was superficial as a basis for a shared life lust alone doesnt last we fucked a lot premierleague class sometimes but we never talked about anything worth talking about before too long each of us was cheating on the other and justifying it in our own minds until eventually for one of the few times in my life i got honest with myself and went back to jan even without prim my goodluck streak seemed to carry on until the night when it turned very bad afterwards i turned to prim again maybe in the subconscious hope of restoring it that possibility hadnt occurred to me until that moment in the trailer but yes maybe i did if that was the case it didnt work out sure the money kept rolling in but it was offset by black moments too even our wedding day had its crisis come to think of it our shortlived marriage was one big crisis as for our honeymoon but thats another story all that said though flawed selfish cynical and ultimately doomed as a couple as we may have been we never were ordinary the bond that tied us might not have been true love but whatever it was its fabric was strong and conductive sparks did fly between us and sometimes bolts of lightning thats how it was as we looked at each other in the canteen trailer im nothing to you am i i challenged her so why are you looking at me that way you dont know whether you want to stab me or shag me do you she jumped to her feet given the choice i bloody well do she shouted do you think ive forgiven you for susie gantry or forgiven her for that matter you think ive forgiven you for yours i heard myself snap back actually i thought i had but old oz had been lying to himself again do you want me to run through the list or the age range of the guys you had half a century wouldnt cover it we glared at each other she had forgotten nicky i had forgotten everyone else so dont go telling me i mean nothing i mean plenty otherwise you wouldnt have set up that poor sap there to see what i would do to him a twitch of her right eye told me id hit the mark i bet you got your jollies off him being flattened didnt you ill bet youre all moist now she slapped me hard across the cheek i laughed at her then i heard a shout from the door you two stop it stop it at once it was the first time id ever heard dawn speak sharply to anyone other than on the screen if youre going to scream at each other do it in private yeah said miles quietly his calmness contrasting with his wifes anger thats a good idea there are things you two need to get out of your system without knocking ten bells out of each other of course oz you arent in the next couple of shots take time out and well see you back after the lunch break ive got nothing to say to this bastard prim hissed i had cooled off well ive got things to say to you lets go up the hill to my dressing room nicky johnson was still sitting on the floor against the wall he made a small sound of protest perhaps but everyone ignored him my wife glared at me again but nodded okay she followed me up the hill to my trailer and stepped inside i locked the door behind us to make sure we werent interrupted no more yelling now i warned her you dont want to disturb ewan capperauld if you havent already dont you bet on it she snorted after what you just said i felt my cheek it was still stinging i was right then nicky getting belted over you did give you a wee thrill no it did not then why did you bring him here you must have known it was on the cards you promised me you wouldnt touch him since when did you and i start keeping promises to each other you just wanted to see what would happen didnt you what sort of a bloody nerve have you got she gasped time for a change of tack osbert sorry i murmured she blinked i said what i heard you the first time and i said sorry i want to apologise properly for what happened with susie ive never really done that and i should apology noted she murmured even if i cant accept it in the circumstances and im not apologising for any of what i did i was more than entitled not quite i pointed out not even in the eyes of todays liberal matrimonial courts do two wrongs make a right plus when you decided to get even with me for susie you did it with a married bloke so neither of usis innocent so are you just doing it to ease your conscience telling me that youre sorry you slept with susie i dont have a conscience over that your cock certainly doesnt have one true and i should have got my terminology right too apologising doesnt always mean youre sorry id have wound up sleeping with susie sooner or later so im not sorry about that its just that my timing was a bit off that was wrong thats about as clumsy as you can get but at least its more honest than usual she ventured a grim smile im trying really you should too what do you mean i mean you and that lump of nothing back there that nicky what the hell are you doing with him im in lo she began until my exploding laugh cut her short stop dont be daft youre no more in love with him than you were with me in fact probably less hes a prat and hes not worth your time you know that come on honest up you got involved with him because you werent finished punishing me yes or no she pursed her lips maybe she muttered from you thats a yes tell me did you expect me to come flying down to mexico bop the boy there and take you back with me she looked at me again her eyes widened then narrowed as if she was about to start shouting again then went back to normal if i did then i was a bloody fool wasnt i she said grimly you didnt know then that susie was pregnant though did you ive seen prim in many states but i dont think ive ever seen her look as totally stunned as she did then her mouth fell open and she gasped then she sat down hard on the chair by my table and started to cry oh hell i heard myself whisper you never knew at all did you i put my hands on her shoulder raised her to her feet and held her to me oh love i really am sorry about that i murmured into her ear i assumed that dawn would have told you i felt her shake her head against my chest no she didnt she mumbled then she pushed herself away from me but you should have told me primavera i cant remember when we stopped telling each other things maybe we never started i didnt tell you because i didnt know what to do about susie even though she wasnt making any demands of me when you ran off with johnson that helped me make my mind up and the baby she asked is it born yet we have a daughter she sniffled i really messed up with nicky then didnt i both times i should feel sorry for him but hes such a creep and hes a fucking awful actor as well her face was blotchy and a bit crumpled yet it gave her smile a fetching vulnerable quality that id never seen before youre so great are you she teased better than him if i wasnt id go back to the investigating business maybe you should maybe all this isnt really for you maybe you should go back to being the old oz blackstone whoever the hell he was i grunted no make no mistake love on balance i like being rich and famous i admit id settle for being just rich but if i have to ill take both but its made you different whats wrong with different you were never scary before you were always nice ive told you before nice was a front anyway you were always nice too if what you say is true youve changed as much as me when i met you i thought you were mother teresa then you started acting like the village slapper thats the effect you have on a girl when you dump her my love anyway i wasnt that bad she chuckled not all of the time there was a box of tissues on the table i pulled a couple out and dried the tears from her face what are you going to do about that poor sod down there i asked her god i dont know tell me the truth now whose idea was it to come over here yours or his she smiled again this time she looked like a kid whod been caught doing something naughty mine she admitted i booked the trip to perthshire when i suggested to nicky that we should call in here to wish the new movie luck he jumped at the chance i reckon he thought it would get him back into miless good books well he knows different now come on prim you cant take that guy to meet your folks hes worse than steve miller that car salesman you had it off with when she snorted cute wee laugh lines that id never noticed before creased up around her eyes no hes not she protested no one was worse than him but youre right ive been going off nicky for a while i only brought him over here to flaunt him in front of you i didnt think you would hit him though and i expected even less that miles would do it for you thats what friends are for you and miles are two of the biggest chauvinist pigs ive ever met oink i said but admit it you love us for it she looked up at me her eyes were clear again i dont know what to call it you are an infuriating bastard and i should hate you till the day i die but you do have an effect on me she slid her arms around my waist what am i going to do oz about nicky own up tell him you dont love him any more and put him on a plane back to the states id worked that out for myself no what am i going to do about me go and see your folks for a while get your head together then decide whatever you want to do you can moneys no object i cant go back to los angeles i hate the place i felt safer when i worked in africa and there was a war on there so go back there or be mother teresa again go to calcutta and work with the poor im no saint besides i prefer the rich go to the south of france then go back to spain come with me she said it tentatively now that would be crazy in spite of myself i felt sparks begin to fly theres no such thing as third time lucky wed end up killing each other id behave i wouldnt what if i withdraw from our divorce agreement now i know youre joking even you must realise that whatever else were good at were lousy at marriage she ran her hand up inside my shirt i felt its warmth on my chest there is one thing were very good at she pulled my head down and kissed me i kissed her back out of sheer habit of course yes but i said when we came up for air what susie she did it to me id do it to her in a minute when she grinned at me and those extra sparks flew i thought id had it although id really take much longer than that there was a sofa thing against the far wall of the dressing room it was well long enough for us i looked at it and saw us there so did she and pulled me towards it then all the lies and deceit mine and hers that had driven us apart came back to me and something else too i cant i said im sorry but i cant theres someone else involved now who she asked let me guess that big blond goddess who let us into the canteen truck and who went running when you shouted close but no cigar no her names janet and shes two weeks old she changes everything she took her arms from around me i see so thats what i should have done to keep us together is it had a baby with you no what we should have done was build a relationship on the rocks of truth not the sands of deceit i tried to smile as i said it but fell short jesus prim exclaimed have you got a scriptwriter now no that trite double metaphor was all my own thank god id hate to think a professional came up with it so what are you telling me that you and susie are building your thing on the basis of a kid because there are millions of examples to show that that doesnt work i dont know what im telling you i dont know period i think i do and then something will happen to make me uncertain again like me turning up out of the blue yes no fuck she smiled at me again but with real warmth this time i couldnt remember the last time shed looked at me that way my darling those three words encompass your entire approach to life and mine susies wrong for you shes much too complicated i sat on the couch and pulled her down beside me all of a sudden i was dead tired she put her head on my shoulder you may be right prim you may well be but youve got to let me work that out for myself not try to persuade me last time you came back into my life it led to all sorts of disasters for us both having you do it again scares me a wee bit no scares me a lot so please you do what you have to do to get rid of loverboy go see your mum and dad and let me get on with making my movie and with sorting myself out she nodded okay she whispered then she drew me round and kissed me again i kissed her back but not out of habit this time finally she stood id better leave now she murmured yeah i said but before you go she looked at me with a mixture of surprise and expectation yes youd better take some of those tissues and wipe my makeup off your face otherwise people will talk even more than theyre going to already forty i was bugger all use for the rest of the day i fluffed a couple of simple lines and tried even miless patience but somehow or other i got through it without too much embarrassment mandy was waiting outside my dressing room when i got back down to cockburn street at the end of it all its not like you to let a locked door bother you i said grimly come to think of it its not like anyone around here shh she whispered urgently rickys back hes in the catering van and the doors open he might hear you i might tell him all the same i grunted but i didnt mean it it had been a bad enough day as it was and if i dropped mandy in it by telling her boss about her surprise visit id just make myself look even dafter not to mention getting her fired as i opened the door her look told me she didnt believe my threat anyway has my wife gone i asked her her mouth fell open and stayed like that for a good few seconds your wife she exclaimed at last primavera the woman who visited the set at the lunch break she told me she was dawns sister she is shes also my wife but were getting divorced im not surprised she said with a snorting laugh i thought id been fully briefed about you but ricky left that bit out it wasnt relevant has she gone do you know mandy nodded yes about half an hour ago what about the guy she was with nicky johnson she surprised me by looking starstruck there she was working with three of the biggest name actors in the world in miles dawn and ewan but it took his name to make her eyes go dreamy no accounting for tastes is there just as well she hadnt been there when miles decked him she might have leapt to his defence he left before her they had a big argument and i heard gail driver booking him on the next london flight she shook her head more fool your missus you dont know the half of it i muttered but shes well shot of that clown mandy looked at me as a nun might have looked at a heretic come on i said back to business what have you got to tell me about the guy who left that photo for me nothing much i did find a catering worker who saw a man near this van but she didnt see him break in or anything he was just standing there leaning against the wall smoking a cigarette description he was wearing a hard hat and an orange donkey jacket theres a shop being refurbished up the road theyre working seven days a week and thats what the builders wear he was probably just a joiner having a smoke nevertheless did she notice anything else he was around six feet tall he had a beard and he was wearing flashy wrapround sunglasses a joiner in raybans did anyone think to go and see if any of the guys working on the site fit that description mandy gave her lip a quick nibble no she murmured well do it tomorrow theyll have knocked off for the day by now a waste of time said a voice from the door i turned to see ricky climbing into my room if that was your guy hes not going to be back if it wasnt so bloody what he had a point so whats he up to i asked why pull a stunt like that i dont know oz it could just be a nutter thats the likeliest explanation in fact but what if it isnt in my experience the likeliest explanation hardly ever turns out to be right ross took a deep breath mine too he admitted in that case this could be leading up to an extortion attempt you might get a letter threatening susie and the baby and demanding a payoff the photo the way it was taken and the way it was planted could all be an attempt to scare you into paying up what about a kidnap attempt not a chance the guy would have done that already or tried it if it was on his agenda lets assume he isnt a nutter and he isnt stupid hell know that susies protected i want that stepped up dont worry it has been youll need to tell her whats happening though i dont want her picking up the phone and getting any nasty surprises i agreed with that ill call her right away i said ive talked to mr grayson ricky continued and we both think i should step up your cover as well we should make it more obvious you should have someone fulltime like him and mrs grayson and ewan capperauld it could be that hes picked you because youre the most vulnerable i thought mandy could do that for you shes well capable and youve got spare rooms up there in your apartment you okay with that i risked a quick glance at my lady minder she was deadpan attractive as that suggestion is i replied i dont want that one ive promised a bedroom to liam matthews whenever the schedule brings him to town hes all the minder ill ever need two i have another plan for mandy three i dont want to scare this guy away i want to meet him in fact if he does send a demand for money i plan to deliver it in person s fortyone did that make rickys day not by a long way he tried everything to talk me round he even got miles in on the act but i wasnt having any of it and eventually they came to terms with it most of all of course what i wasnt having was mandy ofarrell in my spare room i did phone susie though as id agreed as soon as i got home i told her the real reason for my jumpiness the day before and i told her about the photograph i didnt expect her to sound frightened and she wasnt i did expect her to sound angry and she was but not just at the mischiefmaker she turned the heat on me as well why the hell are you only telling me this now she demanded do you think im some sort of a bloody wimp if this guys threatening anyone hes threatening our daughter and i had a right to know that from the start she paused for emphasis i guessed now tell me what youre doing about it and id better be impressed or ill make my own arrangements i didnt like to think what they might be lord provost jack gantry had had connections with some euphemistically named security firms around glasgow and the survivors were still around youve had cover since last night i told her one of rickys guys has had you in his sight ever since i plan to step that up theres a woman on his staff you met her briefly the other night i plan to move her in with you until this guys nailed that big blond amazon she exclaimed the one you called mandy thats the one can she handle herself oh yes she wouldnt be working for ross if she couldnt i was taking a chance that she could also keep her mouth shut something she hadnt been able to do the night before but i wanted susie and janet to have effective close protection and i couldnt think of anyone who was better equipped to do the job okay she agreed just a touch grudgingly ill give her a try but the best solution is to catch this guy have you reported it to the police rickys briefed his contacts they know whats happened but theyre keeping it under wraps so what the hell are you and ross actually doing apart from giving me a houseguest and sitting on your arses the only thing we can love were waiting for his next move fortytwo i had hoped that my day was done but no such luck i had just finished speaking to susie when the phone rang again i need to see you said ricky theres been a development on the anna chin investigation we agreed to meet halfanhour later in the oxford bar where real detectives are supposed to hang out ten minutes after that i knew that it never rains but it pours ricky told me that the police had released corporal adam cruikshank anna chins paratrooper boyfriend pending further investigation hes got a petrol transaction slip from a filling station in canonmills he said the time on it doesnt prove absolutely that he couldnt have killed anna but hed have had to be some driver they still like him for it but theres absolutely no evidence to place him at the scene so until they find some theyve had to let him go mmm i muttered still it keeps them away from alison aye but said ricky ominously theres something else even if this lad had found out about his girl and david capperauld he couldnt have killed him i made some enquiries of a closemouthed military source of mine when the boy david was done corporal cruikshank was jumping out of a plane on a training exercise in the middle east only we know about that connection only we know about the attempts to set up alison they still mean that the same person committed both murders the police are barking up the wrong tree with the soldier i cant tell them that but sooner or later theyre going to find out the guy with the beard had become my big concern but he wasnt my only one as much as i wanted to i couldnt forget about alison i had hoped that the corporal was the end of our troubles on that score now he had been hit on the head as a likely suspect and she was still a thorn in my flesh it wasnt that i was too worried about her though hell no i had my own position to think of after all ricky and i had messed up the crime scene and we had hidden information from the police that would have led them straight to the most obvious suspect yes we had done it for the best of motives we believed that alison was innocent and i was cool about that we had also done it very well so there was no reason why anyone should ever find out unless of course and this was my one niggling doubt the police found out about david and anna and put the thumbscrews on alison herself ricky had told her to deny everything and say nothing else if it came to that but still she was flaky under pressure all in all i reckoned and i said as much to ricky the sooner the real killer was caught the better it would be for everyone that depends who it is he muttered darkly the oxford was busy as always but we had wedged ourselves into a quiet corner what the hell do you mean by that i demanded the real killers got it in for alison oz hes done two people and tried to frame her for both of them to all intents and purposes he succeeded the first time and if it hadnt been for a police car being in a traffic accident shed be remanded in prison right now and wouldnt be coming out again until she was past fifty whoevers done that had a bloody good reason for it when we find out what it is we might not like it have you asked her about it i know you two have been pillowtalking after all yes ive asked her as directly as i could she swears she hasnt a clue who or what could be behind it and do you believe her he looked down into his beer and nodded if that was me talking i said youd bloody laugh at me youd go on about the power of the furry purse to blind you to the obvious and in the end id agree with you jesus christ for years i thought prim was mary fucking poppins ricky chuckled aye and that you were bert the chimney sweep i suppose youre right though thats exactly what i have told myself and i still believe her so do you come to that you never thought she killed capperauld and you know she didnt kill anna chin because someone set her up to be caught sure but believing that she doesnt have a clue why all this has happened thats something else nonetheless i do he finished his pint went up to the bar and ordered two more youre right about something else too he said when he returned two correct in one night thats good going for you thanks what is it we do need to catch this character he knows about the connection between david and anna clearly he does because hes killed them both at the moment as far as were aware hes the only one who does but if the police dont tie in alison in the next few days then sooner rather than later hes going to find a way to let them in on the secret if we allow that to happen my famous friend for all ive told alison to act wideeyed and innocent chances are we are all waistdeep in the shit so where do we begin to look for him stick a pin in a map of the city thats as good a way as any in the circumstances do you have any bright ideas what connects the two killings its a triangle thats what were meant to think maybe it is maybe alison knew about it from the start maybe were just a pair of saps and she is just playing us along maybe she made those anonymous phone calls to herself and maybe she fixed that accident to the police car yes at the end of it all thats the one lucky break shes had and thats why i believe all the rest of it so to come back to your question what connects the two killings torrent what do you mean he was a client of alison and davids he was anna chins employer he was putting pressure on alison when all this happened and hes dodgy in business as we know from susie yet when i spoke to him he was as nice as nine euros handing out treats like he was scrooge on christmas day but so what but so its all weve fucking got we need bugger it you need to get in there and see what you can find youre his security consultant start a complete review in the wake of annas murder and while youre at it look for anything that might help us here otherwise were not just waistdeep in the shit any minute now the teabreakll be over and itll be back to standing on our heads fortythree actually i was in it already as i found out when i left the oxford i had switched off my mobile while i was talking to ricky when i turned it on again outside in young street it flashed at me impatiently to tell me that i had a voice message it was susie terse and to the point call me back i obeyed trying her mobile first since its ringing was less likely to disturb janet you might have warned me she said as soon as she answered i thought i had i protested not knowing what the hell she was on about is mandy there with you yes she replied and that made it worse having her in the house she knew who she was when the buzzer went and she answered it the third pint of lager had fogged my brain who i mumbled prim you idiot who else your wife came to see me and our daughter you might have bloody well warned me she was around but she only turned up this afternoon i heard myself protest lamely and when she left i thought she was going up to perthshire to see her folks id no idea shed go to see you or id have told her not to fat chance shed have listened said susie scornfully so what did she say did mandy have to referee mandy wasnt there i sent her into the kitchen while we had our chat and and she was as nice as only primavera can be when she puts her mind to it she asked if she could see the baby and when i showed her j to her she got all mistyeyed shed even stopped in at a shopping centre and bought her a present i then she said that the way things had worked out were probably for the best she hoped that you and i would be very happy together and she wished us both luck what do you make of that what should i make of it i replied im relieved i suppose she didnt know about janet until she turned up in edinburgh this afternoon it came as a real shock to her im pleased that shes taken the news so well she didnt know she told you that and you believed her yes oh you poor gullible lad shes a better actor than you are not that it would be hard come on susie i protested stung by her critical review whats your problem with all this i know her she shot back her turning up like this was not spur of the moment and as for her best wishes they were a declaration of war i was always wary of prim at the best of times as things are now i wouldnt trust her an inch ah come on sometimes you have to take people at face value she isnt people shes your wife and shes got the biggest down on me any woman could possibly have on another so when she swans into my house goes gooey over my baby and wishes me long life and happiness no way will i believe a bloody word shes saying well i do okay sure you do like you believed her in the past when she was having it off with half of spain in your absence she didnt really lie to me though i just assumed anyway all that time was none of my business yeah and what about her and mike when she was with you and he was with me what about that young street grew blurred all around me i held the phone away from my ear and looked at it until my eyes focused what did you just say i asked her when i could find the words nothing i ever planned to she replied i never intended to tell you but the two of them had an affair in glasgow prim and dylan youre making that up you have to be i wish i was but im not after he died i found a letter she wrote him the daft bastard kept it inside the birthday card it came in it was wishing him many happy returns in more ways than one so i said slowly when you turned up in spain and we got it together you were getting your own back too susie fell silent no she answered eventually i didnt plan it that way but it made it a hell of a lot easier i can tell you so why didnt you tell me about her and dylan until now i dont know i didnt see the need i suppose you liked him and hes gone what was the point of telling you and did you tell prim you knew no im keeping that in reserve for when i need it and when will that be when she tries to get you back as she will she wont she knows better i know better she will believe me maybe shes started already i thought about our encounter that afternoon and prims willingness to put the couch to good use susie latched on to my silence she has hasnt she she exclaimed almost triumphantly well if she did she failed and when she saw that she had she went to see you and wished you all the best i heard her laugh in your dreams big boy tell me something this man whos been following you the guy who took our picture and planted it in your room has it ever occurred to you that he might be working for your wife did it never occur to you that she was being far too compliant over the divorce no it had not never until that moment i told susie as much well maybe you should give it some thought youre trying to make a movie which she knows all about because her sisters in it out of the blue dodgy things happen why shouldnt she be behind them why shouldnt she be behind all of them fortyfour i thought about what susie had said for the rest of the night i started thinking about it again as soon as i was wakened next morning by the sound of the door buzzer i checked my watch as i answered it was five to nine id overslept and liam matthews was at the door ready to begin rehearsals for his big week of being a movie star having shot the beginning of the movie the day before we were scheduled to film one of the climactic scenes a complicated shootout in edinburgh universitys mcewan graduating hall which had been made available to us for a full week as i waited for the lift to come up from the street i ran through what susie had said could prim have sent the stalker could she have planted that photo herself shed had the chance sure if she had shed put on a terrific act when id told her about the baby but shed put on some alist performances for me in the past not least keeping me totally in the dark about her having it off with mike dylan god rot his bones yes i told myself as i listened to the whoosh behind the sliding steel door she could be behind the man who followed me i wouldn t put that past her but to be behind all of it then the lift opened and there he was the gwa world heavyweight champion a true superstar of wrestling i half expected him to have the big leather and gold title belt slung over his shoulder but thankfully he was out of character for the week when i first met liam i took an instant dislike to him he was pushy arrogant playing all the stuff in his ring persona in real life pissing off just about everyone around him and surviving in his job only because of his exceptional physical gifts his technical skills he was a world championship medallist as an amateur and his natural acrobatic talent pound for pound because hes much smaller than most of his enormous colleagues liam is as good a sports entertainer wrestler that is as the world has ever seen happily hes also worked his way though his difficult period found himself a nice girl and let the nice guy within him work his way to the surface he filled a void in my life when dylans death left me short of a best pal given what id learned in the last twelve hours or so was i glad to see him right then he looked me up and down jesus boy what have you been up to you look frazzled youve got eyes on you like pissholes in the snow id a few beers last night then i didnt sleep very well ive had a disturbing weekend i heard myself give a slightly hysterical laugh weekend fuck since i came back to edinburgh the whole place has been growing crazier and crazier i dumped liams bag in the spare bedroom off the living area took him into the kitchen and made him coffee then led him through to my suite he sipped quietly as i shaved then showered and as i told him stage by stage about everything that had happened to me over the last few weeks from prims walkout in california to her reappearance on the shoot and her visit to susie in glasgow you think i look frazzled do you i asked him as i buckled my belt is it any bloody wonder no liam conceded i dont suppose it is he looked at me appraising me once again you know whats the most dangerous thing in the sports entertainment business he asked in his light dublin brogue tell me aggression its when a wrestler goes into the ring in an aggressive frame of mind that someone gets hurt youre so full of it right now that if you came across this guy whos been following you the good lord alone knows how far youd go what you need oz is to take that aggression out on someone who can absorb it who you liam laughed it was loud and refreshing and i felt a bit better right away dont be so fucking stupid id damage you no you need to take it out on yourself whats our timetable for today we meet up for lunch at the rehearsal room in george street one oclock sharp fine have you sorted yourself out a gym in this town yes not far from here then thats where you and i are going to spend the morning well get you healed there my friend was as good as his word we headed down to the edinburgh club where liam put me through his own training routine while hes small for a wrestler around my height hes maybe fifteen pounds heavier than my oneninetyfive and fast and exceptionally strong with it he worked each piece of apparatus flat out and he made me keep up his pace all the way he made me press weights id never even attempted before with my arms and legs until i screamed out loud with the effort when we were done with that he made me put on the gloves and held the heavy punchbag while i hit it harder and harder combinations at first then single punches big booming shots every one of them aimed at a bearded guy wearing shades finally i nailed the red leather bag with a huge righthander that broke liams grip on it and sent him rolling over backwards jesus he grinned as he got to his feet im glad that was between me and you to wind up he took me on the judo mat and showed me some new moves and other stuff he had been working on himself not necessarily for use in the ring more the type of throws and holds that had won him his world championship medal when we were done with that he sat down in the middle of the mat and told me to do the same close your eyes he instructed cleanse your mind of all but the most peaceful thoughts take the biggest lungful of air you can and release it slowly then breathe shallow quietly so you cant even feel it then find whats dearest to your heart and focus on that alone i did as he said as i exhaled i had a vision behind my closed eyes of jan my dead soulmate shed come to me before in times of need and she did so again wordlessly this time i could hear nothing but the sound of my own heart its beat slow and steady as i concentrated on the picture in my mind i seemed to close in on its centre on something within her it grew and became clearer until two figures formed susie and the baby i sat there motionless for i know not how long looking at my child and her mother aware only of them and of the violence draining out of me id probably have stayed in my trance all day had not liam broken it by touching me gently on the shoulder okay boy he said time to be moving as i took my second shower of the day i felt cleansed in every sense as i towelled myself dry and dressed i realised just how strung out i had been and how close to the edge id come i took a look in the mirror and couldnt see a trace of the guy whod been there a few hours before you have to master yourself oz liam said to me quietly as i drove back to the apartment on the mound theres something dangerous about you it needs to be driven out and kept out what we did this morning should be your standard workout from now on but the most important part of it is the part at the end if you cant do anything else none of the physical stuff at the very least you should commune with the peaceful side of your nature every day in life since then ive taken that advice to heart and followed it religiously it works most of the time i still find it strange to think of the gwa champion as a man wholly cleansed of aggression but i understand completely why that has to be these people are trained professionals kids dont try their stuff at home we were dropping our gym gear at home straight into the washing machine when my hardwon serenity was put to its first test i had missed my morning check of my email so in the few minutes that were left before we had to head for george street i switched on my laptop plugged in my modem and set up an aol flashsession even if theres mail normally it takes seconds to run unless theres an attachment to download this time there was an untitled jpeg file it took just under a minute until it was complete and joannas voice said goodbye i opened my offline filing cabinet and looked at the incoming folder there were two new messages one was a cheery hello from susie saying sorry that shed given me a hard time the night before and assuring me that everything was okay in glasgow the second was from a source i didnt recognise it was on hotmail untitled and the sender address was no more than a jumble of letters mzrimnmeal i opened it thinking that it was junk mail expecting someone to be offering me free insurance promising me a bride from st petersburg or trying to sell me a magic pill that would make my dick three inches longer ive had all of those and more in my mailbox in my time this one was different though the message was two words thats all hello oz at the foot of the screen an icon indicated an attachment i have my computer set up so that all my downloads go straight to my desktop i clicked three times and the folder was open i found it easily u for untitled with the jpeg symbol i opened it and watched as it unrolled on the screen it was another photograph of susie and the baby from our saturday outing this time taken inside the kelvingrove art gallery so much for my powers of observation id been wise to the man yet hed still been able to follow us inside and take the second photograph stupid oz rushing off to the gents like that to play detective you could have come out and they could have been gone but they weren t i answered myself which means surely that the man s intentions aren t violent dont be daft the next email will ask for money whats up liam asked i showed him the screen the guys been playing silly buggers again inside i was strangely pleased with myself i didnt feel a trace of anger i picked up the phone called ricky and told him what had happened give me the sender address he said i read it out letter by letter number by number ill try it on mark kravitz he has contacts with the thought police mind you given that its hotmail they might be able to tell you where it was sent from but as for identifying the sender therell be little or no chance of that maybe he sent it from his home phone nah hell have used a public internet access for sure have faith richard i told him in the inherent stupidity of your fellow man this guys been daft enough to stalk two of the most protected people on the planet maybe hes been daft enough to lead us to him hed have signed his fucking name if he was going to do that maybe so anyway hes letting us know hes still there thats the main thing yeah said ross sourly look on the bright side make my fucking day whats up with you i get like this when i lose a client who torrent the fat bastard called me into his office this morning and fired me he blames me for leaving anna chin open to attack i pointed out to him that it was his niece who instituted the friday evening callin system for the reps and that it was the two of them who left her vulnerable by fucking off to gleneagles for the weekend when normally at least one of them would still have been there when she finished didnt do any good though ross securitys contract is terminated from this date for dereliction of duty im sorry about that ricky he may be too i may sue the fat fucker you do that but it wont help us catch our killer will it ah but ive made progress on that i was in there through the night i made photocopies of all the health and safety signin sheets i know everyone whos been in there since the company moved into that building five months ago i also took what i could from annas desk you never know the killer might have signed his fucking name too he gave a short bitter laugh oh by the way torrents been really busy this morning he called your codirector alison in too is she at work she insisted dont worry shes covered did he fire her too no nothing like that but he did ask her to draft a letter to ewan capperauld putting his invitation on hold in the light of annas death he feels that it wouldnt be appropriate to proceed at this stage with something that might be seen as a celebration thats unusually sensitive of him maybe but hes still postponed it indefinitely hell get his reward in heaven soon i hope while were waiting im off to look at those lists he hung up and i turned back to my computer yes pal i said to the screen as i reached for the trackpad to begin the closedown process pity you didnt sign your name isnt it i looked at the address and my hand froze all at once i couldnt see anything but those letters and numbers mzrimnmeal focused on them totally as if i was back on the mat meditating they seemed to swim before my eyes as i rearranged them in my mind and all of a sudden i knew who my stalker was the stupid bastard really had signed his name i just couldnt make myself believe it thats all fortyfive i carried the name in my mind all through lunch and into the afternoon rehearsal the scenes which we were shooting were relatively easy for me all i had to do was look alert shout a few words and fire a pistol convincingly any other director in the world would have hired an exsoldier to teach the guntoting members of the cast how to use them in an authentic way not miles he was an exsoldier and in his young days in the aussie army he had learned the true marksman technique himself along with a few other things which would not be needed in this project we could have used empty magazines and dubbed the gunfire noises on to the soundtrack but miles had decided that we would fire blanks so that the weapons would react properly in our hands when we pulled their triggers so he spent a good part of that afternoon teaching us individually ewan me bill massey liam and a few bit players how to handle the weapons wed be using and letting us feel for ourselves how it felt when they were fired almost for real mine was a big heavy colt automatic and i was really glad that there was no business end on the cartridges the thing was so clumsy that id have blown out half the lights on the chandelier by the time i was through while ive never fired a gun in anger myself ive seen it done close up i understand the power of the things physical and psychological and ive seen their aftereffects i do not like firearms not at all and im glad that in my country at least their ownership is restricted by the time wed finished for the day my earlier conviction that i knew my follower had gone more than a bit hazy it was a coincidence sure but thats all it was it had to be strange though when we left the rehearsal room to walk back to the mound i didnt feel threatened any more i knew that he was still there and i guessed that he and i would come face to face pretty soon now i was looking forward to it not for what i was going to do to him for liam had pounded most of that out of me but because actually i wanted to meet him miles and dawn had invited liam and me to join them for dinner at the caledonian that evening i found myself looking forward to that too i had trouble remembering the last time i had sat down to a formal meal grazing had become my norm by the time we had checked the news and were ready to go time was getting a bit tight so we took a taxi down to the hotel as we hailed it i had a fleeting thought that the driver might be my stalker and that he might flood the back of the cab with gas then whisk us off to parts unknown as it happened he was an old bloke with a flat cap and a hacking cough he did try to whisk us off on a convoluted route to the caley but i was wise to that and made him drive straight down the hill and along princes street miles had a couple of surprises in store for us when we were shown into the private dining room he had booked we werent his only guests ewan capperauld was there too with a pleasant darkhaired brightfaced lady i wouldnt have known her from eve but he introduced her as his wife margaret she was about his age tall athletic from the back of my mind i dredged up an old piece of showbiz trivia id read once in her teens shed been an olympic gymnast and very attractive in an understated way i could understand why young david had made a pass at her ten years back the capperaulds fame as a couple was based on their privacy rather than their public face they were never to be found in the pages of hello or ok and they seldom attended film events together having got to know ewan i had come to understand that he viewed his wife as his business partner she handled all the stuff offscreen and offstage and he did everything else i thought of the two agents id employed in my short career they were all right but i wouldnt have wanted to sleep with either of them the second surprise arrived a couple of minutes after we did it was susie there was a light in her eye and she was dressed to kill wow murmured liam as she walked into the room if i didnt know whose girl she was even ewans head turned and hes seen more than a few glamour queens in his time she walked right up to me and took my arm stood on tiptoe and kissed me i felt myself smiling awkwardly and i knew why susie and i having dinner with my sisterinlaw and her husband i looked at dawn checking for any frost in her expression but i saw none miles read my mind he walked over to us after yesterday he said we thought we should make it clear where we stand as far as you two are concerned he took susies hand and kissed it welcome he murmured youre among friends she gleamed with delight i smiled a bit myself why wouldnt i there i was with a partner who was the brightest light in a room full of movie stars and their consorts id made the jump from a bad marriage to a new relationship with a readymade family so why did i feel just a wee bit boxed in ewan and his wife came across and i made the introductions youre susan gantry margaret exclaimed ive read a lot about you i cant tell you how much i admire what youve done with your business that was it the ice wasnt just broken it was shattered how did you get here i asked susie quietly when eventually we were seated at the rectangular table mandy drove me through you going straight back after dinner she shook her head and grinned ethels given me an overnight pass well go back in the morning any scares through there i was never scared but no its been all quiet what about you i told her about the second photograph via email i did not tell her about my wild flight of fancy about the sender no way did i tell her that that dinner party was the best night id had wed had since janet was born susie was treated not as a newcomer but as a member of the cast as for liam his girlfriend is an air steward and she was en route for miami but even on his own he fitted in hes like that i noticed that miles was watching him from time to time and i guessed that if he handled his nottootaxing part reasonably well it might not be his last looking back one of the reasons for the evenings success was that there was no centre of attraction miles was the perfect host he said very little all night letting the rest of us chat as we liked about whatever we liked the only thing that was off limits was our current project and quite right too more and more i found myself watching the capperaulds apart from my parents id never seen a couple who complemented each other so well and who were as relaxed and confident in each others company i like to think that jan and i would have turned out that way round that table i found myself thinking that maybe susie gantry and i would maybe the evening was over too soon miles ordered a round of liqueurs for those who wanted them and that was that as we broke up susie asked miles dawn ewan margaret and liam to sign her menu she surprised me slightly but i supposed that even the most confident among us can be a punter at heart i was slightly huffed that she didnt ask me to add my name but she told me that she had something else in mind for me to sign what i asked youll find out soon enough liam was just a bit awkward about being in the spare room with susie in the apartment he even volunteered to move into a hotel dont be daft she told him just you think of yourself as a nanny were used to them you can be a big irish version we could always call mandy on her mobile i suggested and ask her to sleep over for added security he grinned at my jest sure and i could teach her some new holds yes i almost retorted no she could teach you some good sense made me put the brakes on the words right on the edge of my tongue i had got away with murder once with susie i didnt fancy pushing my luck any further fortysix there is a myth that moviemaking is all early starts and late finishes and that the other side of the coin for guys like me is that we earn our vast sacks of gold by being dumped in arduous locations for weeks and months on end and are then screamed at from six am till midnight by neurotic directors who are overly jealous because we can act and therefore are recognisably famous while they cant and therefore arent i believe thats true on occasion but its never happened to me yet my experience is of filming in attractive cities and countryside under the guidance of a mentor who explains how he wants a scene to look and sound once its shot rehearses until hes happy its going to turn out that way then completes in a minimum of takes and with no histrionics at all but then so far ive only worked with miles grayson no as ive come to appreciate the people who really work hard on movie projects are those behind the cameras and there are a hell of a lot of them every one seems to look after his or her own bit of the business and most of them seem to have exotic titles for example theres someone called a focus puller i assume that her job is to pull focuses but how she pulls them and with what is and always will be completely beyond me the crews first day at the mcewan graduating hall was scheduled to begin at sixthirty for the cast it began at midday susie had a flying start she had asked mandy to pick her up at seventhirty and she was up and ready we had a coffee and toast breakfast i took some in to liam and then we headed for the mound thanks i said as the lift wound quietly down to the ground floor what for she laughed coming through for a posh dinner at the caley sat beside ewan capperauld and across from miles grayson then getting to sleep with you that was not a chore my darling i promise no i mean thanks for putting up with me and all the shit i have brought into your life having a minder at home surprise visits from prim and all that crap she patted my chest listen all of that is offset by the incredible good youve brought into it there wouldnt have been a janet without you which begs no screams the question i told her that has been gnawing at me i know youve said you love me and you keep on showing it but is that only because weve made a family together a familys something youve never had not properly so without janet would there still be a me the lift doors opened and we stepped out the entrance hall was empty funny you should ask that susie whispered because just occasionally when i brush the stardust out of my eyes and look at the real world i ask myself that very same question about you whats your answer ill tell you remember the signature i want from you the one we joked about last night i want it on our marriage forms i whistled as in whistling in the dark perhaps jesus youve taken my breath away i mean no ones ever proposed to me before you sure about it im in business oz i wouldnt propose a merger if i didnt think it was absolutely right for my company the same principle applies in my life i know how i feel and i know what i want now how about you i know how i feel too for a while i believed that there was no goodness in the world any more but you and janet changed that i love you and our daughter and i will always be around for you i dont need to tell you that i hope but remember ive stood before the anvil twice and twice ive been burned by the heat of the forge christ the ink isnt even wet on my divorce never mind dry on top of that am i a guy you can trust i think so if i can trust you after what i walked in on the other night for gods sake her eyes were laughing they made me want to say yes yes yes right there and then but it wasnt as easy as that let me think about this susie there are things i have to sort out such as whether or not you really love me no the past thats all the light went out of her eyes in an instant prim got to you didnt she youre having second thoughts about the divorce i shook my head not one well she is in that case i wouldnt let her no thats a done deal honest even if she did try to back out its done id use her fling with johnson as grounds she might countersue tough well what is it that you have to sort out everything me jan everything her eyes were full of doubt now i had hurt her and i knew it but if i told her the real reason for my hesitancy the mad idea which was still there at the back of my mind that would hurt her a lot more the devil alone knew what it would do to her fortyseven liam and i hit the gym again at eightthirty we hit it bloody hard we did an hour flat out going through the same routine as the day before ending with ten minutes of meditation we had taken our shaving gear down with us i was just wiping off the remnants of the gel when my mobile phone sounded where are you ricky asked he was using his crisis voice i leapt straight to the worst conclusion imaginable the police had found the link between david capperauld and anna chin they were after alison and us im at the gym wait there ill pick you up gimme the address i did i handed liam my car keys and told him that if i didnt see him back at the apartment id head straight for the mcewan hall privately i hoped that id make it anywhere other than the cells at gayfield police station rickys alfa pulled up outside the club in less than ten minutes he looked as grim as hed sounded and that made me feel no better wheres the fire i asked him he answered with a savage grunt ah i see i muttered its at your house he headed up towards the city centre swung round picardy place and then along york place when he didnt stop outside alisons office i began to feel a bit easier he didnt say a word as he drove along queen street then out across the dean bridge towards the west of the city i dont know why im taking you here he muttered eventually but youve been arriving at disaster scenes since you got back to edinburgh so you might as well pitch up at another where are we going youll see we drove in renewed silence out through blackhall until he took a right turn just past the library i still hadnt a clue where we were going until after another couple of twists and turns he swung in to gamekeepers road and into the driveway of one of the big villas that line it three police cars and an ambulance were lined up in front of the house the doors of the ambulance were open but no one was hurrying i knew what that meant i still hadnt a bloody clue then i looked at the garage to the side of the sandstone mansion the wide door was open and i could read the personalised plates on the roller and the mercedes that were parked inside james torrent i heard myself gasp this is james torrents place was said ricky tersely now it belongs to his estate my head went all over the place again as i realised what he had said very sad i managed but why are we here ronnie morrow didnt know id been fired as security consultant he phoned me hed filled that gap in his knowledge though he was standing in the doorway as we crunched up the drive he was dressed in a white crimescene tunic you might have told me sir he said reproachfully i found this on his desk i peered at the copy letter as he held it up by a corner i couldnt read it all but i could see that it was addressed to ross security and i could guess what it said as far as im concerned we still have a contract ricky snapped back okay he nodded to me but why bring him he was with me when you called i didnt have time to drop him off what happened come and have a look he gave us each a tunic like his from a pile by the door and waited till we put them on then he led us into the house and up a big wide staircase it reminded me of the place in spain that i was in the process of selling to scott steele at the top we turned left a heavy panelled door lay open and we could see the people bustling inside we could also see james torrent he was behind a big wooden desk in a chair that looked like the twin of the one in his penthouse office he was reclining his little piggy eyes staring at the ceiling his great mouth hanging open slackly dont go beyond the doorway said morrow you can see enough from here how asked ricky stabbed right through the heart when just after midnight the me reckoned weapon from one of the cavernous pockets of his tunic morrow produced a knife encased in a clear plastic evidence envelope a sound like a police siren went off in my head i recognised it when we were together id once given alison a fancy desk set for her office it had included a paper knife with a long thin gilt blade and a fancy tooled handle just like the one morrow was holding okay it wasnt a oneoff piece but after the last couple of weeks were going to have to speak to alison goodchild again the detective sergeant announced as if hed been reading my thoughts why i blurted out i was startled and couldnt disguise it when he was killed mr torrent appears to have been signing his days correspondence the letter i showed mr ross was at the top of the pile hed done but there was another folder in his briefcase with more not signed yet one of them was to her terminating her contract aw come on ronnie ricky protested you might as well list me as a suspect dont take it like that sir you and she arent the only people getting bad news in those letters well have to talk to everybody you know that ross was mollified i suppose so i tapped him on the shoulder listen i need to go i have to be on set at eleventhirty and its five past now okay ill take you morrow led the way back to the front door we stripped off the tunics and dumped them on a pile of discard just outside in the pathway i wont bother to interview you sir said the sergeant thanks for the courtesy ross shot back as we walked towards his car you might have told me youd such a tight deadline he grumbled as we climbed in i dont i told him about the knife oh fuck he whispered when i was finished but its a plant you know that sure and shes got an alibi hasnt she sure she was in my bed and ive got a grudge against torrent as well as her some alibi that knifell have her prints on it sure ill say she was with me that were in a relationship all of a sudden shes got an accomplice do you know what theyll wind up arresting us both worse than that theyll assume weve been having it off since before her fiance was murdered chances are theyll do us both for that as well fortyeight id never seen ricky ross panic before it was not a pretty sight it was all i could do to stop him picking up alison and making a run for it he saw sense at last though on the drive back to the city centre we have got to concentrate on what we started on sunday man i told him we have to find the killer before it goes pearshaped for us all you think it isnt already he retorted as we drove across the george iv bridge but youre right weve got some time yet even if alisons prints are on that knife itll take them a while to lift them and match them if she goes away on a business trip even if its only for a couple of days thatll buy us more so how are you getting on checking the lists you took from torrent he swung the car round past bristo square into george street and stopped on a yellow line ive been through them all wee anna was efficient everyone who came into that building printed and signed their name he chuckled all the wellknown ones signed her own wee book too even you flash bastard that you are must have been a great job for an autograph hunter they came to her every signature in there matched a signature on the list bar one whose was that havent a fucking clue the thing was completely illegible just a straight line with squiggles in it thats all i know the one like an ecg chart thats it its nowhere on the health and safety lists some pop star probably shell have taken it with her to a concert so where does it take us he threw me a gloomy look nowhere pal if you were making a western here id say i could hear the sound of the sheriffs posse closing in on me as it is i can almost feel mr skinners hand on my collar i could see that his earlier panic was still pretty close to the surface id never imagined him like this before never thought it possible that he supercop supermason superconnected could lose it if he was scared surely i should be too i told myself and then as if in answer a strange feeling of certainty swept over me it told me beyond doubt that everything would be all right i smiled at him youre forgetting one thing ricky whats that he grunted youre sat next to the luckiest bastard on the planet i held up my right hand grab that and some of it will rub off on you he looked at me as if i was a lunatic maybe hes right maybe i am i only have my own word that im not but then he took his whiteknuckled fist off the steering wheel and grasped mine at this moment he said ill try anything fortynine the setup in the mcewan hall was still not complete when i walked in everything else was ready though including the production trucks which were lined up on the bristo square car park the cafeteria van was nearest the hall with the others in ranks behind it my dressing room was out of sight but that was fine that was the way i liked it i had told miles as we were leaving the caley the night before that i wanted the minders pulled off me altogether mandy should stay with susie but i was to be left alone he hadnt been too keen on the idea but i had insisted i knew that something else was going to happen i wasnt certain what it would be but i didnt want anyone around when it did i picked up my andy martin costume from the wardrobe department and headed along to the truck to change when i was in my screen clothes i locked my watch wallet and wedding ring in the safe which was set in the floor and went to makeup i didnt even bother to lock the door as i left liam was on set as i walked into the hall big grin teeth sparkling looking like mario mcguire to the life he had his jacket slung over his shoulder i couldnt see any of the wiring associated with a blood capsule so i guessed from that alone that we werent going for a take that day i said as much to miles and he nodded were barely ready in the hall yet weve had to make modifications to the seating and the carpenters still have a couple of things to do so ive sent all the nonessential extras home for the day the key players can run through the scene though the crucial part with bill and the video camera thats got to work for real and i want to see that it does you could fake it though it wouldnt show yeah but id know it besides faking it costs thats typical miles the dinner in the caley the night before must have cost the earth but in terms of his personal cash it was small change but the production budget is the investors money and its a matter of personal pride with him never to waste that the guns are here though he added theyre paid for anyway he had cut a deal with the army they were providing all the necessary firearms plus an armourer for a flat fee there were men in black uniforms and balaclavas too extras cast as sas soldiers ive seen a couple of these people in real life and our version looked pretty authentic to me i asked miles whether hed hired the uniforms from the military as well he put a finger to his lips and went sshhh we spent the afternoon doing rehearsals of all the scenes in the hall up to and including the big gunfight at the end miles concentrated on liam who was a bit like a schoolboy when the action began and tended to overplay his hand acting was not new to him all wrestlers play parts these days assuming characters good and evil some of them quite complex all of them farfetched some of the performers for example everett davis the main man of the gwa are pretty good on microphone some like my other friend jerry gradi the behemoth arent good at all so theyre given very little to say most of them though have a little of the ham about them liam is one of the best but even he has a tendency to overact and it showed as soon as we got under way in the final scene which involved us the good guys confronting an assassin armed with an uzi the bad guy his character mario was meant to take two in the chest as he leapt heroically between the gunman and his target the script had ewan skinner leaning over him giving him a few encouraging words before they carted him off toer in the royal infirmary he didnt have a word to say all the script called for him to do was look up at ewan with a plea for reassurance in his eyes his problem was that while he was fine on his feet acting horizontally was a new experience for him he couldnt get the hang of doing everything with his eyes eventually miles broke into the third rehearsal laughing in spite of himself he could see the joke the big cameras werent running only video so it wasnt chewing into the production budget mr matthews he said we are not doing the death of nelson here the way youre approaching this im up here expecting you to ask ewan to kiss you if youre like this when you have your bedroom scene with the lady sergeant were all in trouble im sorry miles the wrestler replied propping himself up on an elbow i guess its because all my stuffs fake and we have to give the audience a hint that it is i understand so lets start from the ground up dont show any emotion just lie there and think of ireland sure and if i do that ill start to cry we might have had a problem there if i hadnt saved the day hey liam i called out cutting across miless response remember that time down in newcastle when a prop broke and you got a metal shaft through your side he grimaced remember it will i ever forget it okay put yourself back there and just act exactly as you reacted then he had no trouble after that none at all when that incident had happened he had been hurt just as badly as his character was meant to be when we wrapped up for the day we were all happy with the way things had gone i was even whistling a wee tune as i walked back to my dressing room to change out of my gear and to retrieve my watch wallet and keys from the safe i wasnt surprised when i saw the parcel on the table i felt this sense of unreality sure but i wasnt surprised i let it lie there while i changed into my own clothes replaced my andy outfit on its hangers and took it back to the wardrobe caravan i thought about it as i wandered into the cafeteria truck to grab a coffee and chew the fat with liam bill massey and some of the crew but i was in no hurry to open it somehow i felt that i was in control of the game now as everyone began to drift away liam said that he fancied a chinese that evening i told him that was fine by me but that i had a couple of things to do first so i gave him the keys to the apartment and headed back to the dressingroom truck the parcel was still there wrapped in bright blue fancy paper with wee white horses on it i looked at it and smiled it could wait a bit longer i took out my cellphone and called susie just to say hello hows your sorting out going she asked me it was interrupted i told her about james torrent i was surprised she hadnt heard about it already jeez she hissed ive been working all day i havent had the radio or the telly on therell be a long list of candidates for that one from business rivals to pissedoff suppliers to unhappy customers with a bigmoney grievance have the police got any specific leads theyve got one thats going to take them straight to alison goodchild i thought you told me that ricky ross was looking after her he is the trouble is hes on that long list you were talking about oh dear let me try to summon up some sympathy for them both i didnt tell her that i might need some as well instead i said hello to janet over the phone listened to her gurgle then said goodnight to them both finally i was ready for the parcel i guessed that whatever was in it had been wrapped in the shop where it was bought it didnt occur to me for a moment that it might be something sinister there was a nice silver bow on top and letterbombs generally dont come in fancy wrappers i opened it carefully again not because i was worried but because i felt it merited the same care with which it had been put together plus im a fifer you never know when youre going to need a sheet of wrapping paper the tape adhesive wasnt exactly super glue it came away easily and the paper lifted clear in a piece without tearing nice one oz inside was a large packet of pampers two babygros age six to nine months one pink one yellow and a teething ring i picked them up one by one looking for a card but i didnt expect to find one i sat there for a while smiling to myself looking at my daughters presents and wondering what to make of them i wasnt thinking about what i should do next i knew that already i was just thinking eventually i stood up slipped on my red lacoste windcheater and stepped out of the truck this time i locked the door behind me at a leisurely pace i walked across the car park crossed the road at the lights and made my way down past the mosque to the pear tree we were just short of the start of the university year otherwise the old pub would have been heaving with students adding to their loan debts ask yourself as i do often what sort of country is it that doesnt invest in its brightest and best young people it wasnt quiet but there was space at the bar for me to order a pint of eighty how do british publicans get away with their attitudes to their customers virtually everywhere else in the world you pay for what youve had when you leave in britain theyre not far short of seeing your money before you see their watery overpriced product and a spare table in the beer garden for me to sit i sipped my beer and looked around me some of the production team were gathered around a table in the corner of the garden i waved to them but didnt join them instead i popped open my packet of crisps salt and vinegar i cant stand any other kind and gazed back across the square taking time to admire the late victorian grandeur of atkinsons mcewan hall parts of edinburgh are an architectural dream others like the st james shopping centre and office block are a nightmare i sat and i wondered and i waited eventually i found myself pondering upon the wisdom of two pints of eighty before a chinese it was an easy decision to make i was on the point of rising to go back to the bar when as if by magic another was placed on the table beside me thanks i said without looking up or round he set down his lager then settled on the bench facing me there were flecks of grey in his hair which came down almost to his shoulders and in his heavy beard the sun was long gone but he still wore his shades i couldnt see his eyes but i knew that he was staring at me wondering maybe why i hadnt shit myself hello i said evenly then i reached across the table almost lazily and punched him in the mouth a girl at the next table looked across and gasped then looked away again quickly his sunglasses went skewwiff he put them back in place then wiped blood from his lip with the back of his hand what was that for he asked you know fucking well what it was for glasgow not last weekend a while back oh he said i see you found out he took a drink swilled it around in his mouth as if he was washing away more blood and swallowed you were expecting me he asked of course i was expecting you i was meant to fucking stupid email address i thought it was quite clever he said his crest a little fallen it was too clever by half just typical of you mzrimnmeal i mumbled the jumble as if the eighty had got to me already an anagram of zimmerman give me a bit of credit id have got that eventually but to add in the numbers as well i was almost insulted by that zimmerman is dylans real name now i might be fucking famous these days but i cant imagine mystic bob wanting to get in touch with me apart from him and the dead poet i only know of one dylan youre forgetting bob willis youre right im forgetting him who is he the cricketer he took dylan as his middle name big deal anyway even from the anagram id have got the link but you had to put the icing on it by adding the numbers another anagram of the day and month mike dylan was shot in amsterdam how did you know for sure it was me and not someone pretending two reasons the first and most obvious was that you knew my email address the second was the gifts you left for janet an impostor wouldnt have done that he tilted his head back i could just see that behind the shades his eyes were closed how did i know thats what the two of you would call her he murmured because i hissed youre a clever bastard too clever by half remember so fucking clever it got you killed remember youre dead mike i know youre dead because i was there i saw you get shot i saw you die he shook his head you saw me cough up a lot of blood and start to choke then you saw me pass out then they got you the hell out of there what you didnt see was when they whipped me out of there to the emergency room if the man they sent had been trying to kill me hed have blown my brains out he didnt he shot me through the right side of the chest it got a bit hairy because he hit my lung but that served to convince you didnt it they wanted the other guy dead but not me why not you were a rogue policeman and special branch at that surely they wanted you even deader than him no they wanted the names in my head id never been debriefed before i did my runner i knew what the guy they killed knew namely some key links in the chain of drug imports not just to scotland but to the whole of western europe and beyond when i began to recover they gave me a choice who were they our security services the dutch and the american dea heavy hitters all of them they scared the shite out of me i can tell you i gave them the names i had but they said that wasnt enough that the list didnt go far enough they gave me a new identity and they told me to contact some of the guys id been told about to infiltrate the network and to stay in until i had the whole chain and could deliver them i tried to tell them to get fucked they offered to dump me in the north sea so did you do everything they told you he sighed yes two months ago there was an international operation starting in burma and thailand and winding up in london glasgow amsterdam and new york all sorts of people were taken down some of them were taken out completely like me for example im dead again what do you mean i mean they did again what they did in amsterdam but in bangkok this time what they shot you he grinned right in the head but not with a bullet with a special cartridge filled with blood like you guys use in the movies there were witnesses a couple of the middleranking people who were being arrested the idea was that when they got to jail they would spread the word that id been bumped did it work as far as i know but these dealers have tipsters everywhere on the inside i should know i used to be one so who are you now i cant tell you that but youre right i have a third identity now i was set up with that and with a chunk of money the deal was that id go to portugal and never go near the drugs business again as easy as that he gave a grim smile it was less than a couple of years since hed gone tits up at schiphol but his eyes looked twenty years older i wondered what theyd seen since then of course hed been dead twice that must have an effect on a bloke not quite as easy he replied they told me that they know where i am and who i am they may have a use for me in the future so what the fuck are you doing here why havent you got yourself yet another false passport and gone somewhere out of their reach why have you been following susie and me im taking a chance thats what im doing and there is nowhere out of their reach no i was ready to split for portugal when i picked up a scottish paper in london and who did i see on an inside page but you and susie and your new baby you might have been surprised when i turned up think how i felt when i saw that what the hell happened oz what happened to prim i looked at him hard for all his adventures he didnt scare me not a bit it was the other way round and he knew it by coming back hed put his life in my hands you know what the punch in the mouth was for didnt it even occur to you that susie might have spilled the beans about you and her he winced i left a letter behind didnt i i nodded some secret operative you couldnt even cover your tracks with your best pals fiancee im sorry oz it was just one of those things spare me please so was susie and i at first the fact is i didnt know about you and prim till a couple of days ago susie only told me when she showed up at her place her place i thought she bought it from me before we anyway back to your story you saw us and you were gobsmacked yes i bailed out i told my minder i was going and i split he took me to the airport but i lost him went back into london and caught a train to glasgow it took me a while to pin you down but when i did i started to follow you i wanted to see you man to see the two of you to see how you had turned out thats all im sorry if i spooked you lying bastard youre not sorry at all i am if susie got worried honest ill take your word for it so now that youve seen us what do you think he drained his glass and gave me a long look i think youre all right you look like a family you know i really hope you stick it he gave a big sigh you know i always thought that we had the wrong women you and i i always thought that susie was more your type and prim was more mine what do you mean by that i mean that you two are basically straight while she and i are basically bent i laughed that has to be a compliment coming from you he grunted here he said suddenly what are you doing hanging out with my old boss ricky ross he was your mortal enemy for a while aye and you were my best friend touche rickys head of security on the movie i told him thats all mmm you going to get more beer in i raised an eyebrow like hell you are you owe me pal he gave me a grin and disappeared to the bar returning after a couple of minutes with two more so whats next i asked him im going to turn up in portugal as planned ive seen what i came to see and im content i leaned across the table thats good i murmured for you have to know one thing susie is never to learn about this or about you if you ever show up near us again if you ever try to contact her i paused youve changed ive changed if you ever do that then i promise you you will be dead again and it will be for real this time i looked him in the face and gave him time to think about it do you believe me i reckon i do there was always a hard bastard under your surface wasnt there but dont worry im too fond of susie and of you ever to threaten either of you the only thing is he hesitated then took off the shades and stared at me ive got no one oz im cut off from everyone ive ever known in the life i had before all this theyve fucking buried me youve no idea how lonely it is being dead i heard what he was saying loud and clear youve got my email address i told him if the need really arises and it had better be more than going for a pint mind thats how you can reach me use the same stupid name and ill know thanks he drained his lager in a oneer and stood up so long the guy who had once been mike dylan turned on his heel and walked out of the pear tree into whatever kind of a future might await him oq fifty it had been a while since i had drunk eighty at all let alone shifting three pints of the stuff in under an hour so my brain was even fuzzier than it had been after the oxford when i got back to the apartment and pushed the entry button whozzat liam asked through the speaker santa fucking claus you can come in down the chimney then but he pushed the button anyway just as well by that time my bladder was feeling the pressure he gave me an appraising look when i reemerged from the bathroom where the hell have you been then he enquired its a funny thing about mates is it not when you share a flat with them they can be worse than wives in some ways thinking i told him thinking about how fast you can get to the bottom of the glass that among other things come on superstar of wrestling lets go get that chinese we grabbed a cab on the hill outside by chance it was the legendary white taxi the one with the tartanlined interior and jock and roll music playing from the moment you step in until the moment you close the door behind you it is to edinburghers what the great white buffalo is to native americans there is a theory that the driver is long dead and that it is but his shade that cruises the city streets bringing eternal delight to tourists whatever the truth of it he took us straight to the kwei linn the crispy duck was as i remembered it from a few years back and so was the chicken in black bean sauce we walloped them down with a beef dish and a mild prawn curry i stuck to fizzy water okay i admit it we shared a bottle of lambrusco but its much the same and by the time we got to the coffee stage i could see clearly again you back in the land of the fully conscious then liam asked i nodded where did you go tonight he was still doing the pal as old woman routine its instinctive with blokes we cant help it i had to meet someone male or female male someone i hadnt seen in a long time let me guess you found the guy whos been stalking you no i let him find me and and nothing we had a talk and hes gone he frowned oz you didnt hurt him did you i laughed quietly nah all that communing with my peaceful sides done me good i only hit him once and not very hard at that so what did he want he only wanted to say hello he came a long way to do it and had a funny way of working up to it but he got to it eventually you sure thats it absolutely we wont see him again he looked at me for a while then grinned thanks for helping me out this afternoon i was having trouble until you came up with that suggestion you got any more tips for the bedroom scene with the lady detective sergeant yeah all the time as shes getting her togs off keep a picture of tony blair in your mind no way can you think of him and still get a hardon liam laughed out loud a quartet of women whod recognised us when we came in looked back in our direction thats quite an occupational hazard when you think about it in my game you worry about your knees or your back or springing a rib cartilage its odd to think of getting a boner as a workplace accident dont worry about it i said leaning back in my chair so the women across the restaurant could hear like i said theres the stuff they put in your tea as well it hardly has any aftereffects he gasped and held the pose long enough for the girls at the other table to latch on to his surprise a natural actor indeed we got talking to them after that it turned out that they were a hen party from the standard life office in lothian road one of them a pretty brunette called serena was being married on the following saturday funnily enough she was the one who made the biggest eyes at liam so why should women be any different from men a couple of years before hed have been right in there but since he found his air stewardess hes flown straight as an arrow the taxi that picked us up was one of the ordinary black kind or it would have been if it hadnt been painted like a mobile phone it dropped us back at the mound at around eleven thirty theres a pub beside the door to the apartment block we thought about going in but were hit by a double blast of selfdiscipline being due on set at eightthirty next morning plus i reckoned that if i had any more to drink i might start to think of dylan again and i didnt want to do that so instead we went straight up to the penthouse where i got myself a bottle of still water from the fridge and headed straight for bed i was almost ready to crash when my eye was caught by something on the dressing table at first i thought it was a postcard or a piece of junk mail that stuff gets everywhere until i realised it was susies menu the one shed had signed the night before by everyone at the table bar me daft bat i smiled as i picked it up forget your head next i glanced at the signatures on the white card miles grayson clear and confident dawn phillips scrawled and spidery but legible margaret capperauld traditional primaryschool style joinedup writing liam matthews as quirky and flamboyant as the man himself and one other i couldnt read it not a snowballs chance in hell of that it didnt look like a signature at all more like an ecg printout it was more than familiar though it was an exact match of the unidentified scrawl in anna chins notebook and now by a simple process of elimination i knew that it was the autograph of ewan capperauld all of a sudden i wasnt tired any more all of a sudden i didnt care what time it was i grabbed the bedside telephone found ricky rosss home number from his business card and called him oz he moaned he sounded slightly breathless do you know what fucking no but i can guess who this is your lucky bastard calling i need to see you now so come out to my place ive had a drink you come here and bring annas autograph book with you but what about alison i cant leave her bring her theres a fair chance we might need her anyway fiftyone my urgency must have got through to ricky i had expected him to take half an hour to get to me but the entry buzzer sounded in just over fifteen minutes he stepped out of the lift wearing jeans and a heavy sweater and needing a shave alison followed behind dressed almost identically to him she was completely without makeup and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail i led them through to the kitchen liam was asleep directly off the living area and i didnt want to disturb him so why the alarm call said ross tersely as i poured two mugs of coffee from the filter jug susies menu card was lying on the worksurface i picked it up and handed it to him he looked at it then his eye hit on the cardiac squiggle jesus he murmured whose ewan capperauld what the word came out in an astonished halfshout i worried that it might waken liam and signalled him to be quiet but capperaulds never been to the torrent building he said in that case hes the only person in annas book who hasnt thats remarkable isnt it but she told me that was where shed collected all her autographs so he must have been yet james torrent clearly didnt know it he told me so himself almost in so many words it would be good to have someone as eminent as ewan capperauld visit this building thats what he said to me when i saw him in his office i turned to alison did he ever say or imply to you that capperauld had been there no she replied the opposite in fact he told me that he wanted every eminent scot to visit his new headquarters and that ewan was at the top of that list i nodded and yet when i saw him there he wasnt all that bothered something happened between him giving you that instruction and my visiting him to make him change his mind or at least go soft on the idea something said ricky like what like maybe he found out that capperauld had already been to his building its a pity we cant ask him or anna i added but theres someone we can ask who come on waken up ewan himself ross looked at me as if he had a wrestling hold on something in his brain easier said than done capperaulds a big name hes also miles graysons star attraction and miles is my client i cant just go interrogating him okay ill do it call his minder and have him brought here are you crazy talk to him in the morning if you must have you got that much time ricky has alison ill take that chance nice of you to take it for alison he glared at me but said nothing we had been drinking our coffee in silence for almost five minutes when the mobile in rosss pocket sounded he scowled and answered the call i wouldnt have thought his face could have got any grimmer but as he spoke it did youre kidding i heard him snap how would i he flashed gimlet eyes in my direction do your own fucking job son he growled into the phone at last and jabbed the red button to end the call he told me what id guessed already that was ronnie morrow theyve matched some of the prints on the knife he looked at alison hes looking for you love youve just gone top of the list of people he wants to question he said hes been to your flat but youre not there surprise then he tried to say that technically youre still bailed into my custody so i should help him find you you heard what i told him sure i said thatll keep him at bay for a long time and its probably put you second on his list now i dont want to be third so get that bloody phone out again and call ewans minder ricky was well beaten this time he did as he was told it took glen oliver less than a minute to answer quickly his boss gave him his orders what do you tell him ross exclaimed suddenly he looked at me as if for an answer tell him i said that its a very important matter involving his cousins murder and that if he doesnt get here pronto theres every chance itll be all over the redtops by the weekend he repeated what i had said almost word for word after that there was nothing to do but wait i tried to imagine what we were going to say to ewan i could manage that okay but when i tried to guess what he might say to us i came up short the case of the baffled detective it was fifteen minutes short of one when the buzzer sounded again this time it did wake liam he appeared in the bedroom doorway bollocknaked drowsy growling what does an irishman have to do to get some sleep around here then he saw alison who had come out of the kitchen fuck he said we could have pulled in the restaurant why change your mind now at that point he remembered his state of undress and dived back behind the door ewan came storming out of the lift i could see that he was in full skinner mode locked and loaded ready for a fight he blinked when he saw alison but his expression stayed hard i led him through to the kitchen where ricky was waiting and closed the door on oliver leaving him in the living room okay capperauld boomed this had better be the story of a lifetime ross or your security career will be over his anger was so impressive that for that important moment ricky was struck dumb i wasnt though i had seen him act before come here i said beckoning him over to the worksurface and pointing towards what lay on it this is the menu you signed for susie last night so i took the book from my back pocket opening it at the place i had marked and laid it beside the card and this is anna chins autograph book let me tell you about anna she was james torrents front office receptionist and she had a harmless hobby every time a celebrity signed into the building she asked them to sign her autograph book as well nearly all of them did every signature in that book is matched by a signature on the torrent registration sheets every one except yours that is let me tell you two more things about anna maybe theyre new to you maybe theyre not first she was having it away with your late cousin david shes one reason he dumped alison second last friday night someone killed anna in the office at her desk and tried to set it up so that the police would find alison there i looked at ewan thats appalling oz he said but how does it justify you hauling me out of my bed in the middle of the night its just as well margarets gone back to london by the way or there would have been an explosion bigger than you can imagine have you heard any news bulletins today i asked him no should i i reckon so if you had youd have heard that james torrent was stabbed to death in his home overnight the murder weapon was a paperknife which someone stole from alisons office the police are looking for her now and in the morning rickys going to have to take her in hes got no choice or hes in the crapper too when he does hes going to take that card and that book with him hes going to tell the police about james torrent suddenly going all coy about your opening his building when a couple of weeks before only the greatest living scotsman would do torrent thought you had never been in his building yet if you look at the dates of the signatures after yours in annas books it appears that even when he gave alison an ultimatum to get you there you had been we just want to know why ewan thats all then you can get stuffed the anger was gone from his voice though he was playing a scene he hadnt rehearsed fine then well go to the police and they will interview you for sure discreetly i would imagine youll maybe tell them that anna stopped you in the street and theyll leave it at that if youd told me that rather than telling me to get stuffed i might just have believed you myself but you didnt so this is whats going to happen as soon as the police call you in for a chat or even call on you im going to tip off the tabloids all of them that youve been detained for questioning in connection with the murders of your cousin anna chin and james torrent i dont know who or what youre trying to protect here ewan but you are not going to do it at alisons expense or rickys or mine you might think you can keep this under wraps but i promise you you do not have a fucking chance i leaned back on the worksurface and looked at him letting what id said sink in staring hard in the hope that hed know i wasnt bluffing because i wasnt alison and ricky stood there silent beside me the wait seemed as long as any id ever known the seconds seemed to be stretched like thick elastic as they passed he opened his mouth as if to speak and his teeth snapped together but then he closed it again and another elongated minute began looking at him i knew what he was doing the guy was rehearsing mentally the next thing he said was going to be very important so he could not afford to falter over a single line finally he gathered himself and nodded as if he was a director satisfied with his own performance he looked at ricky then at me and finally at alison do you know what sort of a little shit your late fiance was my dear he didnt wait for an answer he was the worst kind i know a blackmailer his delivery and timing were perfect he held her eyes for a few seconds then turned back to me youve had a colourful career with the ladies oz i know that much about you spot on ewan youve got my attention that deals with the why i could guess the who but it wouldnt be right youre on stage youre in the spotlight it all began at a dinner party in edinburgh about six months ago my private investments are handled by one of the oldest partnerships in town they invited me to be their guest one night along with a few other key clients i went alone margaret was detained in london on business as it happened james torrent another of their important investors was out of town that night too he sent his niece natalie in his place of course he did who else in that setup had the class to have pulled capperauld i was fascinated by her youve met her oz you must have when you visited torrent so youll understand when i say that theres more depth to her than any woman ive ever known he smiled summoning up some classic wistfulness it was instant and it was mutual it was faintly ludicrous too here we were surrounded by elderly fund managers people more staid than you could ever imagine with lightning shooting between us you have to understand oz that this was not normal behaviour from me i love my wife and id never been unfaithful to her before although it goes without saying that in our business one has plenty of opportunities too right there mate id have been sorted with at least one of the four in the kwei linn if id fancied it we left there as soon as we could and took a taxi to the balmoral i wasnt staying with my parents on that trip i had a suite there we drank a little champagne talked into the small hours and then went to bed the affair was in earnest from then on thats all it was though a fling for her as well as me we were very discreet we conducted it either in edinburgh at her place or on neutral ground in paris once when i had a premiere in madrid on another occasion when i had a meeting with a producer natalie confided in no one and naturally neither did i he paused i opened the fridge took out a bottle of water and gave it to him thank you he said and took a drink then he continued i made my only mistake we had an assignation in edinburgh one friday evening i flew in on the shuttle and took a cab from the airport i called natalie on my mobile to let her know that id arrived her car was being serviced so she asked me to pick her up from the office it was sixthirty when i arrived anna chin was still there i told her id come for miss morgan and she paged her then she produced her autograph book and i signed it technically of course i was never in the building so i didnt sign anything else he gave a beautifully wry smile how was i to know that the girl the poor sad girl was my cousins lover or that she wouldnt be able to resist telling him who had called for miss morgan and whom she had kissed in the hallway before they left how was i to know then his eyes narrowed and his mouth tightened i found out though as soon as i got back to london i found out david called me on the following sunday evening there was no preamble he told me that he knew and that he wanted money or hed tell margaret he asked for a quarter of a million did you pay him ricky asked ewan looked at him as if he were a heckler he ignored his question altogether no ad libs in this performance i called natalie immediately to warn her her first reaction was to declare that anna was fired i asked her not to do that it could only have raised questions i said that i would pay him what he asked in the hope that it would be his last demand a hope more than an expectation i admit natalie wouldnt hear of it shes a very powerful woman and formidable when shes angered she told me that her uncle had a business relationship with davids firm she said that she would speak to torrent and that he would take care of the matter i trusted her to do that i heard no more from david and then i heard of his death when i did i assumed that alison had indeed killed him i havent heard from natalie since then either when all this blew up we decided that we should cool things for a while at least although really as far as im concerned its all over he sighed heavily loud enough to be heard in the back stalls so thats the story oz i will tell that to the police happily but i will expect from them and from you a little discretion youll take what you fucking get i told him cheerfully so natalie thought that uncle james could lean on david and that would be it but what she didnt know was that he was effectively out of the firm and that torrent had no leverage over him at all so he got really heavy said ricky he took care of the problem in the oldfashioned way but who he sighed ah fuck who cares with luck natalie morgan will back up mr capperaulds story and alisonll be off the hook maybe she can tell the police who did the dirty work for her uncle and will she tell them why he was killed do you think he looked at me so did ewan so did alison well i demanded so torrent has criminal connections and he puts a contract out on the two of them the business gets done and he pays the money so who killed him and why did he welsh on payment unlikely said ricky people like that want paid in advance okay why knock him off also if it was a straightforward contract job why go to all that trouble to frame alison come on man whats wrong with this picture yes he nodded i take your point so what are you thinking im thinking that the person torrent told to take care of the problem was someone he knew lets suppose that after the second killing torrent panicked he became a threat to the killer himself so he had to go so who was that close to torrent natalie no if she was going to do them both herself why tell her uncle at all maybe he found out no ewan shouted at last there was some spontaneity in his performance natalie did not do those things how do you know i asked him could susie do such a thing he asked no i answered how do you know he had me i just do thats all very well trust me on this in the same way it wasnt her in that case ricky murmured who theres only one person left to ask i told him natalie and then i paused theres only one person left who knows about this or so the killer thinks oh jesus ewan moaned do you have her phone number no i had but i tore it up when i stopped seeing her i have said alison she picked up the shoulder bag that she had dropped on the kitchen floor and dug out a personal organiser she flicked through it stopped then read out natalie morgan home i put the kitchen phone on to speaker mode and dialled carefully the number didnt ring out at all instead it went straight on to the answering service natalie had a personalised message hi this is nat her chocolate voice announced to all of us in the kitchen im either out on the bog or on the phone please leave a message i pointed at ewan he nodded and moved closer to the phone natalie he said its me i need to speak to you urgently please call my mobile i clicked the line shut the answer phone picked up right away alison pointed out that means shes either on another call i gave her both raised eyebrows or the phones off the hook where does she live asked ricky ravelston ewan answered near mary erskines school in a flat its a top floor like this but i cant remember the number i never even knew it i never wrote to her or even noticed it on the door when i was there the police will know the first thing the police will do ross barked is come here and arrest us come on youre taking us there make sure your mobiles on just in case natalie calls back fiftytwo four of us headed for the door ewan ricky glen oliver and me okay i could have stayed behind but no way was i going to not after everything you cant leave me here alison wailed too right we can i told her if you get frightened get in beside liam the lift was getting close when a thought came to me from nowhere hold on a minute i said and went back inside alison i asked her those calls you had the one that got you out the night david was killed and the one that took you to the torrent building last friday can you remember anything about the caller no the voice was indistinct both times i had trouble hearing what was being said it was a man though i cant even tell you that for certain okay i headed back to the other three ewan was holding the door the script was done we were on to the impromptu stuff now and he had stage fright bad glen drove us out of the city centre and towards ravelston dykes it was dry but cloudy there was no moon to compete with the orange glow from the street lights ewan gave directions from the front passenger street eventually he called for a right turn the lighting was less bright off the main road but still we could see in front of us the dim outline of a block of flats thats it ahead the actor whispered though i couldnt think why he did maybe he didnt want the audience to hear i know that building ricky exclaimed its got good security i know that because we renewed it two years ago and we look after it on a contract every flats alarmed and there are video cameras on all floors my buildings supposed to have good security too i grumbled only it doesnt should i call her again ewan asked i nodded and handed him the number id noted it on a piece of kitchen roll i watched as he waited answering service again he announced at last but the phone seems to be back on the hook maybe shes asleep he added hopefully sure ricky grunted oliver drew the car up a hundred yards away from the block i tapped ricky on the shoulder and motioned him to get out and follow me he looked puzzled a little annoyed even but he did it i had a good reason i didnt want glen to hear what i was going to say i want to ask you something i told him in a whisper not unlike ewans stage version suppose you were torrent and you had a problem that you wanted to go away weve already considered underworld contacts so who else would you ask my lawyer i suppose not that sort of problem you cant interdict a blackmailer for christs sake okay so who then how about your security officer he gaped at me and his eyes widened hey wait a minute he never said a word to me no but do you handle all your accounts in person dont you ever delegate of course every client has someone in charge so who ran torrent he sucked in a long breath it sounded like a moan of foreboding mandy ofarrell but tell me honestly have you ever suspected that mandy might have given torrent a bit of extra service not that way shes protective of her clients but thats all how protective aw come on oz ricky protested yes come on suppose torrent told mandy about the problem and told her no more than that he wanted it to go away suppose she took it to extremes capperauld dies and alisons arrested fine but then annas murdered right in his office he knows the connection and so does natalie but it cant be her because theyre off to gleneagles when it happens no one else knows though other than mandy he shook his head in firm denial no what was the first thing torrent did after annas death he tried to distance himself from your firm thats what he fired you to put space between him and mandy that scared her she saw herself being dropped in it where was she last night when torrent was killed in glasgow minding susie no she fucking wasnt susie was with me getting ewans autograph on her menu mandy was off watch in edinburgh ross looked up at the penthouse okay so where is she now theres one good way to find out i took out my phone and keyed in susies mobile number it took her a few seconds to answer when she did she was pissed off sorry love i said but its important is mandy with you what are you talking about she asked me wearily you know shes not shes gone back to edinburgh she told me that theyd found the stalker you mean they havent she sighed with exasperation ah who cares good night the phone went silent so mandy said theyd found the stalker where did she hear that i wondered only three of us knew about that i hadnt told her liam hadnt and i was damn sure mike dylan hadnt either i looked back at ross we may have a problem he nodded towards the building youre wrong he said but best get up there fiftythree ewan wanted to come with us but that idea got short shrift he was emotionally involved up there also given the outside chance that things might get a bit physical he was too valuable for us to run the risk of him getting hurt there was a third consideration what we were about to do was probably illegal i was pushing my own luck and as miless friend i just couldnt let his star be part of it ricky wasnt even keen on letting me go with him and glen but i squashed that notion you need me up there pal i told him im your independent witness im not an employee of ross security ewan still couldnt recall the number of natalies apartment but when we got to the door that turned out not to be a problem her name was on a label next to the top buzzer number a ricky pressed it there was no sound we should have heard that feed back from the other end he said thats funny no its bloody not how do we get in with difficulty if no one will open up for us of course if id known we were coming here i could have brought a pass key it had been a bad news day all round so i tried one more which of your operatives is responsible for this i asked him glen oliver was on his other side i spoke quietly hoping that he didnt hear i could see his face fall mandy ofarrell he whispered terrific now tell me this suppose we get the hubcap lever from glens car and use it to jimmy the lock on the door what happens an alarm goes off i stood back and looked at the entrance there was a single door halfglazed with glass panels on either side suppose we break one of those panels are they alarmed no but the glass is toughened so am i i looked around the communal gardens around the block had a rockery in one corner i walked across and looked at the big stones embedded in the ground i tried one it was set firm but eventually i managed to work it loose it was heavy but after all the gym work id been doing it was no problem i carried it across to the doorway give me your jacket glen i said he was wearing a big black leather jerkin he nodded and slipped it off i laid it on the ground put the stone on top and zipped it up around it then i took the arms tied them together and picked it up i swung it experimentally a few times the boulder stayed in place i had myself a club the glass panel wasnt just strong it was laminated two toughened layers with a clear plastic lining between them i hit the panel three heavy swinging blows each one made a thumping noise but there as no smashing of glass after the third whack the panel was hanging loosely it was opaque now with shattered crystals clinging to the lining and there was no way i was going to be able to club through that glen oliver may be a man of few indeed of no words but he can rise to the occasion he reached into his trouser pocket and produced the biggest swiss army knife i have ever seen more like a swiss army bayonet in fact and handed it to me i folded out the main blade which was so sharp i could have shaved with it and sliced through the laminate side to side top to bottom i had been working as quickly as i could and as quietly in the circumstances in the hope that there were no insomniacs in the flats above us it seemed as we stepped inside through our newly made door that wed got lucky lets walk up said ricky dont be daft i told him whats wrong with the lift you might hear the mechanism from the penthouse in that case we run up i led the way towards the stairway there were ten storeys in the block ground one to nine and then the top floor ricky was breathing hard when we got to the top but glen and i still had our wind left there were two apartments on the penthouse floor one on either side of the stairway door number a was on the right ricky moved towards it but i signalled him to stop i unholstered my cellphone and dialled natalies number yet again we could hear it ring inside eight times until the message clicked in i hit the red button but it played itself out maybe shes a really deep sleeper ross muttered maybe she is on the bog maybe she should try immodium i suggested i looked at him in the green landing light are we going in or what he nodded glen he said your moment has come try ringing the bell just once i suggested whats another fucking door glen ewans minder stepped forward raised his right leg and opened natalie morgans apartment with a single kick the night breeze met us as we stepped inside i looked across the openplan living room and saw wide glass doors leading to a westfacing terrace they were open there was something piled on the tiled floor outside but i couldnt make out what it was the flat was absolutely silent we stood there unwilling to switch on a light looking around us for the prospective horrors that had drawn us there and then in a door to the left a figure appeared all we could see was a silhouette around medium height slim wearing a onepiece headtofoot garment strikingly similar to that i had seen worn by the sas extras in the mcewan hall id seen mandy in the dark before naked or clothed like this the shape was the same a whisper came from ricky glen the minder and the black figure moved towards each other he carried himself loosely a bit like a wrestler looking to restrain then detain he never had a chance the figure seemed to leap straight off the ground then hit him with a leftfooted jab to the midriff and a rightfooted kick behind the ear oliver moaned quietly and sagged to the floor like a sack of potatoes ross started to moved forward but i held him back you block the door i told him theres a fire extinguisher on the landing outside if this character gets past me put it to good use the figure stood there waiting for another of us to have a go i obliged by inching forward in the dim light i could see teeth gleaming in the centre of the tunics black balaclavatype helmet i edged sideways round olivers motionless form until i bumped into a woodenframed swivel chair positioned in the middle of the room okay mandy i said quietly round two i feinted a move with my left foot she bought it and launched into a spinning rightfooted counterkick i ducked under it and as i did grabbed the chair onehanded and threw it at her its wooden edge caught her flush on the kneecap she almost fell but recovered her balance too late though i had closed in by then i whipped the feet from under her with the russian leg sweep that liam had taught me and followed up as she went down driving my knee hard into the midsection of the black tunic it was all over then but i had seen and experienced enough to take no chances so i hit her once hard with my right fist in the middle of the forehead i could see her eyes now they glazed over as she went out cold find a light ricky i shouted as i pushed myself up from the motionless figure and headed for the door through which she had come i fumbled for a switch on the inside of the door but found none then for the first time i became aware of a soft splashing sound it was a bathroom i found the switch on the outside and flicked it on i didnt see natalie morgan at first but i heard her quickly enough he bath was a big old victorian thing big enough to accommodate a fiveaside football team she was in it on her own the tub was full almost to overflow point natalie was beneath the surface a big strip of gaffer tape had been slapped over her mouth her arms were bent behind her and her legs were doubled beneath her her wrists were lashed tight to her ankles and lying on her back as she was she was helpless she was also on the point of drowning she was moving but only slightly and i couldnt see any bubbles coming up i plunged my arms into the bath the water was no more than tepid and lifted her out then laid her on her side in the middle of the floor she had been tied with a satin cord which might have been the sash of a dressing gown whatever it was it was sodden and the knot would not budge luckly i still had olivers big clasp knife in my pocket i produced it and cut her free then i ripped the tape from her mouth she had stopped moving altogether and her lips had a bluish tinge to them i rolled her on to her back and was about to begin mouth to mouth when she coughed and spluttered quickly i turned her over and jumped clear as she vomited all over the tiled floor as i did i saw an empty vodka bottle and a glass on the floor by the bath do we need a medic ricky was in the doorway ill tell you in a minute i replied hows glen he thinks its christmas i told him that if it is the fairy on top of the tree just kicked the shit out of him hes okay though and how about mandy he surprised me he laughed come and see he said we left the naked natalie to puke in private and i followed him into the living room it was lit by a fancy modern fivebulb halogen arrangement the figure on the floor was still out although as i looked down her right leg twitched involuntarily as if she was dreaming about kicking some bloke in the head ricky had ripped off her helmet i looked down and whistled as i realised why he had been laughing i think wed better get ewan up here i told him mrs capperaulds got some explaining to do fiftyfour we paid margaret capperauld plenty of respect when she came round a couple of minutes later she was tied into the swivel chair with the same cord she had used to bind her wouldbe victim natalie herself was sitting on the couch wrapped in a to welling robe shivering with a mixture of cold fright and alcohol she must have drunk all that vodka she was completely pissed ricky had vetoed the idea of ewan coming up correctly when i thought about it hed have wigged out instead he had sent glen oliver down to sit with him in the car and to call ronnie morrows home number and dig him out of bed there would be credit going he had pointed out and he wanted his protege to get it it took another minute or so but eventually margarets eyes were fully focused when she realised where she was she strained against her binding for a moment then gave up olympic gymnast eh i murmured and them some and freestyle climber she replied and martial arts student and vengeful wife i suggested she glared at me i had already worked out the climbing part on the terrace outside id found a coil of rope and a heavy hard rubber grappling hook shed got up to natalies penthouse by scaling the whole damn block floor by floor taking the stairway balconies one by one david spilled the beans didnt he she looked at me again as archly as her husband might have then she winced in pain from the big lump that had sprouted about an inch above her nose what did you hit me with i held up my right fist thats no way to treat a lady she murmured then she nodded yes he did he came to see me in london and told me the whole story he said that he had asked ewan for money to forget about his adventure with natalie and that all he had got was a threatening phone call from her uncle he told me that he guessed i would do anything to protect ewans reputation and his career so he proposed that i pay the money instead and did you confront ewan absolutely not she snapped i love him he can have all the bimbos he wants not that he has before to my knowledge and ill overlook them as long as he comes back to me no i confronted this bitch here first i told her that if she ever looked at my husband again i would kill her and then i told her that i would take care of the problem myself she frowned it made her wince again david was right you see i would go to any lengths to protect ewan so when you went to see him that wednesday he thought you were going to pay him off margaret gave a cold smile that he did and that i did but why implicate alison i needed someone to take the blame quickly to avoid any chance of the police looking in our direction she was the obvious person and anyway i was sure i still am sure that she was in on the blackmail attempt i waved a finger at her no she was not but well let that pass okay so you killed david then natalie here on the couch the drunk rolled her eyes at the mention of her name let you into the office so you could kill anna chin and have alison caught redhanded as it were only the last part didnt quite work thanks to a random accident but why torrent why kill him margaret hesitated i dont think im going to say any more you might as well none of its admissible in court she thought about it i suppose youre right okay torrent was smart you see he twigged at once after he heard of annas death that something was up he asked natalie what she knew and the stupid woman caved in and told him so he had to go too simple as that i had already stolen the knife from the goodchild womans office i had intended to use it to kill the girl only it wasnt necessary so when we were all at miless dinner party i slipped a groundup mogadon into my husbands last brandy then once he was sound asleep crept out and took care of the problem and that left only natalie knowing what had happened exactly and she overcome with grief at her beloved uncles death horses a bottle of stolychnaya in the bath flakes out and drowns exactly which is where we came in i smiled at her would you like something for that headache margaret i asked ill get over it ive had worse no you havent lady its going to get really bad when the police get here why whats my problem i was visiting my friend natalie when you people broke in and assaulted me what you were visiting her dressed like the milk tray woman i have an exotic taste in nightwear the police will assume were lezzies and we wont deny it she had a point there natalies too drunk to be interviewed just now but when she sobers up shell confirm it all she doesnt have any choice shes in it up to her neck indeed i exclaimed im impressed you really do think on your feet or on your arse in this case dont you mrs capperauld theres only one small problem about that no sorry one big one for the first time she looked slightly uncertain whats that she challenged bras sing it out my pal mr ross here nothing is safe from him hes the worst eavesdropper in edinburgh do you know he even has his own house bugged hes so bad that he carries a bloody pocket recorder with him everywhere he goes isnt that right ricky he stepped round from behind her and waved a small device in the air minidisc he said broadcast quality its the same kind radio reporters often use would you like to hear he reviewed the recording listening through an earpiece made an adjustment then paused and pressed a button i had already stolen the knife from the goodchild womans office i had intended to use it to kill the girl only it wasn t necessary so when we were all at miles s dinner party i slipped a groundup mogadon into my husbands last brandy then once he was sound asleep crept out and took care of the problem margaret capperauld went dead white as she listened to the sound of her own confession through the tiny but effective speaker but that wont be allowed in court she snarled when ricky switched off the recorder dont wager your life on it i told her for youd lose but of course youve placed your bet already havent you fiftyfive as soon as greg oliver saw ronnie morrows car arrive as per orders from ricky he got ewan to hell out of there no way did we want him to be around when his wife and his mistress were huck led into a police car we went with them of course not as suspects but as witnesses it was almost eight by the time we finished making our formal statements ricky did a deal with morrow for alison to come in later that day so that the charges against her could be formally binned the young sergeant gave us a lift back to the mound after that and after i had called miles and advised him to stand down the extras for another day at least suggesting that he shoot liams bedroom scene instead ricky came up to the apartment with me but only to collect alison break the good news to her and take her home for what he hoped would be a bit of a celebration tough luck richard but i can go back to my own place now cant i she said i dont need minding any more do i the way she chopped him off was pretty brutal i could see why she had such a bright future in the pr business just before nine they left me on my own almost i was just beginning to think about a long sleep when liam appeared from my bedroom he looked at me in a way i could only describe as shifty all right then he asked it is now what about you you dont look so good rough night mmm the thing is i dont know if i should tell you this fuck i dont know if i believe it i was lying there trying to sleep and then i hear you lot leave thank christ i thinks to myself then five minutes later this alison woman comes into my room and gets into bed beside me i thinks about it give her that but then i says no thank you very much gets up and goes across to your room the light bulbs jiggered but i thinks so what and goes into the toilet to bleed the lizard then when i came out whizz bang im up in the air and on my arse and theres a bloody great naked woman lying on top of me i kept my face straight so what did you do about that what the hell could i do i tell you oz theres no bloody security in this building none at all fiftysix the capperauld scandal hit the fan twentyfour hours later when margaret was charged with the murders of david anna and uncle james natalie was released the crown office was going to need her as a prosecution witness ewan was devastated he really had known nothing about it and like the rest of us suspected nothing with miless agreement he withdrew from the project and the boss himself took over the part of skinner okay hes a bit short for it but he has the charisma to carry anything off we finished the production on time an achievement considering everything that had happened liam and i were even able to sleep easy in our beds once ricky had obliged us by sending mandy ofarrell on a temporary assignment as security chief on an oil terminal in the orkney islands we had a big closedown party of course everyone was there even nula liams air stewardess who fixed her schedule to accommodate it prim was not she paid me one brief visit in edinburgh to tell me to my great relief and to confound susies suspicions that shed put her signature alongside mine on the divorce petition and had it lodged with the court she surprised me then by telling me that shed taken my advice and decided to go back to basics she had signed a sixmonth contract as a senior staff nurse in ninewells hospital in dundee and she was planning to move back into semple house in auchterarder beside her parents to draw breath and do some serious thinking about what she wanted to do with the rest of her life she told me that although wed been rotten at marriage wed been good at being friends and hoped that would still be the case i told her that as far as i was concerned it would her new spirit of openness didnt extend to owning up to having it off with mike dylan but i let that go that and he were both history i was happy at closing off that chapter but it didnt mean that there was nothing but roses in my garden i had some serious thinking of my own to do i was due in vancouver in less than a month and the central question of my life was still unresolved i was pondering hard in my last few days in the apartment about what it really meant to be my own man when it came to it there was only one place i could find an answer to that so i went back to life back to enster to see my dad i told him what was at the core of it all i reckoned that i loved susie as much as i could ever love another woman and that wee janet was all my christmases come at once but i was scared i said plain scared about taking a chance on marriage again even if my heart told me to do it my head asked whether i could ever give up even a part of my independence mac the dentist thought about this for a while and then he pronounced son he said im a fucking backwoodsman as you well know i have a backwoodsmans simple attitudes to life and his simple beliefs and the way i see it is this when you and the right woman have kids youre not your own man any more youre theirs and youre each others and thats how it should be you dont actually have this independence that you talk about not any more janet will be dependent on you for the next twenty years and more and susie is now too as you are on her whether you live together as a couple or not you have a duty to bring that baby up together unless death takes one of you out of the equation so no you are not independent either of you you ceased to be so the moment you made that child what you are talking about is freedom its being the centre of your own universe giving yourself the licence to do what you like say what you like go where you like fuck who you like without a thought to the consequences for anyone but yourself maybe youve done that for long enough oz if you want to continue down that road now that youre rich and famous the opportunities to indulge yourself in such pleasures will be endless but compared to the love that flows into you from your children when you come home at night and sit them in your lap the rewards of such a life are ashes just ashes what youre afraid of son is of finding out about yourself youre asking yourself and now me whether if you choose family life youll be able to stay the course im not a fucking fortune teller some do some dont in my judgement id say that you and susie will make a go of it still as you and i both know nothing in life is certain but death and taxes and a skilled accountant can avoid a good chunk of the latter the last couple of years have made you a fatalist oz theyve developed a side in you that was latent but lurking before things went sour on you and along the way youve lost your belief in your own inherent goodness well i havent trust me if you dont trust yourself and do what i would do if i was standing in your shoes right now i looked into my dads coal fire and for some reason i thought of wee anna chin and her bowl of cherries maybe it is i thought maybe life is just that i leaned over my father as he sat in his big comfy chair and for the first time in around twentyfive years i kissed him on the cheek then i climbed into my nice shiny mercedes and headed off to glasgow to find out for myself whether indeed it is after an eventful career as a spin doctor to the powerful rich and notorious quintin jardine found that his talents were equally
