chapter one manhattan memories it was early evening in new york city people were going to the theatre they hurried past the bright lights of times square to broadway peter parker smiled to himself as he walked through the crowds he was going to the theatre that evening too suddenly a group of little boys ran in front of him they stopped and looked up at one of the signs it said in lights new york loves spiderman for the first time in his life peter felt popular well at least spiderman was popular all the kids in the city wanted to be like spiderman after all he was a hero the people of new york were safe when he was around uncle ben would be so proud of him peters heart ached when he thought of his uncle uncle ben was murdered two years ago but for peter the memory was still very fresh peter remembered the words uncle ben used to say with great power comes great responsibility peter had accepted his responsibility as spiderman and he felt good about that peter parkers life was so much better these days he still didnt make much money as a photographer for the daily bugle and he still lived in the same horrible little room but some things had changed as well as fighting crime he was going to the university every day and he was now the best student in his class but best of all peter had mary jane watson he had always loved mary jane or mj as everyone called her and tonight was her opening night on broadway in manhattan memories as peter stood outside the theatre he couldnt believe his luck he finally had the girl he went inside he was so proud that his girlfriend was the star of the show yes everything was perfect or almost perfect the only thing missing was harry osborn harry and peter had been best friends since high school but everything changed when harrys father went crazy and became the green goblin the green goblin had attacked new york and died in a fight with spiderman then harry found out that peter was spiderman he couldnt forgive him for killing his father as peter found his seat in the dark theatre the musicians started to play and then mary jane appeared peter was so excited she looked amazing when she started to sing he felt she was singing just for him peter had never been so happy harry was there too he watched peter from his private box at the side of the theatre he wasnt smiling she was great thought peter after the show maybe other people hadnt cheered as loudly as him and maybe peter was the only one standing up and cheering at the end no that didnt matter she was great suddenly peter saw a face he knew outside the theatre it was harry osborn peter had tried several times to visit harry at the offices of oscorp harry had refused to see him each time peter wanted to tell harry that norman osborns death was an accident harry peter called as his friend got into a big expensive car harry wait you need to hear the truth harry turned to look at peter for a moment his heart told him he should listen to peter this time but a second later the face of norman osborn seemed to appear at the window dont be weak norman cried to his son harry made a sign to his driver without a word they drove away was i good asked mary jane as she put her arms around peter later that evening good peter smiled you were great mary jane went a little pink then she took peters hand and led him into her dressing room i got your flowers she said warmly thank you theyre beautiful then she pointed at a much bigger arrangement of flowers and these are from harry she said was he here tonight peter shook his head sadly i saw him but he wouldnt talk to me im so sorry said mj softly what is it with you guys its difficult said peter although mary jane knew that peter was spiderman she didnt know exactly how norman osborn had died the wind blew through mary janes long red hair as they rode out of manhattan on peters motorbike it was wonderful to get out of the city for a little while soon they found a good place to stop peter made a big web between two trees they lay together in the web and looked up at the stars high above them a shower of meteorites lit up the dark sky it was a beautiful sight tell me you love me said mj looking into peters eyes i like to hear it it makes me feel safe i will always love you said peter i always have not far away from them a small black rock hit the ground but they didnt notice the rock was a meteorite it was still hot after crashing down to earth smoke rose from the rock and then something black and sticky came out of it something alive it started to move across the grass like a spider it jumped onto the back of peters motorbike it hid there and waited chapter two the goblin returns flint marko ran through the streets wearing his prison clothes he knew the police were searching for him after his escape he had to move quickly he started to climb up the side of a building through a window he saw a young girl asleep he opened the window softly and climbed into her room he took some letters from his pocket and put them very carefully next to the girl flint wrote these letters to her when he was in prison the girl was his daughter penny but she hadnt received them his wife emma had returned them all to him silently flint went into his old bedroom and changed his clothes he felt hungry and found some bread in the kitchen a moment later emma appeared get out of here she shouted youre a bad man marko they both knew that penny was sick very sick neither of them had enough money to pay her hospital bills they didnt have much money before flint went to prison they had even less now suddenly penny appeared and looked at her father with big eyes she gave him her locket he looked down at the silver heart in his hand even though he did bad things penny still loved her father get out his wife shouted youre as useless as a grain of sand im not a bad person i just had bad luck he said i want to help you penny thats the truth then he turned and jumped out of the window there was a knock on aunt mays front door she answered it and found peter standing there his eyes were shining and he had a big smile on his face im going to ask mary jane to marry me he said aunt may was excited and surprised she wasnt expecting this lets have a cup of tea she said they sat down together in the kitchen aunt may remembered when uncle ben asked her to marry him we were both frightened and excited and very young she said and you said yes said peter right no she said slowly i wasnt ready love isnt enough peter theres more to think about you need a fulltime job aunt may was right if they wanted to start a family he would need to earn more money he could hardly pay for his room a ring for mary jane was impossible aunt may knew what peter was thinking she took off her diamond ring and put it in his hand think about how youre going to ask her peter she said make it special peter smiled he had thought about that a lot he knew just what he wanted to say all he needed now was a better job the daily bugle was looking for a fulltime photographer he was the only person who took photos of spiderman will they give me the job he wondered in a secret room in harry osborns house harry stood behind glass walls a special gas started to fill the air around him harry breathed in the gas through his mouth and his nose then he opened the glass doors and stepped out he felt like a new man he was stronger faster and more powerful he became the new goblin now ill be able to attack spiderman he thought ill get revenge for my fathers death my father will be proud of me peter waited nervously to speak to jonah jameson or jj as everyone called him the boss at the daily bugle he could hear him shouting in his office he was often angry these days because sales were bad people werent buying enough copies of the newspaper there werent many crimes or exciting stories in new york city these days and it was all spidermans fault just then another photographer eddie brock went into jjs office suddenly peter realised that eddie probably wanted the fulltime job too peter heard eddie ask for more money jj hated talking about money when it was finally peters turn to speak to jj he went crazy youre not the only photographer in town he shouted peter hurried out of jjs office ill just have to try again later he thought peter was riding his motorbike through the streets suddenly something crashed into him it was the goblin they both shot high into the sky on the goblins skystick but it cant be the goblin thought peter he knew the green goblin was dead the new goblin held onto peter tightly he pulled back peters head to show his throat knives shot out from the new goblins armour now i will get my revenge thought the goblin peter pulled away from the goblin and fired a web at him the new goblin cut through the web but peter managed to hold onto the side of a building he looked down and saw the new goblin on the skystick the new goblin pulled off his mask peter couldnt believe what he saw harry peter said amazed yes peter harry replied you knew this was coming i didnt kill your father peter cried shut up harry shouted as he fired a bomb at peter boom peter jumped quickly out of the way then he moved like a spider from building to building he looked behind him the new goblin was getting closer he fired a line of webbing between two buildings harry hit the webbing at full speed he fell screaming from the skystick into the street below harry was very badly hurt and peter hurried to his side he lifted harry and carried him in his arms to hospital chapter three sandman flint marko ran through some fields outside the city of new york the police were close behind him now he looked back and almost crashed into a wall he didnt see the sign that read danger scientific testing keep out he climbed over the wall and fell into a huge bowl of sand he lay there waiting he looked at the locket his daughter had given him his heart ached for her he had to try to escape very slowly he got up he looked around him and saw some strange guns pointing at him suddenly with a terrible noise the guns fired at flint he screamed in pain as hot grains of sand hit his body the grains burned whitehot and then flints whole body was turned to sand he tried to stand up and walk he looked down at his body and almost cried look what they did to me im not a man any more im sandman he thought then he saw something in the sand it was pennys locket i must get it he thought slowly he managed to stand up and put one foot in front of the other he reached down and picked up the locket it doesnt matter that im made of sand he said to himself im going to save my little girl nothing can stop me now the next morning there was a knock on peters door it was mary jane she held up a newspaper peter looked at the front page but it wasnt about spiderman why are you showing me this he asked read the review said mary jane they hated me peter couldnt believe it but you were great he said mary jane turned to the reviews page and started to read young miss watson is a pretty girl easy on the eyes but not on the ears spiderman is attacked all the time in the papers said peter this isnt about you mary jane shouted try to understand how i feel but at that moment there was an urgent report on peters police radio a crane was about to crash into a building people were in danger they needed spiderman peter looked at mary jane she seemed so sad she needed him but peter didnt really have a choice he had to go he just hoped that mary jane could understand gwen stacy stood in front of the camera and tried to smile she was a university student but she sometimes worked as a model to pay the bills it was a very boring job today for office copiers why do they even need people in these photos gwen wondered but the photographer wasnt looking at gwen he was looking through the window behind her a huge crane had suddenly appeared right in the middle of his photograph whats that thing doing in my background he said it started to move closer a long heavy piece of metal was hanging from the crane and now it was swinging dangerously close to them get down gwen shouted as the metal crashed through the window glass flew around them then the crane crashed into the building gwen screamed as the floor dropped away she just managed to hold on and swung high above the ground but then she couldnt hold on any longer she screamed and fell right into the arms of spiderman she held onto him tightly boy am i happy to see you she thought down in the street below eddie brock was taking photos of spiderman rescuing the girl my god eddie said to himself thats gwen thats my girl brock continued taking pictures as spiderman put gwen safely on the ground beautiful eddie said wait till you see the pictures gwen er are you ok gwen managed a weak smile im fine eddie she didnt think of eddie as her boyfriend they had only been on one date but eddie felt differently it made gwen uncomfortable eddie introduced himself to spiderman im new he explained im taking pictures of you for the daily bugle from now on later that day eddie took his photo of spiderman and gwen to jonah jameson at the daily bugle jj loved it he was about to pay eddie when peter hurried into the office with his own photo of spiderman both shots were good but jj decided that eddies was better perhaps brocks photo was better this time but peter really wanted that fulltime job he had earned it he needed it so he could marry mj the problem was that eddie wanted it too jonah jameson didnt care who got the job he only cared about selling newspapers he told them i want a photo of spiderman doing something criminal then people will see that he really is a fake the guy who brings me that photo gets the job chapter four lost memories peter held the door open harry came slowly into the hall of his amazing home he looked around as if he was a stranger he couldnt remember much about anything thank god youre all right sir said bernard when he saw harry bernard had worked for the osborn family for many years harry remembered bernard but he didnt remember that he harry was the new goblin or that his best friend peter was spiderman peter was so happy to have his old friend back he had brought him a present its your old basketball said harry thanks harry threw the ball a couple of times against the floor then shot the ball at peter it looks like money isnt a problem harry said looking around the place peter laughed as he caught the ball harry youre super rich slowly harry walked towards a painting of his father norman osborn i cant remember much about him id really like to know more he loved you thats the most important thing peter replied feeling uneasy he threw the ball back to harry but he threw it too hard harry moved with amazing speed he caught the ball before it broke anything expensive harry looked at peter with surprise on his face did you see that asked harry peter tried to act cool you were always a fast mover he said and smiled dont let one bad review stop you mary jane told herself as she walked to work the next day she tried to walk proudly into the theatre she pushed open the heavy door and was surprised to hear someone singing her song suddenly the music stopped and everyone turned to look at mj for a moment nobody spoke the director turned to his assistant didnt anybody call her he whispered mjs heart stopped you dropped me after one bad review she said the producer stepped forward and said coldly all the reviews were bad mary jane could hardly breathe fighting back the tears she turned and ran out of the theatre it was a very special day for peter the city of new york was giving spiderman the key to the city peter thought about all the bad stories the daily bugle had printed about spiderman for a long time the people of new york thought spiderman was a criminal but over the years he had saved many lives and now everyone knew he was a hero everyone except jonah jameson a big crowd of people had come to see spiderman peter looked at all the excited faces just then peter saw mary jane he pushed through the crowd to reach her he smiled at her excitedly he didnt ask why she wasnt at the theatre mj really wanted to tell him but this was his moment im proud of you she said peter pointed to a tall building at the corner of the square im going to swing in from there give them a good show mary jane replied you too peter said with a smile and dont worry about that review well laugh about it tomorrow flint marko was back in manhattan he was walking down a street when some police officers saw him he hid behind a truck the officers ran to the truck but marko had disappeared they looked under the truck but he wasnt there then one of them climbed onto the back and pulled off the cover all he found was sand suddenly a sandy hand shot out and threw the officer into the air sandman rose out of the back of the truck the other officers started to shoot at him they made holes in his body and grains of sand flew from the holes but the gunshots didnt stop him and then with a terrible cry sandman flew down the street like an angry sandstorm chapter five the key and the kiss the huge crowd of people were shouting and cheering for spiderman suddenly someone called to mary jane hi mj she turned around and saw harry osborn she had visited him in the hospital and he looked so much better now wheres pete harry asked as he looked around taking photos i guess she said in the past only two people knew peter was spiderman mary jane and harry but now only mj knew peters secret and she wanted to keep it harry asked why she wasnt at the theatre she looked into his smiling face at last someone had time to listen to her she told him everything he said he was really sorry you look so good harry mj said after a moment harry smiled a knock on the head and youre as free as bird mj replied knock me on the head then please they laughed together for the first time that day she stopped thinking about her problems harry was just what she needed gwen stacy looked out nervously at the huge crowd in the square she had never spoken in front of so many people before she was nervous too because spiderman was out there she stepped up to the microphone and started to speak she told the crowd about spiderman and how he saved her life everyone cheered loudly a band started to play and suddenly there he was spiderman swung over the crowd the crowd went crazy slowly upsidedown spiderman lowered himself to face gwen she reached out and pulled down his mask to show his mouth gwen gave spiderman the key and then kissed him it was a long slow kiss i just want to thank you for saving me said gwen the crowd went wild but one person in the crowd wasnt cheering mary jane her first kiss with spiderman was exactly like this her eyes filled with tears and all the horrible feelings returned not even harry could help her now a huge sandstorm was blowing through the streets it was heading for the square suddenly it blew through the crowd everyone ran to escape the angry winds the cloud of sand raced round a corner and then disappeared peters spider sense woke up a moment later the sandstorm shot down from the sky whooosh it blew an armoured truck round and round like a leaf in the wind the truck was taking lots of money and gold to a bank then the storm winds tore the top off the vehicle sandman had arrived the guard in the front of the truck turned and shot sandman in the face sandman cried out in pain and then disappeared but a moment later he rose up from the back of the truck and crashed down on the driver and the guard under the weight of the sand the two men could hardly breathe the drivers foot pressed down hard and the vehicle shot down the street at high speed spiderman landed silently in the back of the truck he stood next to sandman who was normal size now he looked more like the old flint marko spiderman looked him in the eyes but marko wasnt afraid marko knew he had special powers too then spiderman hit him hard but his hand went straight through sandmans body suddenly sandmans hand began to grow soon it was huge he used it to hit spiderman with all his power spiderman and sandman flew out of the truck tearing off the back doors spiderman landed on one of the doors he shot a line of webbing at the truck and it pulled him along like a surfer there was a lot of traffic on the road spiderman had to move quickly to avoid the cars racing towards him then he realised that the truck was heading straight towards a wall he had to do something to save the men in the truck and fast he pulled himself along the webbing to the front of the truck he made a web around the two men and threw them out of the truck then he shot another web for them to land in spiderman was still in the truck and there was no time for him to get out crash the truck crashed at top speed into the wall at first nothing moved smoke was rising from the pile of metal but then very slowly spiderman pulled himself out he was in a lot of pain but he wasnt seriously hurt he was spiderman after all the next day the daily bugle printed a story about sandman on the front page in big letters it said sandman even spiderman cant stop him there was also a personal note to spiderman from jonah jameson give back the key peter shook his head and put down the paper the story didnt even say that spiderman rescued the guards and worst of all the photo of sandman was by eddie brock dont think about it peter told himself tonight was his big night he had more important things than sandman to think about things like mary jane he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the diamond ring still there still safe he took a deep breath put the ring back in his pocket and left the room he didnt see the sticky black goo moving across the wall towards his clothes cupboard chapter six a painful evening wow peter thought as he walked into the constellation restaurant it was the most expensive restaurant he had ever been to new yorkers in designer clothes talked and laughed over plates of amazing food peter gave his name to the head waiter the waiter gave him an unfriendly look and replied sharply in french then nervously peter took out the diamond ring theres something i want to ask you he said immediately the waiters face changed he smiled warmly at peter maybe we can put the ring in the bottom of her glass he suggested peter nodded excitedly and perhaps the musicians could play this peter gave the waiter a piece of paper with the name of a song the waiter said ah yes their favourite peter sat alone waiting for mary jane he practised the words he wanted to say then she appeared and came to the table she looked extremely unhappy she had just taken a new job as a singing waitress in a club the club wasnt very nice but she needed the money she looked around the restaurant without much interest isnt this place too expensive for you she asked its a special night peter replied brightly youre on broadway youre a star mj looked down at the table she wanted to tell peter the truth but it was just too painful i dont feel much like a star tonight she said sadly you are a star youve earned it peter said warmly he thought mj was still worrying about the bad review he had more to say but at that moment gwen stacy appeared at their table to say hello she was at the restaurant with her parents her father captain stacy was very important in the new york police its so nice to meet you she said to mj with a happy smile pete talks about you all the time mary jane remembered gwen from the day spiderman received the key she hadnt realised that spiderman was kissing a girl he knew peter looked uncomfortable gwens my er study partner he said in dr connors class gwen asked peter if he had a photo of spiderman kissing her shed love a photo of that who gets kissed by spiderman these days she joked mj looked angrily at peter gwen realised that she should go ill leave you two alone she said she waved as she returned to her table peter waved back the head waiter saw the wave and thought it was time to bring the champagne mary jane looked peter in the eyes let me ask you something she said when you kissed her who was kissing her spiderman or peter what do you mean asked peter that was our kiss she said almost crying why would you do that the truth was that peter didnt know what to say he didnt know why he kissed gwen mary jane fought back the tears hes not going to say sorry she realised it doesnt matter she said finally i dont feel very well i have to go she got up and walked out of the restaurant as she left a violin player came towards the table he was playing their song falling in love then the head waiter arrived with two glasses of champagne peter picked up mary janes glass and took out the ring ill remember this moment for the rest of my life he thought for all the wrong reasons peter stood next to the phone outside his room he had just left a message for mary jane he really needed to speak to her why didnt i say sorry he wondered why am i so stupid and then the phone rang peter answered it immediately but it wasnt mary jane mr parker this is captain stacy said a mans voice weve got some new information about the murder of your uncle ben parker peter didnt understand uncle bens killer was caught long ago what new information could they possibly have please come down to the police station immediately aunt may sat as still as a stone in the chair next to peters we used to think that this man dennis caradine was the killer said captain stacy he held up a photo peter knew the face well peter had allowed him to escape from a fight club with the nights money he had chased him when he drove off in uncle bens car after the murder captain stacy put the photo down on his desk we were wrong peters heart stopped wrong how could they be wrong he thought the real killer is still free captain stacy explained and held up another photo hes a thief whos been in and out of prison peter looked at the photo in disbelief it was the man spiderman fought in the armoured truck two days ago he escaped from prison captain stacy continued he told another prisoner about the murder peter could hardly breathe peter had chased dennis caradine and he had died because of a terrible mistake peter felt so angry it was too much he ran straight out of the station he couldnt look at captain stacy or think about dennis caradine for another moment chapter seven a new spiderman someone was knocking very softly on peters door peter got up slowly and opened the door mary jane was standing there he wasnt pleased to see her he was too upset about uncle bens killer aunt may called me she said she told me about this criminal who killed uncle ben shes worried about you peter couldnt speak he turned and went back into the room mj followed him and closed the door her heart ached for peter you killed the wrong man she said but you didnt know that when you pushed him i didnt kill him i didnt push him peter replied sharply he was pointing a gun at me i moved he fell mj had chosen the wrong words but she really wanted to help peter she didnt want to make things worse if i can help you in some way im here she said thank you for coming peter answered but his voice sounded flat and cold he opened the door for mary jane right now he needed to be alone he had to think about how to make things right everybody needs help sometimes she said as she walked out even spiderman peter didnt even say goodbye he switched on his police radio uncle bens killer is out there he thought lots of other criminals are out there too he thought about sandman and how he had escaped from spiderman that wont happen again he promised himself criminals can escape from the cops but they wont escape from spiderman not any more later that night peter was lying on his bed wearing his spiderman suit the police radio was still on but peter wasnt listening he was in a deep sleep the black goo moved from his clothes cupboard towards his bed as it moved closer and closer peters dreams became darker he saw flint marko shoot uncle ben and dennis caradine fall to his death over and over again the black goo moved slowly across peters red and blue suit until it covered it completely it became part of spidermans suit peter opened his eyes he was high up in the air above the city he looked up and saw that he was hanging on a line of webbing from one of the tallest buildings whats happening peter asked in surprise just then he saw himself in the mirrored wall of the building wow he thought awesome his spider suit was completely black and he felt really strong much stronger than usual he ran straight down the side of the building then he jumped up high turned in the air and landed on a very narrow wall it was an impossible jump i couldnt do that before thought peter he felt amazing with this new black suit he could do anything this feels good he said this is something else chapter eight washed away the next morning there was an urgent report on peters police radio someone was robbing a bank and spiderman had to act fast peter knew this was the work of flint marko hes not going to escape this time thought peter he put on the new black suit and raced to the bank but spiderman arrived at the bank seconds too late he saw sandman escaping into the new york subway spiderman was about to jump down after sandman when eddie brock appeared love the new suit eddie said as he took spidermans photo spiderman was angry the last thing he needed right now was eddie brock he shot a line of webbing at the camera and pulled it from eddies hands then he jumped down into the subway tunnel after sandman eddie couldnt believe it spiderman wasnt such a good guy after all and then he had an idea he took out a second camera from his pocket quickly he took some pictures of the bank before the police arrived spiderman moved silently through the dark subway tunnel suddenly he heard a train coming towards him he pressed his body against the tunnel wall the train raced past like the wind then he turned a corner and saw flint marko with bags of money in his arms spiderman moved marko turned quickly but he couldnt see anyone spidermans new black suit hid him in the darkness slam out of nowhere spiderman hit marko hard in the face marko flew backwards dropping the bags of money he got up and his body turned into sand he ran at spiderman wham they both went flying through the tunnel spiderman moved quickly to avoid a speeding train sandman knocked spiderman backwards then spiderman fired a web at sandman but it missed sandman threw himself at spiderman but his head hit a passing train it cut away half of sandmans head he screamed in pain and fell to his knees spiderman noticed that one of sandmans hands had landed in a pool of water his hand was disappearing spiderman realised that the water had come from a huge pipe next to them he pulled at the top of the pipe with his hands the pipe broke open and water shot everywhere sandman gave a terrible cry as the water washed him away soon there was nothing left of sandman flint marko was gone and spiderman didnt feel bad about it not even a little bit when peter returned home later that day he met mr ditkovich mr ditkovich owned the building and lived on the floor below peter mr ditkovich wanted his money for the month and he was not happy peter was always late with the money for his room usually peter was polite to mr ditkovich but not today i would pay on time if you mended anything like the lock on my door he shouted he had the suit on under his clothes he felt really powerful he went angrily into his room he saw himself in the mirror he looked different like a wild animal its the suit he realised its changing me its making me dangerous he couldnt wear the suit any more he must throw it away but what if someone found it he thought he saw a box in the corner of his room he put the suit in the box and closed the top ill keep it he thought but ill never wear it again harry osborn was painting a picture he was really enjoying himself he stopped for a moment and looked around the room suddenly he heard his fathers voice in his head he looked at himself in the mirror and then memories poured back into harrys mind he saw his fathers dead body spiderman lying on a sofa a hand taking off spidermans mask peter parkers face remember me shouted norman osborn yes father harry replied i remember everything now why havent you killed peter parker harry felt sick peter was his best friend i wont listen to you any more harry shouted leave me alone peter went to see his teacher dr connors he had a small piece of the black goo in his hand he was really worried about the new black suit and its dangerous power at first dr connors wasnt very happy to stop his work but he could see from peters face that this was important and when peter showed him the black goo he was very interested he promised to examine it as soon as possible mary jane was in harrys kitchen she had called to tell him about her new job and he had invited her over for lunch they were having so much fun together that mary jane forgot all her problems harry loved being with her they were laughing and dancing when more memories came back into his head he had loved mary jane and he still loved her he moved closer to mj and looked into her eyes for a moment they kissed but then she pulled away she loved harry as a friend i could never love harry the way i love peter she thought youre thinking about peter arent you harry said angrily mj got up to leave thats right thought harry run back to peter like you always do and then all his memories came back he was jealous of peter he loved mary jane she loved peter peter was spiderman harry could hear his father laughing in his head his father was right peter parker was his enemy he had stolen everything that harry had ever loved he thought of a plan mary jane must break up with peter nothing could hurt his enemy more than this mary jane ran home from harrys place she was about to open her front door when the new goblin appeared from nowhere his strong arms took hold of mary jane she tried to scream but no sound came out the new goblin had her in his power chapter nine revenge peter walked through the park to meet mary jane he had brought her favourite flowers when mj called him she had sounded very upset ive only been thinking about myself peter realised he held out the flowers to her she looked at them and felt terrible peter had remembered her favourite flowers it just made things harder this isnt easy for me she began i have to tell you the truth we cant be together any more but i love you peter said im lonely she replied youre not there for me peters heart was breaking she had to make it final theres someone else she added theres nothing more to talk about peters world was falling to pieces he had to fight to keep her he got down on one knee he started to ask her to marry him but mj didnt listen she turned away to hide her tears just leave me alone she cried then she ran out of the park leaving peter alone with the flowers harry osborn was hiding behind some trees near the bridge he saw everything bravo he called to mary jane as she left the park she had done exactly what he wanted peter lay on his bed feeling terrible he couldnt stop thinking about mary jane what happened he wondered why wont she talk to me he knew he had done some bad things he wasnt there for her when she needed him it was wrong to kiss gwen and he wasnt grateful for her help about uncle ben but these werent reasons to break up he wanted to help mary jane but he didnt know how he turned over and saw the box dont touch the suit he thought its dangerous it changes you he looked again at the box well maybe i want to be different things cant get much worse he moved towards the box lifted up the top and pulled out the suit ill just wear it for a little while he promised until i feel better later that day peter walked through manhattan like a new man with the suit under his clothes he felt fantastic nothing can stop me now he thought but then he walked past a newspaperseller he noticed the front page of the daily bugle it said spiderman thief under this there was a photo of spiderman robbing a bank peter looked closely at the photo immediately he realised that it was two different photos it was a fake someone had put them together to make spiderman into a criminal and the name under the photo was eddie brock peter was very angry eddie wants that job so much peter thought hes happy to lie about spiderman well hes not going to get away with this and he raced down the street towards the daily bugle office peter found eddie at his new desk in his new office there were a lot of people from the newspaper there they were celebrating eddies new job your picture is a fake peter shouted give me a break eddie said with a smile peter pushed eddie powerfully against a wall peter please eddie said in surprise if anyone finds out no newspaper will give me a job at that moment robbie robertson appeared at peters side he was jonah jamesons number two at the newspaper he couldnt believe that peter parker was attacking eddie brock peter was so quiet and shy peter let go of eddie and gave a photo to robbie it was the real photo the one eddie had used in his spiderman thief photo peter knew eddie would lose his job but peter didnt care any more he just smiled peter went silently into the osborn house he was wearing the black suit under his clothes he didnt mean to put it on but he couldnt stop himself he needed to speak to harry about mary jane what took you so long said harrys voice but it wasnt harry it was the new goblin what peter asked in i surprise i was there for her pete i said harry and when she kissed me peter threw himself angrily a harry he shot webs at his old friend but harry cut through them easily then peter held onto harrys arms and they crashed through the long mirror on the wall behind this mirror was the goblins secret room peter ran at harry and pushed him to the floor he could easily kill him there and then are you going to kill me like you killed my father harry cried your father tried to kill me peter shouted in his face finally peter was able to tell harry the truth and he was enjoying it he wasnt proud of you he cried he hated you harry reached for a bomb and throw it at peter but peter was too quick and he shot the bomb back at harry boom the bomb blew up near harrys face he cried in pain then he saw himself in the broken mirror and he screamed peter heard harrys screams behind him this time he didnt help harry he jumped out of the window and away into the night peter was on the phone outside his room dr connors was telling him about the black goo something very similar was found in a meteorite in the s said dr connors its very old its alive and it can think it can think peter couldnt believe it his black suit was alive it can even change the way people act dr connors continued peter already knew that he had done some terrible things when he was wearing the suit stay away from it dr connors said finally it could be dangerous peter knew dr connors was right he should stay away from the suit im just not sure that i want to he thought in a water pipe below the city some grains of sand were coming together the water raced through the pipe and out into a small river the grains joined together to make a hand then an arm then a body very slowly the body rose out of the water sandman was alive chapter ten the jazz room peter was laughing as he walked into the jazz room with gwen he had asked her out on a date earlier that afternoon gwen was looking really beautiful and theyd had a wonderful dinner together peter looked around the small dark club so this is where mary jane is working he thought im not surprised shes feeling so down they found a table near the band one of the musicians stepped up to the microphone and said lets hear from you mary jane mj put down some drinks and hurried over to the band isnt that mary jane your old girlfriend gwen asked peter in surprise peter smiled and said crazy huh just as mj was about to sing peter jumped up and started to play the piano mary jane stepped back from the microphone in surprise peter played the piano with amazing skill then he jumped onto the dance floor under his clothes the black suit made him dance really well he took gwen in his arms turned her around then lowered her backwards he was about to kiss gwen when she suddenly pushed him away this is for her isnt it gwen cried looking at mary jane im so sorry she said to mj and ran out of the club peter watched her go he didnt feel bad about using her he had come here for revenge and now he had it the manager came over and asked peter to leave when peter refused he asked the doorman to throw him out the doorman was huge but peter knocked him over easily then mj tried to talk to peter she walked up behind him without looking he turned round and hit mj she fell to the floor suddenly everything stopped nobody moved whats happened to you mj whispered i dont know peter answered feeling sick but he knew it was the suit he had it on again under his clothes the suit was changing him into a bad guy a really bad guy peter ran out of the jazz room and through the city streets he didnt know where he was going he ran until he saw an old church he stopped and looked up at the beautiful broken windows he needed somewhere to think he wanted to get high above the noise of the city he ran into the church and up the stairs to the highest point he took off his shirt and climbed outside he looked out over the city in his black suit then he swung down into the bell room i have to destroy the suit he thought he tried to pull it off but it stuck to his skin it had become a part of him for a moment peter was pleased he didnt really want to give it up he enjoyed feeling powerful and dangerous but then he thought of mary jane she had looked so hurt in the club his heart ached for her no he had to destroy it he tore the suit with his fingers and screamed in pain but it wouldnt come off then he fell back into one of the bells clang at the sound of the bell the black goo started to come off bits dropped from his body onto the broken floor clang he rang another bell and more fell from his skin it dropped through to the floor below someone was standing there watching this amazing sight eddie brock peter parker is spiderman eddie couldnt believe it the two people who destroyed my life are really one this explained everything peter was the only person before eddie to take photos of spiderman and now he understood why peter felt so angry about the fake photo eddie had of course lost his job because of that photo his life fell to pieces on that day gwen didnt want to see him any more he had lost everything he had gone to the church to ask god for something he wanted to ask for revenge as peter fought with the suit bits of it fell onto eddie peter had no idea that eddie was there the black goo landed on eddies hands his face and his tongue a bright white light shot through eddies body he felt like he was on fire he smiled crazily as spidermans powers raced through his body he became a terrible new enemy for spiderman he was venom peter was in the shower he was washing away the last bits of the black goo from his body for the first time in weeks he felt clean a little later there was a knock on peters door it was aunt may she was very worried about him hows mj she asked peter shook his head i dont know i havent heard from her did you ask her to marry you no he answered you were right im not ready but you seemed so sure peter took out the diamond ring and gave it back to aunt may i hurt mj he said i dont know what to do forgive yourself peter she answered i believe in you find a way to make this right and she put the ring back in peters hand it was late at night and flint marko stood in the street below his daughters room he missed her so much just then flint saw a man in black he was watching him in the darkness do i know you flint shouted im the enemy of your enemy venom replied flint didnt understand eddie explained that they both hated spiderman together they could destroy him i just want him off my back flint agreed eddie smiled sandman was the perfect partner he put his arm around flints shoulder follow me he said chapter eleven partners in crime all around the city people watched tv screens a taxi was hanging high above the city of new york in a huge black web there was a young woman inside the tv news reporter said she was an actress called mary jane watson venom wrote a message in the web spiderman stop us if you can peter was watching too this time he really needed help but who in the world could help spiderman harry sat in a dark room watching the action on tv his face would get better but he would never look normal he was feeling very angry with peter and very sorry for himself peter entered the room silently through a window harry i cant take them both peter said softly she needs us if you want to save mj youll have to do it yourself harry shouted get out peter knew harry would never forgive him but after peter left bernard came down the stairs bernard had seen and heard many things during his years at the osborn house harry he said theres something i have to tell you i saw your father the night he died i cleaned his injury i know your fathers death was his own fault mary jane was angry and afraid once again she was in terrible danger because of spiderman suddenly she screamed as part of the web broke and the taxi almost crashed to the ground there was a huge truck in the web above her the truck was full of concrete blocks and then spiderman arrived he swung down and landed on the front of the taxi at that moment mj forgot all her angry feelings finally spiderman was there for her venom swung towards them and kicked spiderman through the front window glass flew everywhere venom climbed into the taxi the black goo on his face was moving all the time spiderman could see eddies face and realised what had happened the black goo had found a new partner in crime venom hit spiderman in the face and they both fell out of the taxi they landed on one of the floors of an unfinished office building venom jumped onto spiderman and the two enemies were face to face venom smiled a horrible smile soon he would have his revenge at that moment the truck above mj started to move some of the concrete blocks fell into the taxi mj managed to push one of the blocks out of the taxi and down onto venom below spiderman broke away from his enemy but venom shot webbing at spiderman the webbing flew around spidermans neck and tied him to a metal post suddenly the truck above mj broke away it hit the taxi as it fell mj managed to jump out into venoms huge web in the street below sandman was ready to join the fight all the grains of his body came together and a huge mountain of sand raced towards spiderman was this the end for spiderman boom suddenly a bomb hit sandman and blew away his head harry had arrived he flew down to spiderman and took his hand together the two old friends flew on the skystick and faced their enemies harry shot bombs at sandman while spiderman attacked venom but then venom knocked harry and spiderman off the skystick he picked up a metal pipe and pointed it at spiderman one end of the pipe was very sharp dont give in to the suit spiderman shouted at venom it changes you it makes you bad venom smiled a horrible smile i like being bad he said it makes me happy harry threw a bomb at venom he fell back but got up again and ran at spiderman with two sharp metal pipes this time spiderman would die suddenly harry jumped in front of venom and the two metal pipes shot deep into his stomach harry fell screaming to the floor below quickly spiderman drove some metal pipes into the floor around venom they made a circle all around him he was caught like an animal spiderman ran round the outside of the circle hitting each pipe with a piece of metal clang clang the sound of metal on metal the black goo started to move and fall from venoms body spiderman pulled eddie out of the goo but eddie didnt want to be saved he jumped back just as spiderman threw a bomb at the goo boom there was fire and smoke then eddie brock and the goo were gone suddenly flint marko appeared at peters side he needed to tell peter about uncle bens death he explained that his daughter was dying she was all he had in the world he needed money and he was frightened uncle ben had told him put down the gun and go home he realised now that uncle ben was trying to help him but a moment later his partner dennis caradine had run up with the money they had to escape in the heat of the moment he shot uncle ben i did a terrible thing ive wanted to go back and change it so many times said marko if you cant forgive me i understand peter thought for a moment ive done some terrible things too he said he looked flint marko in the eyes he knew marko was telling the truth i forgive you said peter then flint marko disappeared in a cloud of sand down on the floor below mj sat beside harry peter raced down to join them was he already too late how are you harry peter asked ive been better harry replied with a weak smile well get through this said peter but he could see his friend was dying i was wrong to hurt you i was wrong to say those things none of that matters peter harry said softly youre my friend my best friend and with these final words harry osborn died epilogue the songbird peter could hear mary janes lovely voice as he walked towards the jazz room he stopped at the entrance there was a large photo of mary jane next to a wonderful review peter read the words and smiled dont miss her a beautiful songbird has flown into town he pulled open the door and went into the club mary jane smiled at peter as he walked into the room he waited until she had finished her song then he took her to the dance floor the band started to play falling in love peter looked into mjs eyes we have a lot to talk about he said mj put a finger to his lips lets not talk about us she told him just shut up and dance and so they danced the end
