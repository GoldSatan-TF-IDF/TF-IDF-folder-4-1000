morthylla clark ashton smith in umbri city of the delta the lights blazed with a garish brilliance after the setting of that sun which was now a coalred decadent star grown old beyond chronicle beyond legend most brilliant most garish of all were the lights that illumed the house of the ageing poet famurza whose anacreontic songs had brought him the riches that he disbursed in orgies for his friends and sycophants here in porticoes halls and chambers the cressets were thick as stars in a cloudless fault it seemed that famurza wished to dissipate all shadows except those in arrased alcoves set apart for the fitful amours of his guests for the kindling of such amours there were wines cordials aphrodisiacs there were meats and fruits that swelled the flaccid pulses there were strange exotic drugs that amused and prolonged pleasure there were curious statuettes in halfveiled niches and wall panels painted with bestial loves or loves human or superhuman there were hired singers of all sexes who sang ditties diversely erotic and dancers whose contortions were calculated to restore the outworn sense when all else had failed but to all such incitants valzain pupil of famurza and renowned both as poet and voluptuary was insensible with indifference turning toward disgust a halfemptied cup in his hand he watched from a corner the gala throng that eddied past him and averted his eyes involuntarily from certain couples who were too shameless or drunken to seek the shadows of privacy for their dalliance a sudden satiety had claimed him he felt himself strangely withdrawn from the morass of wine and flesh into which not long before he had still plunged with delight he seemed as one who stands on an alien shore beyond waters of deepening separation what ails you valzain has a vampire sucked your blood it was famurza flushed grayhaired slightly corpulent who stood at his elbow laying an affectionate hand on valzains shoulder he hoisted aloft with the other that fescenninely graven quart goblet from which he was wont to drink oniy wine eschewing the drugged and violent liquors often preferred by the sybarites of umbri is it billiousness or unrequited love we have cures here for both you have only to name your medicine there is no medicine for what ails me countered valzain as for love i have ceased to care whether it be requited or unrequited i can taste only the dregs in every cup and tedium lurks at the middle of all kisses truly yours is a melancholy case there was concern in famurzas voice i have been reading some of your late verses you write only of tombs and yew trees of maggots and phantoms and disembodied love such stuff gives me the colic i need at least a halfgallon of honest vine juice after each poem though i did not know it till lately admitted valzain there is in me a curiosity toward the unseen a longing for things beyond the material world famurza shook his head commiserately though i have attained to more than twice your years i am still content with what i see and hear and touch good juicy meat women wine the songs of fullthroated singers are enough for me in the drums of slumber mused valzain i have clasped succubi who were more than flesh have known delights too keen for the waking body to sustain do such dreams have any source outside the earthborn brain itself i would give much to find that source if it exists in the meanwhile there is nothing for me but despair so young and yet so exhausted well if youre tired of women and want phantoms instead i might venture a suggestion do you know the old necropolis lying midway between umbri and psiom a matter of perhaps three miles from here the goatherds say that a lamia haunts it the spirit of the princess morthylla who died several centuries ago and was interred in a mausoleum that still stands overtowering the lesser tombs why not go forth tonight and visit the necropolis it should suit your mood better than my house and perhaps morthylla will appear to you but dont blame me if you dont return at all after all those years the lamia is still avid for human lovers aad she might well take a fancy to you of course i know the place said valzain but i think you are jesting famurza shrugged his shoulders and moved on amid the revelers a laughing dancer blondelimbed and lissom came up to valzain and threw a noose of plaited flowers about his neck claiming him as her captive he broke the noose gently and gave the girl a tepid kiss that caused her to make wry faces unobtrusively but quickly before others of the merrymakers could try to entice him he left the house of famurza without impulses other than that of an urgent desire for solitude he turned his steps toward the suburbs avoiding the neighborhood of taverns and lupanars where the populace thronged music laughter snatches of songs followed him from lighted mansions where symposia were held nightly by the citys richer denizens but he met few roisters on the streets it was too late for the gathering too early for the dispersal of guests at such symposia now the lights thinned out with everwidening intervals between and the streets grew shadowy with that ancient night which pressed about umbri and would wholly quench its defiant galaxies of lampbright window with the darkening of zothiques senescent sun of such things and of deaths encircling mystery were the musings of valzain as he plunged into the outer darkness that he found grateful to his glarewearied eyes grateful too was the silence of the fieldbordered road that he pursued for awhile without realizing its direction then at some landmark familiar despite the gloom it came to him that the road was the one which ran from umbri to psiom that sister city of the delta the road beside whose middle meanderings was situated the longdisused necropolis to which famurza had ironically directed him truly he thought the earthlyminded famurza had somehow plumbed the need that lay at the bottom of his disenchantment with all sensory pleasures it would be good to visit to sojourn for an hour or so in that city whose people had long passed beyond the lusts of mortality beyond satiety and disillusion a moon swelling from the crescent toward the half arose behind him as he reached the foot of the lowmounded hill on which the cemetery lay he left the paved road and began to ascend the slope halfcovered with stunted gorse at whose summit the glimmering marbles were discernible it was without path other than the broken trails made by goats and their herders dim lengthened and attenuate his shadow went before him like a ghostly guide in his fantasy it seemed to him that he climbed the gently sloping bosom of a giantess studded afar with pale gems that were tombstones and mausoleuns he caught himself wondering amid this poetic whimsy whether the giantess was dead or merely slept gaining the flat expansive ground of the summit where dwarfish dying yews disputed with leafless briars the intervals of slabs blotched with lichen he recalled the tale that famurza had mentioned anent the lamia who was said to haunt the necropolis famurza he knew well was no believer in such legendry and had meant only to mock his funereal mood yet as a poet will he began to play with the fancy of some presence immortal lovely and evil that dwelt amid the antique marbles and would respond to the evocation of one who without positive belief had longed vainly for visions from beyond mortality through headstone aisles of moontouched solitude he came to a lofty mausoleum still standing with few signs of ruin at the cemeterys center beneath it he had been told were extensive vaults housing the mummies of an extinct royal family that had ruled over the twin cities umbri and psiom in former centuries the princess morthylla had belonged to this family to his startlement a woman or what appeared to be such was sitting on a fallen shaft beside the mausoleum he could not see her distinctly the tombs shadow still enveloped her from the shoulders downward the face alone glimmering wanly was lifted to the rising moon its profile was such as he had seen on antique coins who are you he asked with a curiosity that over powered his courtesy i am the lamia morthylla she replied in a voice that left behind it a faint and elusive vibration like that of some briefly sounded harp beware me for my kisses are forbidden to those who would remain numbered among the living valzain was startled by this answer that echoed his fantasies yet reason told him that the apparition was no spirit of the tombs but a living woman who knew the legend of morthylla and wished to amuse herself by teasing him and yet what woman would venture alone and at night to a place so desolate and eerie most credibly she was a wanton who had come out to keep a rendezvous amid the tombs there were he knew certain perverse debauchees who required sepulchral surroundings and furnishings for the titillation of their desires perhaps you are waiting for some one he suggested i do not wish to intrude if such is the case i wait only for him who is destined to come and i have waited long having had no lover for two hundred years remain if you wish there is no one to fear but me despite the rational surmises he had formed there crept along valzains spine the thrill of one who without fully believing suspects the presence of a thing beyond nature yet surely it was all a game a game that he too could play for the beguilement of his ennui i came here hoping to meet you he declared i am weary of mortal women tired of every pleasure tired even of poetry i too am bored she said simply the moon had climbed higher shining on the dress of antique mode that the woman wore it was cut closely at waist and hips and bosom with voluminous downward folds valzain had seen such costumes only in old drawings the princess morthylla dead for three centuries might well have worn a similar dress whoever she might be he thought the woman was strangely beautiful with a touch of quaintness in the heavily coiled hair whose color he could not decide in the moonlight there was a sweetness about her mouth a shadow of fatigue or sadness beneath her eyes at the right corner of her lips he discerned a small mole valzains meeting with the selfnamed morthylla was repeated nightly while the moon swelled like the rounding breast of a titaness and fell away once more to hollowness and senescence always she awaited him by the same mausoleum which she declared was her dwelling place and always she dismissed him when the east turned ashen with dawn saying that she was a creature of the night skeptical at first he thought of her as a person with macabre leanings and fantasies akin to his own with whom he was carrying on a flirtation of singular charm yet about her he could find no hint of the worldliness that he suspected no seeming knowledge of present things but a weird familiarity with the past and the lamias legend more and more she seemed a nocturnal being intimate only with shadow and solitude her eyes her lips appeared to withhold secrets forgotten and forbidden in her vague ambiguous answers to his questions he read meanings that thrilled him with hope and fear i have dreamed of life she told him cryptically and i have dreamed also of death now perhaps there is another dream into which you have entered i too would dream said valzain night after night his disgust and weariness sloughed away from him in a fascination fed by the spectral milieu the environing silence of the dead his withdrawal and separation from the carnal garish city by degrees by alternations of unbelief and belief he came to accept her as the actual lamia the hunger that he sensed in her could be only the lamias hunger her beauty that of a being no longer human it was like a dreamers acceptance of things fantastic elsewhere than in sleep together with his belief there grew his love for her the desires he had thought dead revived within him wilder more importunate she seemed to love him in return yet she betrayed no sign of the lamias legendary nature eluding his embrace refusing him the kisses for which he begged sometime perhaps she conceded but first you must know me for what i am must love me without illusion kill me with your lips devour me as you are said to have devoured other lovers beseeched valzain can you not wait her smile was sweet and tantalizing i do not wish your death so soon for i love you too well is it not sweet to keep your tryst among the sepulchres have i not beguiled you from your boredom must you end it all the next night he besought her again imploring with all his ardor and eloquence the denied consummation she mocked him perhaps i am merely a bodiless phantom a spirit without substance perhaps you have dreamed me would you risk an awakening from the dream valzain stepped toward her stretching out his arms in a passionate gesture she drew back saying what if i should turn to ashes and moonlight at your touch you would regret then your rash insistence you are the immortal lamia avowed valzain my senses tell me that you are no phantom no disembodied spirit but for me you have turned all else to shadow yes i am real enough in my fashion she granted laughing softly then suddenly she leaned toward him and her lips touched his throat he felt their moist warmth a moment and felt the sharp sting of her teeth that barely pierced his skin withdrawing instantly before he could clasp her she eluded him again it is the only kiss permitted to us at present she cried and fled swiftly with soundless footfalls among the gleams and shadows of the sepulchres on the following afternoon a matter of urgent and unwelcome business called valzain to the neighboring city of psiom a brief journey but one that he seldom took he passed the ancient necropolis longing for that nocturnal hour when he could hasten once more to a meeting with morthylla her poignant kiss which had drawn a few drops of blood had left him greatly fevered and distraught he like that place of tombs was haunted and the haunting went with him into psiom he had finished his business the borrowing of a sum of money from a usurer standing at the usurers door with that slightly obnoxious but necessary person beside him he saw a woman passing on the street her features though not her dress were those of morthylla and there was even the same tiny mole at one corner of her mouth no phantom of the cemetery could have startled or dismayed him more profoundly who is that woman he asked the moneylender do you know her her name is beldith she is wellknown in psiom being rich in her own right and having had numerous lovers ive had a little business with her though she owes me nothing at present should you care to meet her i can easily introduce you yes i should like to meet her agreed valzain she looks strangely like someone that i knew a long time ago the usurer peered slyly at the poet she might not make too easy a conquest it is said of late that she has withdrawn herself from the pleasures of the city some have seen her going out at night toward the old necropolis or returning from it in the early dawn strange tastes id say for one who is little more than a harlot but perhaps she goes out to meet some eccentric lover direct me to her house valzain requested i shall not need you to introduce me as you like the moneylender shrugged looking a little disappointed its not far anyway valzain found the house quickly the woman beldith was alone she meet him with a wistful and troubled smile that left no doubt of her identity i perceive that you have learned the truth she said i had meant to tell you soon for the deception could not have gone on much longer will you not forgive me i forgive you returned valzain sadly but why did you deceive me because you desired it a woman tries to please the man whom she loves and in all love there is more or less deception like you valzain i had grown tired of pleasure and i sought the solitude of the necropolis so remote from carnal things you too came seeking solitude and peace or some unearthly specter i recognized you at once and i had read your poems knowing morthyllas legend i sought to play a game with you playing it i grew to love you valzain you loved me as the lamia can you not now love me for myself it cannot be averred the poet i fear to repeat the disappointment i have found in other women yet at least i am grateful for the hours you gave me they were the best i have known even though i have loved something that did not and could not exist farewell morthylla farewell beldith when he had gone beldith stretched herself face downward among the cushions of her couch she wept a little and the tears made a dampness that quickly dried later she arose briskly enough and went about her household business after a time she returned to the loves and revelries of psiom perhaps in the end she found such peace as may be given to those who have grown too old for pleasure but for valzain there was no peace no balm for this last and most bitter of disillusionments nor could he return to the carnalities of his former life so it was that he finally slew himself stabbing his throat to its deepest vein with a keen knife in the same spot which the false lamias teeth had bitten drawing a little blood after his death he forgot that he had died forgot the immediate past with all its happenings and circumstances following his talk with famurza he had gone forth from famurzas house and from the city of umbri and had taken the road that passed the abandoned cemetery seized by an impulse to visit it he had climbed the slope toward the marbles under a swelling moon that rose behind him gaining the flat expansive ground of the summit where dwarfish dying yews disputed with leafless briars the intervals of slabs blotched with lichen he recalled the tale that famurza had mentioned anent the lamia who was said to haunt the necropolis famurza he knew well was no believer in such legendry and had meant only to mock his funereal mood yet as a poet will he began to play with the fancy of some presence immortal lovely and evil that dwelt amid the antique marbles and would respond to the evocation of one who without positive belief had longed vainly for visions from beyond mortality through headstone aisles of moontouched solitude he came to a lofty mausoleum still standing with few signs of ruin at the cemeterys center beneath it he had been told were extensive vaults housing the mummies of an extinct royal family that had ruled over the twin cities umbri and psiom in former centuries the princess morthylla had belonged to

courtesy i am the lamia morthylla she replied
