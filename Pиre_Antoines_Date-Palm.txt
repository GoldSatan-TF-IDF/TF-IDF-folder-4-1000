pиre antoines datepalm by thomas bailey aldrich boston and new york houghton mifflin company copyright and near the levйe and not far from the old french cathedral in the place darmes at new orleans stands a fine datepalm thirty feet in height spreading its broad leaves in the alien air as hardily as if its sinuous roots were sucking strength from their native earth sir charles lyell in his second visit to the united states mentions this exotic the tree is seventy or eighty years old for pиre antoine a roman catholic priest who died about twenty years ago told mr bringier that he planted it himself when he was young in his will he provided that they who succeeded to this lot of ground should forfeit it if they cut down the palm wishing to learn something of pиre antoines history sir charles lyell made inquiries among the ancient crйole inhabitants of the faubourg that the old priest in his last days became very much emaciated that he walked about the streets like a mummy that he gradually dried up and finally blew away was the meagre and unsatisfactory result of the tourists investigations this is all that is generally told of pиre antoine in the summer of while new orleans was yet occupied by the confederate forces i met at alexandria in virginia a lady from louisiana miss blondeau by name who gave me the substance of the following legend touching pиre antoine and his wonderful datepalm if it should appear tame to the reader it will be because i am not habited in a black ribbedsilk dress with a strip of pointlace around my throat like miss blondeau it will be because i lack her eyes and lips and southern music to tell it with when pиre antoine was a very young man he had a friend whom he loved as he loved his life emile jardin returned his passion and the two on account of their friendship became the marvel of the city where they dwelt one was never seen without the other for they studied walked ate and slept together thus began miss blondeau with the air of fiammetta telling her prettiest story to the florentines in the garden of boccaccio antoine and emile were preparing to enter the church indeed they had taken the preliminary steps when a circumstance occurred which changed the color of their lives a foreign lady from some nameless island in the pacific had a few months before moved into their neighborhood the lady died suddenly leaving a girl of sixteen or seventeen entirely friendless and unprovided for the young men had been kind to the woman during her illness and at her death melting with pity at the forlorn situation of anglice the daughter swore between themselves to love and watch over her as if she were their sister now anglice had a wild strange beauty that made other women seem tame beside her and in the course of time the young men found themselves regarding their ward not so much like brothers as at first in brief they found themselves in love with her they struggled with their hopeless passion month after month neither betraying his secret to the other for the austere orders which they were about to assume precluded the idea of love and marriage until then they had dwelt in the calm air of religious meditations unmoved except by that pious fervor which in other ages taught men to brave the tortures of the rack and to smile amid the flames but a blonde girl with great eyes and a voice like the soft notes of a vesper hymn had come in between them and their ascetic dreams of heaven the ties that had bound the young men together snapped silently one by one at last each read in the pale face of the other the story of his own despair and she if anglice shared their trouble her face told no story it was like the face of a saint on a cathedral window once however as she came suddenly upon the two men and overheard words that seemed to burn like fire on the lip of the speaker her eyes grew luminous for an instant then she passed on her face as immobile as before in its setting of wavy gold hair entre or et roux dieu fit ses longs cheveux one night emile and anglice were missing they had flown but whither nobody knew and nobody save antoine cared it was a heavy blow to antoine for he had himself half resolved to confess his love to anglice and urge her to fly with him a strip of paper slipped from a volume on antoines priedieu and fluttered to his feet do not be angry said the bit of paper piteously forgive us for we love pardonneznous car nous aimons three years went by wearily enough antoine had entered the church and was already looked upon as a rising man but his face was pale and his heart leaden for there was no sweetness in life for him four years had elapsed when a letter covered with outlandish postmarks was brought to the young priest a letter from anglice she was dying would he forgive her emile the year previous had fallen a victim to the fever that raged on the island and their child anglice was likely to follow him in pitiful terms she begged antoine to take charge of the child until she was old enough to enter the convent of the sacrйcour the epistle was finished hastily by another hand informing antoine of madame jardins death it also told him that anglice had been placed on board a vessel shortly to leave the island for some western port the letter delayed by storm and shipwreck was hardly read and wept over when little anglice arrived on beholding her antoine uttered a cry of joy and surprise she was so like the woman he had worshipped the passion that had been crowded down in his heart broke out and lavished its richness on this child who was to him not only the anglice of years ago but his friend emile jardin also anglice possessed the wild strange beauty of her mother the bending willowy form the rich tint of skin the large tropical eyes that had almost made antoines sacred robes a mockery to him for a month or two anglice was wildly unhappy in her new home she talked continually of the bright country where she was born the fruits and flowers and blue skies the tall fanlike trees and the streams that went murmuring through them to the sea antoine could not pacify her by and by she ceased to weep and went about the cottage in a weary disconsolate way that cut antoine to the heart a longtailed paroquet which she had brought with her in the ship walked solemnly behind her from room to room mutely pining it seemed for those heavy orient airs that used to ruffle its brilliant plumage before the year ended he noticed that the ruddy tinge had faded from her cheek that her eyes had grown languid and her slight figure more willowy than ever a physician was consulted he could discover nothing wrong with the child except this fading and drooping he failed to account for that it was some vague disease of the mind he said beyond his skill so anglice faded day after day she seldom left the room now at last antoine could not shut out the fact that the child was passing away he had learned to love her so dear heart he said once what ist ails thee nothing mon pиre for so she called him the winter passed the balmy spring had come with its magnolia blooms and orange blossoms and anglice seemed to revive in her small bamboo chair on the porch she swayed to and fro in the fragrant breeze with a peculiar undulating motion like a graceful tree at times something seemed to weigh upon her mind antoine observed it and waited finally she spoke near our house said little anglice near our house on the island the palmtrees are waving under the blue sky oh how beautiful i seem to lie beneath them all day long i am very very happy i yearned for them so much that i grew ill dont you think it was so mon pиre hйlas yes exclaimed antoine suddenly let us hasten to those pleasant islands where the palms are waving anglice smiled i am going there mon pиre a week from that evening the wax candles burned at her feet and forehead lighting her on the journey all was over now was antoines heart empty death like another emile had stolen his new anglice he had nothing to do but to lay the blighted flower away pиre antoine made a shallow grave in his garden and heaped the fresh brown mould over his idol in the tranquil spring evenings the priest was seen sitting by the mound his finger closed in the unread breviary the summer broke on that sunny land and in the cool morning twilight and after nightfall antoine lingered by the grave he could never be with it enough one morning he observed a delicate stem with two curiously shaped emerald leaves springing up from the centre of the mound at first he merely noticed it casually but presently the plant grew so tall and was so strangely unlike anything he had ever seen before that he examined it with care how straight and graceful and exquisite it was when it swung to and fro with the summer wind in the twilight it seemed to antoine as if little anglice were standing there in the garden the days stole by and antoine tended the fragile shoot wondering what manner of blossom it would unfold white or scarlet or golden one sunday a stranger with a bronzed weatherbeaten face like a sailors leaned over the garden rail and said to him what a fine young datepalm you have there sir mon dieu cried pиre antoine starting and is it a palm yes indeed returned the man i did nt reckon the tree would flourish in this latitude ah mon dieu was all the priest could say aloud but he murmured to himself bon dieu vous mavez donnй cela if pиre antoine loved the tree before he worshipped it now he watered it and nurtured it and could have clasped it in his arms here were emile and anglice and the child all in one the years glided away and the datepalm and the priest grew together only one became vigorous and the other feeble pиre antoine had long passed the meridian of life the tree was in its youth it no longer stood in an isolated garden for pretentious brick and stucco houses had clustered about antoines cottage they looked down scowling on the humble thatched roof the city was edging up trying to crowd him off his land but he clung to it like lichen and refused to sell speculators piled gold on his doorsteps and he laughed at them sometimes he was hungry and cold and thinly clad but he laughed none the less get thee behind me satan said the old priests smile pиre antoine was very old now scarcely able to walk but he could sit under the pliant caressing leaves of his palm loving it like an arab and there he sat till the grimmest of speculators came to him but even in death pиre antoine was faithful to his trust the owner of that land loses it if he harm the datetree and there it stands in the narrow dingy street a beautiful dreamy stranger an exquisite foreign lady whose grace is a joy to the eye the incense of whose breath makes the air enamored may the hand wither that touches her ungently because it grew from the heart of little anglice said miss blondeau tenderly
