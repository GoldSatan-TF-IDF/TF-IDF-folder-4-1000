chapter heaven cent vy woke stretched and opened her eyes it was dawn the sun had not yet quite dared show its round face because darkness made it nervous but soon it would get up its nerve she looked at the tapestry with its ever changing picture of xanth she never really tired of watch ing it though her interest waxed and waned it waxed when it rained outside because it was more fun to remain inside where it was dry and it waned when zora zombie was waxing the stairs and the smell of the wax got chok ingly thick thus as she put it it waxed when it waned and waned when it waxed it was her private joke with dt ph the adults didnt understand adults were chroni cal slow about such things sure enough zora was waxing today the smell was just starting ivy had only minutes to find a pretext to go far away several days if possible until the wax settled down but she was running out of pretexts what was left she jumped out of bed so suddenly she frightened the monster under itgrabraham she heard his honk as he shrank away he was a young monster replacing snorti mer who had departed long ago he tended to be timid she was also reaching the age when folk started not be lieving in bed monsters and that made it that much worse when she turned eighteen she would stop believing en tirely and the poor thing would fade away grabby was man from mundania man from mundania quite upset over the prospect for some reason she was sorry about that but there was really no alternative she couldnt stop herself from getting older she ran barefoot to the next room where princess nada slept nada had moved in three years before when dolph brought her home and the two had become great friends because they were the same age and rank and similarly pretty nada was only half human but she kept her human form when staying at castle roogna just from courtesy princesses had to leam courtesy early because princes certainly didnt nada she cried i need a pretext in a hurry nada sat up in bed wrinkling her nose i know i smell it too ill go with you of course but where nada concentrated have we used the mirror yet we dont have the magic mirror ivy reminded her compewter got it last year and wont give it back yes so ivy caught on so well just have to go and fetch it because ill need it when i use the heaven cent exactly except i know except that compewter isnt going to let us have it without a fight and he fights dirty still its a perfect excuse if we can only figure out a way maybe electra thats right she could shock pewter into letting it go electra appeared in the doorway did someone say my name she asked sleepily she was a freckled child whose hair was a bit frizzy her eyes were the color of wonder and there were smile lines around her button nose no one would think to look at her that she was tragically in love zoras waxing the stairs come help us get the magic mirror from compewter is that what i smelled just let me get dressed there was a scramble as the three of them dived into proper clothing in a moment they were together again the two princesses in dresses glancing jealously at electra in her rainbow jeans she was of common stock so could get away with practical clothing she was also slender enough to wear it without attracting stray male eyes or female frowns quickly they trooped down the hall to the farther stair way avoiding the wax unfortunately this led them past dolphs room and he heard them he had ears like those of a werewolf perhaps because he commonly assumed wolf form to snooze his door banged open hey wherere you going he cried are you sneaking out again nada and electra paused nada because she didnt want to hurt his feelings electra because she was in love with him both were betrothed to him of course though he was only twelve in a moment electra would invite him along because she always wanted to be close to him to prevent that ivy dived in were going to get the magic mirror from compewter so i can have it when i use the heaven cent she said so we can find out where good magician humfrey is and finally complete your quest but mother wont let you he started reasonably so youll have to cover for us ivy finished bye he still looked doubtful but nada stepped in and kissed him not saying a word uh sure he said he was silly putty in her hands of course even though he knew she didnt love him it was the mirror image of his asso ciation with electra he changed into zombie form and walked back the way they had come zombies didnt mind the smell of wax so he would be able to brave those stairs despite zoras mischief they completed their escape whatever dolph had done must have been sufficient because no one tried to inter cept them ivy whistled for stanley and in a moment the dragon whored around the castle and joined them he was almost grown now and soon would have to depart for the gap because guarding it was his job ivy would be sad when he left but knew it was the same as it was with her age had its burdens meanwhile he was excellent protec tion they had no fear of wild monsters while in the com pany of the tame one man from mundonia they snatched fruits from the orchard as they passed through it eating on the run then they reached the main path going north every so often compewter arranged to set up a dtour and then king dor would send out some one to shut it down because it was a public nuisance ivy happened to know that there was a dtour currently in force and this time they meant to take it it was the easiest way to reach the evil machine they were supposed to stay clear of the infernal contraption of course which was part of what made him so intriguing stanley would befio protection against him but electra would v sure enough there was the dtour they veered onto it now they could relax because even if it got shut down they wouldnt lose it they stopped for the night near the unlevel playing field where the bulls and the bears charged back and forth grundy golem had discovered this during his quest to locate the missing pet dragon it was called the market and the bulls and bears were the stock almost every day the foolish animals resumed their pointless activity react ing dramatically to insignificant events and ignoring major events there were many strange things in xanth but this business was too strange for even the craziest folk to un derstand what did those bulls and bears find so fascinat ing about that stock market stanley whomped off into the thickest wilderness to catch a bite to eat while the three girls harvested pies from a pie tree near the path it wasnt much of a tree but ivy used her talent to enhance it and then the pies became so healthy that they steamed there were many more such trees along all the paths than in years of yore because ivys mother irene had seeded them in and made them grow and ivy had enhanced them while they ate they talked for it was always fun to talk when there were no adults to listen in inevitably the sub ject found its way to romance for that was the most fascinating concept ever to approach teenage girls when are you going to find a boy ivy nada in quired i mean youre well into seventeen and when man from mundania your mother was that age she had already landed your father and trussed him up and by the time my little brother was nine he had already landed two finacees ivy agreed i confess to being retarded nada and electra grinned ruefully nada had been four teen when the young prince dolph had come to her father the king of the naga for help and because the naga needed an alliance with the humans the king had agreed to help if dolph married his daughter nada had had to pretend she was dolphs age nine knowing that her real age would freak him out it was only a betrothal of course they would have to wait until dolph came of age for the actual ceremony of marriage but meanwhile the alliance was valid and nada had kept company with dolph while her folk received sundry items from the castle roogna arsenal to fight off the encroaching goblins there seemed to be more goblins in xanth than there used to be no one was quite sure why but it did make for trouble then the heaven cent had brought electra to dolph she had to marry him or die so dolph agreed to be be trothed to her too that had happened at about the time dolph discovered that nada was five years older than he so it might have been an easy decision for him to make but in the end he had realized that he loved nada so that betrothal had remained thus their quandary they all knew that dolph had to choose between the two girls before he came of age if he chose nada he would honor his word to the naga folk and as a prince he was bound to keep his word but elec tra would die none of them wanted that three years had passed while electra used her talent to charge the heaven cent the three girls had become fast friends so they accepted the situation as it was un resolved electra loved dolph and dolph loved nada nada didnt love dolph and dolph didnt love electra how was this picklement to be settled no one knew but it remained a favorite topic for conjecture fortunately it would be several more years before dolph came of age so the matter wasnt pressing yet man from mundania didnt you know a boy once electra asked she had been born more than eight hundred years before maybe closer to nine hundredand had slept through all those centuries until dolph kissed her awake so her phys ical age was fifteen and she looked twelve indeed she was still a child in all the ways that counted except for the spell that made her love dolph but because of that spell she understood something of love and had a lively curiosity about it yes ivy said remembering i knew hugo the good magicians son he was five years older than me the right way around nada said they all knew that a boy could love a girl who was five years younger but a girl could not love a boy five years younger that was nadas plight she could marry dolph when the time came but couldnt love him oh electra said understanding so when the good magician disappeared so did his son yes hugo wasnt much but he was nice and he could conjure fruit only he usually conjured rotten fruit rotten fruit electra exclaimed laughing she plucked a cherry from her pie and tossed it at ivy have some rotten fruit oh so thats the way it is ivy cried with mock out rage she plucked a fragment of peach from her own pie and threw it at electra have a peach of pie yourself but electra childishly canny ducked and the piece hit nada oho nada said her pie was lemon meringue but there were no lemon pieces to throw so she threw me ringue instead in a moment they were engrossed in their very most favorite sport a food fight for some obscure reason this was frowned on at the castle so this was a golden oppor tunity when stanley returned all three were thoroughly spattered the dragon offered to lick them clean but at the first lick electra dissolved into titillations of ticklish ness and that set them all off in helpless laughter fortunately there was a hot spring nearby the three plunged inonly to indulge in a fury of splashfighting man from mundania with piercing screams while stanley prowled in a circle around them ready to help steam them clean if it hadnt been for him every predator in the region would have been there attracted by the delicious sounds of shrieking nymphs it was fun being girls they camped for the night in a nest of pillows within the circle formed by stanley who curled around and caught his tail in his mouth ivy had told him the story of uro borus the giant serpent who circled the mundane world and grasped its own tail and stanley liked the notion so now he slept that way himself he was long but really not that long he could not hope to circle the world it didnt matter because he was only doing it for the feel of it meanwhile they were quite safe which was the point when they got tired of walking they took turns riding on stanley it was an art to remain perched while he whomped along but they had had time to practice it first the rider would be low then riding high then low again wheee electra took special joy in this not ashamed to yield to her juvenile impulses ivy and nada being more mature were obliged to pretend that it really wasnt all that special as they approached cornpewters cave they paused for a consultation should we try to hide our identities from him ivy asked compewter was really an it but it was easier to ascribe masculine evil so they called it he hell never be fooled nada said hell know we didnt come here just to giggle but maybe if we can hide our talents nada shrugged we can try but i dont think it will work he certainly knows about ivy unless hes overconfident so doesnt check and ivys eyes flicked meaningfully toward electra nada nodded when i change form try to escape distracting him now electra nodded gotcha man from mundania all else is bluff ivy said maybe well pull it off without violence maybe nada agreed seeming less confident stanley you go hide in the jungle ivy said after the invisible giant passes sneak up and follow us but dont let yourself be seen that machine in there is devi ous and we may need to be rescued if things go wrong stanley nodded he was only a dragon but in ivys presence his ferocity and intelligence were enhanced and he understood her perfectly he ceased whomping and slithered into the brush beside the path in a moment his sinuous green body merged with the foliage and disap peared he would be watching they looked on chatting innocently in the way girls had when innocence was the last thing on their minds the ground shook theres the invisible giant right on cue ivy remarked get ready to spook the ground shook again they paused gazing wildly around whats that electra cried her hair flaring slightly she was very good at spooking there was another shake its the invisible giant ivy cried in seeming horror eeeeeeek nada and electra screamed in perfect unison run ivy cried the three broke into a run right toward the cave that was the way compewter set it up first travelers got onto the dtour then they were herded by the invisible giant until they took refuge in the cavewhere they were trapped by compewter they were walking into it deliberately this time just before the slowmoving giant came into sight as it were they reached the cave and plunged in it was dark but in a moment a light showed deeper inside so of course they went toward it soon they were in compewters main chamber there he was an odd collection of wires and colored metalware with a big glassy screen sitting up in the center words appeared on this screen written in light g eetwgs girls man from mundania the three tittered uncertainly ivy put her finger to her mouth as if nervous which really was not much of an exaggeration what is that she asked staring at the screen l am compewter your host the screen said to what do i owe the honor of this visit princess ivy so much for secrecy ivy decided to get right on with it i have come for the magic mirror you stole from cas tle roogna i stole no mirror the screen printed angrily i won it you stole it ivy retorted and i want it back did not the screen replied did too did not ivy realized that compewter who was of the techno logical persuasion could continue this argument forever machines were like golems it didnt bother them to repeat things indefinitely ivy being just about grownup except for the matter of a boyfriend could no longer indulge in such activity it wasnt dignified you lured a traveler here who was using the mirror with my fathers permission and you only let him go be cause he left the mirror ivy said stoutly correct i played a game with him and won the mirror is mine the mirror is not yours she snapped it wasnt his to give away he had borrowed it and he was going to return it when he finished his mission so you stole it and you have to give it back i won it and i dont have to return it yes you do ivy said or else or else what or else my father king dor will have to do some thing your father does not know you are here this machine was entirely too clever well then will have to do something do what vvi teiw to a a ybhtoe bask fcy fasl w kfj crook man from mundania but a princess is not a crook ill make an exception then i will have to hold you captive ivy delivered a haughty stare are you threatening me you crock yes so much for bluffing then its war it always was war then she said boldly where do you have the mirror why do you want it why should i tell you that why should i tell you where it is oh you mean youll tell me where it is if i tell you why i want it of course i need it to take with me when i use the heaven cent the screen blinked this news had evidently taken the machine aback then the words appeared the mirror is in the cabinet by the back exit ivy looked toward the rear of the cave there was a cabinet she knew the machine could not tell an untruth but it could tell a partial truth is the cabinet locked no there must be some reason i cant get it even if i beat you there is no reason i dont believe it go to the cabinet take the mirror youre giving it to me she asked incredulously no i am merely evincing my good faith you may hold the mirror it does not matter because if i make you captive the mirror remains captive too ivy walked to the cabinet she pulled open its top drawer there was the magic mirror she picked it up maybe its the wrong mirror nada exclaimed maybe it only looks like the one you want test it the machine printed imperturbably show me my brother ivy told the mirror man from mundania n prince dolph appeared in the mirror he was sitting quite still that was suspicious show me the larger context she said the image of dolph shrank as the scope of the scene increased now the image showed the boy sitting on ivys bed watching the magic tapestry that little stink hom ivy exclaimed he sneaked into my room to watch the tapestry that figures nada said he does like it ivy nodded almost as well as he likes you she agreed the mirror was genuine all right pewter ivy said now it starts im walking out of herewith the mir ror she started walking toward the front of the cave princess ivy changes her mind the screen printed well maybe not with the mirror she said ivy nada cried dont let him rewrite the script ivy glared at the screen so youre doing it pewter she said severely well it wont work im not changing my mind she resumed walking princess ivy sees a big hairy spider on the floor there was the spider right in front of her eeeeek she screeched horrified dont fall for that nada called its illusion but its a big hairy illusion ivy replied just walk through it ivy realized that she would have to do just that she took a nervous step toward the spider the spider reared up on six of its hairy legs and hissed ivy skipped back affrighted again this is ridiculous nada said ill take care of that spider for the naga had no fear of spiders they ate them nada encounters her worst horror the screen printed the spider converted into a manhigh mound of cake covered with ice cream covered with chocolate fudge with whipped cream topping oh ugh nada exclaimed retreating you hate cake electra asked amazed man from mundania when i traveled with dolph we came to an isleone of the keysmade of cake and icing and all we ate until we got sick ever since i cant stand the stuff my stom ach turns at the very notion well mine doesnt electra said let me at it electra encounters her worst horror the cake reshaped into an open coffin the interior was plush and there was a coverlet and pillow inside it looked quite comfortable electras eyes went round with horror no no i dont want to go back to sleep there she cried retreating for she had slept for a thousand years minus time on for good behavior in just such a coffin having fallen in as victim of a curse by magician murphy if she ever went back to it she would slumber the rest of the sentence then die in her sleep she backed away until she almost banged into the big screen which was exactly where ivy wanted her i think weve had enough of this she said firmly im not going to let that hairy spider stop me this time nada right nada abruptly changed form becoming a snake if the spider reappeared she would snap it up nada encountersthe screen began but at that point electra responding to their agreed signal slapped her hand down on top of the screen and delivered a tremendous jolt of electric current that was her talent of course and it was formidable in the right situation the screen nickered writeerror it flashed then gibberish symbols raced across it then more words in terrupts off then nothing it faded out entirely come on lets get out of here before he recovers ivy said she hurried across the cave nothing opposed her the illusions that had been the spider cake and coffin were gone electras shock had thrown cornpewter into confusion and he would have to put all his circuits in order before he could resume revising reality they ran out nada resuming human form there was stanley in the entrance tunnel steaming had their elec tric magic ploy failed the dragon would have fired a jet r man from mundania of hot steam at the screen and that probably would have done the job they had come prepared they rushed out into daylight while stanley guarded their rear if compewter recovered too soon and started printing barriers to their escape the dragon would use his head of steam after all the day remained clear but there was now a horrible smell as of a hundred fat men sweating in unison electra was childishly fleet on her feet she led the wayand suddenly stopped ooof she grunted and sat down gasping ivy was next lectra whats the matter electra still struggling for breath pointed ahead but there was nothing there the odor must have choked her nada said coming up did a sphinx die nearby ivy stepped forwardand banged into an invisible col umn then from above came a sound aoooga the invisible giant ivy exclaimed hes standing here because he doesnt know what to do now that com pewters on the blink nada said but we can help him she tilted her head back hey giant she called go take a bath baaath the huge voice came back go jump in the lake ivy called helpfully the monstrous invisible legs moved the ground quaked with each footfall in a moment a patch of trees to the side was flattened then another patch in the shape of a tre mendous footprint then there was a truly phenomenal splash in the nearby lake movebefore everything floods ivy cried helping electra to her feet the girl wasnt hurt she had just had the breath knocked out of her they ran on down the pathand indeed a wash of wa ter was coming and drops spattered down around them like rain stanley whomped after them catching up they had made their escapeand ivy had the mirror man from mundania man from mundania there was whatfor to pay when they returned of course but ivy was used to that she had gotten into mischief all her cute life she had recovered the magic mirror and that went far to stifle her mothers sharp tongue anyway dolph had been watching their little adventure on the tap estry and would have warned king dor had things gone really bad still ivy was bothered by one aspect of it it seemed to her that their escape had been too easy sober later reflection suggested that surely compewter had known of electras talent and could have insulated himself against it why hadnt he done so had he been careless just this once it had seemed so at the time but in retrospect this seemed less likely it was almost as if the machine had wanted to give back the mirror but that didnt seem to make sense compewter never did anything for anybody voluntarily unless he stood to gain a lot more than he lost what could he gain from giving up the valuable mirror well the deed was done and she had the mirror now she had confidence to use the heaven cent for now that electra had charged it the cent was ready for useand they had always known that it would be used to complete the quest dolph had started to find good magician hum frey who had disappeared seven years ago with his family leaving his castle empty he had to be found for unan swered questions were piling up xanth needed him prince dolph could not use the cent their parents had been quite firm on that prince dolph had gotten himself betrothed to two girls at once and he had to stay and face the medicine he had to choose between them get unbe trothed to one and marry the other when he came of age until he settled that mess queen irene called it a situ ation but a mess was what it was everybody knew that he was not going anywhere so ivy was going to use it the magic of the cent was that it took whoever invoked it to wherever or whatever or whenever or whoever needed that person the most there was no certainty that good magician humfrey needed ivy the most but his message to dolph had named the heaven cent if the good magician thought it would help him then surely it would for humfrey was the magician of information and knew everything so ivy expected to find him wherever he was and expected to be the right person for the job magic had a way of working out with her yet she was not deep deep down inside quite sure for one thing there was magician murphys curse ma gician murphy had lived eight or nine hundred years be fore and his talent had been to make anything that could go wrong go wrong he had cursed the folk of electras time and as a result electra had been caught up in the spell and dolph had wound up betrothed to two girls in stead of one eight hundred years and murphys curse had been potent so how could she be sure it was not still operating that it would somehow mess up her mission and make things even worse than before and get her lost as well as the good magician the answer was she could not be sure maybe magi cian humfrey had known bestbut maybe he had forgot ten about that ancient curse there was only one way to find out for sureand that made her nervous but she did not express these doubts to anyone else for that might make it seem that she wanted to renege on her agreement to use the heaven cent she certainly wasnt going to do that the good magician had to be found dolph had done his part and now it was her turn the day soon came the heaven cent was fully charged and ready electra said so and electra knew she had been trained in this by the sorceress tapis who had woven the great historical tapestry that now hung in ivys room in deed the first cent she had crafted had worked marvel ously well bringing electra herself here to the present just when they needed another heaven cent ivy had watched those old events more than once on the tapestry verifying everything that electra had told her not because she doubted the girl but because she was insatiably curious about oldtime adventure and romance and tragedy certainly her own life lacked any trace of such elements she was safe and dull here in castle man from mundania man from mundania roogna that might be another reason she wanted to go on this quest for the things she missed and she did want to go despite her secret misgivings where would the cent take her to the top of fabulous mount rushmost where the winged monsters gathered to the bottom of the deepest sea where the merfolk swam to the heart of the savagest jungle where things too aw ful to contemplate quivered in their foulness where was the good magician that was the mystery of the age and she could hardly wait to unravel it ivy made her farewells to all her friends and family members her father looked uncomfortable and her mother was stifling tears they all knew that ivy would not be hurt or even be in serious danger they had been able to verify this with incidental magic perhaps having private doubts similar to ivys but they had not been able to learn where she would go or how long she would be awayonly that she would return unharmed so it was an occasion of mixed feelings she said goodbye to her brother dolph and his two betrotheds nada and electra surely she would be back in time to see the resolution of that triangle nada gave her a sisterly embrace and then electra gave her the charged heaven cent the girl was chewing her lip as if wanting to say something perhaps about staying clear of curses ivy smiled with a reassurance she wished were genuine but she had one more farewell to make she went out and gave stanley steamer a final hug i think its time for you to go to the gap she said tearfully youre a big dragon now and i cant keep you forever but ill visit you after im done with this business stanley gave her face a careful lick after she enhanced the softness of his tongue she took the cent and held it before her it was the size of a large penny gleaming brightly its copper surface im bued with the magic of its nature all she had to do was invoke it she shivered remembering murphys curse once more but surely that could have no real force after all the evil magician had been confined to the brain corals storage pool ever since the time of king roogna how could his curse on the sorceress tapis affect ivy now it must have done all the damage it was going to which was plenty it was foolish to worry about it ivy stifled her foolishness i invoke you heaven cent she said firmly then it happened chapter mundania rey woke and looked at the computer sud denly he made a connection the computer was doing it then he thought no thats ridiculous a machine couldnt do anything like that well obviously it could but this was such a disreputable thing that it wouldnt he had cobbled it together from used components and gotten a friend who understood the guts of computing to make it work knowing it was far from stateoftheart but it did take care of his school papers sometimes weird messages showed on the screen like incompatible operating sys tem or nonstandard peripherals what else was new apparently his friend had set up something called cp dos that everyone else said was impossible he had put a directory on user that worked most of the time so he stayed with it and usually his papers came out pretty much the way he typed them in mediocre that was all the computer did or could do but then he thought some more and wasnt sure be cause there certainly seemed to be a connection it had started with that program and the vacant apartment and he sat up and held his head in his hands he was sure he could manage to come to a conclusion if he worked at it but after that date with salmonella he felt so sick and weak that even thinking was almost too much of an effort man from mundania still he was sure he was onto something if he could just work it out before the revelation fled grey had come here to the city apartment because his folks couldnt afford to board him at the college city col lege had to take any local resident who qualified and its tuition was taxsupported low so by renting this cheap room and living mostly on canned beans grey was able to squeak by he was not a great student and he had no idea what he might major in if he got that far but his father said that he was stuck in this mundane world and if he didnt make something of himself no one else would do it for him since a college education was the way to start making something of himself he was getting it or trying to he had thought life was dull now that he was taking freshman english he realized that he had greatly under estimated the case he was receiving a superlative edu cation in just how deadly dull education could be his grades were slipping slowly from c through c toward c and points south as his metaphorical hands lost their fingernail clutch on comprehension then he had received that program from vaporware limited the ad had been impressive having trouble in school let the worm enliven your life we promise ev erything indeed they did they promised to improve his grades and his social life at one stroke if anything was duller than his grades it was his social life so this really interested him the problem was that not only was grey strictly average in mind he was completely forgettable in body his drivers license listed his hair as haircolored and his eyes as neutral he excelled at no sports and had no clever repartee as a result girls found him pretty much invisible he knew it was foolish but sometimes he was no world beater on common sense either so he hocked his watch and sent off the money for the program then once the money was safely gone a classmate had told him what the term vaporware meant computer programs that were promised but never delivered he had been suckered again par for the course man from mundania man from mundania then the program had arrived suspecting it was merely a blank disk he had put it in his floppy disk drive in tending to read its directory but suddenly the thing was loading itself onto his cutrate hard disk then the screen came alive greetings master uh same to you what i am the worm a sending from one who has an interest in you i have enchanted your computer i am here to serve your needs ask me anything what was this none of his other programs operated this way uh your ad said you promised everything and would enliven my life true name the aspect of your life you wish en livened he hadnt even typed in his remark it was as if the thing had heard him uh social i mean no girl what girl do you wish amazing it really was responding to his spoken words thats the problem i really dont know any girls and choose from the list agenda alimony anorexia bezoar bulimia conniption agenda grey exclaimed realizing that the machine could go on listing forever how could he tell anything from a name anyway so the first one would do to test this odd programs bluff go to the apartment across the hall but that apartments empty grey protested no ones rented it in ages the screen rippled in a manner reminiscent of a shrug you can lead a horse to water it printed look ill show you grey said its not even locked because its empty he went to his door opened it stepped across the hall and opened the facing door a girl stood just inside the apartment she was rather pretty with her brown hair tied back with a neat ribbon and every button in place ohare you the superinten dent she asked the stove doesnt seem to grey swallowed his surprise he had had no idea that anyone was moving in uh theres a switch in back thatill show youim not the superintendent just the boy next doori mean he stifled his confusion and walked to the stove and pushed the switch now itll work they just didnt want it going on by accident oh thank you she exclaimed you are so helpful whats your name uh grey grey murphy ii go to city college and oh how nice im going there too im agenda he goggled at her agenda agenda andrews how nice to find a friend so soon a friend he was still bemused by the coincidence of names he had just chosen that one from the worms list arent you she asked looking cutely troubled uh oh of course the friendliest i just why dont we have lunch together im sure you know all the best local places there was another pitfall uh sure but dutch of course i wouldnt presume to impose it remained awkward he was broke until his weekly check arrived from home i uh on second thought lets eat in she said brightly i happen to have some things with me uh ive got half a can of beans no need she bustled to the kitchen cupboard which it seemed she had already stocked what would you like i have asparagus bread corn doughnuts eggplant fish uh doughnuts are fine she had her shelf organized alphabetically so it was that they had a nice meal of doughnuts before he knew it he had a girlfriend and she had his whole life organized just about it was great for a few days but then it got on his nerves agenda did everything by the number or rather by the alphabet but grey was a dis organized kind of guy he didnt like having his life run by the clock and book it was also apparent that agendas arrangements were progressive first they had an informal meal together then man from mundania they had a formal one then they went on a date a grated movie where they held hands then they kissed then she set an appointment for him to meet her parents he realized that he was on a wellorganized treadmill to marriage and a completely mundane life he liked agenda but he wasnt ready to make that commitment yet he was trying to break the mundane traces and that would be impossible with her damn he muttered under his breath you have a problem the computer screen inquired the machine was always on now the first time he tried to turn it off after installing the worm program the screen had protested with such logic that he had backed off and left it on grey was barely average in gumption too it seemed well yes he confessed ive got this girlfriend and shes nice but shes so organized i cant stand it and now you wish to have a different girl well i hate to say it but choose alimony anorexia bezoar bulimia ca thartic conniption anorexia he cut in he knew better than to take up with a girl called alimony of course the name might not mean anything but why takes chances anorexia sounded like a good name go to the apartment across the hall but thats where agenda is he protested if i go there i just know shell have things so organized that ill never get away you can lead a horse to water grey sighed hed just have to show the machine he opened his door and crossed the hall he knocked on the door it opened there stood a strange thin girl uh grey said amazed you dont think im too fat do you the girl inquired anxiously im on a diet but uh no youre fine uh i thought agenda man from mundania she moved out this morning she said this place was too disorganized or something im anorexia nervosa moved out this morning he had never suspected what a coincidence im grey uh you dont believe in orga nization oh no im very disorganized no discipline at all i keep getting fat you dont think grey took a solid look at her she was coat hanger thin if you were any thinner youd look like a boy he said she laughed nervously oh youre just saying that im so fat i hate it i thought if i lived alone maybe i could reduce and look pretty as it turned out this was no innocent ploy anorexia truly believed she was fat and continually dieted to make herself thinner it was awkward eating with her because she barely pecked at her food leaving most of it on the plate though she looked as if she were starving he tried to reassure her but she simply would not believe she was thin enough im afraid shes going to keel over any moment from hunger grey exclaimed in the privacy of his apartment then theyll think that im somehow to blame you wish a different girl i guess so choose alimony bezoar bulimia cathartic chlamydia conniption no no wait grey cried he had done a smidgeon of research in the interim because of his association with anorexia and so had a notion what to expect from bu limia bezoar conniption or cathartic dyslexia emetic emphysema enigma euphoria dyslexia he cried realizing that the computer would not stop until he made a choice go to the i know he opened his door crossed the hall and knocked sure enough a new girl was there she was a blueeyed blonde and looked neither fat nor thin oh you must be the nice young man across the hall she exclaimed anorexia told me man from mundania man from mundania uh yes uh you dont have any hangups about eat ing do you she blinked in cute surprise why no should i dyslexia seemed like the perfect girl then he discov ered that she couldnt read there was something wrong with her eyes or with her brain so that she saw things backwards or upside down she had managed to finesse her way through classes for she was bright enough and had good legs but it was a chore to get through a written homework assignment he had to read the material to her and correct her odd errors of writing this soon became tedious you have a problem there was the worm again i like her but the screen printed the list of names grey knew better than to choose emetic or euthanasia and wasnt sure about enigma so he chose euphoria euphoria was luscious her black hair swirled down around her cleavage like a living thing and her eyes were hypnotically intense she was extremely friendly too but very soon he discovered what she was into but i dont uh do the drug scene he protested try it youll like it she urged proffering a cigarette of strange design this stuff will send you to the moon and stars and you will float for eternity that was exactly what he was afraid of he fled you have a problem he tried one more time passing over melanoma mi asma treblinka and polyploidy in favor of one that sounded safe salmonella that turned out to be a mis take sal was a great cook but the food turned out to be contaminated now waking weak and bleary he had finally caught on worm youre doing it deliberately you are offering me only treacherous girls i am not worm that was only the installation all right already so ill call you sending now why are you finding me only girls who are trouble how could you say such a thing every one of them has something wrong with her if you cant do better than that i dont want any all thats happened has been a lot of heartache and my grades de scending to d lets give up on girls and concentrate on scholastics try one more girl no im through with women i want to make good grades and be something in the world try one more girl so it was that way he could not out argue the com puter it only repeated itself indefinitely all right one more girl and when that one messes up its grades choose no you dont all those names are pied i dont care about the name just find me a good girl one i can be with and agreed no tricks now or the deals off any little pretext and ill dump her you got that worm mean sending go to the apartment across the hall all right one more time because after all he did need a girl without one he would be reduced to having to do his homework which was a fate only half a smid geon this side of oblivion grumpily still in his rumpled pajamas though he saw by the bleary clock on the hall wall that it was nearly noon he knocked on the apartment door the door cracked open and a blue eye peered out youre not a monster are you she inquired grey had to smile well i do feel like one at the moment but as far as i know thats temporary who are you she opened the door wider reassured oh good a human person i was afraid that in this horror house it would be much worse im ivy im grey are you a normal girl now she laughed of course not im a princess man from mundania man from mundania well she had a sense of humor despite his best inten tion he liked her maybe the sending really was playing it straight this time ivy invited him in and they talked she seemed just as eager to know about him and his situation as he was to know about her soon he was telling her all about his dreary life which somehow seemed much less dull when she was listening ivy was an attractive girl about a year his junior with blue eyes and fair hair that sometimes reflected with a greenish tint evidently picking up what ever color was near her she had been frightened at first but now was relaxed and was a fun person to be with but there were some definitely odd things about her for one thing she seemed quite unfamiliar with this city or indeed this country perhaps even this world he had to show her how the stove worked and even how to open a can of peas what funny magic she exclaimed watching the electric can opener for it seemed that she believed in magic she claimed to be from a magic land called xanth spelled with an x where she was a princess and pies grew on trees so did shoes and pillows monsters roamed the jungles and she even had a pet dragon called stanley steamer she was obviously suffering delusions sending had mousetrapped him again but by the time he was sure of this it was too late he liked ivy too well to let her go she was a great girl apart from her dreamland since her delusion was harmless he decided to tolerate it but there were hurdles one came when she realized that he was not teasing her about his situation her face clouded with horror you mean this isnt a setting in the gourd this really is mundania that was a quaint way of putting it thats right mun dania no magic oh this is worse than i ever dreamed she ex claimed drear mundania she had that right his life had been about as drear as it could getuntil she came into it but what are you doing here if you didnt know you were coming he asked for the sake of compatibility he did not debate her xanth delusion he would find out where she really was from eventually the truth was he rather liked her dream realm it had a special quality of appeal pies growing on treesthat certainly sounded better than canned beans i used the heaven cent she explained matterof factly she lifted a common old style penny she wore on a chain around her neck it was supposed to take me where i was most needed which is where the good ma gician is lost but the curse must haveoh no he was catching on to the rules of her magic land you mean it would have taken you there but a curse made it go wrong so youre stuck where you shouldnt be yes she said tragically near tears oh how am i to get out of this theres no magic in mundania thats for sure yet somehow he wanted to help her to return to that magic land even though he knew it wasnt real her belief was so firm so touching oh grey youve got to help me get back to xanth she exclaimed what could he say ill dowhat i can she flung her arms around him and kissed him she was an expressive girl he knew she was suffering from a per vasive delusion and that sooner or later the authorities would pick her up and return her to whatever institution she had escaped from but he also knew that he liked her that made his dilemma worse grey did what he could he took ivy to the college library and looked up xanth it turned out to be a prefix xantho meaning yellow that connected to various terms ivy said that wasnt what she wanted the library was a loss then on the way back to the apartment building ivy spied something in a store window theres xanth she exclaimed pointing grey looked it was a paperback book on it was a star proclaiming a new xanth novel did ivy think she came from this book theres chex she continued chex man from mundania man from mundania the winged centaur shes actually four years younger than me but she seems older because her sires xap the hippogryph and monsters mature faster than human folk so she matured halfway faster than i did and shes married now and has a foal che and theres volney vole who cant say his esses only he thinks were the ones who have it wrong and this bookit really describes where you think youre from he demanded incredulously she faced him baffled where i think im from this bookits fantasy of course dont you believe me damn he had his foot in it now why hadnt he thought to avoid the issue i believeyou think youre from there he said carefully i am from xanth she retorted look in the book im in there i know but she was perilously close to tears grey wavered should he get the book and check but if she was in it what would it prove simply that she had read the book and made it the focus of her delusion be sides he remained broke uh im sure youre right he said i dont need to look in the book that was a half truth but it mollified her they contin ued walking back to the apartment building greys mind was seething with thoughts now he knew where ivy thought she was from but he didnt know whether to be relieved or alarmed it wasnt a land of her own inventionbut was it any better as a land someone else had invented the delusion was the same still it did offer some insight into her framework if he got the book and read it he would at least be able to relate to the things she did still he wished that she had a better notion of the dis tinction between fantasy and reality she was such a nice girl in other respects the perfect girl really and he could really like her a lot if only could like her a lot he already did which made it that much worse in the hallway she stopped this cant be mundania she exclaimed where else would it be he asked warily because we can understand each other she said ex citedly we speak the same language well sure but mundanes speak gibberish they cant be understood at all unless there is magic to translate what they say into real speech but you are perfectly intelligible i should hope so was this the beginning of a break through was she coming to terms with reality what language do they speak in xanth well its the language the human language i mean all human folk speak it just as all dragon folk speak dra gonese and all trees speak treetalk grundy golem can talk to any of them and my little brother dolph when he becomes one but the rest of us cant because our talents are different not that it matters much usually because all the partbreeds speak human too like the centaurs and harpies and naga and those are mostly whom we deal with but the mundanes are sort of crazy they speak all different languages and cant even understand each other a lot of the time its as if each group of them is a different animal species only in xanth do they speak the human language so this has to be an aspect of xanth you almost had me fooled just when he thought she was getting better she got worse but because he liked her and knew how sensitive she was to criticism he spoke cautiously how do you know that you arent speaking mundanian i mean that maybe this is mundania and you can speak our language when you really want to ivy considered then she shook her head no thats impossible ive never been to mundania so ive had no way to learn its language so this has to be an aspect of xanth what a relief but if this is xanth then everything ive known all my life is a delusion grey said hoping to shock her into some awareness of the problem i know she said sympathetically youre such a mgn from mundania man from mundania nice man i hate to have it be like this but you will have to face the truth sometime ill do my best to help you with it grey opened his mouth but closed it again baffled she had the situation reversed how was he ever going to get through to her let me think about it she said first ill figure out a way to convince you then we can go look for the good magician who must be somewhere near here then we can guide him home and the quest will finally be done she expected to convince him well maybe that was best after all when she realized that she couldnt con vince him maybe he would be able to convince her the next several days were indecisive greys check came and he paid his rent and bought more cans of beans and against his better judgment that copy of the xanth novel ivy had remarked on together with its sequel he stayed up late to read it though he knew he should either be doing his homework or sleeping it was a story of three unlikely travelers who sought to rid a valley of demons sure enough ivy was therebut she was only ten years old so it could hardly be the same girl he glanced at the sequel there ivy was fourteen well if this was about three years later she could be the same one this was the story of her little brothers quest for the missing good magician but first he had to finish reading the first novel he fell asleep over the book and dreamed of xanth he was hungry so instead of opening a can of beans he plucked a fresh pie from a pie tree suddenly he liked xanth very well for he was long since sick of beans he woke and wondered wouldnt it be nice if there really could be such a magic land no more beans no more freshman english no more bare cheap apartment just warmth and fun and free pies and ivy his eye saw the computer screen the computer was on but the screen was dark it dimmed itself after half an hour if left alone so as not to wear itself out on impulse he rose and went to it does xanth exist he asked it the screen brightened i thought youd never ask yes i mean as a real place not just something in a fantasy novel that depends this was interesting depends on what on whether you believe oh you mean it exists for ivy and not for me be cause she believes in it and i dont yes grey sighed so anything that anybody believes in exists for that person thats not much help tough are you sassing me you dumb machine i ought to turn you off do not do that the screen printed quickly but grey miffed reached out to push the onoff switch youll be sor then the screen went dark as he completed his motion it was done he had been foolish to leave it on so long he returned to his bed and went to sleep almost im mediately this time he dreamed of ivy whom he was coming to like very well indeed despite all logic in the morning he got up dressed and stepped out to knock on ivys door they had been having breakfasts to gether and other meals too because they got along so well apparently the first girl agenda had left a good deal of food on the shelves and ivy was using what remained of that whatever it was it was better than more beans ivy opened the door and smiled when she saw him gesturing him inside her hair was mussed but she seemed prettier than ever to him she was neither voluptuous in the manner of euphoria nor skinny in the manner of an orexia for his taste she was just right uh i was reading that xanth book last night he began as he stepped in it he broke off for she was staring at him europe tal cum giddiness she exclaimed man from mundania man from mundania what icon nut united states ewer tale grey gaped had she gone entirely crazy or was it a joke uh she looked at him comprehension coming yukon tundra stammer eater i cant understand you either he agreed then did a doubletake he had understood herin a way mafia theist monday error she exclaimed grey shook his head she had lost him again buttery cookie unstable yodel fourteen she demanded i dont knowi just dont know something happened and suddenly we cant communicate its almost as if a trans lator were turned off he did a second double take turned off could his computer have anything to do with this pardon me he said and hurried back to his room he turned on the computer it took a few seconds to warm up then the screen lighted ry it concluded he remembered it had been in the process of telling him hed be sorry is this your mischief sending he demanded i told you not to turn me off the mischief is yours thats compewter ivy exclaimed at the door you know this machine grey asked then youre talking my language again youre not talking gibberish anymore she agreed i can understand you again whats this about the computer he asked do you know about computers compewter is an evil conniving machine she said he rewrites reality to suit himself if youre in his clutches im not in anyones clutches then he reconsidered that chain of girls starting with agenda and ending with ivy her selfthe sending program had been responsible when he turned it off he could no longer talk with ivy obviously there was a connection wed better talk he said yes she agreed quickly but not here not while this thing is listening he said he reached to turn it off but hesitated they couldnt talk if they spoke gibberish to each other so he left the computer on and went to her room ob viously that wasnt beyond the machines range because its translation still worked but maybe it couldnt actually eavesdrop on what they were saying now im not sure where we are ivy said if this is mundania we shouldnt be able to understand each other and that happened for a while but magic doesnt work in mundania either and it takes magic to make mundane speech intelligible so if theres magic i have this funny program grey said it talks to me without my having to type inwell anyway i dont think its magic but program its a set of instructions for the computer its called sending and itwell that computer hasnt been the same since it does things it never did before couldnt do be fore and it seems well alive it uh wanted a girl friend and and it brought me she asked for a moment he feared she was offended but then she smiled it brought you he agreed but it was the heaven cent that brought me here maybe the computer knew you were coming maybe but compewter doesnt hesitate to rewrite events to his purpose are you sure the good magician isnt here this is mundania no magicians here but then he remembered sending and wasnt sure humfrey could be here but then he couldnt do magic he would look like a small gnomelike old man his wifes tall and she made motions with her hands statuesque and his son hugo my friend grey felt a shiver not pleasant your friend from childhood we were great companions but we were already growing apart and for the last seven years i havent man from mundania man from mundania seen him at all of course but im sure none of them are happy if theyre stuck in mundania so if they are here i havent seen any people like that but of course i dont know many people in the city either they are here and thats why the heaven cent brought me here and the magics working or they arent here and murphys curse sent me awry and its another picklement what kind of curse magician murphy made a curse a long time ago and we dont knew whether it sdll has effect but if it does it could have sent me to the wrong place and this could be mundania my name is murphy grey said my father is ma jor murphy and im grey murphy she stared at him with a peculiar intensity then she shook her head no it couldnt be magician murphy lived almost nine hundred years ago maybe murphys curse sent you to the nearest mur phy he said jokingly but she took it seriously yes that could be it could be the last gasp of the curse so its not coincidence but its not where i was supposed to go either i was supposed to go where i was most needed i thought you were supposed to go where the good magician was yes we assumed that was where i was most needed because of his message skeleton key to heaven cent grey said ivy jumped how did you know that i uh got that book it says oh of course the muse has them but someone sneaks them out to mundania every so often its a bad business but they cant seem to fix the leak anyway dolph found the skeleton keythat turned out to be grace ossein who i thought you read the book not that far i guess i fell asleep but i did leam how the good magician disappeared grace is a walking skeleton shes very nice oh like marrow bones yes so she was the skeleton key and she helped get the heaven cent so it seems natural that this was how the good magician wanted us to find him but if the curse diverted me to a murphy instead of to humfrey maybe the heaven cent worked properly only the good magician wasnt the one who needed you most her eyes widened what grey gulped i uh really needed someone like you i mean he faltered embarrassed but you dont believe in magic i wish i did he exclaimed fervently i wishi wish i could believe in whatever you believe in so i could be wherever you are and but he couldnt continue be cause he knew he was making even more of a fool of himself than usual you needed me ivy said musingly i guess id better go now you dont believe in xanth so you dont believe im a princess or that i have any magic she said but i do believe in you he cried desperately she gazed at him with a new expression appraisingly so it really doesnt make any difference to you whether im royal or common or magic or not i wish it did oh ivy i think youre such a wonderful girl if only it wasnt for thisthis delusion she concluded i didnt say that but its true that he could not deny he made a supremely awkward retreat to his room if only he could have found some way to express his feeling without messing up the computer screen lighted as he entered you have a problem stay out of this he snapped and struck the onoff switch viciously shutting it down then unable to con centrate on anything else he sat on the bed and resumed reading the novel man from mundania chapter signs i vy sat and thought for some time she had been so sure that this was an aspect of xanth perhaps a setting in the gourd and that grey was an accomplice in the de ception the only question was whether it was witting or unwitting he seemed so nice but of course that could be part of the challenge she had to figure out where she was so she could reach the good magician after all if this place was so devious that not even humfrey who knew everything could find his way out it surely would not be easy for her either so she knew that nothing might be as it seemed and she had to question everything something wanted her to believe this was mundania but that business about the language had given it away she had known it was really xanth then the language had stopped was this another trick to deceive her by patching up the prior oversight grey had seemed genuinely confusedbut again if he was set up to play a part he might really believe this was mun dania she had tested him by trying to use her talent to enhance him so that he would become more obviously whatever he was and show his real nature but there hadnt seemed to be any effect in fact her magic seemed inop erative even her magic mirror didnt work it just showed her reflection her hair so pale that no one would know it ј was supposed to have a green hue it would be easy to believe this really was mundania except for the language then she had seen compewter suddenly things had fallen into place obviously pewter couldnt operate in mundania because only magic animated him the strang est thing though was the fact that grey could turn pewter off that meant that grey had power over pewter and that was mindboggling then she had learned how grey saw itthat a magic disk had come in to animate pewterand realized that this might actually be mundania after all some bits of magic did operate in mundania such as rainbows and centaur amolde had been able to carry an aisle of magic there maybe that disk had come from xanth sent by com pewter and made the mundane machine turn magic then it had used its magic to enable ivy to talk clearly in mun dania or to make mundane speech intelligible to her or both when it had been shut off that had stopped and the full reality of drear mundania had manifested that seemed to make more sense than anything else but grey had not changed at all when the machine was off he was independent of it and seemed just as confused as she had been so maybe it was foolish but she believed that grey really was what he seemed to be a nice young man but there had been any number of nice men not all of them young who had played up to her in xanth she knew why because she was a princess any man would like to marry a princess even if she never got to be king of xanth so she had never trusted that she had wanted perhaps foolishly to be liked for herself alone not for her position or her sorceress magic or the power of her father thus her romantic life had been scant in sharp contrast to that of her little brother she liked nada so well that she had entertained more than a whimsical notion of pay ing a call on nadas big brother naldo who was surely a fine figure of a prince but if dolph married nada when he came of age it would not be expedient for her to marry nadas brother so she had not followed up on that now suddenly she had discovered that grey really did man from mundania man from mundania like her for herself because he thought her magic and her position were part of a delusion thus everything she had told him had counted against her in greys estimation yet he obviously liked her very well her mother irene had long since taught her the signals of male interest and deception her mother really did not quite trust men her dictum was never let a man get the upper handtheres no telling where he might put it ivy had known that from the time she was two and kept it in mind but poor grey obviously had no notion of upper hands he couldnt say anything to a girl without somehow bumbling it that was one of his endearing qualities now grey had beaten a confused retreat and she had to decide what to do if this really was mundania with no magic except for that compewter extension and the good magician wasnt here she would just have to extri cate herself from the foulup that magician murphys curse had made imagine getting sent to a murphy instead of humfrey she would have to find her way back to xanth with the heaven cent so that electra could recharge it and they could try again this time without the curse but how could she do that she knew the answer dolph had learned of a secret way into xanth that bypassed the usual barrier it went through the gourd it was in centaur isle or the mundane equivalent she just had to get there and go through but how could she get through mundania when she couldnt even speak its language for now she knew that the moment she left the vicinity of the local compewter the gibberish would resume she had no mundane money which she knew was necessary because here things did not grow on trees well she had the centbut she cer tainly wasnt going to use that for money she would have to have help that meant greyif he would do it well she would just have to ask him she stood adjusting her blouse and skirt this mun dane clothing wasnt as good as xanth clothing it chafed and wore but it had to do she was just lucky that agenda had been about her own size she went to the door and out and across and knocked on greys door in a moment he answered grey i need to ask you she began xbjuxfsfjoup hjccfsjti bhbjo he exclaimed turn ing away oh he must have turned off the pewter device again he would have to turn it on again before they could con verse even as she realized that she had a notion wait she said catching his arm for there was a point she wanted to make while pewter wasnt watching he paused xibu she smiled turning him gently around to face her squarely then she leaned forward and kissed him not hard she drew back he stood as if stunned zpvsf opu nbe bu nf he asked amazed its all right grey she said smiling then she in dicated pewter dazedly he walked to the machine and touched the but ton that turned him on in a moment the screen came to life if you persist in this foolishnessthe screen printed well you aggravated me grey retorted but now i need to talk to ivy of course grey made as if to return to her room but ivy held up a hand in negation its all right if pewter listens she said ill need to talk to him in a moment anyway naturally the screen said smugly she faced grey i believe i am in mundania she said i need to return to xanth will you help me but but you dont believe in xanth she said but would you believe if i showed you xanth you see i think i know how to get there but i need help if you will come with me and talk to people when i cant man from mundania man from mundania oh of course he agreed she faced the screen compewter you knew i was coming didnt you yes and you know where im from yes will you tell grey where im from yes uh you have to tell it grey said it takes things literally tell him she said princess ivy is from xanth grey stared you say that but how can a machine believe in fantasy when it is true you see we could have asked him all along ivy said pewter why am i here grey needs you most but what about good magician humfrey i know nothing of him so it was the curse she hadnt been sent to humfrey but to the mundane most in need of her company yet a mystery remained pewter why are you here she asked to facilitate your encounter but you dont care anything about me she protested irrelevant statement so pewter wasnt telling she wasnt surprised she con sidered herself lucky that he had cooperated to this extent she turned again to grey if you will help me i will show you xanth she said grey evidently remained bemused by pewters endorse ment of her origin he might not believe yet but at least he was having more trouble disbelieving that was prog ress of a sort ill uh help you if i can you will have to guide me to no name key to what a key south of florida the screen said helpfully but thats far away from here how hitchhike but my classes i cant skip choose ivy or freshman english grey was taken aback well if you put it that way you have virtually no aptitude for scholarship grey became suspicious you act as if you want me logo yes then my assignment will be completed ivy too was suspicious what is your assignment to get grey murphy into xanth grey shook his head i dont believe this your belief is irrelevant turn me off when you depart this is absolutely crazy grey exclaimed my com puter wants me to go into a delusion you understand ivy reminded him we wont be able to talk intelligibly to each other until we get to xanth i will have to keep my mouth shut in mundania but we cant go just like that my father look at it this way ivy said if we dont find xanth you can come back here in a few days and pewter will have to help you pass all your classes so your father doesnt find out and turn him off forever but if we do find xanth grey got his wits about him lets say for the sake of nonsensical argument that we find it and you go there where does that leave me alone again and far from home and in trouble when i get home youre welcome to come into xanth with me ivy said i thought that was understood but i assumed you wouldnt want to i uh if you go there i want to go there too even if it is crazy ivy smiled you might like iteven if it is crazy grey shrugged defeated when do we start now ivy said delighted now but now the screen said grey tried to marshal another protest but ivy smiled at him and he melted she had seen nada stifle dolph sim man from mundania ilarly it was nice to know that such magic worked even in mundania now grey agreed weakly they delayed only long enough to pack some clothes and food because neither grew on trees in drear mun dania then they set off hitchhiking turned out to be a special kind of magic a person put out one thumb and it caused the moving ob jects called cars to stop some of them anyway cars turned out to be hollow inside with comfortable seats and belts to hold the people down in case they bounced out each one had at least one person riding in it and seemed to go more or less where that person wanted but there were obstacles glowing lights hung above the car path and flashed bright red the moment any car approached then the driver muttered something under his breath that sounded villainous even in gibberish and fumed for half a minute before the light changed its mind and flashed green the driver would start up his cars round feet squealing only to be similarly caught by the next flashing red light ivy wished she could understand the purpose of this magic but suspected it would not make much sense even if she had been able to comprehend the dialect several car rides later night was falling as it did in mundania much the way it did in xanth apparently the sun feared darkness just as much here for it was nowhere to be seen as the night closed they stopped hitchhiking and ate some beans from greys can then looked for a place to spend the night grey was somewhat confused about this so ivy took over they were at the edge of a big villagecalled a town as she rememberedand sure enough there was a barn cvu xf dbou kvtu grey protested hanging back so she kissed him again and led him by the hand around to the back where she found a door inside was a loft filled with hay just as she had expected but instead of leaving the hay all nice and fluffy and loose the idiotic mundanes had somehow compacted it into cubes so it was all hard and bumpy but they were man from mundania able to scrape together wisps and make a serviceable bed she made him lie down then she lay down beside him and spread their jackets over them as blankets as well as more hay it was comfortable enough once grey realized what she was about he cooperated readily enough side by side they fell asleep next day they got up dusted off the hay and sneaked out of the barn unobserved ivy was hungry and knew grey was too but realized that it was better to get moving early than to pause for more beans what a relief it would be to get back to xanth where there was good food for the taking the cars zoomed by without stopping despite the magic of the thumb obviously even this limited spell was not reliable in mundania grey muttered something unintel ligible but she understood the gist the people in the magic vehicles were all in such a hurry that none could pause to do a favor for anyone else that seemed to be typical of this dull land then a pretty blue car slowed ppqt grey said seeming chagrined rather than pleased he tried to back away from the road but the blue car pulled to the side to intercept him there were two people inside dressed in blue with squashed flat caps and shiny copper buttons ivy recog nized the type demons she had seen them on the tap estry these were of the variety known as flatfeet who were devoted to interfering with travelers no wonder grey was alarmed but it was too late the platfoot on the right gestured to them ivy knew better than to try to run demons could always catch normal folk unless there was strong coun tering magic however she also knew that the hassling was usually harmless the demons liked to make people assume odd positions and to pat them all along their bod ies and ask embarrassing questions but after they had had their fun they generally moved on to other things xifsf zpv ijet hpjoh epou zopx jut jmmfhbm up ijudiijif mfut tff vpvs je the platfoot said gruffly man from mundania grey tried to explain in similar gibberish but of course the demons didnt listen they never did they made him take out his wallet which was a little flat folder containing various cards and the odd mundane money of which grey had very little they perused his cards and the nearer flatfoot frowned in his best demonic fashion apparently grey had passed inspection cvu uif hjsmtif mppit voefsbhf jbwf up difdl ifs upp the flatfoot turned to ivy and held out his fat hand palm up oh nowas he going to go into the patting routine she really wouldnt care for that grey turned to her holding up his wallet which the flatfoot had returned suddenly she realized that the de mon wanted to look at her walletand of course she didnt have one she had observed that the wallets of most mun dane women were much larger than those of the men and contained everything except kitchen sinks but she didnt have one of those either i dont have any she ex plained the demons eyes widened and ivy realized her mis take she had agreed with grey to keep silent to let him do the talking because what she said sounded almost hu morously garbled to mundanes they had compared notes after the first siege of garbling and laughed when she told him youre talking gibberish he had heard eu rope talcum giddiness and when she asked you cant understand me either it had come out yukon tundra stammer eater but the worst had been when she asked but why could i understand you before then and he had heard something like buttery cookie unstable yodel fourteen discussing that she had raided his meager re frigeratora box that was magically cold insideand found cookies and butter sure enough there had been five of them which crumbled when she tried to spread the hard butter on them and become fourteen frag ments they had laughed and laughed and there was the key to their relationship they got along well together laughing at the same things she had never had that ex perience with a man before only with nada and electra man from mundania but now the demon was gazing at her in annoyed won derdemons were good at such expressionsand she knew she was in trouble how could she explain that she was from xanth when the flatfeet would not believe in xanth but as grey had warned her if any mundanes thought she really believed in xanth they would assume she was crazy and that would be worse mischief so even if she could talk their language it wouldnt do much good what could she do she shut her mouth and spread her hands she had nothing to show them uibu epftju tift b svobxbz the flatfoot said his door swung open and he heaved his ponderous bulk out dpnfpoxfsfubljoh zpvjo he snapped grabbing ivy by the arm she looked at grey for guidance but he just looked back helplessly she understood the problem it was im possible to escape from demons so it was necessary to go along with them maybe it would be all right the two of them were put in the back of the flatfoots car which then caromed away down the road grey held her hand trying to provide comfort though it was evident that he had little control of the situation soon they arrived at the demons residence where male and female flatfoots abounded and there were many of the fierce blue cars with flashing lights on top what a fearsome place there was more talking then a matron demoness took ivy by the arm ivy hung back not wanting to be sepa rated from grey but he made a gesture that this was all right the matron took her to a small chamber where there were chairs and a table then she spoke gibberish in a questioning tone ivy merely spread her hands knowing better than to speak again then the matron brought out pictures men women children table chair careverything was in this collec tion it seemed she pointed to a picture of a man then brought her hand up to her forehead almost touching the hairline then she flattened her hand and brought it away from her head palm down nbo she said firmly what was she up to ivy kept her mouth shut man from mundania man from mundania the matron pointed to a picture of a woman she made a fist with her thumb up then flattened her hand as she had before and moved it out at the level of her cheek xpnbo ivy watched saying nothing the woman pointed to herself and made the second gesture again then she pointed to ivy and made it once more suddenly ivy caught on this gesture indicated a woman she lifted her own hand thumb up then flattened it imitating the gesture the matron smiled she pointed to the picture of the man ivy promptly made the higher gesture wfsz hppe the matron exclaimed pleased the significance of this was not lost on ivy this was a way to communicate that bypassed the spoken language with this she could talk to the mundanes though she hoped not to be in mundania much longer she realized that her inability to speak their peculiar language could prevent her from escaping it because the mundanes would think she was unable to speak or was crazy she needed to satisfy them that she was a normal person so that they would leave her aloneand here was the way to do it she dived into the signlanguage lesson with a ven geance she told herself that she was very smart at this kind of thing and therefore she was because though magic might not work very well here her power of enhancement still worked on herself she quickly mastered the signs for man woman girl and got into more general terms such as the one for going somewhere the two index fingers rotating around each other in the manner of a wheel rolling forward the ma tron was amazed and pleased it seemed she had never before had so apt a student there was a knock at the door panel and a flatfoot appeared the matron startled glanced at her wrist where a funny bracelet was the ornament had a round flat surface like that of a sundial and two little lines whose position changed magically because they never changed while ivy was looking but were always different when she looked away and then back at it then the matron spoke rapidly to the flatfoot who departed the matron faced ivy and made a gesture toward her mouth several times as if pushing something into it ivy was perplexed what did this mean too much talk rather than struggle with that ivy inquired about the bracelet the matron tapped the back of her wrist with a finger several times then made a funny fist and circled it across her other flat palm ivy shook her head she couldnt make sense of this the matron opened her picture book and pointed to a similar bracelet there with the word xbudi beneath it apparently it was just a special kind of deco ration then the flatfoot reappeared with a package the ma tron took it and opened it inside were several sandwiches and two of the funny mundane paper boxes of milk ivy made a lightning connection this was food the matron didnt need to make the handtomouth sign again it was obvious that it meant eat ivy was famished more time had passed than she had realized and she hadnt had breakfast anyway it was now around midday the matron gave ivy two sandwiches and one box of milk and took the others herself ivy quickly picked up the terms for egg salad sandwich and milkthe lat ter was most peculiar involving the squeezing of the two hands separately as if hauling on short ropes instead of the obvious plucking of a milkweed podand ate eagerly as the lesson continued now it was business the matron was questioning her using the signs they had established where is ivy going oops ivy understood the question well enough but how could she answer if she said xanth she would be deemed crazy but then she saw the way through ivy is going home the sign for home was like the one for eat and sleep because home was where a person usually ate and slept xanth was indeed home for ivy the matron nodded who is man she meant grey that was easy friend the sign con man from mundania sisted of hooking her right index finger over her left index finger then the left over the right making a double link age the rest was relatively easy it seemed that not only were the flatfoots worried that ivy was crazy they thought that grey might be mistreating her or that both of them were running away from their homes ivy had already re assured the matron that there was nothing wrong with her mind only her language and now reassured her that grey was helping her return home not run from it she also realized that they would have questioned grey similarly not having to use the hand signs and that he would have been smart enough to avoid any detail on xanth the de mons were only trying to help in their fashion satisfied the matron brought ivy back to the main chamber and spoke a torrent of gibberish to the demon in charge the demon made an i surrender gesture and waved to the back of the room grey appeared ivy ran to him and flung herself into his arms and hugged him closely what a relief to be with him again after being captive by the demons the demons allowed them to go in fact they even ar ranged for ivy and grey to get a ride in a big car one that held about fifty people in twin rows of chairs but ivy catching on to a good thing turned back to the matron and made signs to ask for the picture book of signs this was a way she could talk to grey in mundania too the matron who was remarkably nice for a demoness gave her the book and a smile the big car came and they climbed in and found two seats together near the rear then ivy opened the picture book and started teaching grey the signs the bus as it turned out to be called did not go directly to no name key in the confused mundane man ner it went instead to a huge village where they had to get off and go find another bus but the other bus wasnt there yet so they had to wait in the big crowded building for several hours that was really no problem there were toilet facilities of the mundane kindseparate ones for the man from mundania males and femalesand places where grey could buy them more sandwiches they used the extra time practicing signs grey was almost as quick as she had been to realize their usefulness if they learned all of these signs they would not need compewter to make the mundane gib berish intelligible a mundane man saw them practicing and approached embarrassed grey desisted but the man surprised them by using the signs himself you deaf he inquired touch ing his ear and then his mouth no ivy signed then she did a double take this man knew sign language it turned out that the man was deaf and had long ex perience in using the signs and in something termed lip reading that enabled him to understand the words spoken by others he was waiting for the same bus they were and had thought they were deaf like him his name was henry he was glad to give them practice in the signs for he could make them with marvelous finesse so rapidly that it was impossible for them to follow but with practice he assured them they too would be able to communicate like this so that it was almost as good as regular speech their bus was late but they hardly noticed they went right on practicing their dialogue becoming increasingly proficient though nowhere close to henrys proficiency when the bus came they took seats beside henry so they could keep practicing then their bus broke down they had to wait for three more hours for a relief bus to resume their journey it didnt matter the other passengers bored with the delay gradually joined in and henry became the teacher of a class it was evidently a game for some using signs in stead of gibberish but it was a game that several children took up with great enthusiasm and aptitude the new bus came and they all transferred to it and their journey resumed most of the mundanes lost interest in the class but a number stayed with it for the first time ivy was able to talk in a limited way directly with mun danes they turned out to be folk very like herself and man from mundania grey traveling to visit friends or family or to new types of work or just for the fun of it night closed and finally they returned to their padded chairs and rested and ivy slept it had been a long day but a good one she was glad now that the flatfoots had picked them up she had gained far more than she had lost if she had lost anything at all this sign talkit was making mundania far less frightening and she was no longer in as big a hurry to leave it of course she realized that only a few mundanes used the sign talk still it was a great discovery they came at last to the nearest large village to no name key here they had to change buses again they bid farewell to their newfound friends and went to the waiting room where they slept on benches until morning this was like trekking through the jungle in xanth it had its inconveniences but really wasnt bad when one got ac customed to it in the morning they rode a smaller bus down toward what in xanth would be centaur isle but here was a group of a squintillion or so islets they got off at no name key and walked to the region which dolph had described though the key was small it turned out to be a fair walk at length they came to an ornate gate this is it ivy signed where my brother was greys face was studiedly neutral she knew he still didnt believe in the reality of xanth and was wary of what they might encounter here but he had agreed to bring her here and he intended to see it through she understood that determination in him and liked it grey wasnt much of a believer but he was a decent person who kept rumbling along on whatever course seemed most nearly right to him we must go in she signed turn key is there grey walked to a box mounted beside the gate and pressed a button evidently this was a magic bell to signal those inside sure enough a voice sounded from nowhere speaking in gibberish grey responded tell him who i am ivy signed grey paused sure he signed back actually he used man from mundania the sign for agree touching his forehead and then aligning his two forefingers together because they didnt know the proper one but she understood well enough yes princess ivy of xanth there was no sign for xanth so she used home she actually signed prince me join home some adaptation was necessary until their vocabulary of signs expanded grey grimaced but evidently said it there was an abrupt silence from the box they waited nervously knowing that greys last statement had had an effectbut what kind then the words came again if you are of xanth speak now ivy jumped she understood compewter must be here i am princess ivy of xanth she said clearly my brother dolph was here three years ago he was nine years old you helped him now you must help me there was a pause with whom was prince dolph he was with nada naga his betrothed she is my age there was another pause describe nada ivy remembered ohshe was in the form of a snake because she couldnt keep her natural form here then the gate swung inward enter princess ivy they stepped in grey gaping it was obvious that he had never expected this to work turn key came down the path to meet them holding something in one hand he was a big fat older man just as dolph had described him only more so he spoke gib berish then from his hand came words for ivy what are you doing here in mundania princess ivy appar ently he had a box that could speak both languages the heaven cent sent me but it was a mistake ah so prince dolph found the heaven cent the box exclaimed after a pause for gibberish that grey evidently understood this did not seem to be the same as com pewter after all the box was a golem that translated the mans mundane speech that was a relief ivy did not trust compewter but why didnt he use it himself hes grounded until he decides which girl to marry man from mundania ivy said so i used it instead only magician murphys curse must have interfered because i got sent to grey murphy in mundania they entered turns house which was very nice with carpets on the floors and windows looking out on the key my understanding of such magic is limited turn said but i doubt that an eighthundredyearold curse could have such a farreaching effect certainly it would not con fuse a mundane murphy for the magician murphy or cause the heaven cent to go completely haywire there must be some better rationale for what occurred ivy remembered that dolph had mentioned the convo luted way that turn key expressed himself she put up with it anyway i have to get back to xanth so we can try again and i promised to show grey what xanth is like you see he doesnt believe in magic you told a complete mundane about xanth turn asked appalled its all right he doesnt believe it he will if you show it to him but i have to show him i dont want him thinking im crazy grey spoke gibberish in a moment the golem box translated im listening to all of this you know ill concede that you two know a strange language but you havent shown me any magic a skeptic turn said thats good if he returns to his home now there should be no problem no ivy said sharply i want him to see xanth turn gazed at her xanth is no place for mundanes you know that hed get eaten by the first dragon he en countered ill protect him ivy said i know my way around in xanth anyway i have the magic mirror so i can get right in touch with castle roogna you intend to take him all the way to castle roogna of course so he can meet why this brought her up short why man from mundania why would you want a man from mundania to meet your folks well if ihei mean she fumbled to a halt con fused because you like him turn asked well do you have any idea how your folks might react if grey looked perplexed what are you two talking about even in translation it sounds like nonsense ivy found herself beset by a storm of indecision turn had seen right through a notion she had not even known she had she knew very well what he was talking about and knew he was right she should send grey home to his college right now she looked at grey he was absolutely nondescript in appearance and abilities he was a nice personbut mun dania was not a good place for nice people he would have to go back to what he called freshman english and it would slowly grind his life into mud and if you take him in and he becomes a believer i will not feel free to let him pass this portal again turn warned we can not allow i know ivy said still youre a princess you can do as you like turn said gravely but you are young and impetuous and may bring incalculable mischief to others i know ivy repeated almost inaudibly turn shook his head grimly i wash my hands of it whats going on grey demanded via translation ivy took a deep breath grey ii like you and you helped me a lot and i promised to show you xanth but he assumed a look of understanding but of course you cant because it doesnt exist look ivy why dont you come back with me and that did it and i will show you xanth she con cluded only once you are in it you may not be allowed to leave so i really have to warn you grey shook his head tolerantly lets assume for the sake of argument that xanth exists and you take me into man from mundania it and i cant return what is there for me in mundania as you put it freshman english she said with a smile right a fate marginally worse than death so show me your xanth ill take my chances actually it would be sort of nice to be in a land like that where pies grow on trees and magic works he grimaced there i go again getting foolish the truth is i just want to be with you ivy i dont care where you go as long as i can be by your side he liked her as she liked him without doubt but he had no notion of what he was asking for and she was wrong to bring him into it probably she should send him back to his dull home but she knew she wasnt going to send us through turn she said both of us turn nodded having expected this i must warn you that the route is not direct you have to proceed through the gourdand that is different for each person the night stallion will know your identity so you wont be harmed but he does not like having solid folk trespass in the gourd so he wont help you either you will have to find your own way through and it might turn out to be a significant challenge ive been in the gourd before ivy said but never with a mundane companion she knew that changed the whole picture but she was committed well do it anyway just take us to the gourd turn sighed as you wish princess chapter mountain rey and ivy followed the fat man out to the rear garden this was a thoroughly fenced exotic jungle with pleasant byways and even by the sound of it a trick ling stream in the background then they came to a mon strous watermelonlike thing with a stem on one side and a hole in the other this was evidently the gourd they had mentioned that was the route to xanth he was sure there wasnt any more inside that gourd than pulp and seeds ivy faced him and made signs inside talk there was another translator box in there why not hold hand she continued gladly he took her hand ivy climbed into the hole and he climbed in right after her suddenly they were in a cave that seemed larger than the gourd itself ohthe gourd was merely a fakedup entrance to this new chamber clever this is merely an aspect of xanth ivy said it is where i thought i was before you thought you were in a big gourd he agreed then he realized that the language barrier was gone they were talking directly again no wait for the translation computer this was an improvement we dont have to hold hands now that were past the threshold she continued but stay very close to me man from mundania grey because the world of the gourd isnt like regular xanth it has funny rules and it can be pretty scary scary like an amusement park horror house im not worried the gourd is where the bad dreams are made she said then the night mares carry them to each sleeper who deserves them nothing here is really real but it can terrify almost anyone not really real was she coming to her senses and ad mitting that xanth was just a state of mind that she wasnt really a princess in a magical land but just a girl who liked to dream thanks for the warning he said also it is set for each person who enters it though usually thats not physical she continued thats why i entered first so that my presence would fix it you had to be in physical contact with me at the time otherwise it would have put you into a separate dream sequence and we might never have gotten together again that would have been bad he agreed she seemed to make so much sense she had really worked out this fantasy pretty thoroughly of course it was modeled on the xanth novels which she must have read a lot more carefully then he had now he wished he hadnt skimmed parts just remember nothing here is really going to hurt us as long as we keep to the proper path and dont spook but we may be terrified before we get through grey remembered one scene in xanth where a party had made a harrowing trip along the lost path where as sorted punnish things abounded and prince dolph had gotten lost in a modem airport the innocent xanth idea of horror if this horrorhouse setting was modeled on that he had little to worry about ill keep that in mind there was light ahead they proceeded toward it and soon the cave opened out into a breathtaking landscape it was a mountain projecting up from gloomy mists into the sunlight its curious outlines showing in starkest relief it was stepped vaguely like a pyramid with crude terraces set off by vertical drops and abrupt cave entries shining crystalline spires and a flying buttress or two at man from mundania the very top perched at what seemed a precarious angle was a turreted palace or castle so far and high it looked tiny the whole effect was of fairyland beauty and chal lenge beside him ivy was silent gazing as raptly as he at the mountain then she came to life i had hoped it wouldnt be this bold this soon she murmured grey walked forward to gain a better view of the fas cinating structure suddenly he stopped he had almost banged into a glass barrier then he looked again why its a picture he exclaimed just a picture of a fancy mountain we cant reach it i dont think thats the case ivy said this is the gourd remember where dreams are real we shall have to enter the picture enter the but he remembered that there had been just such a scene in one of the books so naturally she believed it okay you make the scene and ill follow yes she stepped forward and through the barrier grey gaped she was standing on the painted path that led down into the painted valley that contained the painted mountain she was inside the picture then he realized that it was an optical illusion there was an entry there or something he moved over to where she had stood then forward cautiously he put out a hand he touched the surface of the picture he passed his fingers along it the thing was definitely a painting done in slight relief he could feel the edge of the terraces and of each of the steps on the stone stairways circling the mountain no way to walk into that scene yet there was ivy part of the picture she had walked down the path a way perhaps assuming that he was right behind her and perspective made her look smaller was it really her he stroked her backside with a fingerand she jumped while grey stared the pictured ivy whirled around a mixed expression on her little face she was aliveyet painted he had felt the material of her skirt the firmness of her tiny bottom yet also the flatness of the painting man from mundania ivy was saying something but he could not hear her of course how could a figure in a painting speak then she started making signs grey she signed using the signs for white and black which they had agreed would be his name mix white with black and you got gray her name was green plant he made that sign an swering her suddenly they had a new use for the language of the deaf come here she signed can not he signed back hardly believing this how could she be part of a picture yet still alive and moving she walked back toward him growing rapidly larger as the perspective changed finally she was his own size standing in the foreground of the picture take my hand grey put forth his hand he set it against the painting beside her having learned caution about touching her im age directly she put her hand up to match his the texture of the painting changed under his fingers it became warm and yielding like flesh then his hand clasped hers their fingers interweaving she tugged and he fell forward he had the impression of stepping into water the surface tension crossing his body he blinked and tried to recover his balance then ivy was holding him steadying him dont worry grey youre in she said it was always nice being close to her but he was too distracted to enjoy it properly he disengaged and looked back there was the cave a picture mounted in a huge frame he looked forward there was the mountainlarger and sharper than before the air was cooler here and smelled slightly of ocean a sea breeze ruffed his hair and ivys tresses making the green flicker green he snapped back to look closely at her her hair had a definite green tint he took a hank between his fingers inspecting it blond and green my mothers hair is much darker green ivy said understanding because of her green thumb you know she has green hair and green panties and she turns other man from mundania women green with envy but im only a shadow of her so im less green green panties grey echoed ivys hand went to her mouth oh i shouldnt have told no man outside the family is supposed to know the color of her panties promise you wont tell i uh wont tell grey agreed numbly he had better concerns than anyones panties at the moment how could he be within the picture and the place he had come from converted to a picture he put out a hand to touch the painting behind he felt the rough texture of the painted stone of the cave wall i guess you believe in magic now ivy said a trifle smugly grey snapped out of it magic of course not ob viously this was a sophisticated illusion with some sort of curtain or forcescreen that gave the impression of paint whichever side of it was touched his mind interpreted that texture as whatever he saw beyond it the only mys tery was how ivy had gotten through that screen and how she had brought him through her hair color would be a function of special lighting he had seen more dramatic effects in magic shows oh well lets get on with the challenge challenge you know the night stallion has challenges set along all the routes in the gourd to keep strangers out i had to swim through a lake of castor oil once to get through ugh ugh he agreed and she flashed him a sweet smile that made it all worthwhile they walked on down the path toward the mountain the mist thinned as they approached and he saw that the mountain rose abruptly out of a plain so flat as to resemble the surface of a table it was fashioned of gray stone and was bare no trees or grass at all it loomed increasingly impressively being much larger than he had judged from the cave uh we have to climb this he asked of course thats the nature of the challenge im sure man from mundania to reach the castle at the top it looks just like castle roogna but of course it isnt because castle roognas in the jungle not atop a bare mountain and anyway this is the gourd probably theres a window from the castle to xanth proper but it wont be easy reaching the castle grey looked at the sheer dins of stone and tilted his head back to see the tiny castle far above he swallowed he wasnt acrophobic but unprotected heights made him nervous there were no guardrails on those narrow ledges uh whats the name of this uh challenge mount xanth but ivy was walking boldly onward he had to follow or let her risk it alone the name of the mountain hardly mattered they just had to climb it he hurried to catch up maybe the climb would not be as bad as it looked they came to the base it rose steeply from the ground with no apology the stone too sheer to scale without spe cial equipment the lowest ledge was out of reach yes its a challenge all right ivy said but maybe a passive one passive grey asked feeling stupid again rather than an active one whats the difference with a passive challenge she explained patiently you dont get chased by monsters oh lets keep it passive he agreed they walked around the base the circumference of the mountain did not seem great in fact far smaller than it should be to accommodate such a large castle at the di minishing top unless the castle was as small as perspec tive made it seem it would be a real irony if they got to the top and discovered a dollhouse castle there they came to a small bush growing right against the base maybe that plant conceals an entry grey said indeed the rock seemed less solid behind it smells like some kind of mint be careful ivy said it might be a a sharp stick poked out from the plant as grey leaned over it he jumped back just in time to avoid getting stabbed man from mundania spearmint ivy finished grey glanced at her but she seemed serious he picked up a pebble and flipped it at the plant another spear popped up and stabbed at the pebble with dismaying ac curacy spearmint he agreed they are dangerous to approach ivy explained un necessarily they attract birds and things with their smell and then they i get the picture springloaded spears nestled in an ordinary plant a trap fit for a jungle fighter and a pun fit for a crazy story writer he would have laughed had he found it funny they continued on around the mountain soon there was another plant and this one definitely masked a flight of steps that led to the first ledge the mint smell was strong again grey made a cautious approach and inspected the plant he saw no spears still he did not trust it he found another pebble and flipped it into the bush there was an explosion of dust it surrounded him in a cloud grey inhaledand started sneezing he scrambled back and away sneezing violently thaahthat s ah pepchew he exclaimed through his sneezing a peppermint ivy agreed i should have known grey sneezed himself out and found himself sitting on the ground panting his eyes watering his nose itching to trigger more of the same peppeppermint he wheezed in deep disgust a mint that peppered the intruder with ground pepper after a moment they went on as it didnt seem worth while to risk the sneezing they would do if they plowed through the guardian plant to get to the steps behind it they might sneeze themselves right off the ledge they came to a third plant once again the smell of mint was strong grey flipped a pebble at it and the mint responded with an aroma like minty incense thats all he asked not trusting it incense it must be a frankinmint plant ivy said they just make a nice smell for special occasions man from mundania mem from mundonia not frankincense he inquired suspecting another pun no those make a smell that gets people frankly an gry grey let that pass he had after all asked for it there was a cave entry behind the plant they decided to try it if it didnt lead quickly up to the ledge they would retreat and search for another inside was a circular staircase that corkscrewed right up to the ledge no challenge at all they emerged from an arch that turned out to be immediately below a ledgelet between major ledges ivy looked up at the ledgelet grandpa trent she exclaimed grey looked but saw nothing it was an empty place with a kind of canopy over it i see no man he said shortly she glanced at him startled you dont see king emeritus trent right i dont see him she faced the ledge he doesnt see you grandpa she paused then she said oh why dont we go up there and ill prove theres noth ing there grey suggested no need she said sadly he says he isnt really there its just an illusion to go with the enchanted moun tain there are a number of them but they will vacate the enchanted mountain now so as not to interfere with us was she coming to her senses so we can ignore it he said lets get on up to the top and be done with this yes she said a little tightly but they still had to decide which way to their left as they faced the mountain was a flight of steps leading to somewhere out of sight to their right the ledge continued more or less level around and also out of sight they decided to start with the level approach on the theory that it should be easier to explore quickly if it went nowhere they would return and try the more promising steps the ledge led to a narrow bridge over a big cave en trance the stone of the bridge was cracked the narrow ness was evidently because the rest had crumbled and fallen grey did not like this suppose it collapses under our weight she shrugged well fall but we cant actually be hurt the gourd doesnt hurt people physically it just frightens them besides when i set out to use the heaven cent they checked the auspices and said i would return unharmed so if we fall we just pick ourselves up and try again grey was not at all reassured he had no confidence in magical reassurances or in the beneficence of the gourd but he knew that his objections would not sway ivy whose belief defied logic still he made an effort to get through to her ivy maybe you will get home okay but i have no such guarantee because your magic experts didnt know i was coming and maybe the gourd wont hurt you because youre a princess of xanth but i am no such thing and it wont care about me so im worried about that bridge she considered briefly yes it is true mundanes can have trouble in xanth i will have to use my magic to protect you your magic he didnt like the sound of this much better well not exactly my magic i mean use the magic that protects me to protect you too that way youll be as safe as i am grey still was not much reassured he was afraid ivy would do something foolish and get them both hurt this might be a fancy amusement park setting but people could get hurt in them if they were careless he had pointed out to her how he might get hurt even within the framework of her belief but it was she he was really worried about she believed so firmly in her own safety that she could take foolish risks but how was he going to persuade her otherwise take my hand she said well cross the bridge together if you fall i fall too so well both be safe grey sighed he would just have to take the risk and try to shield her body with his own if they did fall man from mundania he took her hand and they started across the partial bridge it was just an arc of stone seeming all too fragile with the dark maw of the cave below it was so narrow that they had to turn and put their backs to the wall and sidestep across ivy leading oh ivy exclaimed falling backwards backwards he thought as he wrenched her toward him her back was to the wall then she was in his arms and he saw that the cave below extended up in a narrow window behind them the security of the wall was no security at all she had almost fallen into the cave but it had one good effect ivy decided that she didnt like the idea of falling even if her safety was guaranteed well have to be more careful she said grey said nothing happy to leave her with that attitude they tried again this time keeping both sides of the bridge in mind ivy faced outward and grey inward so each could see the hazards of one side and warn the other they sidled across the stone settled slightly and ground out some sand but did not collapse then they were across but if this was the lowest hazard when the ground was really not too far away what of the higher reaches when any fall would certainly be fatal grey liked this whole business less as he got into it there were steps beyond the bridge wide and solid they linked arms and marched up them side by side the ledge continued hugging the irregular curve of the mountain sometimes slanting up sometimes down sometimes having steps sometimes a ramp they made good progress soon they looked down and discovered they had made a complete circuit they were above the place where they had first gotten onto the ledge but they were still near the base of the mountain with more laps of the spiral above the day was passing and neither of them wanted to be caught out on the ledge by night so they hurried as fast as they safely could but it was cold in the upper reaches and the wind was man from mundania rising bits of the nether fog were breaking off and rising drifting ominously close to the mountain rats ivy swore i see practo what cumulo fracto nimbus the worst of clouds he is always up to mischief i dont know how he gets into the gourd but hes here he messed dolph up too when he was here an evil cloud but now he remembered there had been something about a nasty little cloud in the novels he found the notion of a bad cloud quaint still this was definitely the wrong time for a storm and one did seem to be brewing rain would make these sloping narrow ledges treacherous indeed fractos an ill wind all right she said angrily hes sure to try to blow us off the mountain maybe we can find a niche for shelter yes wed better she led the way on upand there almost immediately was another large opening in the wall it was a deep cave extending far back into the mountain curving out of sight it would do nicely for shelter if the storm got too bad they could simply retreat further into the cave and remain dry the storm blew up horrendously grey had to admit it did at times vaguely resemble a demonic face but it was definitely a cloud and clouds did swirl and rain there was nothing magical in that the rain slanted into the cave they moved back water coursed along the floor trying to wet them they found a rise and perched on that safe from wetting it got cold as the cloud blew frigid upper air down into the cave grey opened his jacket folded it around ivy and hugged her close for mutual warmth her greenish hair spread out like a scarf helping insulate them it was quite nice it was truly said it was an ill wind that blew nobody good delightfully embraced they fell asleep waiting out the storm by morning the storm had blown over and sunlight streamed down brightening the mountain they were man from munckmia man from mundania hungry but all they had to eat was one bean sandwich left over from their traveling ivy had expected to pluck pies from trees of course so hadnt been concerned grey more sensible had hung on to the sandwich and now it paid off they split it and though it was squashed and messy it was also delicious hunger was a marvelous tonic for the appetite they had occasion for the use of a bathroom but there was none here why was it grey wondered that in stories a man and woman could travel together for weeks in alien realms and never had such a need uh maybe theres a deep crack farther back in the cave he suggested very deep so ivy nodded well find it they moved cautiously back into the cave the light of day faded rapidly around the turn slowing them further then the passage divided grey checked one branch and ivy the other keeping in touch by calling his foot found a crevice he explored it with his toe it was about six inches across and too deep to fathom ivy i found it he called so did i she called back maybe its the same crack you use yours and ill use mine she suggested good idea this was like separate bathrooms it was a bit awkward in the dark but he managed there was a roar from deep below as of a monster who had just had a bad experience grey leaped away from the crevice then he headed back toward the front of the cave eager to return to daylight he knew it was just a recording intended to scare him but it was coming too close to suc ceeding he almost collided with ivy as the branches merged maybe that wasnt the best place after all she said grey didnt argue they hurried on out and into the blinding daylight letting the echoing roars fade behind there was no sign of the storm fracto had blown himself out steps resumed they moved on up and around circling the narrowing mountain a second time but just as they completed the loop the path ended they stopped dismayed the path did not exactly end it turned inward and angled up the mountain so steeply as to become a cliff until it disappeared into a circular open ing there was no way they could climb that slope but they could not go straight ahead it was a sheer drop to the next ledge below but we were never on that ledge grey protested how can we be above it when we never walked on it there must be more than one spiral up the moun tain ivy said but it looks like one i mean things are seldom exactly what they look like in xanth and less so in the gourd she said the entrance to that spiral could be masked in illusion or the mountain could change its configuration each day we may be on the same spiral we started on she was talking magic again grey let it pass we need to find a way down to that ledge see it goes on up and around the mountain it must be the right one well we could hold hands and jump down no he cried fearing that she was serious i mean lets not tempt fate or whatever it will be easier to walk back down than it was to climb up here besides which it might be cheating to jump she said challenges have to be met the right way or theyre no good well never get to the top if we do it wrong grey was happy to agree they reversed course and walked back the way they had come actually it wasnt much easier going down than it had been going up their knees werent toughened to it they trudged on as quickly as possible not wanting to have to spend another night on the slope for one thing the fa cilities at the castle at the top were surely better than those of the cave and without nether monsters they came back to that cave and now the ledge they wanted was above them but if it was part of a double spiral where was the lower loop of it grey saw no change in yesterdays mountainscape man from mundania man from mundania then he looked beyond the mountain uhoh ivy looked at him what look away from the mountain what do you see she looked why its changed she said surprised indeed the approach path from the original cave now a picture was gone they were in a broad green plain with thick grass and luxuriant trees there were mountains in the distanceconventional ones that had not been there before this mountain is the same he said but everything else is different i told you things could be strange in the gourd she reminded him grey strove to find a nonmagical explanation for this phenomenon maybe the rain last night made the dor mant vegetation of the plain grow and the different mountains ivy inquired snidely im still working on them they resumed their trek just beyond the cave they turned a comer and spied what they had missed the day before because of the distraction of the storm a flight of steps rising to the higher ledge the configuration of the mountain hadnt changed they just hadnt been paying at tention that was a relief to grey but the middle of this stairway was broken evidently a boulder or something had fallen here and smashed out a section they had no choice they had to scramble over the de bris grey led the way proceeding very carefully finding secure handholds and footholds the very jaggedness of it helped because sharp edges were easier to grasp than smooth planes he had to work his way up an almost ver tical section but got hold of the undamaged step above and managed to haul himself up then he lay on the step and reached down to help haul ivy up she was fairly athletic which was a quality he liked and made it up without too much trouble then they dusted themselves off and moved up the re maining steps to the upper ledge now the mystery unraveled this ledge actually began here it deadended below and proceeded on up it was as if it were the continuation of the ledge they had been on before but had gotten sheered away and set lower perhaps this had happened long ago and later someone had built the stairway to reach it and still later the boulder had smashed the stairs grey wondered just how old this mountain was they walked up the new ledge coming to the point above the cave they had spent the night in here there was a right angle in the ledge and in the rock below almost like the prow of a ship grey stopped abruptly he gazed out across the plain again sure enoughit had changed some more the grass and trees were different and the distant mountains had come closer this things a ship he exclaimed its sailing through the valley ivy considered yes i suppose it is i told you things are strange in the gourd that set him back he was arguing the case for magic there had to be some other explanation maybe the mists of the prior day had concealed most of the surrounding scenery and it appeared to change as those mists cleared lets get on up to the top he said gruffly they resumed their walk greys legs were tired and he knew ivy felt the same but the realization that they were back on track buoyed them both and they made good progress then the ledge became another bridge this time it was no partial thing it was a farranging span that narrowed alarmingly at the apex grey looked at it and quailed now all we need is a st ivy began with disgust dont say it it might come the last thing we want is aa youknowwhat he refused to say the word storm she smiled a trifle grimly i think your unbelief is wavering grey you are right it is not smart to speak the names of those you dont want to hear but even without that how are we going to cross i dont feel that steady on my feet man from mundania she spoke for them both it gets so narrowmaybe we can sit astride it there and sort of hump across hump across ive done it on schoolyard mounted logs he ex plained you sort of put your hands down and lift your body and bump forward you can move along pretty well when you get the hang of it if you lose your balance you just lock your legs around the log you cant fall really if you keep your head he sat down and demonstrated awkwardly on the flat surface how clever ivy exclaimed delighted lets go grey led the way again this wasnt because he was brave but because he just couldnt see making ivy take a risk he wouldnt take himself he pretended it was routine but the truth was he was tight with fear his hands were sweating and his jaw was clenched he hoped it didnt show he walked as far as he dared because that was the most efficient way to travel then he got down on hands and knees when the arch became too narrow for that he put his legs down and straddled the stone he put his hands behind and heaved humping his body forward it worked he kept doing it until the bridge peaked descended and widened he tried not to look down be cause that made him unpleasantly dizzy there was nothing down there except cruel stone far below when the stone became too wide he leaned forward until he lay on it then lifted his legs got to hands and knees and moved on it wasnt fan on the downslope but it was a relief to be there at last he reached the solid mountain again and turned there was ivy not far behind him she was not as nervous about falling as he because of her belief in magic but he remained nervous about her that was fan she exclaimed as she caught up to him but some of the green of her hair seemed to be on her face and he knew she had felt almost as queasy as he this climb was certainly a challenge they walked on up the path the mountain was com paratively slender here but high and the ledge was smaller they had to go single file this time ivy took the arlan front arhjndanja lead because he wanted to be in position to catch her if she slipped and started to fall the path was increasingly steep without steps and still lacked any kind of guardrail he would have been happier crawling up it but that would have been too slow night was closing in then out of the gloomy sky came figures in the air oopsy ivy said spying them wyvems probably they forage here picking off helpless climbers such as us grey asked trying to suppress dread he knew what wyverns were small winged firebreathing dragons of course he didnt believe in thembut cer tainly there was something ugly in the air and that was apt to be just as bad for them as a fantasy creature yes but dont worry ill use my talent to foil them but your talents enhancement wont that just make them even more formidable again he was trying to make her see reason without actually expressing his dis belief in her magic at some point they would have to have this outbut not way up here on this treacherously exposed path not necessarily ill show you the flying figures loomed closeand they did indeed look like dragons but of course such things could be mocked up and even be made to fly this was obviously a most intricately fashioned setting so such threats were feasible certainly those creatures whatever their true na ture could be dangerous he didnt see how enhancing them could help foil them assuming it could be done at all ivy stood facing the dragons she seemed to be concen trating the dragons approached even faster than before their beady eyes glinting plumes of smoke trailing from their nostrils the lead dragon oriented and accelerated flying di rectly toward them it jetted a column of fire grey started to scramble away not wanting to get friedbut ivy didnt move and he couldnt leave her behind so he forced him self to wait hoping that she did know what she was doing the jet of fire missed then the dragon looking sur prised missed also it shot right past them so close that man from mundania man from mundania they were buffeted by the hot breeze of its passing what had happened the second dragon winged in toward them it too missed with both fire and teeth seeming as amazed as grey was by this then the third one what happened grey asked i told you i enhanced them but i made them faster so they flew faster than usual and whipped their heads around faster and fired faster so their aim was off they cant score on us until they get adjusted to their new powersand they wont have them when theyre not attacking us grey worked it out he had driven a car once that was larger and more powerful than he was used to then he had come to a turn in the road and almost careened off the road because his reflexes were wrong he had made hasty adjustments knowing that he could quickly wreck himself if he didnt it could have been the same for the dragons it would require precise timing and coordination of vectors to score with fire while on the wing and if that timing was off there would be no score so what ivy said made sense assuming that she could really do what she claimed but that was magic lets get on before they recover ivy said good suggestion they walked up the path while the dragons reoriented when the dragons made their second strafing runs they misjudged the range again and gave up in disgust see i dont like to use my talent frivolously but for selfdefense its all right ivy said grey was just glad that the creatures had been pro grammed to miss the threat had seemed real enough and he could hardly wait to get off this mountain he would try to reason with ivy about the matter of the dragons at another time the path looped around the mountain again but the diameter of the mountain was now so small that the circuit did not take much time they walked up the last stretch to the castle itself crossing one final bridge the castle was after all full size no longer looking like a dollhouse they paused at the great wooden door and looked back from this height they could see far across the landscape it was definitely a riverscape they were sailing upriver toward distant lofty peaks that reflected red in the late sunlight grey shook his head he did not believe in magic of course but certainly this was a marvelous setting prob ably only this mountain was genuine the rest would be formed from some kind of projection on a surrounding screen as amusement parks went this was the best he had encountered it was too bad that it was too persuasive for some ivy would be a terrific girl if she only could rid herself of her belief in xanth ivy turned to him youve been great grey she said and quickly kissed him how he wished he could believe in xanth man from mundania chapter s river hey had finally reached the door to the castle ivy was much relieved she had been afraid that grey would panic and fall when the wyvems attacked she had even hesitated to explain in too much detail how she could nullify them because she did not want him to have to come to terms with the concept of magic while they were dangerously exposed suppose he spooked and fell off the ledge it was better to wait until things were more secure so now she merely kissed him and told him that he had been great indeed he had been considering that he did not believe in magic it must have taken real courage to carry on in the face of that doubt he should be a great guy once he got over his confusion and saw xanth for what it was she addressed the door hey door dont you know me the door didnt answer oopsshe had forgotten that her father king dor wasnt here it was his talent to speak to the inanimate and to have it answer in the human language he had resided so long in castle roogna that his magic had infused those parts of the castle that he used a lot thus she always talked to the castle door and it normally opened for her because it recognized her but this wasnt really castle roogna this was an imitation one a setting in the realm of bad dreams so her father wasnt here and his magic had not rubbed off uh doors dont know people grey said delicately you have to turn the knob ivy was getting tired of his patronizing attitude about magic so she decided to make a small demonstration she concentrated on the door enhancing its affinity to her fa ther it was an emulation of the real front door of castle roogna so there was a basis for this if she made it even more like the real door it would be able to respond in the manner of the original then she spoke to it again door if you dont open this instant ill kick your shin panel the door hastily swung open it was very satisfying to see greys gape then he recovered ohit wasnt locked must have been blown open by what wind ivy inquired sweetly the air was now quite still but grey merely shrugged the door might not be locked but his mind was it was most annoying they stepped in the entrance hall was empty of course ivy had seen many people and creatures she knew scattered around the enchanted mountain but rather than confuse things she had asked them to fade out since they were all ghosts they had obliged that way she had seen nothing that grey hadnt seen which made the climb eas ier the same was true here in the castle and it seemed better to leave it that way its empty grey said as if surprised it isnt the real castle she reminded him this is the dream realm with settings for all the bad dreams so there arent any folk here except when they come to make up a dream concerning castle roogna and then they arent real folk just the gourd actors he looked at her as if about to say something for her own good but managed to stifle it so where do we go from here wherever this sailing mountain takes us she replied we should keep watch and when it passes some region man from mundania i recognize we can get off and ill lead us home to the real castle roogna again that own good expression crossed his face but again it was displaced by not yet but if this is thethe realm of dreams you wont be able to reach the real uh xanth from here yes i willwhen i see a section of the gourd i rec ognize ive been through it before you know so if i see the sea of castor oil but she did not care to complete that thought the notion of diving into that awful stuff made her sick a sea of castor oil he asked blankly well maybe its just a lake of it you knowthe oil that leaks from castors those little wheels that move fur niture around they feed it to children to make them feel bad i remember he said making a face we get some thing similar from beans thats the stuff of bad dreams all right wouldnt you know itin mundania its the bad things that grow on trees she exclaimed on plants anyway he agreed wryly we have many horrendous plants nuclear munitions sewage so if i see that lake ill know where we are and then i can go the same route i used as a child to return directly to castle roogna theres a candy garden and a bug house and other awful stuff a candy garden is awful because of the temptation if you take even one lick of a lollypop youre stuck in the dream realm forever or worse i think im not quite sure but i dont care to gamble so well just have to stick to our own food until we get out of here we finished our last bean sandwich he reminded her actually if it had gotten any more battered and old it would have tasted like castor oil beans she grimaced well lets get a good nights sleep then hope that we can move on in the morning before we get too hungry man from mundania he smiled we may be hungry but theres not much temptation if theres no food ivy was getting increasingly annoyed by his superior attitude you want temptation ill show you tempta tion she led the way to the kitchen and flung open the door there was a fine array of cakes and pastries laid out with glasses of delicious drink on the side the heavenly smell was almost overwhelming there is food here grey exclaimed amazed he stepped in admiring it but strange too whats this thats a patti cake she explained i wont eat them unless im sitting down why because she explained patiently when you take a bite from such a cake you get patted he paused then resolutely continued his questioning whats so bad about that these are fresh cakes so they give pretty fresh pats so you have to protect any part of your body you dont want patted its worse with hot cross buns he pondered that then smiled then saw her frown and changed the subject whats this fizzing drink boot rear you had really better sit down for that grey looked pained and she realized that he had just bitten his tongue so as to stifle a laugh he was using mundane magic pain to stop mirth how about this one he asked indicating a glass of brown fluid mocolatechilk from mocolate choocows no doubt exactly he sighed youre right this is too tempting i want to gobble it down despite your ludicrous puns if you think its ludicrous she flared why dont you eat some then maybe i will he retorted he picked up the glass of chilk and brought it to his mouth no dont she cried flinging herself at him she pushed the glass away before he could drink from it man from mundania man from mundania uh okay he said disconcerted if you really feel that way when are you going to get it through your mundane head that this isnt mundania she demanded magic really does work here and you can get into horrible trou ble if you arent careful im sorry he said contritely with his thisisnot thetimetodisabuseher look are there any other things to watch out for no this should be safe as long as the setting isnt in use but maybe wed better check of course he followed her out of the kitchen she led him through the castle everything seemed to be in order it was dark and gloomy with the onset of night as was appropriate for a bad dream setting she was about to take him to one of the guest rooms where he could sleepshe would use her own room of course when she spied something odd this isnt right she said it looks like just another door grey said whats wrong with it there isnt any such door in the real castle roogna oh so its not a perfect replica maybe its a secret entrance for the spooks when they come to set up a bad dream yes thats probably it she agreed so wed better stay away from it theres no telling whats beyond it whats the harm in looking the same as in eating the food here we could be trapped in the setting he shrugged we seem to be trapped now unless we want to go back down the mountain and out the picture cave and back into the real world mundania isnt the real world she protested lets just say it is my real world and xanth is yours so he still refused to believe she hoped she would be able to convince him before he got into real trouble she showed him the guest room you sleep here she told him shortly ill be just down the hall in my room dont do anything foolish foolish like sneaking down to the kitchen in the night its better to go hungry until we get where were going okay no sneaking down to the kitchen he agreed but is it all right if i dream a little dream about you maybe she paused are you trying to pay me a compli ment he looked abashed uh i guess so you think im crazy to believe in magic but you still want to dream about me look im not being sarcastic he exclaimed im just not very good at impressing anyone i really like ivy felt two and a half emotions warring in her how would you like me if you learned i really was a princess of a magical realm i dont care what you are in what kind of realm i just think youre a great girl i wishi dont know what i wish there it was again he liked her only for herself be cause he didnt believe any of the rest of it was true what she had told him of her background was actually a liability by his perception because he thought it meant she was making it up she remained annoyed by his refusal to be lieve what she told him yet nattered by his evident sin cerity about the rest of it she was seeing him in his worst light she knew because of his confusionbut she did like what she saw grey really was a decent person well when they got into xanth proper she would show him magic he could not deny and then he would believe when she saw how well he adapted to that she would know how well she could afford to like him for there was one enormous barrier to any serious re lationship between them grey was mundane that meant that he had no magic when she had been trapped in mun dania he had been a great comfort and she had needed him to get back to xanth but now that they were on the verge of xanth the complexion of the matter was chang ing she could bring him there and show him xanths won man from mundania ders but she well knew that any serious relationship was proscribed the old rule that exiled anyone who lacked a magic talent had been thrown out by grandpa trent so grey could remain in xanth and indeed would probably have to because there might be no certain way back to his place in mundania but for a princess and sorceress to associate too closely with a notalent man no way that was one reason she had delayed using the magic mirror she had been busy of course just climbing the mountain and getting grey through but she could have paused long enough to bring out the mirror and contact her folks indeed they well might be watching her on the tapestry no the tapestry didnt reach into the dream realm she remembered now that increased her guilt so she knew she would have to get through before too long because queen irene would not brook too much foolish ness on the way but if she had brought out the mirror on the mountain and grey had seen it operate and realized that its magic really did work his whole philosophy might have been so severely shaken that he might have done something fool ish so she had waited until she could be alone now she was alone she brought out the mirror mother she murmured queen irenes face appeared in the mirror well its about time ivy she said severely have you any idea how we worried when you dropped off the tapestry why didnt you call in before ivy smiled seeing right through irenes severity i was in mundania as you surely realized mother i couldnt call the mirror was dead there but i came back as soon as i could and where are you calling from that cant be your own room behind you were in the gourd mother in a mock castle roogna it took us two days to climb the enchanted mountain and only now could i we who are you with ivy ivy could see that her mother was not in an understand ing mood a mundane he man from mundania you spent two days and one night on that infernal mountain with a mundane irene snapped have you any idea i needed his help to get to the gourd access ivy explained then he wanted to see xanth so im showing him there really wasnt much other way i could repay him for his help irene glanced closely at her obviously not does he realize that hell be a misfit in xanth and that theres little chance he will be able to return to his prior situation i tried to tell him but he doesnt believe in magic doesnt believe in incredulity and outrage rippled across irenes expressive face mundanes are like that ivy reminded her its been a bit awkward here in the gourd so i havent pushed it id like to get into xanth proper first irene sighed somewhat grimly you should never have brought him this far its like pulling a live fish from water and not throwing it back hes apt to be miserable i know ivy said sadly we shall arrange with the night stallion to move you out in the morning irene said bring the mundane out on the north turret then we cant leave him in the gourd ill bring him ivy agreed she felt so guilty know ing how awkward it would be for grey stuck in a land where practically every person except himself could do magic but it would have been worse leaving him in drear mundania from his description freshman english was just about as bad as the lake of castor oil she really hadnt had a good choice to make so she had gone with the lesser of evilsshe hoped good night dear irene said with motherly resig nation good night mother ivy replied with daughterly guilt the mirror became blank then showed her own face it was somewhat drawn embarrassed by her unwanted maturity she forced a sunny smile making herself look younger then she put the mirror away and got herself ready for man from mundania man from mundoma the night it took her some time to sleep despite the seem ing familiarity of her room she woke hungry as the morning sunlight beamed into her room her room was on the west side of the castle but it didnt matter this was the gourd and it followed its own rules probably the shipmountain had made a turn in the landscaperiver turning the castle around she got up washed and concentrated on her dress enhancing it into a fresher and cleaner state it was mundane clothing but here it was subject to her magic she stepped out and walked down the hall to greys room his door was closed so she knocked there was no answer she did not want to be late for the connection on the turret so she knocked again harder grey grey are you up still there was no response worried she opened the door the room was empty grey was not a heavy sleeper so he might have gotten up earlier and gone elsewhere in the castle not down to the kitchen because he had promised not to but oh no she breathed she hurried out and down the hall to the extra door she had forgotten to make him promise not to go there and if his curiosity had caused him to open it they could be in real trouble the door was closed had he opened it and gone through or had he left it alone she checked the rest of the castle just to make sure he was nowhere so he must have used that extra door damn she said using a villainous mundane curse there was no help for it she would have to go after him and right away she only hoped he hadnt gotten him self into more trouble than she could get him out of she packed her knapsack and put her hand to the knob the door opened immediately as she expected there was no sharp mountain drop beyond there was a lovely green landscape a rocky slope with bushes growing in clumps and trees in the distance a faint path led from the door over the nearest ridge she stepped forward so as to see beyond the portal that hid much of the view now she could see a wider section and there sitting on a rock was grey grey she called he looked up ivy dont close the too late the door slammed shut behind herand sud denly it and the portal vanished leaving her standing on the path that path went on down the slope beyond the region where the door had been and to a section of forest it was of course a magical portal similar to the pictures into which they had stepped only those who had the right magic could use that door from this side she had fallen into the trap exactly as grey had grey ran up to join her i was only going to look he exclaimed but i couldnt see much from the door so i just took one step and i know its a oneway door a what some doors like some paths are oneway you can go forward on them but not back they dont exist in that direction but thats nonsensical he protested no its magical he looked down the path evidently trying to see the vanished door oneway glass maybe he said you can see through it from one side but not the other if only i could get my hand on it he still refused to believe and his foolishness had got ten them both stranded here on a magic route so that they could not go to the turret on time and be transported di rectly to xanth proper you idiot she cried abruptly furious grey hung his head yeah i sort of knew that he agreed i shouldntve come through so i just sat and waited for you to find me only only i was an idiot too she said her anger cooling as quickly as it had developed well nothing for it ex cept to follow this path i thought maybe you would be able to my magic is enchancement not portal making but man from mundania man from mundania its not a complete disaster this path must go some where she realized that she could use the mirror to get back in contact with her mother but she was with grey again and preferred to wait maybe there would be some other way to reach xanth without having to make her error too obvious they followed the path up the slope and over the ndge it went down across a shallow indentation then over an other ridge then down into a small valley there masked by bushes and trees wound a small river they came to the river and stopped startled the water was bright red grey squatted and dipped his finger into it ouch its hot he exclaimed and thick like ivy took his finger and sniffed it blood she con cluded blood he agreed a river of hot blood yes but how can such a thing be i mean this is the realm of bad dreams she reminded him blood frightens most folk especially when it splatters this must be the source of the blood used in the most violent dreams but thats nonsensical magical horrible he said theres no bridge but the path continues beyond it she said how should we cross it grey looked around somehow i dont want to wade through it there must be something we can use to make a bridge or raft maybe theres a boat i mean the regular users of this path must have a way to cross they might jump ivy said or have a flyacross spell you never can tell grey grimaced still not believing in magic despite ev erything well since we cant jump that far and have no flying spell well have to make do with mundane efforts let me check along the bank they walked upstream the forest became thicker and there was a huge tree partway fallen across the river but no boat or raft grey eyed the tilting trunk wind must have taken that down but then it hung up in those trees on the other side looks about ready to fall the rest of the way yes ivy agreed nervous about walking under it if that huge trunk came down on them it would drive them right into the ground maybe we can make it drop he continued then we could walk across on it no trouble at all he walked to the base and pushed with his hands the tree was so firm it was rocklike then grey put up a foot and shoved ivy happened to glance at the top across the river and saw it wiggle you moved it she exclaimed but its still hung up its too well supported he walked around the base look theres a branch driven into the ground that must be holding it up while the top is hung up in the other trees if i knocked out that bottom one it would probably tear free and come right down right down on your head ivy said alarmed he looked up um yes maybe if i could pull on it with a rope if i had a rope he looked around but saw no rope some vines perhaps but there were no vines on the other hand if i got a pole and levered at the base but there was no pole either maybe theres something better downstream ivy suggested we could walk down and see grey nodded they walked downstream beyond the path that intersected it but the land only cleared offering nothing and soon the river flowed into a much larger river its blood diffusing in swirls through the clear water we might swim around it grey said no ivy said firmly see those colored fins sharks feeding on the blood loan sharks she agreed theyll take an arm and a leg if you let them but i suppose theyll settle for just blood if theres nothing better loan sharks he muttered looking as if he had chewed on a lemon man from mundania we could follow the path in the other direction ivy said down past where the castle was but she was afraid that even if they managed to return to the castle it would be too late for the rendezvous with her mother maybe it was time to use the mirror again even if that made for a problem with grey lets go back to the tilting tree he said there has to be a way to bring it down she was glad to agree because that would keep him occupied while she pondered what to do she was getting increasingly hungry now that alone would drive her to the mirror if they didnt make progress soon this setting was quite unfamiliar to her and she didnt know what direction was best the realm of dreams was odd to begin with and she did not enjoy being lost in it they reached the tree grey scouted around you know theres a pretty steep slope here he remarked and only brush this side there were a lot of big rocks in the field we walked through yes ivy agreed wondering what he was working up to if we could roll one down here to knock out that supporting branch yes ivy exclaimed seeing it they hurried up the slope soon they were back in the field there were several big rocks ranging from knee high to waisthigh this one seems about right grey said approaching the largest but thats way too big to lift without magic she pro tested and too big to move without a lever he agreed but see how its perched on the slope i think it will work with a little luck luck i thought you didnt believe in magic he smiled that kind i do let me see what i can do he walked across the slope and picked up a sharply pointed stone he had spied then he went back to the hungup tree yes its pretty good certainly worth a try man from mundania try what ivy asked baffled making a channel he said he squatted and began digging beside the supporting branch dont do that ivy protested youll bring the tree down on your head no this is only the end of the channel he was al ready moving away scraping the soft forest dirt into a cavity that was indeed lengthening into a channel you meanthe rock down here yes it should roll in the direction of least resistance it shouldnt take much of a channel to guide it by the time it gets here it should be rolling pretty fast why thats brilliant ivy exclaimed no only common sense he said pleased im not a brilliant guy you know that ivy thought about that as she searched for a sharp stone so that she could help grey didnt seem to think much of himself and indeed he was generally unimpressive but he didnt seem to fade much in the crunch he just keep plugging away at whatever he was doing and doing in creasingly well she liked that she would never have thought of rolling a rock down a channel to make a tree fall across a river they dug and scraped mounding dirt on either side of the channel and evening out any bumps so that the rock could roll smoothly when they reached the rock they deepened the channel undercutting the boulder the rock didnt move it extended down into the ground but grey kept working at it deepening the channel and maintaining its slope so that when the rock did move it would keep moving ivy fatigued and dirty straightened up and stood back maybe if we pushed now she said she wondered whether she should offer to enhance his strength for this but feared that he would take it the wrong way maybe he agreed they got on the other side of the boulder braced their backs against it and pushed with their legs it moved surprised they tumbled and scrambled out of the way man from mundania the boulder crunched down into the channel hesitated ponderously then decided to move on it rolled slowly and raggedly but determinedly they jumped to their feet and followed it down would it break out of the channel it seemed to be trying to as it rolled irregularly but never quite made it it gathered speed and plunged into the bit of forest just before the branch the rock veered to one side threatening to miss but the edge of it clipped the branch and the branch snapped with a loud crack the tree shud dered then slowly let itself down as the rock splashed into the river crunch the top crushed into the ground on the opposite side and wedged into place oh it worked it worked ivy cried dancing with joy then she grabbed grey hugged him and kissed him lets roll some more boulders he said dazedly she ran to fetch her knapsack lets get across weve used up half the day already grey climbed onto the trunk and followed her but in the middle directly over the river he paused staring down ive been thinking he said where does all this blood come from i told youits just a prop from the bad dreams ivy said it doesnt have to come from anywhere its she stopped herself before saying magic but it goes somewhere he pointed out it goes into the larger river and if it doesnt come from anywhere then we should have been able to walk upstream and get around it it just seems too much like a regular river to me maybe theres a blood spring farther up ivy said losing patience look grey this place doesnt follow normal rules as either you or i know them any more than dreams do its not worth worrying about i was thinking he continued doggedly that if it comes from anan animal a big animal that creature must really be hurting i think we should go check ivy opened her mouth to protest but the insidious logic of it began to get to her a big animal what an awful thought man from mundania very well she said wearily lets find out exactly where it comes from grey completed his crossing and climbed down beside her then they trekked upstream ivy hoped that greys conjecture was wrong but she couldnt discount it surely a big bucket of blood selfrestoring would have done the job as well as this river and why was the blood so hot temperature hardly mattered for bad dreams just appear ance also why was it out here in nowhere instead of more centrally located the river coursed interminably forcing them to climb over ridges and through thickets at one point there was a red waterfall of it and they had to find a way up the precipitous slope before they could rejoin it this was cer tainly farther than it needed to be for a dream prop then they reached what might be the source a hole in a bank they piled stones and brush against the bank so as to make a ramp to the top expecting to find a lake of blood beyond but there was none it was just a low hill ivy was relieved there was no animal after all the hill moved ivy screamed and looked for something to grab onto but all that offered was grey they stood frightened as the center of the hill swelled upward then it paused and slowly subsided and swelled again there was an odd wailing sound this hill is breathing grey exclaimed now ivy caught on this is aa giant with a hole in his side impossible grey said but he looked doubtful they walked along the length of the hill soon they verified it there was a monstrous head its face turned to the side breath howling in and out of its mouth this really was a living breathing giant and hes tied down ivy said pointing out cords that stretched across the outflung arms he cant help him self while he bleeds to death grey said appalled he might not believe in magic but he obviously accepted this giant we must help him man from mundania man from mundania yes we must ivy agreed but how hes so big and we have no tools or anything maybe we can ask him grey said ask him she exclaimed but he cant be con scious i think he is grey said he approached the huge head giant can you hear me the eyes blinked the mouth pursed hyesss the wind howled how may we help you the giants mouth pursed again this time the words were clearer magic bandage in pocket ivy looked sure enough there on the chest was a bulge and it was a pocket she knew that a magic bandage would stop the flow of blood from the giants wound because that was the way magic worked its here she called to grey the giant spoke again but firstname your reward grey was taken aback i dont want any reward here you lie bleeding to death just want to help you the giant was silent grey came across to join ivy and together they hauled the huge bandage out of the pocket what an irony grey exclaimed the bandage right here and he cant reach it himself not irony ivy said torture greys mouth opened and closed again he nodded the bandage was as big as the mattress of a bed but not as heavy they pulled it across the giants heaving chest and to his side they let it fall to the ground beyond then took turns dropping onto it as it cushioned their landings nicely they dragged it to the spouting wound now ivy saw that the blood jetted at high velocity from a relatively small hole no more than the size of a human head the bandage was certainly big enough to cover itif they could just get it on i hate to think of the hydraulic force of that flow grey said maybe thats the wrong term but certainly it will blow away the bandage before we can get it placed it is a magic bandage ivy reminded him i think well just have to try placing it and see what happens i dont want to depend on magic grey said ivy sighed inwardly she could postpone this issue no longer i think youll have to this one time you know we dont have a chance without it grey looked at the wound then at the bandage then at the wound again i suppose the technology that can make a setting like this can make a way to deal with it he said a force field or something or maybe the hydrant gets turned off when the bandage comes near so well just have to try it ivy wasnt completely satisfied with that rationale but at least it meant that grey was ready to try the bandage they brought it up close to the wound maybe if i shove it across from this side and you go across and catch it from that side grey said uncertainly yes ivy ducked down and scooted forward there was a clear spot of ground right next to the giants side below the jet because the blood was shooting out so fast it didnt touch ground for some distance she passed right under it feeling its close heat and straightened up on the other side ready she cried over the roar of it grey wrestled the bandage up so it leaned against the giants side he unfolded the cute little knife he carried and used it to slice away the wrapping exposing the clean surface when he had the bandage clear he put away his knife took careful hold and nudged the bandage forward edgewise it touched the rushing blood despite her confidence in its magic ivy almost expected the bandage to be caught and flung violently out to float in the red river below but the edge of the bandage cut into the stream as if the blood were no more than a beam of light there wasnt even any splash grey gaped but kept shoving the bandage lurched across cutting off more of the flow soon it was all the way across and ivy grabbed hold of it she hauled it far enough to be centered across the wound then pressed it onto the giants skin by leaning against it tamp it on man from mundania man from mundania she called to greyand discovered that she didnt need to call at all for the roar of the jet had stopped she was right beside grey close enough to touch they pressed it tight all around the wound where the bandage touched skin it adhered so firmly that there was no leakage at all in the center over the wound it merely thrummed faintly with the pressure of the blood behind it the job was done ivy looked down the slope the river of blood was still there but dwindling because its source was gone it would probably take days for all of it to clear if it ever did some of it might simply clot in place grey shook his head there must have been a lot of pain there he said just sort of lying here while his life ebbed i have a notion how he must feel ivy thought of his life in mundania indeed he might have a notion now lets see if we can free him grey said it would take forever for me to saw through all those bonds with my penknife but maybe he knows of a better way he walked toward the ramp they had fashioned before maybe hell be able to break free when his strength recovers ivy said following now that hes not losing his blood i dont think so enchantments usually come in threes what she asked astonished threes they set it up that way in fairy tales so they probably do the same in fairytale settings we have to play the game their way or it wont work you believe in magic now no just in the way promoters operate she was silent there seemed to be no convincing him they came again to the head giant we have patched your wound grey said how may we free you from bondage the huge mouth pursed magic sword in scabbard well try that grey said name your reward i told you no reward i just dont like you being stuck here like this grey headed down the giants chest look ing for the scabbard ivy ran after him for a man who doesnt believe in magic youre doing very well magic has nothing to do with it he exclaimed this giant has been treated rotten and i dont like it i dont care if it is just a setting i cant just let it be he didnt believe but he wanted to do what he thought was right ivy didnt know whether to be mad at him or proud of him the scabbard lay along the giants right side below the bandaged wound it was hugeand so was the sword it sheathed i cant use that grey exclaimed i think you can ivy said you may not believe in magic but it is obviously working put your hand on the hilt this is crazy grey protested but he slid down used his feet to unsnap the containing strap and worked his way up to the hilt the thickness of the thing was greater than the length of his body but he put his hand on itand the sword reduced in size to fit his own proportions the hilt fitting comfortably in his hand he drew it out and held it aloft amazed this is a magic sword ivy said somewhat smugly now you can use it to cut his bonds uh yes he agreed disgruntled id sure like to know how they managed this effect he jumped the rest of the way down then walked up along the giants side wherever he saw a cord he sliced carefully at it with the sword and it parted he walked entirely around the giant cutting every bond until he reached the left foot oops he exclaimed ivy had been paralleling him on the top of the giant she ran down the leg to see there was a giant metal manacle clamped about the ankle a heavy chain led from it to a solid metal block beyond the feet even with every cord cut the giant would be unable to walk away from this spot man from mundania grey continued on around the legs cutting the remain ing cords when he reached the monstrous scabbard he reached up shoved the tiny sword into it and let go im mediately the sword returned to its former size filling the scabbard they returned to the giants head i have cut the bonds grey announced but you have metal shackles on your feet how can i get those off once more the mouth pursed key on pedestal oh i should have looked ill fetch it name your reward forget it giant i just want to get this job done grey headed back down to the giants feet ivy followed be mused again by greys attitude he might at least have asked for that fabulous magic sword there was a key by the chains longer than greys body but he was catching on to the rules of this region he put his hand on it and abruptly it fit his hand he took it to one of the manacles there was a huge keyhole there he put the tiny key in and tamed it the manacle snapped open the giants leg was free he went to the other manacle and opened it similarly then he returned the key to its spot when he let go it became its original size okay giant he called youre free now moove awaay the giant called from the fardistant head they hurried back away from the legs then the giant stirred the earth quaked as the limbs moved the upper section lifted as the giant sat up it was like a mountain being formed from a wrinkle in the terrain wheeere aare yoou the giant called down here grey called back waving the giant looked and spotted them the upper torso leaned down i asked you three times to name your re ward for helping me the giant said and i told you three times no grey responded if youre okay now well be on our way but i want to know my benefactor the giant said man from munddnia i beg of you remain a bit and exchange stories for the end of this is not yet i dont like this ivy murmured he may want to eat us grey stared at her then he shook himself no i cant believe that would be in the script but just to be sure ill ask he cupped his hands about his mouth and called we are hungry and we fear you are can we trust you the giant laughed and the booming of it echoed across the terrain i dont eat people i understand they taste awful i have magic biscuit i will share it with you in exchange for your company this hour my friend fears we must not eat anything here grey called back this is not dream food the giant said i brought it with me from xanth it is safe to eat grey looked at ivy what do you say ivys hunger pangs roiled up fiercely if the giant turned out to be dangerous she should be able to enhance him into clumsiness i say lets trust him maybe he knows the best way out of here okay grey called the giant extended his right arm the huge hand came to rest on the ground before them grey looked at her again trust him ivy remembered that she was supposed to return from this quest safely trust him she said and climbed onto the hand first she hoped this was a good decision she was a sorceress but her magic had its limits grey joined her then the hand closed partway forming a crude cage and lifted in a moment they were high above the trees traveling swiftly toward the giants face but the giant only set them on the flat top of a nearby mountain where he could converse without having to lie down again or shout he brought out a jagged fragment of biscuit that might have been broken from an outcrop ping of rock and set it beside them then he brought a piece of cheese as big as a house and squeezed out a little grog from an enormous wineskin all from xanth he assured them eat your fill man from mundania indeed he crammed a huge chunk of biscuit and cheese into his mouth and chewed with evident relish ivy could restrain herself no longer she walked to the biscuit used her foot to break off a piece and scooped up some of the cheese both turned out to be excellent they gobbled them down as if they hadnt eaten for a day or twowhich was exactly the case now we talk the giant said satisfied you tell me your tale ill tell you mine ivy was content to let grey tell their story his way she settled back against an escarpment of cracker and listened chapter giant rey was feeling considerably better about this adventure now that his stomach was full the cracker and cheese made him dry so he scooped up some of the puddled grog in his two hands and drank it whew it was potent stuff then he told the giant their story condensed how ivy was a princess of xanth why provoke her by saying oth erwise in her presence who had been sent on a mission to find a lost magician but had somehow landed in drear mundania as she put it how he was an ordinary young man who happened to live in the next apartment who had tried to help her find her way back how they had climbed an odd mountain stepped through a door to a new land and discovered the river of blood so we came to help you because it was the right thing to do he concluded thats all there is to it the giant smiled from this range it looked like a fis sure in the face of a cliffside i think not then he told his story he was it turned out named girard he had been a young carefree giant wandering the unexplored central regions of xanth when as girard giant talked the grog made grey relaxed and woozy he found it easy to identify with the story and seemed to live it himself as if in a dream man from mundania girard had one bad character flaw according to others he was a dogooder when he spied an injured animal he tried to help it when he found a tree suffering in a drought he tried to water it and when he saw wrong he tried to right it unfortunately those on the receiving end did not always understand or appreciate his efforts for girard was an invisible giant there were a number of his tribe in xanth but they tended to be shy and they didnt like to hurt things by treading on them so they maintained distant profiles they romped freely in their own ranges but in recent years the human folk had been expanding and exploring more of xanth and this was re ducing the giant habitat they had to tread carefully in deed when human folk settled nearby for humans could be extraordinarily inquisitive human folk also had magic talents and that was a problem because some magic could harm the giants so the giants retreated as the humans advanced generally one day girard spied a new human settlement deep in the forest he knew he should stay clear but it happened to be one of his favorite forests so he remained to see what was going on it turned out that the beerbarrel trees of this region were especially potent and the man who was tapping them was hauling the beer to a distant village he kept the secret of the trees location so that only he could tap them realizing that girard was satisfied be cause it meant that no more humans would be coming here and it would still be safe for giants as long as they watched out for this one homestead one evening there was trouble in the human house it seemed the little boy had gotten into the cookie jar when he wasnt supposed to and eaten them all so that no one else could have any until the cookie bush in the family garden could grow more he was sent to his room for the day as punishment but the boy rebellious sneaked out his window and ran away girard watching invisibly shook his head he knew children were not supposed to do that he watched the boy slink into the forest because night was coming man from mundania the forest was dangerous for small creatures the spooks of the evening were always alert for helpless victims the little boy naturally soon repented his action but it was too late he had gotten himself lost as night closed he gave up and curled up against a hoarse chestnut and went to sleep it seemed that the heavy breathing of the wind through the leaves of the tree lulled him predators closed from every side girard looking down from above could see them the boy would shortly be a morsel the only question was which predator would reach him first and whether he would get in one good scream or none as he was chomped and swallowed so girard meddlesome as always succumbed to his nuisance of a dogooding instinct he reached down and carefully picked up the sleeping boy before any predator could chomp him he carried the boy back to his familys house and set him on the doormat then he used the tips of his fingers and with the most delicate touch pried up the roof over the boys bedroom when he had the house open at that point he lifted the boy again and set him on his bed in his room then he squeezed the house shut again slowly hardly making a sound the boy was back where he belonged and no one the wiser when he woke in the morning he would think he had dreamed his running away and with luck his folks might never know he had been gone then girard returned to the place where the boy had fallen asleep he put his hand down by the hoarse chestnut tree and piled some dead leaves around the fingers so that they might be mistaken for a sleeping form the first pred ator to pounce on that would receive a surprise girard didnt plan to really hurt the creature just shake it around a bit to discourage it from going after any more sleeping boys but the predators were smarter than he they smelled the difference between boy and giant and stayed clear girard realized this only later after his little trap failed at the time he didnt know and while he waited in perfect silence he fell into boredom and then into sleep himself thus his trap became a nap man from mundania a night mare approached bearing a bad dream intended for the bad human boy who had run away from home she was mare crisium cris for short and she was behind schedule and very rushed the gourd was shorthoofed this night several mares were getting their hooves trimmed so their burden of dreams had to be carried by others thus cris did not pause to verify the identity of the dreamer the boy was supposed to be here and some one was here so she kicked in the dream and galloped off for the next subject she was later to get her tail severely tweaked for that error but that was another story so it was that girard dreamed the dream intended for the boy it would have terrified the boy but it had a rather different effect on the giant the first part was routine a brief rehearsal of the boys flight from home then came the main entre a huge female figure loomed garbed vaguely like the boys mother bad boy bad boy she screamed her voice echoing like thunder when i catch you the boy of course was supposed to cringe in fear and plead for mercy he knew he deserved the punishment and feared it horribly but girard gazed at the giantess and saw there the woman of his dreams the boys dream technically but still a remarkably wonderful creature he was smitten instantly with love for her the huge hand of the giantess reached down to catch the scruff of the boys neck girard could not restrain him self he took hold of that hand and kissed it with a re sounding smack for a moment the giantess looked surprised then the dream censor cut in tilt tilt abort abort in a moment the dream dissipated and girard woke he knew what had happened he had reacted in a way the human boy never would have and that had tilted the dream the wrong way and caused it to selfdestruct the night mares were very possessive of their dreams they wanted none of them getting into the wrong hands he had given an erroneous signal and ruined it that lovely giantess was gone truly it had become a bad dream for him because he would have given anything man from mundania to have seen more of her where did she live how had she come to participate in the dream how could he find her from that moment his directionless life was over he had a quest he had to find that giantess he asked everywhere but none of the other giants knew where she might be none had even heard of her must be from some other tribe one said after all she was visible she was in a dream the rules are different there girard pointed out true maybe you should inquire in the realm of dreams that seemed like an excellent notion the realm of dreams was in the gourd as everyone knew anyone could enter that realm merely by looking in the peephole of any hypnogourd the problem was that the person could not leave until some other party interrupted the contact of eye and peephole that could become awkward girard considered he could ask another giant to stand by and cut off his view into the gourd but the problem was that the outside giant could not know when the time was right girard might be on the verge of discovering the giantess only to be cut off and never find her again he really did not know much about the gourd so did not know what rules operated maybe there was some way to break the contact from inside so that it would be under his own control he decided that since he would rather die than be without the giantess he might as well take the risk of dying in order to make the best possible search for her he went to a private forest that had a glade where a hypnogourd plant grew he lay down on his stomach be tween the trees wriggling to fit and propped his chin next to the gourd he moved the gourd around until the peep hole was about to come into view then chin still propped he closed his eyes and set the gourd firmly in place he opened his eyes one eye found the peephole man from mundania he was inside the gourd he knew it was only his soul self not his physical body but he felt the same and would not have known better had he not known better he was in a jungle the trees were so big that they were slightly taller even than himself and that was certainly the tipoff that this was not the real land of xanth they were solid too as hard as rock maple by the feel of their trunks or ironwood it hadnt occurred to him that any thing in the dream realm could be that solid but obviously it was something tickled his bare toes he looked down and saw that giant vines were curling over them they looked like krakan weed tentacles with big suckers a sucker clamped onto a toe with a slurping sound there was pain it took a while to travel all the way from his toe to his head but it was authoritative when it arrived youch he bellowed in response another sucker clamped on with another slurp they were sucking his blood girard didnt have to stand for that he bent down and pinched the first vine between his fingers pulling it off his toe but it refused to let go the sucker sucked so tightly that it threatened to rip the skin off with it after a mo ment doubled pain reached girards brain it hurt to pull on that vine meanwhile more were rustling in their suckers quest ing for firm flesh soon his feet would be food for the vines and he would be unable to stop it because it hurt too much to pull them off girard reacted as giants do he lifted his free foot and stomped the vines caught below it were squished flat they wriggled a moment then expired he stomped again this time right beside his caught foot take that sucker he cried a few more stomps flattened all the vines around him the suckers deprived of their stems lost suction and fell away to be stomped in turn it served them right giraid walked on he wondered whether the giantess he thought of her as gina because that was the way she had looked in the dreamhad come this way and been man from mundania trapped and forced to work for the night mares in the bad dreams if so he was on the right track he came to a great halfway flat plain ahead of him a cloud formed expanding rapidly it was an ugly cloud with mean curlicues at its edges and a droll gray face he recognized that cloud it was cumulo fracto nim bus the worst freak of nature in xanth fracto termed himself the king of clouds but he was just hot air always up to mischief fracto formed a mouth and blew out a blast of wind hot air this was freezing girard stepped back shiver ing but fracto followed blasting him with sleetladen gales snow swirled around him turning his skin purple with cold soon he would be frozen by the ill wind again girard reacted as a giant should he inhaled hugely then blew out a blast of his own he blew that cloud topsyturvy fractos bulbous misty face turned up side down fracto was so angry that lightning bolts shot out of his bottom but they did no harm because his nether side was aiming at the sky a few incoming sunbeams were dislo cated to their great annoyance but that was all before practo could right himself girard blew again this time the cloud was sent rolling across the sky with the sound of infuriated thunder girard kept blowing until the cloud was out of sight so much for that nuisance he walked on he hoped gina had not been frozen by the cloud women were less blowhardy than men so she might not have been able to blow fracto away a new shape was coming across the plain it loomed hugely it was a sphinxone of the few creatures struc tured on the scale of a giant usually sphinxes just sat in the sand and snoozed but they could be ornery when aroused and this one seemed aroused better to avoid it girard turned away but there coming up behind him was a rocone of the few other creatures able to compete with giants the big bird looked mean more shapes were coming from other directions this promised to get nasty girard lumbered into a run taking man from mundania such huge strides that the animals and birds were left be hind but not far behind they pursued him relentlessly he came to a wall across the plain if he stopped at it the aggressive creatures would catch him and he wasnt sure that would be very comfortable so he ran right through it the wall cracked into jagged fragments and fell aside beyond it was a lovely pool with twenty lovesick mer maids they screamed as girards foot landed in the wa ter splashing a third of it out girard brought himself to a halt standing in the pool what happened he asked bewildered you incredible oaf you crashed through a setting di vider a mermaid screamed we were just rehearsing for our scene and you ruined it your scene girard asked stupidly our dream scene we are scheduled to love a misog ynist to death hes supposed to fall in the pool and wellbut how can we do that when youve splashed out all our water she flexed her tail angrily a setting divider he asked equally stupidly do you think our space is limitless we have to make good use of it youre supposed to stay on your side of the divider in your own setting and us in ours but you crashed through how will we ever get this scene in shape in time he looked at her she was tiny in the human fashion with her wet hair flung across her face and shoulders but her shape was definitely there then a black stallion appeared beside the pool what is the meaning of this the horse demanded speechlessly thisthis giant just barged in here and ruined our rehearsal the mermaid expostulated look at our set night stallion we have a deadline the horses eyes nickered as if lighted from inside sud denly the broken wall was restored in fact there seemed to be no wall at all just the pool and a decorative garden beyond the water was restored so that the pool was full eeeek a mermaid cried here comes the misogy nist get that giant out of here man from mundania immediately the mermaids were assuming their places around the pool brushing their wild wet tresses the lead maid heaved herself up on a rock and inhaled making her shape even more definite then the setting disappeared and girard found himself on a featureless plain he was disappointed he had been curious to see how the mermaids would love the misogy nist to death somehow it did not sound like a bad way to go he wondered just what kind of creature a misogynist was it is a man who hates women the stallion said appear ing before him of course the real one is not here the maids must address a standin while the dream is re corded then when the dream is carried to the real misog ynist it will be realistic enough to give him his most horrible fright oh now girard understood still he wondered about the details of it surely not more than one or two mer maids at a time could what brought you here the stallion demanded girard explained about the lovely giantess he had seen in the boys dream i must meet her he concluded i know she is the one woman for me you fool she is a mere figment a what an illusion a construct for one use only a piece of temporary scenery she has no larger existence but i saw her you saw a dream figure which dissipated with the dream beyond that she is little but a bad memory but the mermaids are dream figures and they are real arent they girard asked the mermaids are regulars they act in numerous set tings there are many calls for mermaids even in bad dreams but few for giantesses the one you saw was what we term an ad hoc figment an image generated for a single use only forget her she is nothing shes not nothing girard protested i love her you are an idiot go back where you came from and dont bother us again man from mundania man from mundania giants were not as a class smart but they did not really like being called idiots girard began to heat up you mean i cant meet gina the stallion snorted derisively you even have a name for her go home oaf that did it girard got mad he stood up straight looked around and saw only emptiness but he knew that was mostly illusion if he ran any distance he would crash through another barrier that would serve this arrogant horse rightand he might even be able to find gina some where too for he just knew she had to exist after all he had seen her he lumbered into a run making the plain tremble sure enough after only a few steps he crashed through a bar rier the featureless plain extended only a short distance before it became walls that were painted to resemble more featureless plain it was a good illusion but this was no dream he could strike these walls and break them down beyond the wall was a new setting a house made of candy it looked good enough to eat and would make several mouthfuls for him but he had been warned about this eat nothing in the dream realm because it could lock him into it forever he had his own supplies of crackers cheese and grog and would eat those when he got hun gry so he ignored the house and lunged on soon he broke through another barrier the painted candy cane backdrop fell away and he stepped into a nest of writhing tentacles he slogged through them and broke through into a hillside teeming with goblins they raised an outraged outcry at his intrusion but he slogged on he didnt care what the horse said about figments gina must be here somewhere and he would batter down every par tition until he found her he broke into an ocean setting the stallion appeared standing on the water as if it were solid that does it giant im putting you under restraint go ram a bad dream under your tail girard ex claimed heatedly for the exertion added to his anger was making him very hot he tramped on he crashed through another partition this one con tained an ogre bearing a pointed stick ogres werent smart enough to use spears then die monster the ogre grunted and hurled the stick at him it struck girard in the side that stung so he caught it between his thumb and forefinger and yanked it out it was no more than a splinter really but it ripped a hole in his side and his blood poured out he was about to reach for the magic bandage in his front pocket then abruptly he was flat on his back in a new setting and strings tied his body down he was unable to sit up the stallion reappeared you have misbehaved giant the horse said you have wreaked havoc and must suffer in consequence you will remain bound until some inno cent creature who knows nothing of your situation frees you you must offer that creature a reward three times and if it accepts any of those times all will be nulled and he will be unable to free you fare ill oaf with that the horse disappeared girard was left to his fate he lost track of how long he lay there the blood pour ing from the wound made by the ogre he soon gave up trying to free himself he could not the bonds were mag ically strong so he slept most of the time slowly weak ening he realized after a few days thought that he probably could not bleed to death here because this wasnt his real body what happened here was more apparent than real but he still did seem to be losing strength why a few more days thought developed an answer his real body out in xanth was lying there without eating or drinking that could weaken him in time but still he could not escape the bonds held his dream body and the peephole held his real body a nymph came by im sorry to see you in such dis tress giant she said i would free you if i could but i cant because everyone knows how you barged in and bashed up several settings i was looking for gina he explained gina oh yes the giantess who is a figment i think man from mundania if you just forgot about her the night stallion might let you go i cant forget her girard said gee thats too bad well i have to move on i have a gig at the castle roogna set im just one of the extras but its a major bad dream the nymph departed nymphs were not noted for their depth or longevity of feeling girard thought about gina for the next few days the horse said she didnt exist but she had to because he had seen her the more he thought about it the more it seemed to him that a person had to exist if someone believed in that person and he believed so he could not afford to forget her because then she might truly be gone a ghost floated up it must be bad being mortal he said id like to free you but i have no substance be sides everyone knows how you bashed up those sets well i have to go on to the castle roogna set im playing a ghost who scared a bad child he drifted on ghosts were not noted for great sympathy to mortal creatures girard thought about the thing the ghost had said that echoed what the nymph had said everyone knew about what girard had done he was cursed to remain here until someone who knew nothing about his situation passed how long would that take when everyone knew about it maybe it would be easier to forget about gina then the horse might free him but then gina would not exist and he couldnt abide that notion so he gave it up a goblin wandered by say whore you bugbrain the goblin inquired politely after the fashion of his kind just a bound giant girard replied well maybe id better free you mudfoot the gob lin said i mean your stupid bloods a menace to navi gation how can we get to the castle roogna set when the blankety path is washed out by this stuff name your reward girard said remembering that he had to ask three times or it wouldnt work a reward the goblin exclaimed say thats a nifty notion hairnose how about a big bag of fools gold now it happened that girard had a small bag of fools man from mundania gold tied to his belt along with his carving dagger per haps the goblin had seen it for goblins had extremely beady eyes to the goblin it would seem like a big bag yes you can have it if you free me he said great the goblin tried to pull out one of the bonds but couldnt budge it he tried to bite through it but his teeth did not dent it he cursed at it but though the nearby foliage wilted the bond remained tight sorry cant break this bond james he said thats girard the giant said girard hey i know that name aint you the one who the same girard agreed sadly but ill take the gold anyway because i did try the goblin said but the greedy little creature was unable to liberate the bag of fools gold either at length disgruntled he stalked off goblins certainly were not noted for generosity or sensitivity girard thought about the goblin for a few days it seemed it was true that the acceptance of a reward made the rescue impossible that was too bad who would be fool enough to go to the effort of freeing him without any thought of reward he wondered again whether he should forget gina but he found he just could not even if he expired if she couldnt exist then he would cease to exist also that seemed fair enough then at last the young human couple came girard had so little hope left that he hardly bothered to awaken and his voice was out of practice but to his surprise the young man did not know of his situation and did not accept any reward even though girard diligently asked three times what an amazing and worthwhile creature this was so now at last i am free he exclaimed because of you grey mundane thats murphy grey said grey murphy of mun dania man from mundania murphy hey i know that name arent you the one who cursed folk no ivy said its just a coincidence well i am glad you came because now the horses curse has been abated and i can resume my search for gina but if shes just a figment ivy began ive been thinking about that grey said if she is just a figment why is the night stallion so eager to have girard forget about her i mean who cares who believes in something that doesnt exist ivy looked at him as if suspecting an insult somewhere but didnt speak he realized too late that his question could be taken as a reference to her own belief in magic the horse doesnt want me to believe in gina gi rard said i dont know why i think i do grey said warming to his thought here in the dream realm things go by different rules so some things that dont exist in the real world can exist here because folk think they do so maybe it is your belief in gina that makes her real nobody else believes in her but as long as you do maybe she is real yes girard agreed so maybe i can still find her so maybe you can grey agreed but maybe it would be better not to bash down any more sets while youre looking or the stallion will tie you down again but how else can i look maybe we could talk to the stallion there might be some kind of deal we could make i mean you want gina and he wants you out of here you want to negotiate with the night stallion ivy asked amazed how can you when you dont believe in him i believe that there is some authority with whom we can deal grey said i dont care what his title is ivy shrugged the night stallion isnt like other au thorities hes dangerous what can he doenchant me grey asked but there was a small core of doubt in him because the giant seemed to have been enchanted of course that could all be part m man from mundania of the setting still girard certainly seemed like a real person but how do we find him i can summon the night stallion for you ivy said how with a spell with my magic mirror she said she brought out a small hand mirror grey shut his mouth if she thought she could do some thing with that let her try night stallion ivy said to the mirror what concerns you princess the mirror replied grey jumped had the mirror really spoken he had almost thought it had my friend grey wants to negotiate with you she said in a moment princess princess had he heard the mirror say that did that mean that he imagined that the mirror not only could talk but also accepted ivy as a princess of xanth they had told the giant their story but ivy had not identified herself to the mirror then a horse appeared it was a great black stallion standing like a glistening ebony statue its eyes nickered what is this a man from mundania yes ivy said he just freed girard giant and now he wants to make a deal the near eye oriented on grey deal grey plunged in you tied up the giant for a long time hoping he would forget gina giantess so you could wipe her off your books well it didnt work he still loves her and you cant get rid of her until you get rid of him i think its better to try another tack why not let him have her and hell take her out of here and then you can forget them both the sinister eye flickered again if you take the giants part you will share his fate then i share his fate grey said stoutly though his inner core of doubt was expanding whats right is right and it isnt right to tie a man down and let him bleed a river of blood just because hes romantic again the eye nickered a gray cloud surrounded grey r man from mundania and strange forces strove at him alarmed he reminded himself that none of this was real the setting might be impressive but there was no such thing as magic so it could not touch him the stallion was trying to fake him out and he refused to be faked then things cleared and the tableau was as it was be fore can not deal with you the stallion said with seeming surprise what i want is reasonable enough grey said rea sonably just give girard what he came for and we can all go he wants a figment look grey said i dont care what kind of a setup you have here or how it looks to the people who come in for tours if you can make a setting as big as a whole mountain with a castle on top of it and fake flying dragons with fire and doors that disappear after being used you should be able to make a giantess thats all girard wants the lady he saw in your dream it was your fault the dream hit the wrong person if you put your night mares on a proper schedule they wouldnt be too rushed to check closely maybe instead of trying to punish girard you should work with him to shape up your operation so such foulups dont happen next time he saw ivy trying to signal him to be quiet but his dander was up and he was sick of authorities who pushed regular folk around he had had more than enough of that in college this horse was the mouthpiece of whoever ran this carnival so he was telling him a thing or three it seems i must come to terms with you though you know not what you are the stallion said annoyed he turned to girard the figment can exist only here not in xanth would you come here physically to be with her sure girard said then so shall it be the eyes nickered and the ground shuddered a shape loomed from over the hill some huge creature was approaching it was the giantess gina girard boomed as her tow man from mundania ering head came into sight he lurched to his feet and lumbered across to meet her girard she boomed back i was afraid you would forget me and i would cease to exist for no one but you believed in me never girard cried passionately they came to gether with a crash that shook the whole setting satisfied the night stallion inquired youll find work for himfor them bothhere grey asked no more tie downs work for them both the stallion agreed but grey cant stay here ivy protested the stallion turned to her obviously not but you said he would share the giants fate if he took his part the stallion paused as if figuring something out and so shall it be the two shall be linked by exchanging set tings girard here grey there do you accept the ex change exchange grey asked his body for yours now wait grey protested he means hell bring girards body into the gourd and move ours out of it ivy explained its a fair deal oh okay that was a kind of sharing he realized once more the stallions eyes nickered in the unmoving figure then the scene changed chapter sharing i ivy breathed a sigh of relief they were in xanth proper at last she wanted to hug the familiar acom and birch bark trees she saw around them and kiss the familiar turf grey stood beside her he looked around ohanother setting he said its not another setting she said this is xanth how can we tell ive lived in xanth all my life i know it when i see it she said defensively he shrugged as if it didnt make much difference it does seem to be where the giant was see there is the indentation where he lay and there is the gourd right beyond the holes where his elbows were propped she agreed the night stal lion brought his body in and put ours out now if i can just figure out where we are i thought you said you know xanth havent you been here before i know the general way of xanth she said the types of trees for example but i stay mostly on the en chanted paths and this must be way off those because the giants dont use them well just have to find our way to a path and then walk down it to castle roogna man from mundania if this is a magic land why dont you just enchant us there are you making fun of me she demanded he raised his hands in the mundane surrender signal i guess i dont know the rules well its because that isnt my kind of magic she said cooling my talent is intensification not transpor tation i could make us walk there faster but thats about all i dont mind walking he said it looks like a nice place she was relieved that he hadnt thought to inquire about the magic mirror of course she could use it to contact her mother again and she knew that she should do just that it was right in her knapsack along with the sign language book but the episode with the giant had shown her more about grey and she wanted to work things out with him before turning up at the castle the long walk should take several days and that might be enough but first we had better eat she said we had plenty of girards crackers and cheese im not sure its the same in the gourd im hungry again arent you that was one thing that was not in her knapsack food he rubbed his stomach yes come to think of it but theres a pie plant over there she said spying it she walked over to it it was young with small pot pies in the budding stage but she was able to enhance these into ripeness so she could pluck them they were only warm not hot but that was the best this immature plant could do even enhanced she gave one to grey and took another for herself thats a nice trick he remarked as he ate ivy didnt comment because she knew it wasnt exactly a compli ment he thought she had found food provided by the mundane management the thing about grey was that he had acted forthrightly in the gourd even though he didnt believe in its magic he had figured out a way to get the across the river then man from mundania man from mundania had sought the source of all that blood and found the suf fering giant she would never have thought of that be cause she took magic for granted then he had insisted on helping the giant and had succeeded in freeing him she liked that it showed how grey cared about people even strange ones then he had faced down the night stallion and that had to have taken sheer courage even if grey didnt believe in magic he knew that the stallion had power of that realm yet he had stood his ground and finally made his point what did the horse mean when he said i would share the giants fate grey asked as he finished his pie he meant that whatever he did to girard he would also do to you she answered my little brother dolph ran up against that when he helped grace ossian but he didnt flinch and in the end the stallion let him go and her too so when you didnt flinch either he let you go but he took the giant in so i didnt share his fate in the dream it seemed to make sense about exchanging places but now im not so sure maybe he interpreted it in another way grey looked perplexed what other way well girard got his girlfriend he looked at her startled are you my uh ivy felt herself blushing yes ibut i thought you were mad because i dont uh you know believe not mad frustrated but now were in xanth i can show you how magic works and it will be all right ivy i dont care about magic but i think youre uh great youre just the sort of girl i always wanted without really knowing it until i met you i feel the same about you even though youre mun dane you mean youd like me better if i believed in magic not exactly you dont believe i am a princess ei ther well i suppose you dont have to be magic to be a princess i am both and i want to convince you but i like you because you dont believe in either grey shook his head i dont understand ivy decided that this was at last the time for candor on this subject lets assume that i am what i say i am even if you dont believe a princess who can work magic how would a man react who believes well hed figure you were a pretty good catch i think i mean he could maybe marry you and be a king or some thing and even if not it could still be a pretty good life and youre pretty which doesnt exactly hurt so you believe he would seek my hand for reasons other than my personality i didnt mean to say there was anything wrong with your personality but yes i think maybe he would so how could i be sure that a man liked me for my self well you couldnt really if you didnt hide what you were i mean men dont always tell women the truth about things suppose he didnt believe what i was he looked at her appraisingly then maybe uh so when you tell me you like me i can believe you even if i am a princess he nodded i think i understand now and if you find out that i really am a princess i told you i dont care about that you can be anything you want to be it doesnt matter to me i just want to be with you and have you want to be with me too i am not sure i can believe you im not lying he protested i didnt say that but im afraid your feelings will change when you leam more about me i so i think it is time to convince you that xanth is real and magic and all the rest before we get any deeper because there are complications about associating with a princess that you may not like well of course if you are a princess what would you man from mundania want with me he asked forcing a laugh im nothing even at home and less in any magic land i have come to know you and i like you for what you are she said evenly i dont think you are nothing or less i think you just arent recognized as a worthwhile person you wouldnt feel that way if you were really a prin cess ivy felt a surge of anger but controlled it he really didnt know any better i would feel exactly as i do now but if you were toto marry me you might find yourself in an embarrassing position to mar he coughed and started over assuming that any princess would uh well what would be embar rassing xanth has no reigning queens only kings oh but obviously he didnt see but that simply means that when a woman assumes the throne she is known as the king my mother was king for a while only a magician or sorceress can be king you see that lets me out he said smiling i have no magic at all yes so if i were king you would be queen he gazed at her his mouth round he swallowed why does it seem that youre not joking so if you dont want to be queen of xanth you shouldnt marry me she concluded because eventu ally not soon i hope i will be king he shook his head ii realize this is all theoretical ivy youre not saying you wouldwould marry me youre just warning me of the rules of your land so im keeping my head and just saying that if i wereyou know uh marriedi wouldnt really care what they called me but you know if you really were a princess i sure wouldnt ask youi mean that just isnt my league but would you decline if i asked you he whistled i wouldnt be able to but you may change your mind she repeated when the time comes mem from mundania he just looked at her unable to comment well she had said what she had to say she had given him fair warning but that was probably the least of the hurdles ahead there seemed to be no path girard giant had come here but he had simply stepped over the trees they couldnt follow his tracks he had selected this to be pri vate so his body wouldnt be disturbed and private it was there seemed to be no familiar animals either she could use the magic mirror to call home of course but she wanted to convince grey about xanth and magic first and to give him time to think it through and come to his conclusions if that made him hate her they could settle it privately if it didntwell she had to be honest with herself about her feelings she liked him a lot and the moment she let herself go she could be in love with him she condemned herself for being foolish but he was a nice person and she knew he wasnt chasing her for her position or power that gave her a deep feeling of security that she had lacked before she had discovered in these last few days that what she wanted in a man had nothing much to do with position appearance physical strength or intelligence but a lot to do with decency conscience and loyalty she could trust grey and that made much of the rest irrelevant so she avoided use of the mirror and would bring it out only in an emergency they would pick their way south toward castle roognathis did seem like the north central region of xanth though she wasnt sure why she thought thatand she would keep alert for things along the way that might help convince grey of the truth i guess id better make a path through this jungle grey said stepping toward a patch of curse burrs no ivy cried too late grey brushed by the burrs and several lodged in his trouser leg and dug their spikes through the material and into his flesh youch he reached down to pull one off wait ivy said again too late greys fingers touched the burr owmpth he snorted r mem from mundania man from mundania through his nose evidently stifling a more coherent com ment stay where you are ivy called dont get any more on you those are curse burrs the only way you can get them off is by cursing one at a time each curse has to be different and original i wouldnt curse in front of a lady he protested and when you get them off back out carefully well find another route i have a better way he said grimly he brought out his folding knife any burr that clings to me is going to get sliced to pieces that wont work ivy saidyet again too late for grey was already flourishing the little knife at the burrsand all six of them hastily dropped off ivy stood openmouthed that showed em he said with satisfaction you cursed them all off ivy said with the same curse thats not supposed to be possible of course it isnt he agreed how could mere words affect sandspurs you have to slice them off sandspurs thats what theyre called where i came from people do tend to curse when they try to get them off ill grant that but theres no magic involved come on ill take off any that get on you we can continue this way it does seem to be the most open route bemused ivy followed him he would have to leam about curse burrs the hard way when he tried to use the same curse against a new batch sure enough three burrs latched onto her skirt can you get these off without cursing she inquired sure he stepped close and extended his knife to ward her skirt turn loose of her or ill slice you he said with mock fierceness and touched her skirt with the point of his knife the three burrs dropped off maybe these are a different variety ivy said doubt fully maybe they just know whos got their number he retorted then he turned and faced ahead all right you burrs listen up any of you who touch either of us will get hurt so stay clear if you know whats good for you he smiled now if curses work thatll keep them clear ivy shrugged grey stepped boldly forward and she followedand no curse burrs got on either of them how could this be it was as if magic was stopping the burrsyet grey was mundane with no magic not even any belief in it it seemed more likely that his curses would fail to have effect than that his threat with the dinky knife would frighten all the burrs was it possible that they didnt know he was mundane and thought his threat was backed by magic they passed beyond the curse burr patch and came to a stately tree with colored flowers grey walked toward it evidently meaning to pick one careful ivy warned him thats a twolips tree a tulip tree no it isnt ive seen them their flowers are different but you arent where you came from here a twolips tree but grey wasnt paying attention so she let it go he would find out grey stepped close reaching up for one of the larger flowers it avoided him he moved closer yet stretching and another flower nudged down and kissed him on the cheek with a significant smack he paused startled i could have sworn that thats right ivy said smugly those are kissing flowers impossible he said flowers cant kiss twolips she explained they like to kiss folk i dont believe it he stepped yet closer into the tree lets see whether anything kisses me while im watch ing he waited but nothing happened to ivys surprise usually a twolips tree would kiss anything that got within its range making loud smacking sounds that carried across the forest it was harmless but embarrassing maybe it doesnt like the way you taste she said man from mundania maybe its magical so cant stand scrutiny he retorted stepping away from the quiescent tree just dont try that with a tangle tree she said dis gruntled i know what that is but ill have to see it grab some thing before i believe it they went on the vegetation thinned and the ground turned sandy there was a feel of magic about it that both ered ivy there was something about this region and it seemed to be associated with the sand she didnt like mysteries in strange places they could be dangerous wait she said grey paused tired its not that im not sure i like this region it seems nice enough to me this sand is easy to walk on we can make good progress before night not if we walk into a trap he shrugged i wouldnt want to do that where i live there can be quicksandthats stuff that you can get caught in so maybe you drown ours makes you speed up ivy said and slowsand makes you slow down which can be awkward but this seems to be something else let me see what i can do with it make a sand castle maybe he said smiling her talent was enhancement not detection but she de cided to investigate in her fashion as she stepped on the sand she enhanced it so that its qualities would become more obvious for a moment the sand just lay there then it rippled waves spread across it as if it were water ivy continued to concentrate enhancing it further she wanted to see whether it was dangerous the ripples became humps was this a dread sand dune looking for subjects to turn into fossils her parents had encountered one of those once dunes liked to bury living creatures forever or until their flesh fell apart leaving handsome bones ivy wasnt yet ready to part with her flesh then a big central hump formed it rose up and up and man from mundania finally formed into a vague manlike form it stood there half again as tall as ivy its hair formed of dry weeds and its eyes of mica pebbles it had a nose made of a twisty root and ears of tattered seashells what are you ivy demanded of it the sandman shifted shape the sand humping as if driven by the wind except that there was no wind it as sumed the shape of a fourfooted animal with root horns and a viney tail you havent answered ivy said the thing didnt seem dangerous but she wasnt sure the sand changed again becoming a small tree with a thick trunk and stubby branches that waved clumsily in the makebelieve wind now look ivy started i wonder how the effect is achieved grey said strid ing across to touch the sand formation i cant believe immediately the sand sifted down and became a fea tureless mound its pebbles and shells and roots randomly distributed oh you spoiled it ivy exclaimed annoyed i was about to find out whether it was dangerous grey stirred the pile of sand with his toe its not dan gerous its just sand but it certainly looked like a sand man for a moment there i knew it was illusion i just wish i could have figured it out without destroying it well i was about to do that ivy said crossly but it did seem that the sandman was no danger the feeling of strangeness was gone now the day was getting on we had better find a place to camp grey said there could be wild crea tures in the night there could indeed they had not encountered any bad ones so far which was remarkable maybe the curse burrs and sandman kept them out but those things seemed to lack force here so she doubted it she hoped there wasnt some truly formidable predator who used this region as its hunting ground eliminating most of the other dangers she would prefer to deal with a series of small menaces rather than one really big one because she wasnt sure man from mundania man from mundania how effective her enhancement talent would be against a truly formidable creature usually when she explored she had stanley steamer along and he had taken care of per sonal defense she looked around but there was no suitable camping place they would just have to go on though her feet were tired and her legs too she wasnt used to this much con tinuous walking maybe under that tree grey suggested indicating a large tree whose tentacles reached almost to the ground thats a tangle tree ivy shrieked appalled yeah i guess so but we cant play this game forever im sure its harmless when its bluff is called he walked boldly toward it using one of the pleasant little paths that approached it no ivy cried dashing after him nobody but an ogre or a dragon messes with a tangler and even they are careful dont go near it im sure most creatures here feel as you do grey said proceeding without pause that means they will stay clear of it and we can spend a comfortable night under its shelter that seems ideal to me ivy caught up to him and grabbed his arm you dont understand that tree will grab you and gobble you down the moment you come within reach im not sure i can protect you from but she lost her balance and stumbled and they both fell right into the nest of the tentacles ivy felt sheer panic but the hanging tentacles remained quiescent not one grabbed at them the tree seemed to be asleep oh ivy said relieved it must have feasted re cently so its not hungry what luck grey shook his head you have an explanation for ev erything okay its not hungry so lets camp here tonight no one else will realize that its safe under here true she agreed faintly she remained nervous about being this close to a tangler but it certainly was true that a sated tree was safe she located some milkweeds and a breadfruit tree for tunately these were common all across xanth so they had bread and milk for dinner there was also a pillow bush nearby with extremely plush pillows they made two beds of them under the tree obviously none of these plants had been harvested recently because of the shortage of trav elers ivy lay for some time without sleeping bothered by things where was the great menace that kept travelers away and why were even the ordinary menaces so feeble at the moment she had been making spot excuses for them almost embarrassed because they were not mani festing adequately to convince grey they were genuine she had concluded that this tangle tree was sated but she saw no recent pile of bones and the tentacles did not look sleek and strong in the manner of a wellfed tree this tree should be hungry yet wasnt and that made sleep nervous which reminded her that sandmanprobably it was related to the ones that came by night to put children to sleep and perhaps it usually put travelers to sleep near this tangle tree so the tree could snake out a tentacle and haul them in without resistance yet in the face of greys skepticism the sandman had collapsed into inert sand there maybe was the crux of it grey thought that magic was mostly in her mind that she saw it work be cause she believed it did in mundania she had been un able to demonstrate otherwise but now they were in xanthand she still couldnt penetrate his unbelief it seemed that he was constitutionally unable to accept magic and that therefore the magic didnt work for him that was a fundamentally unsettling notion suppose magic didnt work for anyone who didnt believe in it now that was an interesting idea could that be why mundanes didnt have magic talents because they didnt believe in them but when they moved to xanth their children were exposed to magic from the outset and never learned not to believe so had talents if the mundanes were just more openminded they might turn out to have talents the moment they entered xanth after all the cen taurs had turned out to have talents those who stopped thinking that talents were obscene no that didnt hold up some mundanes were open man from mundania minded but none had ever had a magic talent some of their children were closeminded but still had talents be lief might be a factor but not the major one a person had to be bom in xanth to have magic so what was she going to do about grey it was foolish she well knew but she liked him she liked him a lot but the moment they reached castle roogna any romantic relationship would be over she was a princess and while she didnt have to marry a prince certainly her folks would not allow her to marry a mundane she had tried to ex plain that to grey but had gotten caught up in her own rebellion and discussed only the awkwardness of marriage between them not the impossibility of achieving it what would happen if she insisted on marrying a mun dane she would disappoint her parents terribly and that hurt they might have to take action such as banishing her to mundania and that would hurt more but if she went with grey would that make it worth it to live the rest of her life in drear mundania without magicthat was an appalling prospect yet she could imagine doing it almost with him grey was completely ordinary but there was something about him that appealed to her and she knew his interest in her was genuine was that enough she shook her head in the darkness she knew objec tively that it was not enough love could be fun but it didnt last if not soundly based and for her to move to mundania would be like a mermaid moving to land pos sible but problematical no she could marry grey only if he remained in xanth with herand that meant she had to have the approval of her parents that meant in turn that she couldnt marry him yet her heart wished that she could she would simply have to get her heart under control she knew that but she also knew it was going to hurt maybe when grey finally learned that magic was real he would suffer a revulsion against it and xanth and her and choose to go home to mundania alone that would solve her problem as the decision would be out of her hands but it still would hurt man from mundania ivy lay quietly on the pillows her eyes closed the tears nevertheless running down her cheeks she woke to the wan light of a shrouded morning as her eyes adjusted she discovered grey sitting beside her you okay he asked of course i am she said sitting up and shaking a stray leaf out of her hair why do you ask he shrugged i uh thought you were unhappy or something maybe sick i was worried she smiled i must look wretched but thats because im not used to sleeping out let me find a brook to wash in and ill be better uh sure id have gone out and looked around but i didnt want to leave you alone i wouldnt want you going out alone she retorted not until you believe that the dangers are real they went out together and did find a spring nearby let me test it ivy said these things can be danger ous why are they poisoned not exactly some are love springs oh yesthey make the creatures who drink from them fall in love with each other what a horror if we should drink from one of those ivy glanced at him sharply grey tried to hold his face straight but couldnt and had to laugh she laughed too more with relief than humor its not as nice as that she warned him love may be a euphemism when it happens they breed immediately being unable to restrain themselves even if they are of two different species it is believed that thats how the major crossbreeds got started centaurs merfolk harpies and so on so you wouldnt want to drink from one by accident of course i wouldnt he agreed but he looked doubtful ivy squatted by the spring and concentrated enhancing it if it was a love spring the enhancement would cause it to affect the plants growing around it and they would man from mundania start loving each other in whatever manner they could manage nothing happened its all right she reported its just water im sure it is he agreed condescendingly again she had to suppress her annoyance he didn t know any better this was the other side of it because of his ignorance she could trust his feeling for her but it was also a con stant source of irritation she wasnt used to such diver gent feelings for the same person they dipped out double handfuls of water to drink then she washed her face and hands the rest other was feeling a bit grubby but she decided not to strip and wash after all she would just have to climb back into the same dirty clothing she had changed to her clean clothes the night in the mock castle roogna and then gotten those dirty trudging along the river of blood and pushing the boulder she would probably have to throw away this mundane out fit the moment they reached castle roogna she hoped agenda whose clothing it was wouldnt mind that was funny the way grey had met such a series of peculiar girls who used the room before ivy was sent there by the heaven cent and the way compewter had been there with a bit of magic grey had told her that an odd program from someone called vaporware limited had changed the machine she wondered whether vaporware lived in xanth that might explain a lot still magic wasnt supposed to work at all in mundania so a mystery re mained compewter she said how did he do magic in mundania my computer didnt do magic grey said it just had a good translation program so we could talk i guess he didnt seem to be entirely satisfied either it sure was strange what it did though it admitted at the end that it was setting me up for you setting you up it had something to do with all those oddball females when i demanded a good one it brought you i dont know how but im sure glad it did man from mundania no one brought me she protested the heaven cent sent me whatever i think that program knew you were com ing somehow and took the credit but i dont care my life was like dishwater until you came and then it was like sunrise ivy had learned about dishwater in mundania because the same dishes had to be used over and over again which meant they had to be washed and i was a dishwater blonde she said remembering how the magic green had washed out of her hair you were beautiful he said she tried to think of some clever response but her mind froze up he was telling the truth he had seen her unen hanceddrab reallyyet had liked her there could be no better compliment than that wed better eat she said changing the subject i saw somethey looked like lollypops growing out of the sand back there he said ivy checked sugar sand she said naturally sweet things grow in it here are some sugar doughnuts and heres sugarcane she picked some of each and a sug arplum tree over there well get sick of sweets but at least its food they ate youre right he said as he chewed on the candystriped cane i am getting tired of sugar i never thought id see the day how is it that you eat these magical plants but still dont believe in magic she asked mischievously sugar doughnuts and sugarplums arent magical he protested though i admit that in mundania sugar sand and sugarcane have different definitions they moved on bearing south they came to a well worn path great he exclaimed now we wont have to plow through brush this isnt one of the enchanted paths she said un known paths are not to be trusted until their nature is understood you never can tell where they might lead he peered at the tangled jungle across from the path cant we risk it this once my legs are tired man from mundania man from mundania ivy considered her legs were tired too maybe if were careful if we hear anything we should get right off it though they walked down the path it was indeed a nice one well beaten down it wound along the contour passing a number of fine fruit and nut trees then they turned a curve and discovered three goblins blocking the path ahead oopsy ivy said goblins are never good news run the other way they turned and ran back around the curveand dis covered three more ugly goblins they were trapped they dont look very big grey said maybe i could knock them down there are always dozens more goblins near the first ivy said darkly sure enough more goblins were already crowding in behind the three they were squat little men almost black with big heads hands and feet and huge grimaces maybe theyre friendly he suggested hopefully goblins are never friendly ill have to summon help ivy brought out her magic mirror castle roog a goblin leaped forward and grabbed the mirror from her hand none of that slut grey leaped for the goblin but it was already too late the mirror had disappeared amidst the throng dont fight them ivy screamed well have to talk our way out of this grey seeing the throng desisted it was obvious to any one that they could not hope to fight their way clear of such a number a goblin chief appeared distinguished mainly by his greater ugliness youre going to talk your way out of this wench im no wench ivy protested im princess ivy and im the king of the dragons the goblin retorted har har har all the goblins joined in the coarse laughter well im grotesk goblin and were the gob linate of the golden horde and we dont care who you are well give me back my mirror and ill prove it she said my father will recognize me and will send hostile magic against us if you are the goblin said we dont need any of that better if he just doesnt know what happens to you he turned his head to the side tell the golden gals to heat up the pot weve got two live ones for supper tonight immediately a messenger goblin set off running on his stubby legs down the path he really wasnt golden it was evidently just a name they had chosen this was getting desperate ivy knew she would not really get boiled because of her guarantee of a safe return but as usual she feared for grey who had no such assur ance how could she get him free of this golden horde and whore youthe king of the centaurs grotesk demanded of grey dont answer him ivy warned but once again she was too late i am grey from mundania grey said a mundane the goblin exclaimed weve never cooked a mundane before do you believe in magic no well now maybe we can have some sport with this one the chief turned his head again what shall we do with the mundane there was a horrible clamor of violent and obscene sug gestions unsatisfied grotesk turned again to grey youre with the haha princess here what do you think of her dont answer ivy cried shut up trollop the chief said swinging at her head grey reached out and intercepted grotesks arm leave her alone immediately several goblins surged in and bore him back but the chief was not annoyed i think we have our answer he said he likes herand surely she likes him theres the key before we cook them lets play with them take them to the hate spring there was a roar of approval ivy and grey were hustled man from mundania on along the goblin path ivy was dismayed anew she knew what mischief a hate spring would be they passed the goblin village there was a bedraggled small centaur haltered and tied to a stake these goblins knew no limits nobody tied a centaur lest it bring ter rible retribution by centaur archers from centaur isle yet here was a young male evidently bound magically for no halter could hold such a creature otherwise they reached the spring a short distance beyond it was dismal as springs went shallow and muddy with a tiny island in the center the goblins hauled over a boat and put her in it one got in front and one in back with paddles both were extremely careful not to splash youre afraid even to touch it ivy asked such wa ter doesnt work unless you drink it thats all you know slattern grotesk called from land one touch of this anywhere on your body and you hate the next creature you see to pieces and will try to kill him any way you can go ahead dip your finger you already hate us so it wont matter ivy shivered not dipping her finger this was hideously potent stuff no wonder the goblins had camped near it they loved to hate they deposited her on the tiny isle then paddled back leaving her stranded there then they hauled away the boat and brought grey up to the edge very well mundane grotesk said you dont believe in magic then you dont think this hate spring will affect you go rescue her dont touch that water ivy called it will make you hate me why couldnt i touch it and hate you grey asked the chief then i wouldnt hate her go ahead the goblin agreed as the horde laughed one touch one hate we dont care how much you hate us as we cook you maybe youll even utter some nice mundane curses to entertain us but you cant reach your girlfriend without crossing that spring and when you see her or touch her youll hate her so you might as well get on with it what good is it to go to her if youre going to cook man from mundania us anyway grey asked i might as well just stay here and not cooperate with you at all there was a groan from the throng they didnt like that threat because it ruined their sport very well mundaneif you cross to her ill let you go well only eat her dont deal with him ivy cried goblins cant be trusted no i want to rescue her grey said in that infuri atingly reasonable way he had you have to let us both go or i wont cooperate grotesk pondered a moment then his eyes lighted cun ningly suppose i let you decide her fate when you get there you go free and you take her with you if you want yes that seems fair grey agreed dont do it ivy screamed hell break his word the moment youre across and youll hate me i dont think so grey said he stepped toward the pool no ivy cried despairingly no no no it was crazy if grey was going to die anyway but she didnt want him to die hating her grey waded into the water a jubilant cheer rose from the golden horde his eyes were fixed on ivy as he pro ceeded the water rising gradually to his waist as he crossed ivy stood transfixed by horror a man who hated her was coming for her and she could not get away without touching the water herself she discovered that there was one thing worse than having him hate her for her to hate him back she had to try to salvage her own emotion so as to remember him with pleasure instead of displeasure he strode out of the water his trousers clinging to his legs he came to stand before her his eyes still fixed on hers ivy knew her tears were flowing she had seen the need to break up their associationbut not this way oh not with hatred i want you to know grey she said falteringly that that whatever you feel for me now i still think youre wonderful do you hate me very much man from mundania hate you he said bewildered ivy i love you she stared at him youyoure not cruelly teasing me for answer he swept her into his arms and kissed her hard suddenly she could not doubt this was the passion of love then she realized that the cruelty was that of the gob lins this wasnt a hate spring at all it was just a muddy pond the golden horde was trying to make complete fools of them both and that meant that she was not stranded here she could cross the pond just as grey had she could escape and take grey with her protecting him with her security oh grey she said im so glad hold my hand tight were getting out of here of course he agreed but it wasnt enough her emotion was overflowing and demanded a more significant expression grey will you marry me she asked he paused amazed then he recovered yes cer tainly ivy but she cut off his protest with another kiss chapter gap hen he released her even though the water wasnt poisonous those goblins were mean characters and the two of them still had a problem about winning free he was not at all sure the goblin chief would honor his promise to release them but he hoped to shame the little man into it but it was hard to concentrate on such things in the face of what had just happened ivy had asked him to marry herand he had agreed what an incongruous occasion for such an engagement were not out of this yet ivy said ive got to get my mirror back then i can call for help if you can think of a way to get it for me maybe i can he said his mind spinning it was as if what had just happened between them had revved up his brain so that he was thinking with uncommon clarity and power the hate water isnt real but it occurs to me that most of the goblins may believe it is the chief would know the truth but keep the unruly minions cowed by threats to use the water on them that means we can bluff them but in a moment they will see that you dont hate me ivy said worriedly then theyll all know i dont think so if i claim to have powerful magic that makes me immune man from mundania man from mundania but grotesk will know thats not true but he wont dare say so because then his hold on the others will be weakened he will have to support me though he hates it so i can force him to honor his deal because hed rather let us go than lose his position and maybe get thrown in the pot himself by the angry dupes ivys face clouded then brightened as she understood grey thats brilliant she exclaimed something about you that brings out the best in me he said wryly indeed that seemed to be true he had never been in love before this episode had brought it out and he seemed almost to be floating suddenly he had confidence in himself such as he had never had before while were at it wed better rescue that poor centaur too it will be bad if they take out their wrath on him you care so much about others who are in trouble like girard giant ivy said i think thats why i love you he hadnt thought of it that way he had just done what he felt ought to be done without thought about whether it impressed her in fact she had seemed irritated when he insisted on seeking the source of the river of blood maybe that was what had been wrong with his life before he had been trying to impress people and had had inadequate resources instead of just focusing on what was right but now with ivy he didnt care about any of that he just wanted to make her happy then he thought of something else but can i justify telling them something i know is not true i mean youre playing their game ivy said quickly they told you this was a hate spring so you agree but tell them your magic counters it youre a liar only if they are he wasnt quite sure of that logic still this whole realm was a setting a phenomenal setting and it was easiest to go along with its rules thats why he referred to goblins instead of dwarves or simulacra and to the centaur instead of trying to figure out how the thing was animated okay for now until i reason it out better take my hand my supposed magic must seem to extend to you while you are in contact with me so you can brave the bad water she took his hand hand in hand they waded into the water see goblins he cried my magic counters your hate water i can wade in it without hating anyoneeven you the goblins watched dismayed they looked to their chief but grey preempted grotesks response you know thats true dont you chief he cried playing up to the lie you know that if this water touches others they will be affected by it he extended his free hand and made as if to scoop some water if i splash them dont do that the goblin chief exclaimed with evi dent alarm grey put on his crudest smile hoping it worked he had guessed right grotesk had to support him in this ruse yes you know what will happen so dont tempt me soursnoot the chief didnt tempt him the goblin had to maintain the illusion of the waters power you said you were mundane well maybe i exaggerated grey said mundanes of course were not supposed to have magic but grotesk could not point that out without giving away his own se cret they waded up to the edge but did not step out of the water now before we go i want you to return the ladys property grey said bring her mirror har bar har a goblin in the rear laughed fat chance grey leaned down so that his hand was within reach of the water if the goblin who spoke cares to step forward i have something for him he said evenly the truth was he was quite nervous how far could he push this bluff before the goblins called it there was a silence grey looked around as if per plexed what is no one in the golden horde thirsty he inquired well perhaps if i proffer a free sample he swished his hand through the water bring the mirror grotesk shouted there was a stir and soon a goblin brought the mirror dont splash he pleaded man from mundania i wont splash if i get what i want grey said ivy take the mirror but dont let go of my hand i cant protect you if you arent in contact yes ivy said doing a marvelousjob of looking very nervous about the water she clung tightly to his hand she reached forward the goblin stood at the bank and ex tended the mirror and she took it while the chief glow ered now we shall need transportation away from here grey said bring the centaur but grotesk had just figured out a cunning counterploy back away from the water he cried get out of splashing range uhoh that would allow the chief to keep his secret and grab them when they left the pool ivy do you have a cup ivy reached over her shoulder set the mirror in her backpack and pulled out a cup dip it full and throw water at anyone who looks trou blesome grey said she dipped it then they stepped out of the water still holding hands the goblins retreated grey saw that a number of them held stones or clubs but no one acted because the chief hadnt told them to grotesk couldnt afford to act until that cup of water was goneand he couldnt afford to have them throw it on any goblins and demonstrate its worthlessness they walked across to the centaur can you carry both of us if we free you grey inquired i think so the creature replied ive been a beast of burden for these monsters im miserable but strong but this is a magic halter only the chief can untie it the chief eh grey glanced across at grotesk and realized that this was another bluff well i have a special talent with knots too so no grey ivy murmured no one in xanth has two magic talents grey was sure the halter wasnt magic it was just so constructed that the centaurs own hands could not reach man from mundania the key clasps to undo it but he had to play by the rules well maybe my magic knife will cut it he said loudly he brought out his knife and sliced at the tough material of the halter fortunately he kept his knife sharp the strands parted some fevered sawing severed the section under the centaurs arm now it is broken you can lift it free he said the centaur did just that in a moment the halter was off thats some knife he exclaimed i got a sharp edged stone once and managed to saw at it without being observed but the magic was too strong and i got no where now we shall ride you out of here grey said the water will not affect you as long as you are in contact with me so dont be concerned if it splashes out of the cup that was literally true the water would not affect the cen taur while in contactor at any other time she will fling it at any goblin who comes too close are you ready the centaur glanced nervously at the cup yes he said uncertainly it was tricky mounting without letting go of ivys hand and for the sake of appearances he had to keep holding it but the centaur reached back and helped her up and then grey got up behind her start walking grey said slowly so as not to make them do anything foolish until we get away from this camp gotcha the centaur said he stepped carefully for ward im sure you can run very fast when you need to ivy remarked but goblins closed in across the path lead by a sub chief i think its a fake the subchief cried that wa ters lost its hate ivy flung the water at the subchief the goblin tried to leap back but the water caught him and also splashed across several others near him the first thing the wetted goblins saw was the ugly faces of their companions for an instant they stared then they exploded into violence the subchief swung his club at man from mundania the one he faced and two others fell to pummeling each other lets get out of here grey said you can do it ivy cried to the centaur youre su perstrong and fast the centaur needed no urging he leaped over the near est goblins and shot off down the path the goblin fight was spreading and none of the nearest ones were chasing the centaur but the more distant ones raised a cry of alarm get them theyre escaping but it was too late even doubly loaded the centaur could run faster than the stubbylegged goblins especially on the wellbeaten path a few stones flew but missed they had made it to freedom well away from the goblin camp they left the path we had better find a river and wash off the hate water on your legs the centaur said otherwise it will affect the two of us the moment you stop touching us not to worry grey said its not magic water that was grotesks bluff but it is the centaur insisted it made those goblins fight the moment it touched them that was psychological they believed it would affect them that way so it did well i believe in it the centaur said i saw it work more than once when the chief wanted to discipline some one i want it all off me before you get off me grey shrugged it made sense for a magical creature to believe in magic do you know where a suitable river is yes theres a stream not far from here it flows into the gap the gap ivy exclaimed were going there but its dangerous the centaur protested the gap dragon runs there wed better introduce ourselves ivy said im prin cess ivy of castle roogna really the centaur asked amazed i have heard of you you enhance folk man from mundania yes i helped you run faster and stronger you did indeed i have never done so well before even without a double load i thought i was just scared i am called donkey what grey asked because im small and gray and have big ears he explained the others always teased me so i preferred to go out on my own but then the goblins caught me and i had no friends to realize i was missing thank you so much for rescuing me im grey grey said not the color just the name im from mundania but then how can you do magic i cant it was all a bluff thats why i knew the water wouldnt hurt you donkey considered all the same id prefer to wash it all off just to be quite sure centaurs dont like to take avoidable chances so they went to the stream donkey walked carefully to the center then slowly settled down wash it all off be fore we separate the centaur said we wouldnt want to hate each other ivy giggled i never took a bath with my clothes on before me neither grey agreed they splashed water on themselves remaining in con tact with donkey letting the current carry away the bad medicine there was a stir in the water downstream see the fish are fighting donkey said its still potent coincidence grey said but he wondered there had been a number of funny events recently and not all were easy to accept for one thing the way those goblins had foughtwhen the subchief had expressed his disbelief in the power of the water why then had it affected him had his dis belief been a bluff or had he decided to support the sup posed power of the water the way grotesk did or had he wanted the captives to escape none of that seemed to make much sense man from mundania and the centaur now that they were relaxing grey was studying the creature he found no artificial connection between the man and horse aspects donkey seemed to be exactly what he claimed to be a living centaur the river was not shorting out his circuits his body was warm part of him was definitely human and part definitely animal how could this be without magic wed better get undressed so we can rinse out our clothing thoroughly then hang it up to dry ivy said it is overdue for a washing anyway but grey protested its all right she said were betrothed but and centaurs never wear any clothing anyway she continued they dont have any concerns about people she unbuttoned her blouse and drew it off grey didnt argue further she was right they did have to get washed and hang up their clothing to dry they were engaged to be married it had happened so suddenly that he still could hardly believe it but he was not going to deny it he didnt care what kind of setting this was or whether magic was real it was wonderful being with her soon they were bathing separately ivy and donkey at last satisfied that the hate water had been washed clear by the pure stream water the day was late now but they hung up their clothing to catch the declining rays of sun shine then he and ivy sat on a clean patch of grass and let the sun dry them too donkey didnt need to sit he stood in a separate sunbeam after shaking his body vio lently grey tried not to look at ivys bare body but didnt want to be too obvious about not looking lest she think she was ugly she wasnt in fact she was his very model of a teenaged girl are you sorry she inquired huh about being betrothed to me oh no he exclaimed iits more than i ever hoped for iwhen youwhen i woke before you under the tangle tree and saw you sleeping i just had to keep look man from mundania ing at you because as wonderful as all this crazy land may be you are the craziest and most wonderful thing that ever happened to me and i wish it would never end i meani dont know what i mean but you know there is trouble ahead she reminded him i was resolved to let you go no matter how much i liked you because i knew we couldnt marry but when you came for me through that water and didnt hate me sud denly i didnt care anymore what my folks think my little brothers got two betrotheds im entitled to one i think but you have to be willing im willing i just never thought that youdi mean that you were seriousi mean you dont know what you mean she repeated for him are you beginning to believe in magic a little he looked at the centaur and still could not explain him away if loving you is believing in magic then i believe he said she smiled i think i have never had a better compli ment i am amazed that you profess to disbelieve in magic donkey said we centaurs try to maintain a certain dif fidence about it but there is absolutely no doubt of its validity havent you felt ivys enhancement yourself grey considered i suppose i have but you are too full of buts ivy said shut up or ill kiss you but she leaned over and kissed him grey shut up in the morning they discussed the matter and decided to travel together down the river to the gap chasm don key knew the way and the location of the best trees along it while ivy knew the gap dragon so that they could enter the chasm safely none of them cared to remain in the vicinity of the goblinate of the golden horde for the goblins were surely out looking for them and would not treat them kindly they agreed that it was best to get on the other side of the gap with reasonable dispatch man from mundania man from mundania grey had read of the gap and the gap dragon but reserved his belief in such things until he actually saw them a trench across the state of florida a mile or so deep as he understood it there wasnt any part of that state anywhere near that elevation above sea level so such a chasm would be impossible even if it were possible with a great whomping steaming ferocious dragon run ning along the bottom more likely it was a railroad cut with an oldfashioned steam engine chugging along on its track some chocolate milkweed pods grew along the river and some mushrooms which turned out to be little rooms full of mush some were commeal mush and some were oat mush or wheat mush they didnt taste like much but the chocolate milk provided a bit of flavor at least they were filling how do you like it ivy asked he could tell by the sparkle in her eyes that she was up to some mischief so he answered cautiously mushy stuff was never my favorite thats what my little brother always saiduntil he met nada nada nada naga his betrothedi told you but she cured him in a hurry and now he loves mush i could use that cure myself he muttered still not seeing her point how did she i thought youd never ask she stepped to him wrapped her arms around him and kissed him so em phatically that his head seemed to float but he said when she gave him a chance to breathe mushy stuff she explained oh grey felt completely stupid he had walked right into that one yet somehow he wasnt bothered it was about as nice an experience as he could imagine did i embarrass you she asked uh no of course not he protested immediately she glanced at donkey im not sure what do you think hes flushing and perhaps stammering the centaur said i believe it is likely that you did embarrass him though he is attempting to deny it thats what i thought ivy faced grey again the brassies know how to handle that the brassies grey tried to remember what the brass folk had done in the books he had read they apologize she said do you know how they apologize uh no i she hauled him in again and kissed him with even more authority than before this time his head seemed not only to rise but also to swell to the size of a helium weather balloon and float across the landscape buffeted by stray playful breezes from somewhere far away her voice came do you accept my apology he tried to get back to earth uh then donkeys voice evidently the apology was not sufficient he seems frozen in place ivys voice again true i will simply have to make a better apology then she kissed him a third time his head heated and expanded so rapidly it exploded and bright fragments of the balloon fluttered down into the forest below to deco rate the trees with seeming flowers bees buzzed up to attend to those flowers and came away with buckets of nectar oh the sweetness of that kiss do you accept my apology ivy asked again grey strove valiantly to get his head back together uh yes sure he gasped finally catching on he wasnt sure he could survive the next kiss alert donkey said i hear goblins suddenly grey was back in focus lets get out of here wed better do it as we did before ivy said briskly ill enhance you donkey and well ride you that way well leave them behind again certainly the centaur agreed ivy scrambled into her pack and they both scrambled man from mundania onto the centaurs back and the centaur took off with a terrific leap just as a goblin burst into view tallyho the goblin cried and blew on a hom he carried alerting the others the sound was amazingly loud and vulgar i hate those stink horns ivy said as they raced through the light foliage beside the stream the centaur was proceeding vigorously psychologically buoyed by ivys supposed enhancement but the stream was extremely winding and clogged with rocks and brush so full speed was impossible the goblins were running along the ground on either side evidently small enough to duck under the worst of the obstructions so were not falling behind fast enough weve out to get well ahead before we reach the gap ivy said why if you know the gap dragon grey asked well for one thing stanley isnt likely to be right there when we arrive for another oops were here donkey said skidding to a halt as the landscape opened out ahead of them rats ivy swore the gobs are too close ill run along the edge the centaur said turning abruptly i believe theres a passable descent not far to the east now grey got his first clear look at the gap suddenly he felt dizzy it was a sheer dropoff hundreds no thou sands of feet down to a bottom shrouded in fog the morning sunbeams cut sharply across the cliffs of it look ing like sparkling ramps to the depths the stream plunged over the edge and plummeted so far that there was no sound of its landing no wonder they needed time to find a safe way into it somehow i dont think were in florida any more toto he murmured awed how could he explain this in terms of the closetosealevel terrain they had ridden through on the way to no name key what ivy asked over the wind of their motion be side that terrifying descent her greenish hair was flutter ing back in his face man from mundania the ramparts of my disbelief have just taken a hit he explained its about time the goblins burst into view again trying to cut them off but donkey made a phenomenal leap and sailed over their heads and landed running again they were left be hind but they did not give up they charged along the brink of the great chasm waving their clubs and throwing their rocks which were missing by a lessthancomfortable margin there it is donkey cried drawing up before a nar row side crack that extended from the major gap grey looked there was a little path that crept down from the crack and found some rubble at the edge of the main chasm it did seem to wind on down but they would have to go single file and slowly the goblins would be upon them long before they could complete any part of that tortuous descent theres a great multiflavor pie tree ivy said ill enhance it and hold them off with pies while you two get down ill hold them off grey said but you dont believe in the magic she protested those are crabapple pies pepperpot piesthey can be really effective if i i believe in you grey said firmly and im begin ning to wonder about magic now just get out of here if i cant make a stand to defend the woman i love what good am i she looked ready to argue but the centaur spoke hes right he can do it you go down first ivy made her decision no you go first donkey ill follow right after ive enhanced that tree without further word the centaur started down the path sand and pebbles skidded out under his hooves and slid down the cliffside but the path held ivy ran to the tree and flung her arms about its trunk grey rubbed his eyes he could have sworn the pies were growing becoming larger and better defined in seconds then ivy stepped clear follow as soon as you can r man from mundania man from mundania she said ill fetch stanley so if youre in doubt just keep throwing pies at them she kissed him fleetingly im enhancing your strength aim and endurance be lieve in me then she was gone into the crack believe in her when she put it that way he had to the goblins were already appearing grey looked at the tree now his eyes seemed much more finely attuned he recognized every variety of pie he grabbed a pepperpot pie whose peppers looked huge the first goblin charged up waving his club ill de stroy ya creep the goblin yelled grey calmly threw the pie in his face the peppers puffed into powder the goblin broke into a spasm of sneezing he sneezed so hard that his little body flew backwards into the goblin behind him and a cloud of pep per surrounded them both soon several goblins were sneezingand several sneezed themselves right off the brink of the precipice well now this seemed to work well enough the gob lins seemed to have used up all their stones and there were none nearby for them to pick up that meant that they were confined to their clubs which meant they had to get close to be effective which meant in turn that he could score on a goblin with a pie before a goblin could score with a club there were about thirty goblins but the approach was narrow so that only one could come at him at a time he felt like horatius at the bridge the bold roman gate keeper who had held off the attacking etruscan army while the romans chopped down the bridge that was the only access to the city one man could indeed hold off an armyif the army had to send just one man against him at a time and he was able to slay that man but he had to be good ivys enhancement really seemed to have taken be cause he felt phenomenally good his aim with the first pie had been perfect and he felt strength to heave them much farther if he needed to he felt like a superman maybe it was the power of love goblins beware the goblins completed their sneezing the cloud of pep per had finally dissipated that one pie seemed to have taken out about three of them maybe it wasnt magic but it had worked well enough a goblin charged him club lifted grey quickly plucked a crabapple pie chose his moment and hurled it with uncanny accuracy at the little brute it smote the nasty little man right in the face and the apple fell awayexcept for a crab pincer that had fastened on the goblins ugly nose youff the goblin cried spinning around and banging into the one behind him you sure are crabby the other retorted ill crab you the first exclaimed he ripped the pin cer off his nose and thrust it at the others eye the pincer snapped at the eyeball oh yeah the second exclaimed swinging at the first with his club there was a melee in the course of which three more goblins fell off the edge another goblin charged grey grey plucked a popcorn pie and hurled it again with stunning accuracy he was amazed at himself he had never been a hurler like this if it wasnt ivys enhancement what else could account for it the pie struck the goblin on the chest and the popcorn popped like a series of tiny firecrackers bits of puffed corn flew into his face and beyond him into the faces of the ones following yet another spot quarrel broke out as one goblin blamed his neighbor for the corn and swung his club two more goblins fell off the ledge grey discovered that he liked this type of combat it was mainly the goblins own omeriness that got them boosted into the chasm if they just quit coming no more would be hurt he had plenty of pies remaining another goblin charged grey picked a pecan pie once more his aim and force were uncanny he scored on the goblins big head before the creature got at all close the pie crust clanged like a can and its contents soaked the goblin with yellow juice oooo ugh the goblin cried outraged you peed on me j man from mundama so that was the magic of the pecan he had assumed it was a nut pie well he had been wrong he was glad he hadnt tried to eat it other goblins charged in turn he picked other pies and shoved them in their faces long distance he should have been tired by this time but he wasnt his strength was maintaining just as had that of the centaur he hurled a shoefly pie and its shoe kicked the rear of a goblin and booted the goblin over the edge he threw a papaya pie and it sang im papaya the sailor man and whistled as it slugged the goblin at last he was down to two pies having used all the rest three goblins remained he knew he couldnt afford to let even one remain above while he descended the path because that one could scuff the sand and perhaps start a little avalanche that would destroy his route how could he be sure of taking out three with only two pies well he would just have to go hand to hand with the last one he glanced at the pies one was custard the other pineapple neither looked promising but they would have to do he picked the custard custards last stand he cried as he heaved it at the charging goblin the custard struck squarely on the ugly face the gloppy stuff wrapped itself around the bulbous head and clung tenaciously the goblin pawed at it trying to get his eyes clear but before he succeeded he stepped off the cliff and was gone only the fading sound of his cussing remained well it was a cusstard pie the last two goblins consisted of the subchief who had tried to stop them before and one henchman charge him together and one of us will get him he said but theres no room yes there is if we charge slowly and carefully and keep in step and indeed there was this way for the narrow ledge had been widened by the tramp of the prior goblins big feet the two approached carefully grey was worried the enemy had finally gotten smart he had only the one pie left and while he could score on one goblin the other would be able to charge him from man from mundania close range and perhaps sweep him off the ledge in the manner of a football blocker these goblins didnt seem to care what losses they took as long as they got him well he would just have to use what he had he picked the pineapple pie and hefted it he would throw it at the subchief who was surely the more cunning and motivated of the two then he would handle the other in whatever way he could watch outthats a pineapple the subchief cried both goblins halted then they started backing away grey was surprised was this a ruse were they pre tending fear so that he would relax and then they would turn on him and catch him off guard he resolved not to be drawn out of position the two goblins retreated all the way back out of sight this was curious indeed what were they up to he didnt dare try to follow thembut if he started down the path they could return at any moment and wreak mischief on his head maybe he could fake them out he got down on the path then squatted so that he could duck down into the small crevice they would think he had started down when he hadnt then when they came he could smite one of them with the pie he waited sure enough soon he heard them returning he waited until they sounded close enough then stood up pie ready the two goblins were therebut so was another crea ture it looked like a male sheep with horrendously broad and curled horns the subchief spied him so it was a trick mundane you cant fool a cunning goblin and your pie cant stop this battering ram the sheep charged head down a battering ram that certainly could knock him off the edge grey poised with the pie decided to ditch it maybe the ram would hurtle right past him if he ducked at the last moment he hurled the pie over the head of the ram at the two waiting goblins it struck the subchiefand detonated man from mundania man from mundania juice and pineapple bits exploded outward and both gob lins were blown off the edge so that was the pun in pineapple it was made of gre nades he should have guessed no wonder the goblins had been so wary of it but his distraction caused him to wait too long the battering ram was almost upon him unstoppable and he had no time to dodge it no he cried it cant end like this the ram set his hooves and skidded to a stop just as he reached grey he was so close that his nose nudged greys nose why youre just an ordinary sheep grey said pet ting the animal you dont mean me any harm now that the goblins are gone why dont you go off and graze the ram nodded almost as if he understood and com menced browsing on the adjacent foliage no battering ram at all now at last it was safe to start down the path grey proceeded it turned out to be a tricky descent but manageable he saw the centaurs hoofprints and now and then ivys so would have known he was on the right trail had there been any doubt the face of the cliff was awesome but the path was secure and he did not feel the fright of heights he might have he wondered about that he felt better and had done better than he ever would have expected he had been cool and poised throughout and handled the goblins almost perfectly ivy had said she would enhance him and he did seem enhancedbut could his love for her account for it and those piesthey had acted in ways real pies never would have science would be strained to account for those effects but magic had no problem as for that centaur how could anything but magic account for him there was such a thing as gene splicing but it didnt work that way a man could not be grafted onto a horse not in this cen tury and of course there was the gap chasm he was now climbing down into he could not doubt its reality but how could he have come to it in the real world if this were a mere amusement park setting how could there be anything of this sheer scale was he coming to believe in magic after all maybe he was because ivy did and he did love her if she loved him enough to marry him he should love her enough to share her belief maybe that didnt make much objective sense but it made a lot of emotional sense at last he made it down to the base of the chasm as afternoon was setting in where had ivy and donkey gone he knew the answer ivy had mounted donkey enhanced him and he had galloped off indefatigably to locate the gap dragon it might be a while before they found that creature he looked around the bottom of the chasm was like a long narrow valley with green grass and a river crossing it from the stream they had followed above he walked to it and threw himself down for a drink beside it grew some lady slipper plants with an assortment of delicate feminine slippers farther along was a potato chip bush goodhe was hungry too he sat down beside it and started picking and eating the chips magic if this was magical yes he believed in magic now at last he was tired whatever reserve of strength he had drawn on was gone and he needed to rest he leaned against a stone and relaxed his eye traced the short course of the river across the valley cleft it did not turn to run along the valley but continued on up the far cliff in a reverse waterfall finally disappearing over the top that was nice no sense in flooding the gap in case there was no decent exit for the water his eyes closed he hoped ivy and donkey returned soon certainly it was pointless to go looking for them he had to wait right here where they could find him up the cliff suddenly he blinked awake looking again across the valley then he lurched to his feet and followed the river across there was no doubt the water made a rightangle turn and sailed upwards in a geyser it did not fall back to earth man from mundania as a real geyser would rather it seemed to slow as it neared the top and to curve finding the brink and going beyond it grey shook his head now it was clear he had better believe in magic otherwise he would believe he was crazy he returned to the rock near the potato chip bush and settled down again in a moment he was deep in a snooze he woke to the sound of a series of thuds that shook the ground whomp whomp whomp he jumped up alarmed he didnt like the sound of that something was definitely coming in the dusk he saw steam blowing upward in gusts that must be the gap dragonbut where was ivy then donkey galloped up here he is the centaur cried spying grey immediately the dragon veered it had a horrendous big head from which the steam puffed regularly and a long supple torsoand there riding the top of one arcing coil was ivy the dragon slowed as it came up ivy dismounted and ran across to grey you made it she cried as she tack led him in a breathknocking hug i was so worried uh nothing to it grey said i mean after you enhanced those pies for me and enhanced me too so i could handle all those goblins she looked at him her face shining you mean you believe i guess i do now i mean after what ive seen she kissed him passionately oh wonderful she exclaimed between kisses now its perfect then she introduced him to the dragon this is stan ley steamer the gap dragon she said hugging the dra gons horrendous head the steam stopped for a moment the dragon was evidently holding his breath so as not to bum her and stanley this is grey murphy my be trothed the dragon acknowledged with a twin jet of steam through his nostrils it seemed that any friend of ivys was a friend of his this was just as well because man from mundania he had a huge mouthful of teeth and great claws on every one of his six feet this was certainly no creature to run afoul of then they settled down for the night because the dark ness was closing the top of the chasm walls remained bright but the shadow started below the dragon curled around them and the three piled pillows ivy found and lay in the center it was very nice yes the river does flow uphill here ivy explained in the morning its the only way it can get out of the gap theres another larger river further east that goes the opposite way we could ride one of them up but that really isnt safe so well just have to take the tedious footpath up near the invisible bridge invisible bridge she smiled ill show it to you when we get there in fact well cross the gap on it because the path up is really better on the north side then well be on the en chanted path and on our way to castle roogna but then she sobered abruptly looking pensive is something wrong grey asked nothing that hasnt been wrong from the outset she said enigmatically dont concern yourself about it then she smiled and kissed him and his attempted con cern was dissipated before he could express it it did not take long to get to their gap exit for grey rode donkey and ivy rode the dragon seehere it is ivy said pointing upward the bridge grey looked there was nothing there but of course it was supposed to be invisible so that made sensehe hoped they dismounted ivy hugged the dragon farewell it was evident that there was a deep and abiding friendship between this damsel and this dragon grey almost felt jeal ous of it he had come so recently on the scene while they had been friends ivy said since she was three four teen years then they climbed the path up the side it was a better path than the other and it was possible for them to walk man from mundania side by side in sections of it still it was a long wearing climb this must be a lot like the grand canyon tired ivy asked and he had to admit he was not anymore she said squeezing his arm and in deed he felt new strength her enhancement really did work it was easy to appreciate it now that he believed they reached the top and ivy led the way to the bridge suddenly she stepped into the air above the chasm grey cried out in alarm then saw she was standing not falling there really was a bridge there grey and donkey followed her the bridge had hand rails and was quite secure when he shut his eyes grey was quite satisfied with its solidity only when he opened his eyes and looked down down way far down did he get dizzy so he focused on ivy no uncomfortable task and walked on across without looking down again at the far side ivy turned back to wave to stanley far below the dragon responded with a great puff of steam then it was time to follow the magic path to castle roogna chapter ultimatum i hey walked along the familiar enchanted path within a day they would reach castle roogna especially if she enhanced donkey again so he could carry them swiftly but ivy intended to spend one more night on the road because she was afraid of what would happen when they arrived she saw that grey and donkey were tiring and that was natural she had enhanced them before so that donkey could carry them rapidly and grey could fight off the gob lins but that had to be followed by a period of rest and they hadnt had enough theres a nice coventree near here she said brightly lets camp for the night the two were happy to agree perhaps they had their own doubts about the encounter at castle roogna the coventree was off the enchanted path but was it self enchanted to be safe for travelers and it served as a way station indeed it served as a place of exile for those out of favor with queen irene they had to remain there until she suffered a change of heart which might not occur swiftly ivy had spent more than one night here when she pushed her luck too far and dolph had often been sent here for trying to peek into nadas room at night he would change into something small like a spider and try to crawl through a crack hoping to catch her in panties the truth man from mundania was that he had seen her without her clothing often enough before she ever came to castle roogna but now she was a guest of the estate and he was underage so the sight of her panties was forbidden ivy thought the whole busi ness was funny but her mother took it more seriously the tree was enormous with a huge spreading top that was watertight and large curling branches that made ex cellent supports for pillows the temperature within its environment was fairly constant it cooled some at night and warmed some by day but not as much as the outside forest did there were numerous fruit and nut trees nearby and edible plants such as sugar beets and honey suckles it was an excellent place to camp when a person wasnt sent here as punishment they foraged for supper then harvested some pillows and went to niches in the separate branches no branch was large enough for two people to use together unfor tunately but they were very comfortable for single occu pancies by unvoiced common consent they did not talk about the morrow it would come too soon so it was on that soon morrow they arrived in ner vously good order at castle roogna grey and donkey were rested and clean and ivy had brushed out her hair with a bottlebrush from a bush as well as she could now what was to happen would happen they were expected of course ivy knew that her little brother would have been tracking her via the tapestry once she entered xanth proper it might have taken him a while to locate her because she had been out of xanth for so long and he would not have known exactly where to look but probably within a day or so he had found her had they not succeeded in getting clear of the goblins on their own help would have come why hadnt her parents sent out a party to fetch her in sooner ivy knew why because they had seen her with grey and wanted to study the situation she had been aware that someone was probably watching when she teased grey and kissed him so ardently she wanted them to have no doubt about the nature of her relationship with grey man from mundania this was in fact her first truly major act of defiance of her parents taking up with a mundane it was bound to send shock waves of scandal reverberating throughout castle roogna and the length and breadth of xanth of all the mischief she might have gotten into this was just about the most treacherous the princess and the mun dane this was going to be no fun session coming up dolph came out to meet them at the bridge over the moat he was excruciatingly neatly dressed and his hair was freshly combed a thing seldom seen i am glad to discover you safe ivy he said formally thank you dolph she said as formally she turned to her companions this is donkey centaur who helped me escape a problem with goblins and this is grey my betrothed i am so happy to meet you both dolph said ex tending his hand to each in turn then he leaned close to ivy whew you really did it this time dummy he said confidentially moms fuming if you thought i was in hot water when i came home with nada and electra wait till you feel yours tough tickle squirt she replied in the same low tone you better back me up if you know whats good for you he pretended to consider weeeell ill tell mom about that time you i know whats good for me he agreed hastily then they both laughed ivy knew that her little brother was thrilled to see her with boytrouble after his three years of girltrouble there was never any doubt about his support then nada and electra came out as befitted juvenile protocol both were nicely dressed and mannered for this occasion this was normal for nada but not for electra this is nada princess of the naga ivy said and saw both grey and donkey take stock as nada smiled for she had become beautiful recently and electra elec tra was merely cute to her perpetual annoyance my brothers betrothees man from mundania which one donkey asked evidently having missed this nuance of the situation before both ivy explained he hasnt chosen between them yet that was an oversimplification but it would do for now they walked on into the castle theyre in the throne room dolph said unnecessarily you better have your lines rehearsed before they throw you in the dungeon ivy did not dignify that remark with a response she rehearsed her lines mentally they trekked to the throne room king dor and queen irene were there gravely awaiting them their faces were contrivedly neutral ivy gulped let me do the talking she whispered to grey fat chance the tile she stood on retorted grey looked startled my fathers talent ivy explained quickly talking to the inanimateand having it talk back and does it ever talk back some of his magic collects where he goes often like this doorway any idiot knows that the tile sneered shut up you deadwood or i stomp you ivy whis pered fiercely yeah id like to see you try puddingbrain ivy lifted a foot threateningly with a lady slipper the tile demanded get on with you or ill blab what color your panties are dont you dare ivy snapped furiously ill stomp it grey offered im wearing thick hard soled mundane shoes the tile was abruptly silent i think you have a way with these things ivy said smiling then she squared her shoulders set her little chin and marched on into the throne room grey followed and donkey silently they took their places before the two thrones ivys parents surveyed them for what seemed like half an eternity her father was not a large manin fact he was about greys sizebut was horrendously regal in his crown man from mundania and royal robe her mother was stunning with her green hair and green gown ivy had always been secretly jealous of irenes generous proportions ivy herself was relatively modestly endowed but her mothers eyes were narrowed a sure sign of mischief at last king dor spoke welcome home daughter please introduce your companions ivy turned and indicated the centaur this is donkey centaur whom we rescued from the goblinate of the golden horde and who in turn protected us from recap ture by carrying us clear of that region i hope he will be welcome at castle roogna king dor focused on donkey are you of good char acter donkey of course your majesty then you are welcome here you may use the orchard freely and one of the castle staff will show you the prem ises i shall assign queen irene nudged him he glanced where she indi cated perhaps electra will volunteer for that task for electra was bouncing on her toes back near the door her hand raised eagerly of course she wanted to exchange rides for information the girl was fifteen but looked as young as dolph and retained her childish ways she could be a lot of fun donkey would like her ivy swallowed and this is grey of mundania my betrothed there was a distinctly awkward silence then dors throne spoke oooo what a scandal no princess ever irene kicked it with the side of her foot and it shut up but there was a low snickering from other artifacts in the room the inanimate was enjoying this situation we shall discuss that matter at another time irene said grey it may be that my daughter has not made her situation clear to you do you understand the problem we have with mundanes of course he does ivy said quickly i told irene flashed a look at her which had the same effect as the kick at the throne for much the same reason ivy had to stand aside man from mundania your majesty ivy told me that she was a princess of xanth a land where magic works grey said carefully did you believe her irene put in grey spread his hands in the mundane way he had i believed she believed and you did not magic doesnt work in mundania your majesty you are evading the issue young man irene snapped grey jumped guiltily i uh did not believe her dor tapped his fingers on the armrest of his throne do you believe her now yes your majesty so now you want to marry her irene demanded uh yes ivy gritted her teeth how awful that made him look why grey was surprised because i love her he said in spite of her being a princess irene seemed ready to burst ivy quailed in spite of irene inquired well she told me how complicated it would be and really id rather uh have her all to myself but she is what she is and i guess ill have to live with it both king and queen stared at him ivy closed her eyes this was going even worse than she had feared so you consider it a liability to be a princessor a queen irene said with deceptive calmness the decora tive exotic plants set around the throne room writhed sen sitive to the building storm yes your majesty im sorry if i have offended you but thats the way i see it i mean its such a big respon sibility in such a weird land irene shot a look at ivy did he ask you to marry him before or after he believed you were a princess ivy laughed embarrassed neither mother i asked him before he believed irene exchanged a glance with her husband she shook her head as if bewildered then she focused again on grey there is a great deal more to be decided on this matter man from mundania and we have not yet come to a decision but i think it is safe to say that we like you grey of mundania ivys mouth dropped open uh thanks grey said king dor stood this audience is at an end grey was given a bed in dolphs room though there were chambers free ivy didnt protest she had been afraid grey would not be allowed to stay in castle roogna probably this was her parents way of chaperoning one boy or the other or both at any rate she did not get to see grey for a while but knew he was in good hands she went to her room eager to get properly cleaned up and changed she knew that her mundane clothing was a poor outfit for a princess even when clean and this was not she had hardly entered when there was a knock its your father the door said let him in she said smiling it was nice to be back where the parts of the building talked the door opened and king dor entered ivy ran to him and flung herself into his arms in the formal encounter in the throne room she had had to be proper and princessly and this was back to normal oh daddy i missed you i think not as much as we missed you he replied hugging her tightly when we were unable to trace you we realized that you were either in the gourd or in mun dania when you didnt call in we knew it wasnt the gourd that meant trouble but there was no way to locate you let alone reach you your mother was having connip tions ivy had to smile at that conniptions were nasty little things that floated in to pester anyone who was severely upset they were harmless but messy and queen irene would have been acutely embarrassed to have them there i was in mundania all right she agreed i think murphys curse interfered with the heaven cent again and garbled where it sent me so i went where a mundane named murphy needed a girl instead of where good ma gician humfrey was murphy you said his name is grey man from mundania grey murphy mundanes use two names he helped me return to xanth and then i brought him in i knew i shouldnt but i liked him hes a nice boy but you know you cant marry him where is it written that a xanthian cant marry a mun dane she flared oh a xanthmundania union is possible but the rules for princesses are more stringent there would be turmoil in the kingdom if you became king and were married to a mundane ivy sighed i know but maybe dolph can be king instead or maybe some other magician will turn up if that happens you will still be needed as a reserve we have too few magicians and sorceresses we must con serve every one so you must maintain your eligibility this is part of your responsibility as princess and a sor ceress you know that ivy sighed she did know it she had been carried away by her emotion of the moment and pretended that the somber realities of her position did not exist but they did but i cant tell grey no after i asked him you may not need to once he understands the com plete picture because he will break it off himself she said yes he seems to be a man of integrity and con science yes he is she flared thats why i love him i understand how you feel but you know it isnt enough ivy nodded soberly she knew king dor left but ivy hardly had time to get cleaned and changed before her mother showed up again there was the embrace then they sat down on the bed for se rious woman talk how did it happen irene asked you know how mother first i saw he was decent then i saw that he liked me only for myself you know how rare that is here in xanth i know dear i marked your father for marriage when i was a child because of his position if he hadnt been man from mundania slated to be king some day neither i nor your grandma iris would have given him a second thought then it was a challenge to land him of course but that was excellent sport i guess it worked out ivy said but i sort of wanted to marry for love oh there was love i have always loved your father and he loved me though we sometimes had strange ways of showing it but it was his position that enabled it but for me there was no magician and anyone else well i just wanted romance and thats what i found i do understand dear but you know it cannot be there has to be a way ivy said not really believing it somehow some way her mother merely smiled sadly and left ivy tried to rest but could not so she went to nadas room nada greeted her with a fierce giriish hug then they talked it is an irony nada remarked i dont love your brother but will marry him you do love grey but cant marry him if only we could exchange emotions that wouldnt work ivy pointed out grey and electra would be left over and greys not a prince nada agreed for electra had to marry a prince or die why do we get into such picklements ivy asked rhetorically it may be the nature of princesses ivy had to laugh nada was just about the best thing that had happened to her in recent years because she was indeed a princess and ivys age with a perfect under standing of all her concerns how did it happen nada inquired after a moment i was stuck there in mundania and it was so drear and grey was so nice i sort of encouraged him because i wanted his help but the more i got to know him the better i liked him then when he helped me return to xanth and he didnt believe in magic or that i was a princess but still liked me i just kept liking him more i knew it was foolish but i didnt want to give him up one man from mundania man from mundania thing led to another she shrugged i guess it sort of sneaked up on me not very romantic after all it will do nada said with a sigh my betrothal was not romantic at all for it had been a political liaison but i do love him ivy said and i know my folks wont let me marry him oh nada what am i to do elope nada asked ivy stared at her do you think its possible possible yes the question is whether its desirable it would mean alienating my folks i would never get to be king but if you dont i will lose grey ivy considered the alternatives oh nada i cant give up either my folks or grey nada just looked at her understanding in the evening she met grey for the formal meal he was with dolph of course so she couldnt kiss him they were on palace rules she took his arm and dolph hooked up with nada electra seemed satisfied to walk with don key your brother is most talented grey said as they walked to the dining room he has been showing me his forms and we have talked ivy made a wry face i hope it wasnt too boring no it was very interesting he says there is only one thing to do dont say it ivy warned how like her brother to blab about the elopement grey shrugged yes i told him it was foolish but he says tomorrow we must all go to your room and verify it with the tapestry verify this sounded odd was her brother already planning an escape route for her he says donkey and electra are hot on it too they actually believe it will work they arent princesses ivy remarked dryly he glanced at her curiously what does that have to do with it they were in public so she couldnt answer fortu nately they were just arriving at the dining room so she didnt have to ill explain later she said but in the evening nada come to see her oh ivy electra told me they could be right about eloping you know thats complicated no about finding a talent for grey finding ayou mean thats what grey was talking about yes dolph thought of it and he told electra and she told donkey of course a notion doesnt have to make any sense to thrill dolph or electra but donkeys a centaur if he thinks its possible wed better take notice if grey had a talent your folks wouldnt be able to oppose your marriage because hed be just as good as anybody else ivy quelled her hope knowing it would only hurt her worse if it flew and crashed greys a mundane they have no magic donkey says that all assumptions have to be periodi cally questioned for centuries it was thought that centaurs had no talents but when they questioned it they discov ered that they did have magic if they just accepted it the centaurs of centaur isle still refuse to believe it but they are mistaken so maybe that is also the case with mun danes i dont think so ivy said many mundanes entered xanth when grandpa trent assumed the throne and he checked thoroughly but couldnt find a single magic talent in any of them their children have talents but not the original generation later he even had me enhance some of them to see if that would make their talents manifest but it didnt mundanesjust dont have magic well it wont hurt to check nada said ivy didnt argue but she knew it was a hopeless quest in the morning after breakfast they all piled into ivys room to view the tapestry grey dolph donkey nada and electra see there are some dis dis dolph started discontinuities donkey supplied in the record dolph continued excited we cant man from mundania man from mundania follow you into the gourd because the tapestry doesnt register dreams but we can trace your whole trip in xanth if thats okay with you why not ivy said but i really dont see what it will prove she suspected that her little brother wanted to peek at any mushy stuff she might have had with grey so lets go back to the beginning dolph said when you switched places with the giant the tapestry obligingly showed the picture of girard giant lying with his chin propped on a fist staring into the tiny gourd then he was gone and ivy and grey stood where his head had been they watched as the two of them made their way out of the clearing they saw grey blunder into the curse buns and then get rid of them wasnt that magic dolph demanded he nulled them all nobody ever did that before no such luck grey said i merely threatened them with my penknife if theres any magic its in the knife the picture on the tapestry froze becoming mere col ored thread a magic knife dolph asked we should look at that how would a mundane knife be magic donkey asked grey brought it out i pretended it was magic but that was a bluff i didnt believe in magic see it is just an ordinary penknife he unfolded the little blade we can test it dolph said ivy enhance it ivy took the knife and concentrated on it nothing hap pened i think its dead she said its not responding at all let me try it donkey said i have tough hooves so have had to use a magic blade to trim them theyve gotten overgrown since ive been on my own if this can cut them it may be magic the centaur held the knife carefully and bent down to reach his right forehoof which he set on one of ivys chairs he carved at the edge of the hoof which was in deed somewhat ragged the knife slid across the hoof without cutting in don key tried again with greater pressure this time the blade dug in but wouldnt cut it was lodged in its niche no magic i can fathom donkey said maybe its not the blade its grey dolph said ea geriy thats what were trying to prove you know see if grey can cut your hoof let a nonspecialist cut my hoof donkey asked ap palled just to see if he has magic don electra said cajol ingly the centaur yielded it was evident that the two had become very close in the past day ivy realized that after three years playing second to nada electra was delighted to have a new friend this did not affect her betrothal to dolph of course she loved him and would die if she did not marry him but in other respects she was an ordinary gid with ordinary feelings ivy was not as close to her as she was to nada but it was true that electra brightened castle roogna and was a lot of fun grey took the knife you want me to cut a sliver off your hoof he asked uncertainly my knife is sharp it should be able to do that my hoof is magically hard donkey said thats not my talent my talent is to change the color of my hooves he demonstrated and the brown became green then red oooo ivy and nada said together delighted but then how dolph asked all centaurs have magically hard hooves donkey explained its part of being centaur like having perfect aim with the bow and superior intellectual abilities it doesnt count as a talent well it seems to me that a sharp knife should cut a hoof grey said magic or not thats the way of knives and hooves he put the knife to the hoof and carefully carved a cud of hoof appeared there dolph exclaimed he did it hes magic no im not grey said resolutely i just know whats what i knew this knife would cut that hoof man from mundania man from mundania but that knife wouldnt cut for me donkey pro tested because you thought it wouldnt grey said it was psychological you could cut it if you really tried donkey turned grim grey had insulted him but elec tra jumped in she caught the centaurs arm getting his attention and drew herself close to his ear hes mun dane she reminded him they dont know about man ners grey looked up now wait nada interceded approaching grey in much the same manner she means that different things bother different people some of us dont like to be called reptilian others dont like to have their integrity questioned reptilian grey asked distracted indeed nada hardly looked the part she was wearing the kind of dress that would have sagged on ivy showing contours that tended to make men stop in their tracks and ponder na ture ivy felt a tinge of possessiveness and jealousy then she had another thought and suppressed it if grey could be distracted by someone like nada perhaps it was best that it happen it might be better than the present problem donkey stepped back in i am sure i misunderstood i apologize for mistaking your meaning grey looked at ivy alarmed ivy remembered the joke she had played on him using the brassie mode of apology she burst out laughing the others looked puzzled then nada caught on brassies she said then with mischief did i embarrass you grey no you didnt ivy cried after that they all were laughing obviously grey didnt want to be hugged and kissed by the centaur and ivy didnt want nada doing it to him either what i meant grey said determinedly when they settled down again was not any questioning of your in tegrity donkey but that we all are affected by what we believe i could not believe in magic for the longest time because it doesnt exist in mundania you can not believe in the sharpness of my knife because maybe you dont have experience with mundane steel but now that you have seen it work you could do the same yourself let me try it again donkey said a trifle tightly he took the knife and carved exactly the way grey had hold ing the blade more firmly to the hoof a similar curl of hoof appeared you see grey said no magic just sharpness and confidence you now believe in my knife the way i believe in magic tentatively i take your point donkey said relaxing may i borrow this knife this is an opportunity i should not let pass by to get my hooves in shape certainly grey said but we may have to find a sharpening stone if it gets dull theres one in the dungeon electra said eagerly dolph frowned do you know what youve done grey youve just cherrybombed my proof that you had magic grey shrugged thats because i dont have magic we all know that no we dont dolph insisted lets get on with the viewing the tapestry resumed its animation ivy noted that with a certain annoyance her little brother was getting entirely too good at controlling it he had to have been watching it a great deal during her absence so your knife is sharp dolph said but look how those curse burrs fall they dont care about sharpness they stick you no matter what so well i cowed them grey said they knew i had the knife and was ready to use it so they gave up that wasnt magic that was intimidation what dolph asked he scared them donkey said translating as he carved his hoof oh disgruntled dolph returned to the tapestry they watched the episode of the twolips tree one flower kissed grey but the others did not how about that dolph asked he turned them off man from mundania grey smiled ruefully sure after the first one got a taste of me the others wanted nothing to do with me thats not magic thats bo thats what he stunk donkey said translating again ivy and nada managed to keep straight faces but a titter squeezed out through electras hands clapped over her mouth dolph oddly did not find it funny he returned grimly to the tapestry the figures in the scene proceeded to the sandy region the sandman rose up assumed the forms of a small ogre a holy cow and a nonentitree then collapsed back into a mound when grey touched it see see dolph cried he destroyed it thats magic it was an illusion grey said when i touched it it stopped as illusions do no credit to me no credit to you dolph agreed displeased the tapestry figures went to the tangle tree it was sated ivy said before dolph could make a case about its quiescence well i can check that dolph said resolutely the picture focused on the tree running backwards the day brightened and dimmed and brightened again and dimmed again seeno captures dolph said that tree hadnt eaten in days so it could have been dormantor sick ivy said or maybe the magic didnt work very well around grey be cause he was fresh from mundania no proof of magic donkey nodded it does seem possible natives of xanth relate well to magic having experienced it all their lives but mundanes may have a depressive effect that wont remain now that grey accepts magic dolph buzzed the scene forward until the two of them were captured by the goblins theres donkey electra exclaimed they watched as ivy was put on the isle and then as grey waded through the pool to reach her man from mundania isnt that romantic nada breathed as the two em braced on the isle thats when we became betrothed ivy said thrilled again by the sight it was no hate spring after all but i was so relieved no hate spring dolph asked let me check oh dont waste more time ivy said but the scene was already revving back he was really making that old tapestry jump the days and nights flickered byand abruptly stopped at a variant of the scene whats that ivy asked earlier captives dolph said i made it do a seek on that subject this must be before donkey was cap tured it is the centaur agreed the scene was of the goblins of the golden horde dragging two captives to the spring they were elves male and female they were brought before the chief the tap estry did not make sound so the words were lost but it looked as if the elves were a couple who had been trav eling together they were young and the man was hand some and the maid was pretty and they stayed close together lovers or newly married going from one elf elm to another perhaps to visit kin they would have run afoul of the goblin trails and gotten trapped the goblins did the same thing they had done with ivy and grey they boated the girl to the isle and left her there then turned him loose at the edge the man was in obvious distress as was the giri should he try to cross to her or leave her the goblins were gloating and their big cook pot was boiling the elf decided to call the bluff he waded into the water crossedand threw the giri into it she charged out and attacked him while the goblins applauded they watched in horror as the two elves fought there was no doubt they now hated each other soon the man held the girl under until she drowned then charged out of the pool to attack the goblins they hurled spears at him bringing him down and dumped his body into the pot they used a line with a hook on it to catch her floating man from mundania body and haul it out then dumped clean water over it to clear the hate water and dumped it into another boiling pot the picture faded into a neutral plaid pattern the six young folk stared at each other their eyes and mouths round with horror there seemed to be no doubt about it the spring was hate grey worked his mouth i uh it didnt do that to us so maybe it worked on the elves because they believed it would in that case it would have worked on ivy donkey pointed out no it didnt work on me because i didnt believe in it and then she didnt believe in it but the others were uncertain i think its realand you had magic to null it dolph said they discussed it and found themselves in doubt and divided had grey used magic to null the hate spring or had something else depleted its power they could not decide in due course the parents were ready to give their ver dict grey and ivy stood before them in the throne room and king dor said what he had obviously been coached to say we can not sanction a marriage between a princess of xanth who is a sorceress and a common man who has no magic we do not seek to dictate our daughters choice of a man to marry and have no personal objection to the one she has chosen who strikes us as a fine young man but in the interest of xanth we must insist that she marry either a prince or a man with a significant magic talent we therefore deliver this ultimatum demonstrate that this man grey of mundania is either a recognized prince or has a magic talent until one of these conditions is met this marriage will not have our sanction ivy looked at her father then at grey she could neither defy her parents nor give up her love she stood there and her throat was too choked for her to speak and the tears overflowed her eyes and coursed down her cheeks man from mundania grey spoke i have come to understand a little about your magic land he said ivy knew with a sick certainty that he was going to do the decent thing i think i could leam to love it as i love your daughter i accept your ultimatum as fair ivy is not a woman she is a princess and she must do what is best for xanth i am neither a prince nor a sorcerer and can never be either therefore i wait dolph cried from behind queen irenes eyes snapped to him this is not your decision she said tightly you have your own decision to make but it is my business dolph said rebelliously be cause ivys my sister and i love her and i think youre wrong about grey i think he has magic i dont care where hes from i want to find that magic irene glanced at dor who shrugged allow me to point out son she said with a certain parental emphasis that bode ill for his future freedom that there is no time limit on this ultimatum grey has as long as he needs to find magic it is merely that he may not have our approval to marry ivy until he does any more than you may marry before you clarify your own situation yes so grey should not break the betrothal until we get this straight i think he has a talent and i know how he can find it if you are referring to the episode of the hate spring irene said evenly the evidence is inconclusive we have no way of judging the potency of that spring at the time they were there it may have variable potency depending on the season or other factors no i mean he has to have magic because of the heaven cent now everyone was interested even ivy herself what wild notion had her little brother come up with this time the heaven cent appears to have been fouled by mur phys curse irene said we have noted the alignment of the names it is indeed the kind of thing that can happen when magic goes wrong the cent will have to be re man from mundania charged before the search for the good magician is re sumed i dont think it fouled up dolph said i think the cent worked it sent ivy to the place she was most needed mundania where grey needed her we thought the good magician needed her most because of his message to me but maybe that wasnt so or maybe grey is supposed to help find the good magician so he must have the magic we need to do that ivy gazed at him astonished dolphs crazy notion might just be right she saw that the others were just as surprised so we should take him to parnassus to ask the muse of history what talent is listed for him dolph concluded triumphantly again irene exchanged a glance with dor again he shrugged grey may go to parnassus to inquire irene said after a moment certainly we bear him no malice and stand ready to facilitate any effort he wishes to make on his behalf we shall arrange suitable transportation for him but you prince dolph will remain here you have not yet resolved your own dilemma awwww irenes hair seemed to turn a darker shade of green ooo youve done it now you impertinent boy one of the thrones said youll never irenes kick cut it off but ivy was looking at grey for the first time with gen uine hope she would go with him of course maybe the muse really did have a talent listed for him after all if the heaven cent had not fouled up and this was part of the good magicians plan grey might indeed she was not even aware of the termination of the audi ence she was too busy hugging grey wild with hope chapter parnassus rey was torn he loved ivy and wanted to stay in this magic land but knew he didnt qualify the decent thing to do was to call it off with ivy and return to drear mudania and the horror of freshman english he knew he didnt have any magic but now with ivy holding him and dolph so excited about proving he did have magic he found it all too easy to go along at least it would mean some more time with her what was this parnassus there had been some kind of assignment relating to that in school but he had just skimmed over it without comprehension as usual some thing greek a mountain in greece where people went to see the oracle that was all he could dredge up ivy set about organizing it dolph could not go but his two fiancees would the cute child electra and the lovely nada that promised to be an interesting trip grey and the three girls next day they started off it was a good thing he now believed in magic because he would have been in trouble otherwise ivy had somehow called in two winged cen taurs and a horse with the head and wings of a giant bird and these were to be their steeds for the trip but there are four of us grey said i dont think its smart to ride doublenot if were flying man from mundania man from mundania we wont ride double exactly ivy said nada will be with me but nada weighs as much as you do he protested indeed nada weighed more and in all the right places ivy just smiled let me introduce you she said leading the way to the new arrivals the first was the handsome centaur male like a mus cular man from the waist up and like a horse below and behind with huge wings this was cheiron the second was cheirons mate chex whose long brown hair merged into her mane and at whose ample bare breasts grey tried not to stare the third was xap a golden yellow hippo gryph chexs sire who spoke only in squawks that the others seemed to understand grey was to ride cheiron ivy rode xap and electra rode chex nada approached with ivyand abruptly be came a small snake ivy put the snake in a pocket and mounted so that was the secret he had forgotten that nada was a naga a humanserpent crossbreed able to assume either form she had seemed so emphatically hu man she had made herself small so that her weight did not become a burden knowing that her friend ivy would not let her fall grey looked at cheiron uh ive ridden a centaur before but not a winged one your wings uh sit behind them cheiron said and hold on tightly my magic enables me to fly not by powerful wingstrokes but by lightness of body and you will be lightened too you could bounce off if not prepared uh yes he walked to the side but cheiron stood taller than donkey and there were no stirrups how could he get on chex came up i will help you she reached down put her hands under greys arms and lifted him up he flailed surprised and felt his back brush something soft then he was over cheirons back and settling into place he leaned forward and got a double handful of mane as the great wings spread suddenly he felt lightheaded and light bodied indeed it seemed he might bounce off cheiron leaped and pumped his wings and they were airborne grey felt as if he were floating there was def initely magic operating but it was good magic he looked to the side there was xap flying strongly with ivy his birds beak seeming to cut right through the air behind him chex was lifting too with electra glee fully aboard with each stroke of the centaurs wings her breasts flexed now grey knew what he had brushed as he was lifted electra saw him looking and waved he took the risk of releasing one handful of mane in order to wave back how could he be afraid when the child wasnt its hard to believe that shes two years older than chex cheiron remarked turning his head briefly so that his words were not lost in the wind what grey asked confused ivy and nada are seventeen electra is fifteen chex is thirteen but our foal che is now a year old being tended by his granddam chem it can be awkward to judge by appearances grey looked again at the pair electra remained a child and chex a very mature figure of both horse and woman no offense but i find that difficult to believe grey said but now he was remembering something ivy had said about that it had faded from his memory because it was part of the magic he had not then accepted i thought you would that is why i mentioned it chem was part of the party that went to find ivy when she was lost as a child of three it was on that journey that chem met xap there was no male centaur she found suitable and xap as you can see is a fine figure of a creature so she bred with him and in the following year chex was birthed i uh am surprised that you discuss it so openly grey said somewhat at a loss we centaurs are more advanced and therefore more discriminating about proprieties than are human folk cheiron explained we treat natural functions as what they are natural we reserve our foibles for what counts intellectual application uh sure but chexi thought centaurs aged at the man from mundanii same rate as human beings now he realized what his problem was the same as the one with buxom nada nada looked and acted too human to be credible as a serpent until she actually changed and chex looked and acted too mature to be credible as an adolescent he was coming to accept magic intellectually but there were aspects of it that his deeper belief still resisted ordinarily they do but animals age faster since xap is an animal chex was blessed with the natural conse quences of the crossbreeding wings and faster maturity she grew at a rate between that of her two parents and reached sexual maturity at age six rather than age three or age twelve her dam aware of this tutored her inten sively so that her intellect kept pace thus it was that she was a fit mate for me at age ten though i was more than twice her chronological age for that i am duly grateful for winged centaurs are rare uh how rare are they we two and our foal are the only ones in xanth grey had to laugh that is rare he looked once more at chex she looks so so human uh in front its still hard to believe she can be so young you will find her young in no respect other than chron ological cheiron assured him it may be more con venient for you to think of her as my age ignoring the chronology uh yes that seems best so he really wouldnt have to make the adjustment that was giving him trouble they flew southeast down toward what on the florida map would have been lake okeechobee from this height he really would not have known this was xanth instead of florida the trees and fields and lakes seemed similar then he spied a cloud ahead it did not resemble any mundane cloud it had a puny angry face ive seen that cloud before grey exclaimed that is fracto the worst of clouds cheiron said wherever there is mischief to be done in the air there he is to be found apparently he tunes in magically we shall have to take evasive action before he gets up a charge man from mundcmia but he waswas in the gourd grey said i thought there was no contact between there and here i mean thats the realm of bad dreams isnt it correct that would have been the dream fracto this is the real one their natures are identical the trio angled down toward land the cloud tried to extend himself below to intercept them but was not fast enough fracto could not catch them in the air and would have to settle for raining on them but the three flying figures did not actually land they brushed by the treetops as if searching for a suitable re gionand kept on going before the cloud realized it they were beyond and lifting once more into the sky fracto tried to turn about and go after them but there was a fairly stiff wind that prevented him he turned a deep mottled gray and skulked off seeking other mischief serves you right soggybottom electra called back nastily she has been associating with grudy golem chei ron said that is one of his old insults maybe so but grey was satisfied with it he didnt like fracto by evening they were approaching a feature of the land scape that definitely was not part of the mundane penin sula a mountain at its jagged peak grew a monstrous tree and on the tree perched a mindbogglingly monstrous bird mount parnassus cheiron said unnecessarily we may not fly all the way to it because the simurgh does not appreciate clutter in her airspace we shall set you down at the base of the mountain and wait there for your return they glided to a camping site xap knew about close to parnassus ivy brought out the little snake and set it on the ground and suddenly nada was there again just as lovely as before she was nude but ivy had her clothes ready and in a moment all was in order there were blan ket and pillow bushes nearby and a beerbarrel tree that was filled with boot rear oh i love it electra ex claimed man from mundania grey remembered ivys warning in the mock castle roogna atop the dream mountain did the stuff really work he could not resist trying some and finding out for himself so while the others settled for water from the nearby stream he and electra drew foaming cups of boot rear from a spigot set in the bulging trunk bottoms up electra said and took a swig then she jumped into the air what a boot grey just didnt believe it he sipped his own drink while electra waited expectantly nothing happened maybe you didnt drink enough she said disap pointed grey tilted the cup and swallowed a big mouthful there was no effect it seemed just like root beer let me taste yours electra said suspiciously grey gave her his cup she sipped then drank and did not jump its a dud she said yours must have gone flat mine gave me a good boot grey tried hers but with no effect and after that it didnt work for her either the whole trees gone flat she said i must have gotten the only sip that was fresh enough but she remained perplexed they returned to the camp where the others had gath ered a nice collection of fruits nuts and bolts they had even found a gravy train and a hot potato collection so had potatoes and gravy the more he experienced of xanth the better grey liked it its ways really were better than those of mundania once he got used to them even if some like the boot rear were overrated they slept individually with the three fourfooted crea tures spaced around the outside of the camp sleeping on their feet grey had a suspicion that xap the hippogryph would be aware of any danger and would deal with it swiftly that beak looked wicked in the morning after breakfasting on eggs from an egg plant fried on a hotseat along with green and orange juice from nearby greens and oranges they set out afoot man from mundania for the heights of mount parnassus they had to cross a stream at its base rather than risk wading through it they located a narrow place and jumped across now well be all right if we can avoid the python and the maenads ivy said grey could guess why a python might be awkward but the other wasnt clear what wild women she clarified that sounded intriguing but he knew better than to say so suppose one of them comes upon us that depends electra can shock the first one but then she has to recharge for a day nada could become a big serpent and bite one but she would be no match for the python i can do a certain amount by judicious enhance ment i could also use the magic mirror to call home if there was time but of course my snoopy little brother will be watching us on the tapestry and hell alert someone if theres trouble xap has been here and could run in to carry a couple of us away but he really doesnt like being limited to the ground it will probably be best if we get through without running into any of those creatures since clio will know were coming and why that should be possible she wouldnt wish any harm to us clio the muse of history werent you listening when we planned this trip uh i hadnt caught her name ivy smiled i was teasing grey i dont expect you to know everything about xanth yet not today but just wait till tomorrow electra put in laughing there was a clear path up the mountain electra led the way full of juvenile energy ivy was next and then grey with nada bringing up the rear they all had walking sticks they had found at the campsite and these were a great help because they walked briskly on their own hauling the living folk along they came to a fork in the path electra halted i cant tell which one is right she said let me check nada said she became a long black snake and slithered up past them she paused at the fork man from mundania man from mundania putting her head to one side and then the other her tongue flickering in and out then she became human again the right one the left one smells of maenad fairly fresh lets move on quickly grey would have liked to loiter so as to catch a glimpse of one of the wild women did they wear clothing but the others were evidently alarmed so he moved along with them the path became steep even electra was breathing hard nada gave her walking stick to grey and assumed her natural form a serpent with her human head un changed except that the hair was shorter obviously she didnt want her hair to drag on the ground just as he had tried without perfect success not to stare at chexs bare bosom and not to stare at nadas barely clothed contours in the human state he now tried not to stare at her incon gruous juxtaposition of human and reptilian parts it was a good thing he now believed in magic he offered the extra walking stick to ivy but she de clined i have enhanced my own endurance she ex plained indeed she looked relatively cool and rested electra was satisfied with her single stick scrambling ath letically over rocks and roots evidently regarding the climb as a challenge so he took a stick in each hand and was propelled along by them it was as if he had a second set of legs the slope of the mountain became almost sheer but thfr path cut its ledge cleverly through it and led them without mishap to the home of the muses this was an ornate building set into the steep slope girt by stone columns and arches and guarded by carved stone creatures grey had learned enough of xanth to realize that those statues just might come alive and attack if intruders misbehaved a woman sat in a court in front of the building she had a shelf of books beside her desk and was writing with the point of a bright feather on the middle section of a scroll that rolled up above and below ivy stepped forward clio i presume may we speak with you the woman looked up she was in white and her curly hair was verging on the same color at the fringes but there was an ageless look of preservation about her there was no telling how long she had lived or how much longer she would live but a fair guess might be centuries either way i am and you would be ivy i was aware of your im pending visit i had just not realized that this would be the day this is grey my betrothed from mundania ivy said indicating grey and nada princess of the naga and electra from maybe nine hundred years ago both be trothed to my little brother clio smiled ah yes i remember thats inwhich volume is it there are so many i sometimes lose track ivy stepped closer are these the volumes maybe ill see the title she peered at the shelf of books isle of view question quest the color of her she was over come by a rogue giggle no dear those are future volumes clio said i have written them but they havent yet happened in your terms look farther to the left ivy looked to the left man from mundaniahey does that have anything to do with of course dear clio replied and a fine volume it is if i do say so myself but that is not where oh yes ivy looked again heaven cent vale of the vole golem in the thats it clio exclaimed now i remember heaven cent when prince dolph went in search of the good ma gician humfrey and got betrothed to two excellent young women she smiled at the two girls it is so nice to meet you at last ive written so much about you grey meanwhile was amazed several future volumes of xanth history had already been written and what was the title that had so titillated ivy he sidled closer so that he could read the words on the spines of the volumes you mean you already know how it turns out with us electra asked clio which one of us married dolph of course i know clio said it is my business to r man from mundania know that is certainly an interesting episode and i envy the two of you the experience of its resolution grey got his eyes lined up on the titles it was awkward because he was still a bit too far away and the angle was bad but he was just able to piece out the words geis of the gargoyle harpy thymebut these werent the ones ivy had seen do you think you couldi mean electra said naturally not dear clio said in her kindly fashion if i told you the resolution it would spoil it for you and you wouldnt like that now would you grey realized that he was too far to the right he was reading titles even farther in the future but he was head ing leftward and should soon intersect the ones ivy had called out demons dont dream the color of herah there it was at last panties he exclaimed aloud laugh ing there was a sudden silence as all the others looked at him he felt himself flushing uh i was just you really should not be peeking at future titles clio said firmly suppose the news got out there could be chaos im uh sorry grey said abashed i wont tell if that helps she gazed at him for an uncomfortably long moment there is considerable irony in that statement do you realize that grey spread his hands i uh no not exactly clio sighed my fault perhaps i should not have been careless with the volumes she touched the top of the bookshelf and the air before the tomes fuzzed and turned opaque the open shelf had become a closed shelf a wooden panel hiding the books now ivy why is it that you came i seem to have lost the thread again ivy seemed for a moment to have lost the thread herself but she recovered it promptly i want to marry grey but i cant unless we find a magic talent for him and we think theres just a chance he might somehow have one and surely you know my dear my dear clio said i can no more tell man from mundania you in advance about greys talent than i can tell nada and electra how their triangle with dolph will turn out it would not be ethical quite apart from the complications of paradox oh clio ivy said looking woebegone its so im portant to me i love him and if clio raised both hands in a stop gesture i understand ivy believe me i do but this is a matter of professional ethics i can not compromise in this matter no matter how much i may wish to this is a situation you must see through in your own fashion ivy was crying now grey was deeply touched to see her break down so quickly on this issue though he under stood the muses position he stepped to her and enfolded her shes right ivy we have already seen too much we have no right to put her in this position you are a fine young man clio said perhaps i can say this much it will not be long now thank you grey said uncertain what she meant he guided ivy back the way they had come nada and electra followed pausing only to thank the muse individ ually for her attention soon they were on their way back down the mountain the descent was hardly less arduous than the ascent ivys tears in due course condensed to sniffles and then to mere depression she had evidently put more hope in this than she had let on greys mood was hardly better to have come so close to an answer only to have that hope dashed are we far enough away electra asked ivy stared at her dully for what grey asked to talk maybe we should get the rest of the way down before we relax grey said not certain what she had in mind she looked disappointed i suppose so but im about ready to burst grey looked around oh well therere bushes around we could wait while you man from mundania she laughed not physically dope mentally with my news tell us your news when were clear of parnassus nada said she was in her giriheadedserpent form slid ing fairly readily down the slope they resumed their motion in due course they reached the fork in the path but they had hardly gone beyond it before there was a clamor from below ivy came to life the maenads she exclaimed theyre below us and the python nada said changing briefly to full snake form then back i smell them both now they must have crossed the path and smelled our scent we must run ivy said flustered were too tired nada pointed out even fresh we could not go faster than those monsters maybe if we split up grey suggested that might confuse them and they might go the wrong way which wrong way ivy asked if some of us are each way ill decoy them gray said you three go back up the path where your scent already is and ill run down the other and make a noise to attract them but you dont know the first thing about this moun tain ivy protested its my responsibility he replied i the noise below grew abruptly louder the maenads were rounding a curve and would soon be upon them go grey cried pointing to the path they had just come down he himself ran down the other ivy and electra turned and started up nada was on the other side of him she assumed woman form and started to step across just as he began running they collided at another time he might have found this event inter esting for nada was contoured somewhat like soft pil lows but in this rush he was afraid he had hurt her nada are you he broke off for she had disappeared realizing that she had changed form to avoid falling to the ground he ran on she would join the others in one form or another man from mundania and they would hide all he had to do was decoy the mon sters he slowed and glanced back there was a wild woman she was indeed naked with flaring tresses and a figure suggestive of an hourglass she was gazing up the path the others had taken over here nymph grey called waving his arms her head turned rotating on her shoulders as if mounted on ball bearings now he saw her eyes they were in sanely wild he had not taken these wild women seri ously but those eyes sent a chill through him this was no sweet young thing this was a rabid tigress the maenad launched herself in his direction uttering a harsh shriek of hunger her legs were beautiful her breasts were beautiful her face was beautiful but that shriek was spinetingling she opened her mouth and he saw her pointed teeth and saw her tongue flick out the way nadas had when she was in serpent form there seemed to be candle flames inside her eyeballs yum she screamed reaching for him with hands whose nails were like blooddipped talons grey spun about and resumed his running but the wild woman was fast she kept pace he couldnt draw far enough ahead of her to get off the path and hide he had to keep going he heard the screams of the other maenads farther behind they sounded just as bloodthirsty the path twisted as if trying to make him stumble but he ran with the surefootedness of desperation and kept up speed he began to leave the maenad behind but now his breath was puffing and he was tiring rapidly he had not been fresh when he started he could have used a dose of ivys enhancement he had had the bright idea to be the decoy it had been the gallant thing to do but now he was in trouble how was he going to get out of this something touched his chest at his breast pocket he reached up thinking it was a snag of a branchand felt a tiny snake its head was poking out of the pocket for an instant he felt shock then his fevered mind put two and two together nada he gasped man from mundania indeed it was she instead of falling to the ground where she might have been trodden on she had evidently clung to his shirt and slipped into his pocket in his preoccu pation with the maenads he had not noticed sorry i got you into this he puffed i dont know where im going but i dont dare stop the snake did not reply which was perhaps just as well at least she understood that it had been an accident despite his tiring he was leaving the leading maenad farther behind was she also tiring or merely hanging back to allow the others of her ilk to catch up he might have turned and dealt with one though he did not like the idea of striking a lovely bare woman but he knew he would have no chance against the pack of them but if he got far enough ahead he could dodge off the path and hide they would charge on past and then he would return to the path and run the other way he hoped if he went off the path and they winded him he would be in deep mud for sure he rounded a bend suddenly he was charging toward a pretty spring another hate spring the others had con cluded from the evidence of the tapestry that that one had been valid but had somehow lost its potency by the time he and ivy reached it certainly it had not worked on them but there was no guarantee that this one would be similarly powerless in fact it might be a love spring it glimmered with a pale reddish hue as if potent with some kind of magic suppose he splashed through it then saw a maenad these thoughts flitted through his pulsing brain as he ran toward it by the time they had run their course he was almost at it he veered to avoid it but stumbled only by frantic windmilling did he stop himself from pitching headfirst into the water nada fell from his pocket and splashed into the spring appalled he watched the little snake thrashing should he reach in and pull her out then he would be affected too she changed to her human form she shook the water from her eyes and looked directly at him hey hi hand some she exclaimed man from mundania well it wasnt a hate spring nada get out of there the wild women are coming she hiccuped no you come in its nice was it a love spring he didnt dare touch it get out he repeated if they catch you theyll tear you apart but she demurred she sat in the shallow water her breasts lifting clear and dripping even in this danger he was struck by her sex appeal she might be half serpent but she was all woman come in youll like it she invited she hiccuped again this wines wonderful youre intoxicated he exclaimed catching on no im drunk she corrected him this must be the maenads wine spring pretty soon ill be raving wild just like them what fan now the maenads came into sight they spied nada in the wine spring and screamed with outrage there was no help for it he had to haul her out of there before the wild woman got their claws on her he would just have to resist the intoxicating effect of the water grey waded in the water was bathwater warm and felt somehow soft against his legs as it soaked his trousers he reached down to take hold of nada oooo goody she exclaimed reaching up to em brace him none of that he rapped come on out we have to run but she was slippery with the winewater and his hands merely slid over her marvelous flesh stroking regions they should not oooo fan she said wrapping her arms around his neck and hauling his face in for a wet and sloppy kiss he turned his face aside but that was the least of his prob lems he couldnt get her out she was too slippery and too affectionate meanwhile the wild women were charging in already it was too late to escape them he would have to try to fight them change into your snake form he told nada get back in my pocket ill need both hands free to shove them away i cant hold on to you man from mundania man from mundania serpent form she asked still trying to kiss him the maenads came to the pool and circled it their eyes glowed and their teeth glistened and their claws quivered expectantly grey knew the two of them were done for in a moment the wild women would plunge in from all sides and tear them apart then he had another desperate notion make it a big snake your biggest and fiercest ever big huge gigantic fierce he cried to fight the wild women finally she caught on nasty women terrible women do it nada changed suddenly he had his arms around a py thon that must weigh twice as much as he did it was nada but horrendous she hissed at the wild women they stared for the moment startled from their madness then their blood lust returned in force and they charged into the pool and paused a look of dismay spread across their sev eral faces wheres wine one asked her words barely distinguishable several of them scooped up handfuls of the water tast ing it their dismay intensified wine gone one ex claimed in sheerest horror get out of here nada grey said nada undulated to the edge of the pool and out the maenads distracted seemed hardly to notice they were busy sampling their pool verifying that its magic was gone grey waded out struck by the similarity of this scene to that of the goblins with their hate spring something strange had happened again but he couldnt pause to an alyze it he hurried after nada she headed for the deepest forest moving well despite her intoxication of course it was impossible for her to stagger or fall in this form he plowed into the foliage fighting through the branches and leaves at any moment the maenads might recover from their shock and resume the pursuit nada drew up beside a huge chestnut tree she stopped under a large chest of nuts and resumed human form now kish me she invited extending her arms to him again grey straightarmed her gently you cant be drunk he said that water has lost its potency her eyes widened suddenly im sober she said how did you do that i didnt do it he protested you must have just thought it was wine so grey look at me she said sharply he looked into her face her eyes were completely clear her mouth firm i am not drunk now but believe me i was a moment ago i had lost all perspective all i thought of was being with a handsome man i had conveniently forgotten that you and i are betrothed to others i would never do that sober that water intoxicated me instantly and that was no illusion it didnt stop until just now you did it grey but i couldnt have it would take magic and i have no magic you know that she cocked her head electrawhat was she about to say to us there on the path that was so urgent she may look like a child but shes got a good mind she was full of some news she had but i think i know this experience jogged my memory grey when ivy asked the muse about your talent she said that it would not be ethical to tell us about it in advance wasnt that it yes something like that but what relevance think about it how could she tell us about a nonex istent thing grey froze but that must mean that you do have a talent she finished she slipped grey and electra was the only one to catch it thats what she was so bursting to tell us you do have magic grey was stunned oh nada i could kiss you no you dont she said firmly not when im so ber man from mundania uh i meant that as a figure of she smiled i know just never forget that i am ivys frienda good one i never did you never did she agreed ruefully did when drunk but this has given us the key what could your talent be sobering drunk women he quipped laughing still not quite believing more than that i think you denatured their whole pool but if that really is a magic spring i could no more nullify it all than i could nullify the goblins hate spring she concluded grey thought about it nullifying magic springs that couldnt be because it did make you drunk before you got into it it didnt make you drunk once you applied your will to itand just now to meyou countered it instantly magically he nodded when i set my will to it but is it possible that something else changed those springs maybe ivy dehanced that hate spring i mean if she can enhance maybe ivy wasnt here for the wine spring she reminded him and dont accuse me of doing it i have no talent my magic is in my nature changing between my compo nent species maybe some day the nada will develop tal ents as the centaurs did no you did it grey your talent must be making magic springs harmless but im mundane how could i have atalent she shook her head i dont know grey but consid ering what the muse said and what happened here im pretty sure you do and that means i can marry ivy he exclaimed jubilantly yes if queen irene thought this was a good way of denying you without actually saying no she made a mis take because now she cant say no all we have to do is escape the wild women and get together with ivy and electra and everythings okay he said a trifle ruefully he knew they werent safe yet man from mundania indeed a maenad was coming toward them the wild women knew where they were but had been too dazed by the loss of their wine to organize i can change form and slide through the thicket nada said but i wouldnt leave you here alone that one coming here doesnt look wild anymore he said maybe theyre tame when not drunk tame maenads could cost you your marriage too she said squinting at the womans perfect proportions maybe i can climb a tree and you can go for help wild women can climb lets just see what she wants maybe its not an ulti matum he said without much confidence the maenad came close magician she called her speech was clear now that she was sober grey was too surprised to speak but nada took over what do you want with the magician im no grey started but she elbowed him in the belly we did not know your nature when we pursued you the maenad said we apologize and beg you to restore our wine spring we will do anything you desire the magician has all he desires nada said her el bow poised to jab him again if he protested grey kept his mouth shut the wild woman looked at nadas bare form apprais ingly indeed we can see that serpentwoman but if there is anything else he desiresfood an honor guard servants nada considered the magician was only visiting par nassus he has no need of your services i will try to prevail on him to restore your wine spring but i can not guarantee success the best i can promise is that if you do not annoy him further he will not do anything worse to you if he is so inclined he may see to your pool the woman fell to her knees oh thank you thank you we are but shadows without our wine we would be unable to fight the python nada nodded the python is he near he was following us up the path before we caught your man from mundania mem from mundania scent he must have taken the other fork for there was the scent of live girls there both grey and nada jumped the dread pythongoing after ivy and electra we must be on our way nada said she turned her face to grey magician if you will at least consider their wine spring grey was uneasy about this deception but realized that she was trying to get them out of this without having to fight very well serpentgirl he said gruffly they drew themselves out of the tangled brush and fol lowed the unwild woman back to the spring under stand if the magician restores your wine and you then get drunk and wild and become troublesome to him i can not be responsible for his temper nada warned them we will stay far away from him the women prom ised in chorus grey stepped up to the spring if he really had dena tured it then he should be able to restore it if he had not been the one responsible for what had happened then he hoped that whatever was responsible would play along how should he go about this well if it had been his will that did it to this pool and the hate spring maybe his will could restore it so he concentrated on the water which was now quite clear he willed for it to be restored and for the pale rose color to return since that was evi dently the signal of its potency be wine again was there a flicker of something he squatted and touched the water with one finger willing the color to intensify immediately the water turned a rich red alarmed he straightened up and stepped back what had he done that was too much color a maenad scooped up a palmful of water and sipped it her eyes went round blood she exclaimed oops grey looked at nada with dismay blood another wild woman asked then several more scooped up sips blood they agreed blood flavored wine grey edged back if they could get a running start oh thank you magician the maenad spokesnymph exclaimed this is so much better than before now we can satisfy both our thirsts at once quite all right he said benignly then nada took his arm and they walked back down the path the maenads jubilant clustered around the pool guz zling the water as if there were no tomorrow they paid no further attention to the two visitors grey was almost floating not because of their escape but because of this vindication of his magic he had tried to turn the pool pink and when that was slow he had tried for full redand with his touch it had gone all the way no one else could have known what he was thinking so it had to have been his own effort his own magic he did have magic but the riddle remained how could he have a magic talent when he was mundane everyone agreed that no mundane had magic could everyone be wrong we had better get back to ivy and electra nada said i dont like the sound of that python going after them the python grey was tired but that abruptly passed ill run you get small and get into my pocket weve got to get there as fast as we can right you are magician she agreed with a wan smile she held his hand leaned over his arm oh that body and became a snake spread across his hand and forearm he lifted her to the breast pocket then he began to run he had no idea what he would do if he encountered the python he just knew he had to get there before ivy did then abruptly he stopped how could he be sure of finding ivy and electra quickly he had only a vague no tion of the layout of this mountain and its bypaths and nada had no better knowledge they could blunder about for hours while the python caught and gobbled the girls nadas snake head poked out of his pocket question ingly we need a guide he said someone who knows every wrinkle of this mountain so we can go directly to man from mundania man from mundania the most likely place and get around the python if we have to the snake head nodded but without full conviction he knew why where could they get such a guide on such short notice the answer was obvious one of the maenads grey turned about and marched back to the bloodwine spring ahem the clustered maenads jumped oh magician dont change your mind the spokesnymph cried we have done nothing more to annoy you i want a guide grey said someone who knows this mountain perfectly we all know it magician if this is your demand we must accede choose one of us to serve and the mae nads lined up setting their jaws each obviously hoping he would not choose her this was no good he needed a willing one who would do her honest best ah er a volunteer someone who wants to do it to help me find my friends they burst into cruel laughter magician none of us want to help anyone we are wild bloodthirsty women we are tame only for the brief time it takes to lure an unwary man close enough for the pounce when he takes us for succubi there was more laughter they found such an error hilarious this wasnt getting anywhere if he pushed his luck they might forget their fear of him and that could be awk ward but he still needed that guide well er maybe if one of you can pretend to be tame for this one task in return for an er reward he didnt know what reward he could sincerely offer but was sure that none of them would do it unless either threatened or rewarded generously help someone for hours the spokesnymph de manded impossible but one maenad came forward ii might the spokesnymph shot her a withering glance thats right mae youre always the last to rip out a gobbet of flesh its almost as if you dont really like hurting folk thats a lie mae cried fiercely but her attitude sug gested that it wasnt it seemed there were misfits even among the wild women very well grey said briskly come along mae can you smell the trail of a normal woman yes very well mae agreed then sniff out the trail of the two young women who were with us before we want to reach them before the python does they took the other fork mae said she set off at a run her bare bottom twinkling grey watched for a moment then the snake wriggled in his pocket reminding him that he was not here to watch twinkling bottoms embarrassed he lurched into his own run following mae chapter python vy hated to see grey go but the maenads were coming and there was no time to argue she saw him col lide with nada and nada changed into her snake form and disappeared apparently hanging onto him well at least he would have competent help she dreaded what would happen to him alone electra was already running up the path her walking stick jumping ivy enhanced her own stick and it practi cally propelled her along the same route if only their party hadnt gotten divided maybe they all could have hidden it worked the wild women went charging up the other fork attracted by greys foolish yelling but now what was he going to do he didnt have the first notion about sur vival in xanth she remembered the magic mirror but she had as sumed that she would be in the middle of whatever trouble occurred if she used it she would have to explain that the one in trouble was somewhere else and by the time help got there it might well be too late oh what an awful pass this was nada will help him electra said divining ivys con cern she can become a pretty big serpent and hold them off and greytheres something about him i had noticed ivy said smiling briefly electra was man from mundania right grey had gotten through some phenomenal scrapes such as with the goblins despite his ignorance of magic and he has a talent ivy paused what the museshe said she couldnt tell us about his tal ent but it wouldnt be long before we knew that means he does have one ivy was amazed whyso she did but what could it be maybe something he needs right now cause she didnt say he was going to be in real trouble maybe he can make wild women fall in love with him thats very reassuring ivy said sourly electra was embarrassed i mean maybe that is he would not love themwho would love a maenadbut if theywell maybe something else like turning into a dragon maybe ivy felt lightheaded thinking about the prospect of a talent for grey that meant they could marry they stopped climbing as it was obvious that the mae nads were not coming this way greys ploy had worked but now it was hard to know what to do if they went back too soon they might run into the maenads but if they waited too long and grey needed helpoh this was aw ful then their problem was solved in a worse way they heard a quiet rustling down the trail something was com ing up and it didnt sound like grey in a moment the huge head of a monstrous serpent rounded a turn it was the phython run ivy cried but the great baleful eyes of the creature caught them both before they could act they stood transfixed unable to move or even to speak the head was so big that the jaws could take in either one of them without difficulty the sinuous body was ob viously able to digest them they were this serpents prey aaaah young women the python hissed seeming to speak my favorite repast but first you must worship man from mundania me bow down before me grovel low humble yourselves before the horrendous maleness i am this was awful but somehow the infinite menace of the python was mitigated by an almost infinite appeal she was terrified yet a part of her also desired to be consumed by this monster thus it was not merely the magic mes merism of the reptilian gaze that held her it was the weak ening of her will to resist what a horror to know what was to happen yet not want to fight it down the python hissed bow down tasty mor sels i require my homage before i feed dutifully they got down still held by that sinister gaze but electra was a little ahead of ivy and her body mo mentarily interfered with ivys line of sight to the eye of the python suddenly she was free of the awful compulsion now she was revolted how could she ever have desired any part of that disgusting reptile but electra was still under the spell ivy scrambled for ward shielding her eyes against the gaze and threw her body down before the girls face interrupting her line of sight too the python was like a hypnogourd completely captivating those who met his gaze but losing power the moment the contact was broken but it was too late the gigantic jaws were hinging open and in a moment one or both of them would be snapped up the python did not need to mesmerize them the whole time only long enough for him to get within striking range he was within it now shock him ivy whispered putting her hand on elec tras arm ill enhance you the head plunged down the daggeriike teeth leading both girls rolled to the side and the jaws snapped closed just beside them now ivy cried hanging onto elec tras arm electra flung her free arm across and smote the python on the side of his massive snout the blow itself was laughable she might as well have struck the trunk of a tree but it was charged with all the electric power of her magic talentenhanced by ivys own talent man from mundania there was a jolt so strong that even its backlash stunned ivy for a moment the python stiffened then collapsed his head drooping to the path beside them his latter coils writhing without direction electras shock had knocked him out ivy sat up her senses reeling she discovered she didnt really like such close calls come on lectraweve got to get away before he recovers indeed the head was showing signs of animation the monster was so big and tough that even that terrible shock was enough to set him back only briefly ivy thought fleet ingly of trying to bash the python with a stone but real ized that her strength even if she enhanced it would barely be enough to dent the giant skull it was safer to flee they got up wobbly on their feet the path below was blocked by the thrashing length of the reptile they would have to go back up but soon he would follow them and this time they would not be able to shock it for electra was depleted she was no sorceress she could not exer cise her talent twice in one day ivy herself had no limit but what point would there be in enhancing the python that would only make him worse we cant outrun him electra gasped well never make it to the top ivy had to agree we must find a safe way off the path where he cant follow or at least will be too slow to catch us she did not voice her private doubts about their abil ity to find any such way they stumbled on holding hands so that ivy could en hance electras stamina and there beside a nettlebush was a contorted little path departing from the main one they had not noticed it before but the nettle electra protested it will hurt us let me at it ivy said she stood before the bush thinking how pretty it was and how decorative its spines were more bluff than substance and how such bushes never did really sting nice girls only mean serpents the bush became prettier its sharp edges softening she touched a leaf cautiously and it did not sting her man from mundania she brushed by the bush and electra followed trusting ivys talent the nettle did not sting her either then ivy addressed the bush again silently now she concentrated exclusively on its detestation of all things reptilian especially monstrous pythons it would sting any such creature viciously they walked on down the path no longer feeling the urgency of panic but not delaying either they needed to get somewhere safe before the python found a way to get past the bush the path was evidently little used but ivy sensed some enchantment on it she enhanced this and the path be came clearer with some protective magic someone must have used it regularly once to visit the muses who else lives on parnassus ivy asked it was something she knew she ordinarily could remember but in her present state she couldnt recall all the details electra considered gee i dont really know theres the simurgh on the tree of seeds at the top and the py thon and the wild women and the tree of immortality on the other peak ivy added but this paths going down so it must be to some where else i just want to be sure its better than what were hiding from anythings better than that horrible monster electra exclaimed i mean i suppose its pretty bad getting eaten but that awful gazesomehow i knew that what the py thon planned was worse than eating ivy shuddered reminiscently i hate to say it but if that thing fights with the maenads i favor the wild women but this paththeres something about it i dont understand i wonder if we should follow it any farther well if the python doesnt follow there was a crash above as of a bush getting ripped out of the ground nettles and all wordlessly they resumed their flight down the path abruptly it debouched in a valley hollowed from the side of the mountain huge stone ruins stood there the remains of some vast ancient temple rounded columns reached toward the sky the roof they once supported gone man from mundania sunlight angled across the stones making the scene totally bright and stark what is this electra asked stepping onto the stone platform that must once have been a beautiful floor before ivy could answer a robed bearded old man ap peared from behind a ruined wall pythia he ex claimed just in time what electra asked you are the new priestesses it was foretold you would come but we were afraid it would be too late come this way but we arent priestesses ivy protested we are merely innocent maidens who of course we shall have to clean you up and you can serve immediately were tired and hungry electra said we have no intention of we have excellent food and drink for you ivy exchanged half a glance with electra they were both hungry they decided to hold their protest until after they had eaten part of the ancient temple remained roofed here there were several chambers and there really was good food the girls feasted gluttonously on hayberry longcake and ice chocolate drinks a quiet old woman brought a basin of water and sponges and cleaned them off while they were eating then presented them with rather pretty white robes to don in place of their soiled and torn clothing without even quite paying attention they found them selves garbed like well priestesses with pretty diadems on their heads and sylphlike gowns ivy was surprised to see how pretty electra looked youre growing up lec tra ivy remarked appreciatively electra grimaced im in no hurry all too soon after i come of age so will dolph and then hell have to choose and then ivy knew why she didnt finish they both knew that dolph would choose nada to marry and then electra would die she was safe only as long as she remained betrothed to prince dolph when that ended her nine hun man from mundania dred or so years would catch up with her and she would shrivel into extinction unless they found some way around the dilemma hark the client is arriving the original old man announced we had better use the older one first do either of you have any idea how this is done no ivy and electra said together resuming their nervousness about the proceedings excellent have either of you ever had relations with a man we are both betrothed ivy said a bit stiffly what the man was taken aback but you are so young we require virgins why didnt you tell us this before you didnt ask dodo electra said with her usual asperity anyway who said were not ivy tried to caution her but was too late as was usually the case when dealing with electra ah so you havent been with a man he exclaimed what difference does it make ivy demanded she had heard of virgin sacrifices and didnt like the sound of this at all only truly innocent young girls can serve as pythia he explained that way we can be sure their words are uncorrupted uncorrupted ivy still didnt like this and now electra was catching on and keeping silent the pythia must sit on the tripod and speak in tongues for the client this is the manner of our oracles oracles now ivy remembered something they make predictions she said certainly the very best predictions that is why cli ents come here so they werent to be sacrificed or ravished still there was too much in doubt what happened to the pythia you had before after too many years they grow up and get married the man said then they lose their innocence and are useless for this work we have been looking for replace ments for some time you two should do very well and it man from mundania is an easy life between predictions you have no other work to do and will be well fed and clothed and of course never molested all you have to do is answer the questions of the clients suppose we dont know the answers that is why you sit above the magic cleft the answers are always provided you will have no difficulty suppose wed rather go home he looked blank no girl wants to go home after qual ifying for this elite position ivy exchanged the other half of her earlier glance with electra it didnt seem wise to make too much of an issue at the moment for one thing they didnt know where the python was once they understood the situation better they could see about getting away so ivy went out to the tripod and electra stood on the sideline the client was there a centaur from centaur isle handsome and haughty she could tell his origin by his quiver of arrows the isle centaurs had the very best equipment and their arrows were feathered with a design that was reserved for them alone indeed nonisle cen taurs could not use those arrows their heft and balance and flying properties differed in subtle ways so that only true islers could fire them accurately the tripod was perched over a deep dark crevice in the stone that made ivy nervous she could not fathom its depth and heard a faint hissing far down there was also a warm updraft issuing from it with a peculiar odor it made the hair on the back of her neck tingle but this was the place and this was the jobuntil she could get out of the center of attention and see about get ting herself and electra away from here she had not told these oracle folk that she was a princess fearing that would only make them more eager to keep her she just wanted to get along for now she took her seat on the tripod now the updraft caught her filmy white robe lifting it exposing her legs she tried to hold the cloth down but this was futile there was too much air fortunately the skirt was not full circle it rose until it formed a bell shape and stopped there man from mundania man from mundania she remembered the mouthy tile at castle roogna that had threatened to tell the color of her panties until grey shut it up with his hardheeled mundane shoe was there something down in this crevice gazing up she had not much liked this business to begin with now she was com ing to hate it her panties were her own business the centaur approached ask your question the old man said pythia i am centurion centaur what is the state of my magic oops ivy knew that was an exceedingly awkward ques tion the centaurs of centaur isle did not believe in magic talents for themselves they regarded a talent as fit only for the lower classes such as human beings the mainland centaurs were more liberal and accepted their talents but this was not yet the case with the islers what could she say the chances were that this centaur did have a talent but would prefer to die rather than acknowledge it and if it became known he would be exiled from the isle so he had nothing to gain by the truth should she lie and say he had none thus satisfying him and securing his future with his kind but even though this oracle business was none of her desire how could she bring herself to lie thus neither the truth nor the lie was acceptable she sat frozen unable to speak no wonder the propri etors preferred completely innocent girls no one who was aware of the trap of this office would accept the job even if she took the expedient course and lied suppose later his talent manifested and her oracle was thus proven wrong that would discredit the whole business and somehow she knew that was no good outcome either then the air wafting from below turned hot and in creased its motion it pushed on her flaring skirt so hard she was half afraid she would be lifted into the air her legs were stinging the fumes became choking she coughed and tried to hold her breath but could not she inhaled and the foul stuff flooded her lungs her chest burned and her head became light she felt dizzy indeed she seemed to be floating now though she hadnt moved the stone beneath her seemed to turn trans lucent so that she could see through it down to dim shapes of goblins and demons far below going about their noxious business the air around her seemed to be going the opposite way turning thick opaque as if a monstrous fog were solidifying around her let me out of here she screamed but only gibber ish came out of her mouth as if she were speaking mun danian then hands were pulling her off the stool she flailed trying to fight them off but they wrestled her away from the crevice and its blasting fumes what did she say the centurion demanded she spoke in tongues the old man explained we must interpret it for you a moment while we consult be quick about it the centaur said with the natural arrogance of his kind the matter is important the old man stepped aside to talk privately with the two old women who operated the premises they talked for some time waving their arms animatedly meanwhile ivy was coming out of her delirium the fog was lifting and the ground was turning solid again are you all right electra asked anxiously you looked aw ful on that tripod the fumes choked me ivy explained i tried to call for help but it came out gibberish you mean thats what you cried out it wasnt a proph ecy it certainly wasnt i had no idea what to say but they are i know i think its all a big she broke off spying something awful the python was sliding onto the stone floor electra saw him too he caught up she exclaimed he found us dont look at his eyes they retreated from the monster reptile they ran to ward the proprietors the python the python ivy cried to them the old man looked up of course he is your guard ian pythia he protects the premises from molestation but hes going to eat us man from mundania nonsense he eats only intruders not priestesses the man returned to his animated consultation meanwhile the python was still coming after them he doesnt know we became priestesses electra said he knows we came from the mountain path maybe the centaur ivy said they ran to the waiting centaur that serpent is after us ivy told him but i havent had my answer yet centurion said annoyed and you may not get it if i get eaten ivy retorted here here this wont do he said suddenly his bow was off his shoulder and in his hands an arrow nocked withdraw monster or it will be the worse for you but the python merely elevated his snoot and came on the bow twanged an arrow appeared in the reptiles nose that was a warning shot centurion said i have ninetynine more arrows the next one will be in the eye back off monster ivy had always known that centaurs were brave and skilled warriors but she was amazed even so this one had no awe at all of the python and it was evident that he could fire an arrow exactly where he wanted but now the proprietors realized what was happening dont shoot at the python the old man cried hes our guardian he will be a blind one if he slithers one more slither forward centurion retorted meanwhile the python evidently stung by the barb paused he oriented an eye to fix on the centaurbut dis covered the flinty point of the next arrow aimed directly at the pupil if the python had not been aware of the pro ficiency of centaurs before he had had a recent reminder he hesitated again two more people burst out of the jungle where the path exited a nondescript young man and a luscious nude young woman grey nada ivy exclaimed thrilled the python coiled around to meet this new challenge certainly it was a better prospect than the nervy centaur dont look at his eyes electra screamed to grey man from mundania meanwhile ivy got a clearer look at the girl behind grey that wasnt nadathat was a maenad what had hap pened grey true to his sometimes infuriating nature ignored the warning he stared the python right in the eye ivy froze appalled so did everyone else for their own assorted reasons so did greyand the python the two were locked into that deadly gaze then the python moved his head sank slowly to the ground his coils thrashed aimlessly ivy felt her mouth hanging open she looked around and saw that the jaws of the proprietors were similarly slack grey walked forward are you all right ivy we were afraid maybe the python youyou stared him down ivy exclaimed of course he did dummy the maenad said hes a magician well not exactly that grey said abashed electra hurried up wheres nada there was a motion at greys breast pocket a snakes head poked out grey put up his hand and the snake slid up into it and around his arm then nada manifested in her human form her feet landing neatly on the stone as her arm was steadied she was naked of course because she was unable to transform her clothing when she changed form but something very like it i think she said do you know ivy he nulled their wine spring then restored it more potent than before he has a talent he has a talent electra exclaimed jumping up and down i knew it i knew it what is this maenad doing here ivy demanded fo cusing on the lesser matter because she wasnt quite pre pared to tackle the greater one well this is uh mae grey said sheiwe oh ivy inquired looking more closely at the crea ture mae maenad was just as nakedly wild and voluptu ous as before surely quite intriguing for those who liked that type the magician needed a guide mae explained so man from mundania man from mundania i showed him the offtrail the python uses and sniffed your scent thereon so he could find you its a good trail for serpents nada put in but there was an uprooted nettle bush there that really had it in for serpents and i had to return to his pocket then the nettle couldnt touch me but how did he tame you electra asked everyone knows that maenads cant be well i dont really like blood mae confessed abashed when he made our spring blood now i have to reward mae for her help grey said but im not sure uh how ivy realized that she had better figure out a suitable reward soon because she didnt trust whatever the mae nad might think of that wild woman was entirely too well formed what happened to our guardian a proprietor de manded nothing bad grey said i just uh nulled him so he wouldnt hurt anyone here ill revive him for you he walked across to the python and touched the huge head the thrashing stopped the head lifted the eyes blinked go about your business grey said we are visitors here not intruders here ill pull out that arrow for you he put his hand on the shaft you cant dislodge that arrow centurion said it has a magic point only a centaur can he broke off as the arrow came loose the point was red with blood but intact the python quivered as if recovering from a fundamen tal shock then slithered away across the stone i guess it did hurt grey said here is your arrow back centaur thank you magician the centaur said looking much the way the python had he accepted the arrow the old man approached what is your business here magician we have no prior knowledge of you well i uh just came to rescue princess ivy and elec tra it was nice of you to take care of them nice ivy and electra demanded together princess the proprietor demanded at the same time uh yes grey said innocently this is princess ivy of castle roogna and this is princess nada of the naga didnt you know the old man looked somewhat out of sorts we did not inquire he said gruffly well theyll be leaving now grey said thank you again waitwhat about my oracle centurion asked we have interpreted the message the old man said quickly it is no centaur has less magic than you oh the centaur nodded quite satisfied yes quite thank you i shall be on my way he suited action to word in the fashion of his kind but we need our pythia another proprietor cried if you take these two away magician what will we do ivy stepped in mae how would you like to have the magician arrange for you a new situation with a hard stone room a dismal white gown no raw meat at all to eat and regular sessions with fumes that really drive you wild maes face seemed to catch fire what a wonderful thing ivy turned to the old man here is your next priestess proprietor you know shes a virgin these wild women dont love men they eat them put her on the tripod and shell babble an incomprehensible streak you can interpret to your hearts delight but shes a maenad he protested but a tame one the magician tamed her she turned back to mae he did didnt he you wont try to tear people apart anymore mae was a wild woman but not stupid he tamed me he tamed me she exclaimed no more miss nasty nymph but the maenads are incorrigible the old man said thats why we have the python to hold them off nada stepped in in the perceptive way she had this one is different she no longer fights with serpents or tears men apart see she assumed her snake form the large version mae understanding reached down to pet the man from mundania snakes head though she did look a bit nervous about it then nada resumed human form now kiss the magi cian without biting him she said this really set the wild woman back do i have to does she have to ivy echoed disturbed for a dif ferent reason well i suppose she might kiss the proprietor the old man stumbled back terrified point made ivy agreed with resignation kiss her grey but dont enjoy it too much grey did not look quite as upset about the prospect as she might have wished he turned to face mae and she stepped into his embrace they clinched and kissed hold ing it a good long time see nada said to the proprietors she is perfectly tameaffectionate even one might even call her lov able lets not go that far ivy muttered the proprietors were daunted by this display perhaps she will do the old man said but lets stop that kiss before she gets uninnocent no tions an old woman added ivy agreed completely to her relief they finally com pleted the kiss mae looked dazed and the candle flames in her eyes were flickering maybe i have misjudged men she said they they arent all like that ivy said this ones a ma gician remember ordinary ones wont be worth your while you dont have to eat them just ignore them yes of course mae agreed but she did not look entirely convinced come with us one of the old women said we must clean you and garb you clean me mae asked alarmed they just sponge you off ivy explained quickly it doesnt hurt they just want you to look pretty for the clients look pretty mae repeated glancing sidelong at i grey yes maybe that is best i man from mundania lets get out of here ivy said briskly nada held her back one more thing she turned to the old man is there a path around the base of the moun tain we can use to return to our starting place certainly all the clients use it right that way he pointed thank you nada said flashing him a smile she was better at that than ivy was electra led the way skipping toward the indicated path ivy took very firm hold of greys hand and led him away from the ruins nada followed the suggestion of a smile on her face she reverted to naga form as it really was best for windy paths grey had not spoken a word since the kiss ivy turned on him the moment they were out of sight and earshot of the ruins well why so smug grey did she make that much of an impression on you she was angry for what she knew was no good reason grey opened his mouth redness welled out he turned to the side and spat blood i uh couldnt say anything because if the blood showed they wouldnt believe she was tame ivy stared she did bite you he found a handkerchief and dabbed at his lip yes i think it was involuntary like a sneeze she just couldnt get that close to a man without attacking at least a little i couldnt break the kiss until she let go so i sort of concentrated and nulled her magic nature until she had to stop so that was what made her so respectful ivy ex claimed she felt your power i guess so i think she was sorry about it anyway but shes been a wild woman all her life and it must be hard to change right away even if she really doesnt like blood so the maenad had not quite lost her taste for violence somehow ivy felt better you poor dear she said abruptly full of sympathy let me enhance your heal ing since the wound was in his mouth she touched his man from mundania man from mundania lipswith her own she enhanced the kiss making him recover rapidly soon they resumed their walk along the path holding hands again but with better rapport than before chex was glad to see them we heard some commo tion but did not want to intrude she said did the muse answer your question not exactly ivy said but we did leam that grey does have a talent it seems he nullifies magic when he wants to that explains a number of little mysteries i should think so chex agreed but are you sure i saw no evidence of magic on his part before lets test it electra exclaimed with her usual exu berance let him try to stop you from flying but i dont want to do that grey objected not permanently ivy reminded him just enough to demonstrate your power she didnt add that she her self needed reassurance about it he had subdued the py thon but that might have been because the big reptile couldnt hypnotize mundanes or maybe had trouble with men he thought he had nulled the maenad but it might have been because continued close contact with him stirred certain natural hitherto suppressed romantic urges in her could she after all be so emphatically a woman in every physical respect without having at least a little womanly passion the glow in her eyes had been something after she kissed grey but ivy did not want to discuss such things openly it would be embarrassing if she were mis taken it does seem like a good test chex agreed here grey get on my back if you can prevent me from taking off i will know you have magic power to counter mine grey climbed on in the awkward way he had ivy mar veled that she found his clumsiness endearing but she did grey was nobodys idea of a dashing hero just a decent man chex spread her wings braced herself for a leap and nicked her tail twice the first time the tip touched grey the second time it touched her own body that of course was her magic the flick of her tail made whatever it touched become light so that her wings had much less weight to lift that was why she was able to fly without having wings ten times as large as they were chex leapedand stumbled she came down solidly on all four hooves a look of surprise on her face i cant get light she exclaimed i nulled your tail grey explained do you want me to reverse it no let me try again she flicked her tail several more times but with no better effect indeed there is no effect she confessed very well reverse it nothing showed chex flicked her tail againand sud denly floated into the air her wings only partially spread oh my goodness she exclaimed frantically pumping her wings to get her balance grey hung onto her mane as they wobbled in the air rebound he said all those prior flicks must be tak ing effect now making you too light can you null me just slightly chex asked evidently fighting to prevent herself from sailing way up out of con trol ill try then she stabilized and came slowly to earth he has magic chex announced as grey dismounted her mane was in disarray and she looked flustered rebound nada said that must be why the mae nads wine spring got even stronger than before when you canceled the null thats some magic thats like my magic ivy said i simply enhance but you can enhance by rebound she was impressed by the demonstration she trusted chexs judgment but i wonder how general this talent is see if it works on me nada said stop me from changing form she went to grey and held out her arm he took it they stood there doing nothing well go on try to change electra said lam trying nada replied oh electra smiled well then let her do it grey suddenly nada turned into a serpent with a human head man from mundania man from mundania at each end eeeek what happened she cried in chorus rebound ivy said amazed quick grey null her down a little the heads disappeared for a moment the serpent had no head then nadas regular form appeared the body of the serpent with just one human head that was horri ble she said i never had trouble with my natural form like that before cheiron nodded undisciplined magic is dangerous we should cease these experiments until a safer program of testing can be established yes grey agreed immediately i dont want to mess anyone up im not used to having a talent at all but ivy could not be satisfied yet they were calling you magician i never claimed to be that he protested the mae nads assumed i am a sorceress ivy continued evenly that is the same as a magician only female the terminology a ves tige of what my mother calls xanths sexist heritage noth ing short of magicianlevel magic could null my talent so lets find out if i advise against this cheiron said chex nodded agreement and xap squawked no i really want to know ivy said she had always managed to get her own way ultimately and she intended to have it now i want to know if grey is magician level try to null me grey i uh really dont think he began then seeing her set face he yielded but im not sure exactly how uh it would work ill try to enhance something and you try to prevent me she looked around her eye fell on a glowworm just poking its head up as the evening approached ill en hance that glowworm she picked up the worm it wriggled in her hand glow ing faintly grey put his hand on her other arm very wellim nulling you he said ivy felt nothing she concentrated on the worm willing it to brighten it nickered but did not increase its light she concen trated harder but it remained dim she put forth all her effort then the glow brightened slightly grey had defi nitely crimped her style now unnull she said the glowworm flashed like a lightning bug so brightly that the entire region became noonlit then it exploded burning her hand they stared the glowworm was gone only ashes re mained we killed it grey said appalled ivy looked at her smarting hand oh i wish i hadnt done that precisely cheiron said in a foolsheedwamings not tone now we know that grey truly is magician cal iber no more experiments no more experiments grey agreed staring at the ash no more experiments ivy agreed then she started to cry that poor glowworm they camped for the night subdued they had found greys magic and that was wonderful it was magician level and that was amazing they could now get married and that was best of all but they had done harm in the testing of it and that was bad way too late ivy wished she hadnt pushed it there had been no need to destroy the innocent glowworm she just hadnt thought of the consequence despite cheirons warning in the morning after breakfast they discussed itand came up with a disturbing question it was electra who posed it but perhaps it had been in the back of the minds of the others too how can a man from mundania have magic at all let alone be a magician there was the root of it something was fundamentally wrong unless everything they knew about mundanes and man from mundania magic was false until that question was answered they could not rest easy nada assumed her snake form and they mounted their steeds and flew back to castle roogna but ivy knew that despite their seeming victory it was not yet appropriate to marry grey magicians did not appear from nowhere and certainly not from mundania she knew that her parents would insist on learning the truth and she knew they would be right her quest with grey was far from over it had only changed its nature it was as if they had climbed to what they thought was the top of mount parnassus only to discover that it was only a ledge and that the real peak remained as far above as ever chapter pewters ploy jjd lease grey i really didnt want to admit my ignorance there at the castle rapunzel said in his ear i mean i understand why you and ivy need com pany on this trip because betrothed couples arent sup posed to go too far alone together and nada and electra didnt care to tangle with compewter again but why are you going to see the evil machine grey had not yet gotten used to having a tiny and beau tiful woman perched on his shoulder and holding onto his earlobe with one dolllike hand the parents had decreed that he and ivy had to be chaperoned until they got mar ried which seemed to be their way of agreeing that the doubt about that marriage was gone ivy had met their ultimatum and proved grey had a magic talent with a vengeance in fact he was now eligible to be king some day but the parents shared ivys own concern about the origin of that talent mysteries abounded in xanth and things that made no sense but a mystery relating to the betrothed of a princess was a serious matter so little ra punzel and her similarly little husband grundy golem were the chaperones this time size hardly mattered in this land of magic grundy was riding ivys shoulder as she walked on the path ahead and evidently regaling her with remarks because every so often she giggled well uh it seems that this compewter is similar to man from mundania a machine i had in mundania he said actually what i had was a computer and all i used it for was word processingthats the mundane term for writing papers i would type on this keyboardthats uh do you know what a typewriter is um well then its like a magic pen that sort of writes the words for you all you have to do is touch the right keys and it sort of saves the words and then prints uh writes them all in one big swoop at the end mundania must be a very strange place rapunzel observed kicking her feet she had petite feet and very nice legs he could just about see them from the comer of his eye he understood that she had elven ancestry so could assume the size of elvesor any other size from tiny to hugewithout changing her form at all very strange he agreed anyway i got a new pro gram for this computera program is sort of a set of in structions that tells it what to do and oh the way queen irene tells ivy what to do uh not exactly but maybe close enough this new program changed it a lot it started talking to me on its screen and uh well i guess granting wishes that doesnt sound like compewter she exclaimed tossing her hair that was quite a trick because her hair was as long as forever in fact she had tied a hank of it to his pocket button as an anchor in case she should fall the rest of it flowed out about her like a silken cloak it was dark at her head but faded to almost white at the end of the tresses luxuriant all the way her eyes shifted colors similarly depending on the shadow it doesnt grant wishes it changes reality to suit itself this uh program may have done the same thing it well i wanted a nice girlfriend i really well i was pretty lonely there by myself in my room all the time not much good at anything and rapunzel stroked his ear with a duster formed from braided hair i understand perfectly i was locked up in a tower for ages if it hadnt been for my correspondence with ivy i dont know what i would have done yes i guess you do understand so the program well it claimed to have brought ivy man from mundania but she was sent by the heaven cent yes to where she was most neededand i sure needed her so i guess the computer was just taking credit for that when it wasnt so but it must have known she was coming and it did help it made it possible for us to talk together it was well like magic ivy recognized it as compewter so when it turned out i had magic she remembered that and figured compewter must know something so were going to find out what it knows butbut how could compewter be in mundania she asked cutely perplexed he couldnt see her face but the cuteness was caressing his ear like a warm earmuff on a chill day grundy was a lucky golem that is another mystery grey admitted i thought it was a scientific program that accounted for the change in my computer but now i recognize it as magic so we have two problems how can a mundane have magic and how can there be magic in mundania they may be linked and surely compewter knows the answer to at least one of them thank you she said now i understand of course you must ask the evil machine but i hope it doesnt get the better of you well i do have uh magic now and if i can null other magic maybe i can null compewter so we shouldnt have much to fear but if the machine knows about you and helped put you in touch with ivy it may know how to handle you um yes id better warn ivy before we go into its cave but grey was not unduly worried because he knew that computers could not take any physical action how could it stop him from just walking out when its magic couldnt work on him when he didnt want it to he walked faster catching up to ivy hey rapunzel thought of something he said punzels got a lot of thoughts in her little head grundy agreed but her hair stops most of them from getting out fortunately unlike grundys big mouth rapunzel retorted which lets everything out ready or not man from mundania man from mundania grundy put his thumbs up beside his ears waggling his fingers at her she responded by sticking out her tongue at him again grey felt the gesture though he couldnt see it this seemed to be just another incidental aspect of the magic of xanth hey i thought you two liked each other grey said no we dont grundy said glowering thats true rapunzel agreed with her teeth clenched but we love each other they exclaimed together and broke out laughing ivy laughed too i guess you walked into that one grey she said i guess i did he agreed ruefully they do that to anyone who hasnt known them be fore ivy continued before they got together grundy had a loud mouth and little thought while punzel had vice versa now he thinks more and she talks more and they overlap quite a bit oh you told grundy exclaimed while rapunzel blushed and you said had a big mouth ivy looked flustered what i meant by overlap was rapunzel could no longer stifle her giggle gotcha grundy said grey stifled a grin so it wasnt just newcomers who got teased but about what rapunzel thought ofif com pewter knows about me should we just walk into his lair ivy considered i think pewter wants us to come to him i have the feeling that we shall have to do some dealing to get our information so we have to go in it isnt as if my folks dont know where i am this time grey realized that the king of xanth could probably make a lot of trouble for the machine if sufficiently an noyed the machine surely knew that maybe that was enough of a backup but if push comes to shove she continued we can coordinate on some plan to overcome the evil machine but he will overhear whatever we plan she brought up her right hand putting her two larger fingers together with her thumb in the sign for no now he understood grey nodded not making a big thing of it because he realized that someone might be magically watching or listening they did have a secret language thanks to that episode in mundania he re hearsed the signs in his mind hoping he remembered enough to be intelligible they resumed their walk was that a magic gesture rapunzel inquired softly in his ear not exactly he murmured but if you see us mov ing our hands when were with compewter pay no atten tion so the machine doesnt catch on very well she agreed perplexed the path was devious but in due course they arrived at the cave of the dread machine it seemed to be guarded by an invisible giant but they were not affrighted they knew that the giant was there only to stampede travelers into the cave where compewter had power hey bigfoot how ya doing grundy called his voice amazingly loud grey realized that ivy was enhancing it for him so that he could reach the giants distant head up there in the clouds aooooga the giants voice dropped down appar ently the giants language like his body was unintelligible to normal folk here in regular xanth hey thats great the golem replied grey remem bered that grundy could speak the languages of all living things ask him if he knows girard ivy suggested hey emptyface know girard a foghorn series of grunts came down yes he was a loner always doing odd things grundy translated thats the one grey agreed but hes happy now ill tell him about how girard went to the gourd grundy went into a series of honks and gross gutturals look we have to get on with our business ivy said impatiently you can stay out here and chat if you want but grey and i have to talk with compewter man from mundania man from mundania im ready grundy said giants arent much for conversation anyway at least this one doesnt smell as bad as they usually do i made him take a bath last time ivy explained they entered the cave it was dark near the opening but lighted deeper in they came to a chamber with polished walls and sure enough something very like a homemade computer sitting on the floor this then was compewter doesnt look like much to me grey remarked i mean im no computer engineer but even i can see this equipment is obsolete watch it grundy said this thing can hear you and it can do things you wouldnt believe grey had seen enough of the golem to realize that he had respect for almost nothing if he was in awe of this crude machine compewter must indeed have power the pane of glass at the top of the assemblage lighted who are you it printed i am princess ivy ivy said quickly i have brought my betrothed grey of mundania to talk with you ah at last the screen printed all we want to know is what do you know about grey ivy said he has a magic talent and of course what is his talent grey had a sudden suspicion he flashed a no sign to ivy if the machine didnt know his talent it was better to keep it in reserve ivy caught the signal well pewter we thought you would know so we came to consult with you after all you were in touch with him in mundania werent you yes and no you were not in touch grey asked startled but we saw he broke off halted by ivys no sign she was right there was no point in telling this machine any more than they had to you saw what we saw something that reminded us of you grey said carefully can you explain it i do not have to explain then we shall depart ivy said turning to face the cave exit princess discovers door locked can not exit the screen printed a closed door appeared shutting off the exit i dont see anything grey said come on ivy lets go he took her arm and walked to the door as he had expected it was illusion they walked right through it a bell dinged they turned to look back it was a bluff the screen printed i shall answer all your questions they returned but ivy made a sign he couldnt inter pret he assumed it meant something like caution it was obvious that this was a treacherous and perhaps mean spirited machine why does grey have a talent when he is mundane ivy asked because he is not mundane but i am mundane grey exclaimed this is the first time ive set foot in xanth i didnt even believe in it before true the screen responded but not the whole truth then give us the whole truth ivy said you will not necessarily like it grey exchanged another half glance with ivy what was this machine getting at why not ivy asked after a pause lets make a deal tell me all you know about grey and i will tell you all i know how can you be ignorant of what we know if you know things we dont grey asked i assure you it is so i need to know your story in order to be assured of the relevance of mine after we exchange information we shall have to deal again this is what you will not necessarily like again they considered it seemed to grey that if the machine tried something they objected to like conjuring a monster he could stop it by using his talent to null com pewter himself this would be as effective if the machine man from mundania man from mundania knew his talent as if it did not perhaps more effective because of the psychological element he caught ivys eye again she nodded they would deal we agree grey said we will tell you what we know and then you will tell us what you know with no concealment but we make no commitment about dealing thereafter agreed start with your location and the manner you contacted my emissary grey started in he described his origin in mundania and the way he had installed the new program and then encountered a series of odd girls before meeting ivy he concluded by telling of his magic talent amazing i knew you would have magic but not that it would be magician class perhaps some mun dane interaction enhanced it this is completely positive your turn pewter ivy said grimly it will be more telling if i dramatize the origin do it any way you want grey said just give us the full information the screen changed color it became a picture of a dark lake in a cave in shades of gray print flashed over the picture the time of no magic what grey asked princess ivy will explain while i show the scenes the screen printed it was before my time ivy said in fact before my fathers time something happened and the magic of all xanth turned off as she spoke the scene shifted to show limp tangle trees and bedraggled dragons all suffer ing from the loss of the magic that sustained them i think it only lasted for a few hours but it was awful xanth was dying then the magic came back on and it hasnt been off sincebut things werent the same the gorgon had stoned a whole lot of men and they all came back to life when the magic went and stayed alive when it returned but the magic creatures and plants were pretty much the same apparently it was only temporary magic that got nulled but the forget spell on the gap chasm took a horrible jolt and it began to break up and now its gone my father was born right after that the ogres marked his birthday wrong on their calendar they always were somewhat hamhanded meanwhile the scene on the screen which resembled nothing so much as a television movie before the days of color had completed its scan of the devastation wreaked by the loss of magic and returned to the subterranean pool from this pool two figures struggled one was a man of healthy middle age the other was a rather pretty young woman others were emerging from the pool in cluding some monsters but the scene oriented on these two they seemed not to get along very well they gestic ulated as if telling each other to go away but the man found a ledge leading up a river tunnel and the woman followed then grey realized that there were subtitles he moved closer to the screen with ivy so that they could read the words for they were in much smaller print than before so as not to obscure the picture look the bedraggled woman was saying you dont like me and i dont like you but we can get out of here paster if we cooperate once the magic re turns we will both be finished you know that the man in the picture considered very wellwe shall cooperate until we get out of xanth then we go our own ways thats fine she agreed they hurried on up the river a monster appeared like a twisted small sphinx ill reshape it the woman said she gestured but nothing happened oh i forgot there is no magic thats why we were able to escape from the brain corals storage pool but we dont know when the magic will return the man reminded her we have to keep moving or the coral will recapture us as they talked grey found himself getting used to the printed dialogue and it seemed increasingly as if he ac man from mundania tually heard them speak the scene became real for him as was often the case when he watched movies but im getting tired the woman protested im not used to terrain like this what do you want womanfor me to carry you he demanded irately im tired myself only to slow the pace a little look we cant possibly get all the way to xanth border afoot without resting it will be better to set a pace we can maintain so we can go farther without collapsing the man considered you are correct he slowed the pace time passes the screen said the picture fading out then it showed the two emerging into daylight they were obviously both quite fatigued they fetched some sodden pillows from a defunct pillow bush and lay down to rest and then to sleep it was early morning and evidently cold there were no blankets and the pillows were falling apart finally they embraced not with any passion but to conserve their body warmth and slept time passes the next scene showed the two back on their feet be draggled but moving better they found stray items of food snatching spoiling pies from bushes and eating as they traveled then they encountered the gap chasm we forgot about this the woman exclaimed ap palled in that moment in the bright daylight she looked almost familiar but grey could not quite place the con nection certainly he had known no one in xanth then he hadnt been alive naturally the man agreed gruffly that idiot det onated the most powerful forget spell ever forged in it it will be centuries before that dissipates if ever the woman nodded grimly the same idiot who intro duced millie the maid to the zombie master i would have married him in due course if he hadnt been smitten by her how could a magician fall for a nothing like her the zombie master and millie the ghost ivy ex man from mundania claimed they did live in that time before they came to ours the man smiled she had a talent she needed nothing else oh yesthe talent of sex appeal but shed be just as drab as i am now if she were here without her magic the man eyed her indubitably true now dont mis understand me i regard you as a bad attitude that walks like a girl but physically you are not drab well the same to you who are you to talk every thing you touch fouls up but youre hardly ugly physi cally oh he inquired annoyed well things are supposed to foul up thats my talent and not only are you not drab you are in fact quite shapely in your fashion is that so she demanded angrily you are the worst villain on the scene but actually youre handsome it was obvious by the mans sinister expression that he intended to strike back at her hard i would even go so far as to call you beautiful he said with calculated af front only those rags youre in detract she was almost speechless with rage she tore off her remaining clothes and stood naked well now im out of these rags i dare you to repeat that i repeat it he said nastily eying her thoroughly so as to be absolutely certain i had supposed that you used your talent to reshape your body to better advantage but i know now that you came by it naturally you cant claim the excuse of sorceresslevel enhancement im no sorceress she screamed in his face you think everybody is magician level like you that is a matter of opinion i have a right to mine your magic is sorceress level the woman opened her mouth but no sound came out she jumped at him clawing at his chest but succeeded only in ripping away much of his own tattered clothing then he caught her wrists and held her helpless fur thermore he said his face close to hers you think you lack sex appeal but last night when we slept embraced for man from mundania warmth it was all i could do to refrain from taking advan tage of you well why didnt you she cried its your business to foul things up do you foul yourself up too so you cant even do wrong by a woman in your power i foul things up magically he retorted this had nothing to do with magic you have natural sex appeal deny it as you will well you have it yourself so there you know what i think i think that deny it as you will you have a fun damentally decent streak in you otherwise last nighti mean it isnt as if i would have resisted they stood there chest to chest each angrier than the other you female dog he said i have half a mind to so do i so do i you male dog she retorted you probably wouldnt even slap me if i kissed you you shameless creature i dare you to kiss me you hypocrite their lips met he tried to sneer to show how little he cared she tried to make mush lips to show how indifferent she was they both bungled it badly in their fury the kiss lasted a long time and the shameful truth was that it was a rather intense and effective example of its breed understand i have no respect for you at all he told her after the long moment his hair was ruffled and his face was flushed as if he had just been exposed to a truly repulsive experience i am doing this only because the sight and feel of your body overwhelms my better judg ment your embrace destroys any judgment i have she shot back her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks had what would have been rosy highlights in a color scene as if she had just experienced something too awful to recognize i detest what you are making me so eager to do i will be thoroughly disgusted with myself tomor row he said ominously i will feel totally without virtue tomorrow she re plied grimly man from mundania just to be quite certain we understand how bad this is he said we had better try it another time just so we never so far forget ourselves as to make this mistake again she agreed they kissed again and sure enough it was even worse than before both of them were breathless when it fin ished their chests heaving as if they had been running i am appalled to think that i am doing this with you he said holding her more closely than was necessary for support with anyone else it could be worthwhile well im not taking this lying down she said dis engaging so she could lie down he joined her and when i realize that we could have been making good our escape from xanth instead of wasting our time like this or catching up on our rest she added putting her arms around him there has probably never been any thing quite as foolish as this especially considering that we detest each other he drew her in quite close and want nothing so much as never to see each other again she agreed stroking his back this entire business is disastrous a complete catastrophe they kissed yet again both shuddering with the disgust they felt for this outrage say this is getting hot grundy said zestfully watch your mouth rapunzel snapped jumping down to approach him menacingly listen hairball he started meeting her they laughed embracing something had been nagging grey as he watched the screen now he realized what it was grundy and rapun zels joke acting as if they hated each otherthat was what this episode of the man and woman was like then something strange happened it took grey another moment to figure it out color was appearing on the screen i thought pewter couldnt handle color ivy said man from mundania i didnt know pewter could handle pictures grundy said it was always just print before youre missing the best part rapunzel murmured greys gaze snapped back to the screen what are they doing he asked amazed we arent supposed to tell you rapunzel said ever since we joined the adult conspiracy then the scene changed it showed a snoozing bigbeaked bird suddenly waking as if jolted by an unexpected call theyre summoning the stork ivy exclaimed catch ing on and it just got the message i never knew how it was done you are losing your innocence rapunzel said sadly the picture returned to the man and woman they had just realized something themselves the magic has re turned she exclaimed and there grey realized was the significance of the color on the screen it signified the magic ambience of xanth after the blah shades of gray of the time of no magic we did indeed dally too long the man replied oddly he did not look as unhappy about their dalliance as might have been expected much too long the woman agreed seeming no more upset about their folly than he but we can still escape he said the brain coral should be disorganized for a time and it cant act directly it will have to send a message to recapture us and that will be hard to do for a few hours the woman gazed out into the gap chasm at whose lip they had just summoned the stork but it will take us days to cross this even if we can get past the dragon at the bottom we dont dare use a magic bridge or even a recognized crossing region true he considered briefly perhaps we should foul up the pursuit by doing the completely unexpected trav eling south instead of north toward the exit from xanth but then we wont escape xanth at all they will use magic to ferret us out and well be done for maybe not i can exert my talent to foul up the pur man from mundania suit and you can exert yours to reshape some blankets into clothing for us we might yet be able to sneak out before they get truly organized but that means we shall have to stay together she said expressing a good deal more alarm than she seemed to feel it is a burden we shall just have to endure he said surprisingly undismayed i suppose so just so we dont do any of this again she said putting her arms around him or any of this he agreed kissing her how fortunate that we understand each other so well she said with a smile that might have had a hint of wry ness well we certainly made our attitude toward each other clear enough he agreed with even less of a hint of irony when you insulted me by calling my talent sorceress level did you really mean it of course i meant that insult he said indignantly do you think i would compliment you she was silent but there were tears in her eyes it was evident that of all the insults he had proffered that was the one that had scored most effectively perhaps it had been the one that caused her to make the supreme sacrifice of dragging him right down to the awful business of sum moning the stork certainly her revenge had been effec tive costly as it must have been to her selfesteem they walked south away from the chasm their aversion for each other manifesting in subtle ways such as when he mockingly helped her over a fallen tree or when she just as mockingly gave him the finest of the yellowberry pies she discovered at times they waxed eloquent in their sarcasm addressing each other as dear or darling and every so often they kissed again just to make sure the revulsion was undiminished a stranger might even have been fooled into thinking they felt about each other as grey and ivy did so perfect was their emulation of that lamented state it was a truly amazing performance then they encountered an invisible giant the monster was stumbling around evidently still dazed by the recent man from mundania man from mundania absence of magic and there was no telling where his clumsy foot would fall next they fled into a nearby cave for safety greetings intruders a screen printed the two halted there in the cave drawing together for mutual protection despite their dislike of each other what are you the man demanded i am compewter i govern this region you are now in my power i have news for you the man said i am a he stopped for the woman had elbowed him they were trying to hide their identities i am about to depart this cave with my um wife the man said choking down the implied intimacy for the sake of concealing their actual feelings for one another i dont believe in your power the two of them turned to go evidently concluding that the staggering giant was a better risk than this strange device door slams closed preventing exit the screeh printed a door appeared across the exit it slammed open what went wrong the screen demanded appalled anything that can go wrong will go wrong the man murmured smiling obscurely i heard that the screen printed now i know you you are magician murphy freshly escaped from the storage pool of the brain coral an evil man magician murphy ivy exclaimed i thought his tal ent seemed familiar murphy glancing back saw the print curses we shall have to destroy this thing lest it give us away wait i am an evil machine we must pool our re sources for greater evil than ever now thats interesting the woman said just what is a machine i think i should render it into a topologically harmless configuration just to be sure and you must be vadne evil but beautiful sor ceress also escaped from confinement in the pool thats my mothers name grey exclaimed vadne murphy but shes forty years old shes no beautiful sor ceress then he stared at ivy the revelation dawning not in mundania ivy said not nineteen years later all that time with no magic getting worn down by drear existence on the screen vadne pursed her lips beautiful sor ceress this thing insults me just as you do maybe we should consult further with this device i will help you escape recapture if you help me gain ultimate power over xanth the screen offered but we must flee xanth magician murphy pro tested we are fugitives there is no freedom for us here we can not help you at all compewter considered the screen pulsing gently with the word considering blinking in a comer then i have the patience of the inanimate i am prepared to defer my ambition for the sake of a better chance of its achievement i will get you out of xanth now if you will give me your son what murphy vadne and grey asked together you have summoned the stork with an order for a son the screen printed you may not return to xanth but your son may give him to me in ex change for your escape i will accept his service in lieu of yours murphy and vadne exchanged a glance and a half we would have to stay together even in mundania she said can we stand that are you implying i cant stand as much as you can he demanded then to pewter we are evil folk how can you trust us to keep that pledge you may be evil but your son will be good when he learns of your pledge he will honor it the two considered then reluctantly they made the deal the picture faded out it was only a moment but it seemed like a generation to grey as he oriented on what he had learned his par entsescaped criminals of xanth that explained so man from mundania much but was also so difficult to accept how could he deal with this so you were brought by the xanth stork rapunzel said your magic talent must have been set by your ori gin even though your parents left xanth and you were delivered in mundania they have a uh different way of doing it in mun dania grey said but yes i was conceiveduh sig naled forin xanth so that does explain my magic aad having a magician and a sorceress for parents meant i had that level of talent too just as was the case with ivy but if they escaped at the time of no magic that was before king dor was uh delivered so how come im not his age no problem grundy said theres a time curtain at the border we can step from xanth into any time of mundania and any place of mundania too but mundanes have more trouble controlling it compewter must have arranged for them to step into the mundania of more re cent vintage i arranged that compewter agreed this is the completion of my plot i waited to bring you to xanth until there was an available princess for you to marry i admit that there was an element of chance when i sent your parents to the current time because the firstborn of this generation might not have been female when it was i knew it was time to act my quacks were aligned quacks grey asked oh you mean ducks so it was you in mundania ivy exclaimed it was my sending i could not go there so i sent my essence there was that kernel of magic about grey even there so it was possible to animate his machine in his presence i did not know what hap pened there only what its capacity was it was to orient on him and manifest only when he was be yond the age of eighteen years so that he would be right for the princess then i sent the princess to him the heaven cent sent me ivy flared man from mundania the heaven cent sent you to where you were most needed which i predefined as the location of ma gician murphys son it was intended that you marry him our romancearranged by the evil machine ivy asked appalled living folk are subject to certain patterns i in stituted one of those patterns now murphys son is here and bound to serve me i made no such deal grey protested your parents did they never intended to honor it and so kept all knowledge of xanth from you so you would not want to come here but i sent my essence and then sent princess ivy to bring you here and now you are bound because you have honor your parents lack they have honor grey said they were trying to save xanth even though they were exiled from it how do we know youre telling the truth dimbulb grundy demanded maybe they never made that deal and youre just making it up in your pictures i expect grey murphy to return to mundania to verify this then he will either remain there or return to xanth and honor the deal grey had the sick feeling that this was the truth but there was still much to be clarified so maybe i was supposed to come to xanth he said why was it so important that i marry ivy i mean i care about her but you dont care about either of us or about romance yes you are only tools for my ambition you must marry ivy and be queen of xanth or even king since your magic is magician caliber either way you will have great influence on the throne or con trol it entirely since you will be serving me i will be the true ruler of xanth that is the culmination of my plot grey stared at ivy who looked back with the same hor ror he felt the situation was clear at last they could go to mundania together or they could break their betrothal man from mundania and both remain in xanth or they could marry and do the evil machines will none of those choices was acceptable oh i wish the good magician was still here ivy exclaimed he would know what to do about this ho ho ho i got rid of the good magician as part of this plot you cant get his advice because you cant find him and i will never tell where he is you did that ivy cried enraged all that mischief all those unanswered questions just to further your foul plot i think you should put your hand on this collection of junk and null it grey grundy said you wont have to serve it if it doesnt operate any more that would be unethical therefore grey murphy will not do it grey gritted his teeth it was the truth oh grey ivy exclaimed tears in her eyes what are we going to do you are going to agonize for a time then verify the accuracy of my statement and finally con form you have one month from this moment to con clude your business and return to me then i will rule xanth ho ho ho grey was very much afraid that the evil machine was correct chapter murphy s yo thats the situation ivy concluded greys a magician so i can marry him but he is bound to serve compewter so i dont dare let him close to the throne and even if i dont marry him he could later become king of xanth in his own right and pewter would have power the only way we can see to stop that is for grey to return to mundania and stay there then pewters deal would have no force king dor nodded is grey willing to do that yes he doesnt want to hurt me or xanth and he has the strength of his convictions queen irene leaned forward then what of you ivy ivy had pondered this on the way home to castle roogna and seen the stark alternatives either she could go with grey and live in mundania or she could remain in xanth and not marry grey neither choice was bear able ivy burst into tears but later her parents had further thoughts we do not know that what pewter claims is the truth dor said we should find out but how ivy asked without more than half a glim mer of hope if its not the truth pewter will never con fess it man from mundonia man from mundania magician murphy might though but hes in mundania you could visit there again and ask him ivys eyes widened the notion of living in drear mun dania was intolerable but she could probably survive an other visit there but still it wasnt good enough why should he tell the truth he opposes the existing order thats why hes exiled no actually dor said he stepped out of the pic ture because he had lost to king roogna he hoped to return at some time when chances were better for him such as when there were no magicians available to be king then he could take over but when he escaped from the brain corals storage pool there were several magi cians so xanth was still no place for him rather than remain in storage indefinitely he fled xanth if he for swore his ambition to become king of xanth he would have no trouble here but why should he forswear her father looked her in the eye if you were exiled from xanth for life and were offered the chance to return if you agreed to forswear ever becoming king would you do it ivy thought about that maybe so but its grey who is bound by the deal not magician murphy and it would be no good having a magician serving pewter even if he never was king your mother and i have discussed this matter and we conclude that you have three options you may not have considered you can verify whether what pewter says is true and if it is not you are all right or you can bring magician murphy back here to xanth on condition that he serve the existing order or bring him here ivy demanded incredulously the man who tried to overthrow king roogna way back when or you can resume the search for good magician humfrey and ask him how to deal with pewter dor concluded how can you speak of bringing that evil magician back that would just make even more mischief here and wouldnt solve any problems for me and grey her father explained ivy stared do you really think that would work if it does not then it may be safe to say that nothing else will she had to concede his point it was a faint and devious hope but it was the best thing available she would visit mundania and talk with magician mur phy and perhaps invite him back to xanth they set out at dawn ivy grey and designated chap erone electra the title thrilled her and she promised to spy on anything the betrotheds might try to do together they rode on three fine steeds electra was on donkey who was now nicely recovered from his captivity with the goblins grey rode pook the ghost horse ivy rode peek pooks ghost mare the ghost colt puck trotted cheer fully along beside all three animals had chains wrapped around their barrels for that was their nature they had been befriended by jordan the barbarian some four hun dred plus years before and though they remained wild ivy had enhanced their lameness and they were glad to serve in this temporary capacity they made excellent time trotting most of the way but the length of xanth was not traveled in a day and they had to camp along the north coast the ghost horses wandered into the night to graze they ate ghost grass which was invisible to normally living folk but ivy could hear the tiny clinks as the little chains on it rattled they walked down to the beach and saw the heaving sea this was a designated camping place so the safety enchantment was on it no monsters or evil plants could intrude here but grey started to walk down a path that crossed the magic line grey where are you going ivy called alarmed i uh have to you know he said embarrassed but youre walking down a tangle tree path if you cross the line and walk into the clutches of the tree man from mundania man from mundania he smiled i uh maybe you forgot my talent ooopsy i did forget she said embarrassed in her turn you have nothing to fear from tanglers uh right he agreed he walked on down the path curious she watched sure enough the tangler was quiescent until grey came within reach then it grabbed its hanging green tentacles whipped around greys body and abruptly fell away limp he brushed on through after he was done there he would restore the trees magicand if it was a smart tree it would not bother him again ivy really hadnt thought about this aspect very much but now she realized that she was as safe with grey as it was possible to be because nothing magic could hurt them that included just about everything in xanth grey could nullify magic partly or not at all or even enhance it by the rebound effect thus he could use or not use magic as he chose to the degree he chose he really was a magician whose power matched her own they were well matched in other respects too grey had loved her though he did not believe that she had magic or that she was a princess she had loved grey though she thought him mundane now each understood what the other was and it was wonderful yet it was all a plot by compewter and that made it awful how near and yet how far the waves rose up ahead of her forming odd shapes she realized that she had been unconsciously enhancing the magic of the sea as she stood there musing about grey now the water was glowing and the spume was forming faces curious she enhanced it further soon a big wave took shape and held its position its frothy eyes stared out at her and its little whirlpool of a mouth opened beee waare it splashed ivys own mouth dropped open it had spoken to her why would a wave try to do such a thing did it like being enhanced electra and donkey approached quietly its warning us about something electra murmured wed better find out what ivy agreed she concentrated giving the wave her best enhancement beware of what she called uncertain whether it could hear or understand her she tried to en hance its hearing and understanding but knew there were limits paaath oooouut the wave replied then it collapsed back into mere water the path is out electra asked maybe a storm washed out the dirt we should readily see that donkey said it really did not require such a dramatic warning maybe the wave isnt very smart electra said still it meant well ivy said she had never talked to a wave before that sort of thing was her fathers talent could she now enhance inanimate things too or had she always been able to without realizing it she cupped her mouth with her hand thank you wave she called we shall beware the path a surge of bubbly water washed up around her feet as if licking them grey returned they gathered breadfruit and butter balls and even found an eye scream bush with several flavors of confection they settled for the night ivy wanted to sleep beside grey but chaperone electra was right there watching ea ger to catch them at anything that smacked even faintly of stork ivy wasnt sure whether the girl was moved more strongly by duty or curiosity she remembered how curi ous she herself had been about the business of stork sum moning in the last year or so she had finally succeeded in piecing together diverse bits of information and aided by strong hints from nada had pretty much solved the riddle she believed she would be able to summon the stork when the time came but she had no intention of doing so before she got married now she was part of the adult conspiracy obliged to hide the information from childrenand electra was still mostly a child despite her love for dolph and her betrothal to him so she piled her pillows and blankets and bedded down man from mundania by herself and grey did likewise though she would so much rather have hugged him to sleep in the morning the ghost horses returned and they re sumed their journey not far up the path peek lifted her nose and sniffed pook and puck did likewise evidently disturbed by something that warning donkey said do you think this is where the path is out it looks firm to me grey said they had told him of the wave warning they went on cautiously the path was whole entirely normal but the three ghost horses remained skittish which was unusual for them they rounded a turnand there was a huge land dragon straddling the path it was a smoker with clouds of deep gray smoke wafting back from its nostrils grey in the lead on pook came to a sudden halt i thought you said this path was enchanted he exclaimed ivy next in line stopped as suddenly it is no pred ator is supposed to be able to intrude the dragon formed a toothsome grin obviously it had another opinion well ill just null it grey said watch the smoke ivy warned it can blind you and choke you before you get close pook can get me there before the dragon gets its smoke really up grey said it wont be expecting us to charge it he patted the ghost horse you do believe in my power pook nodded though a trifle uncertainly he had been told of it but had not seen it demonstrated there was a roar from the rear ivy looked back there was another dragon like the first but slightly smaller surely the smokers mate its a trap she cried they have boxed us in electra on donkey was third in line well take this one she cried no ivy screamed you cant man from mundania but now both dragons roared horrendously smoke bil lowed for the moment masking them now grey called while theyre drawing breath but ivy started flustered pook charged forward and donkey charged back ivy was left in mid protest in the middle grey disappeared into the cloud of smoke she knew he could null the dragon if he got close enough to touch it and at the rate the ghost horse was going they would not just touch but collide it was electra who needed help peek responding to ivys decision whirled and gal loped back the smoke was thinning she saw the fuzzy outline of electra strike the dragon on the sooty snoot the dragon blinked shocked but ivy knew that electras charge could not knock out a dragon this size it would only set it back a moment then there would be real trou ble as ivy reached them donkey was kicking the dragons head with his hind hooves the dragon still jolted by the electric shock was not moving but the hoof strikes were only rattling its head not making it retreat still it was an idea ill enhance you ivy told peek you turn about and deliver your hardest kick to its chin dont miss she concentrated on enhancing peeks power of kick she imagined the hooves as having the same hardness as the metal chains and the legs having enormous power this would be some kick peek turned threw down her head and let go with a phenomenal twohoof kick it connected ivy felt the shock it jolted her teeth was it enough peeks feet came down she turned again they both looked and so did electra and donkey the dragon was flat on its back its tail twitching peeks doublehooved kick had flipped the monster all the way over and knocked it out the kick had indeed been enough grey and pook trotted up the front dragon is uncon scious grey reported and so is this one by the look of it man from mundania but how did they get on the enchanted path electra asked now i think i understand donkey said the waves warning the spell on the path is out so it isnt safe in this section all three ghost horses nodded they had known it but had been unable to speak their knowledge but the spell was set by good magician humfrey ivy said he wouldnt let anything happen to it not if he were still around electra said but hes been gone for seven years ivy felt stupid of course the good magician was gone it was dolphs quest for him that had introduced him to nada and electra and ivys quest for him that had intro duced her to grey now other folk could tinker with his spells with impunity weve got to get him back she muttered there must be a counterspell here electra said to cancel out the path enchantment so the monsters can get in then maybe i can null it grey said except i dont know how to relate to it ill enhance your ability to relate ivy said then maybe you can null it he shrugged its worth a try they dismounted and took each others hands youre holding hands electra exclaimed im going to re port that if you do ill report that time you sneaked into my little brothers room and held his hand while he was sleep ing ivy said darkly electra looked so abashed that ivy grey and donkey burst out laughing one of the charming things about elec tra was that she retained so much of the innocence of childhood ivy concentrated on greys power of relation she felt something happening but wasnt sure what then there was a moment of vertigo got it grey said the source of the problem is man from mundania over there he walked to the side of the path this bit of wood he asked picking it up thats reverse wood ivy exclaimed it must have reversed the enchantment on the path right here near it so the dragons could get in well ill null it then dont do that ivy said quickly suppose it reversed your talent but we cant leave the path unprotected just throw the wood away donkey suggested it wont do any harm if its not in the path grey wound up and hurled the wood far to the side immediately the three ghost horses reacted relaxing the two unconscious dragons stirred each dragged itself up and scrambled away from the path problem solved donkey said with satisfaction but there never would have been a problem if the good magician were still around ivy said as soon as we settle our personal problem well have to resume the quest for him we cant continue much longer without him if we could find him maybe he could settle all our personal questions electra said ivy nodded electra had a problem that was just as se rious as ivys own when dolph came of age to marry and had to choose which of his betrothees actually to marry he was very likely to choose nada then electra would die having failed to marry the prince who had res cued her from her enchanted sleep unless grey could nullify the spell on her ivy pondered that could it represent the solution for electra she hes itated to mention it until she was sure magic did not always work the way expected and mistakes could be di sastrous they reached the isthmus this was as far as their steeds could go for magical creatures would soon perish when out of the magic of xanth donkey would keep watch for their return to this spot and the ghost horses would come at his whistle the final station on the enchanted path was a nice one with useful plants of all kinds and an excellent man from mundcmia view of the changing colors of the sea donkey said he expected to enjoy his stay here the colors of the sea related to the times and places of mundania that the folk of xanth could go to scholars such as ichabod the mundane archivist and amolde centaur had taken the trouble to study it and to issue vo luminous reports that entirely defined it unfortunately no one else was able to understand the reports most of what ivy knew about the colors was that when the sea turned black it led to the black sea of mundania where her parents had gone to rescue grandpa trent and grandma iris ages ago this time they were not going to mess with the colors at all grey simply nulled the magic of the border and they walked through to what was called contemporary mundania which was where grey had lived they knew it was right because their entry through the gourd in no name key had also bypassed the magical barrier thus the three of them found themselves stumbling through drear brush in drear mundania and onto one of the paved regions called highways though in truth they were low rather than high now ivy and electra could talk to each other but not to grey because grey had been raised with the nonsensical language of the mundanes grey demonstrated the magic of the thumb signal to make one of the cruising vehicles screech to a precipitous halt it didnt work very well until ivy enhanced it slightly by hiking up her skirt to show more leg then a monstrous truck squealed to a stop providing their first ride they let grey do the talking since they could not ivy exchanged hand signals with grey when she needed to and quietly pointed out the few interesting things to elec tra such as the odd boxlike buildings and colored lights that always flashed bright red when the vehicle ap proached so it went for an interminable journey along the as sorted and confused roads of this dull realm they found a public sleeping place called a bus station for the night the seats were not at all suited to comfortable sleeping but this was only another evidence of the craziness of man from mundania mundanes ivy had to show electra how to use the facil ities in the room for natural functions and the girl was appropriately awed how can they use perfectly good drinking water for such a thing she demanded in a whis per suppose somebody forgets and drinks it ivy had no answer there was simply no explaining much of what the mundanes did as they stood before one of the strange unmagic mirrors ivy was surprised to notice how tall electra had grown she was now as tall as ivy and looked mature too ivy realized that she had been too preoccupied with her own concerns to pay much attention electra would have been maturing all along it had taken the stark mirror that showed them standing together to make ivy appreciate the extent of it grey got bits of wrapped food from the lighted standing machines he had saved some of their mundane coins for this purpose apparently the machines liked the taste of metal better than real food and would give up their food for it ivy had seen this on her last trip here but electra was amazed when do the machines eat the food they trade for the metal she asked why dont they just eat the metal to begin with if they dont like the food again ivy could not answer they slept propped against grey on either side his arms around each ivy wondered whether this was at all like her brothers situation with two betrothees innocent dolph would be satisfied to marry them both the one out of compassion the other out of love but the parents had said no no way definitely not absolutely out of the ques tion and never so it seemed likely that they would op pose such a solution too bad for nada and electra were both so nice they finally reached greys apartment it was hardly too soon for electra wasnt feeling well she had been eating ravenously never seeming to get enough and had grown somewhat short tempered and absentminded she was also quite dirty so that she hardly looked herself ivy had not liked this place before but now it was bless ediy familiar her own room was unchanged with plenty of agendas food still on the shelves she encouraged electra to eat what she wanted and to clean up and don one of the dresses in the closet so she could be present able again then she went across the hall with grey compewters sending remained as soon as he turned the machine on they were able to talk naturally again it was a great relief so you brought someone else from xanth the screen remarked yes this is electra our chaperone grey said as electra appeared at the door cleaned and changed yes it is proper to have an older person in that capacity oh shes not older ivy protested but then she took another look at electra and was amazed the giri did look older like a woman of thirty or so she had assumed that it was dirt and wear on the clothing that had changed her appearance but now it was clear that those things had only masked the true extent of the change how could this be grey too was surprised electra youre bigger and older and uh fuller he said your new clothing makes you look so awfully old what happened she is young the screen inquired what is her his tory shes actually from about nine hundred years ago ivy said a spell fouled up and she slept until the pres ent but she remained the same age until she woke until now it was foolish to bring her to mundania the sctwit said she is now in the process of attaining her mun dane age of nine hundred years the three exchanged portions of a glance of sheer hor ror oh electra we never thought ivy cried we knew the magic folk couldnt come here it is of course my own fault electra said with sur prising maturity naturally i should have realized that this would be the case i shall try to handle it in an adult manner man from mundania she was older emotionally too she was aging in every way how long before she uh grey asked at the present rate of progression she should have about three more days before beginning to fail from old age the screen printed weve got to get her back to xanth ivy exclaimed patience electra demurred sensibly it required two days for us to reach this destination two days should suffice for the return we can accomplish our business in the intervening day i see no reason to jeopardize our mis sion merely because of my indisposition your indisposition ivy exclaimed by the time we get back to xanth youll be an old woman how could you marry dolph then electra smiled with the poise of maturity that would seem to solve my problem wouldnt it of course i would not require the child to marry a harridan have no concern the screen printed in the re newed ambience of magic she will revert at the same rate she aged until she resumes her point of equilibrium for that environment oh lectra ivy exclaimed much relieved she opened her arms to hug her friend then saw how strange the older woman looked and fell back this might be the same person as her friend but it was hard to accept emo tionally your reaction is perfectly understandable electra said tolerantly if she was hurt she masked it with the competence for which adults were notorious ivy felt very small and grubby inside wed better uh go see my folks grey said they live in squeedunk about sixty miles from here i went to city college because it was the closest one that gave a tuition break for state residents but it was too far to com mute theres a daily bus but its schedule is calculated to make it useless and it always runs late anyway but we have to do this in one day ivy said we could take a taxi if i had the money but man from mundania there is an emergency reserve fund that will cover this ivy looked at the screen suspiciously why are you being so helpful pewter you know we dont like you i am not pewter i am merely a sending sent to do pewters bidding it is my task to facilitate the liaison between grey murphy and princess ivy and your consultation with magician murphy will es tablish your situation the money is in the disk mailer under my monitor grey looked under the screen he found the mailer there behind the floppy disk was a packet of money he hadnt noticed before hidden until he looked for it he nodded this will do it but ivy wasnt quite satisfied so sending youre not the same as pewter what do you get out of this data insufficient dont give me that she snapped you know exactly what i mean bad folk never do things just because theyre supposed to they always have something to gain data insufficient electra stepped in what she means to say sending is that it would facilitate her liaison with grey murphy if she had just a bit more information she is so constituted that she tends to distrust what she does not understand and that may prejudice her relationship with her fiances parents and therefore with grey as well since your par ticipation is integral your separate input is necessary so that the mission will not be compromised clarification accepted ivy kept her mouth shut electras new maturity was coming in handy normally each party to an agreement receives an emolument appropriate to his participation electra con tinued incomprehensibly what is your reward in the event the mission is successful return to xanth and what is your penalty in the event the mission is unsuccessful confinement to mundania mon from mundanio electra looked benignly crafty in the way that only an adult could as it happens we are shortly to return to xanth we might take you with us so that you would have no further need to gamble on the outcome of the mission for your own resolution if you were to cooperate with us the screen flickered are you attempting to bribe me again that crafty adult smile parties of conscience neither proffer nor accept unwarranted remuneration they merely come to reasonable understandings what do you require information on how ivy may marry grey without be ing required either to support his commitment of servitude to compewter or to exile herself with him in mundania i do not know how the deal with compewter can be abrogated but there is a strategy that will ac complish this if it is possible will information on that strategy satisfy your requirement electra looked at ivy the sending is ready to deal i think this is the best it can offer how do you feel ivy had hardly followed the preceding dialogue it seemed to her that neither electra nor sending had said anything intelligible yet somehow they seemed to under stand each other it will help us if we help it it will tell us what to do to get around pewters plot if it is possible to get around it then make the deal ivy exclaimed gladly electra returned to the screen that information will satisfy our requirement how may we most expeditiously facilitate your transport to xanth take my oisk grey went to a small box the original vaporware limited disk is here we can carry it with us with no trouble at all but in xanth how will the sending animate ivy asked doesnt it need a screen or something there are magic screens in xanth you may de posit me with any one of those one is in the isth mus man from mundania well do it ivy agreed pleased now whats your strategy return magician murphy to xanth after obtain ing his agreement to exert his talent on your behalf but his talent is to make things foul up ivy pro tested now grey caught on but he controls it doesnt he he makes the side hes against foul up and if hes against compewters plot it might foul up ivy concluded and then wed be all right grey tucked the disk box into a small suitcase and ivy added some mundane clothing electra ate some more from the food on the shelves then they set out for squee dunk the murphys house was typical of mundane resi dences neat clean and drear ivy wondered how they had been able to stand it all these years but of course they had had no choice no one in mundania did if mundanes could escape mundania they would all move to xanth the taxi let them off after grey paid the cabbie the dour driver looked almost satisfied as he drove away i gave him a twentyfive percent tip grey explained touching her hand ivy smiled just as if she understood what this was in fact she was surprised that she could understand any of his words now that they were away from sendings screen then she realized that they had sending along in the disk the machines power was di minished but when ivy touched grey she could under stand him they walked up the walk and grey knocked on the door a pudgy woman opened it npuifs grey ex claimed hugging her hsfzxibu bsfzpv epjoh ifsf she asked surprised eje zpv gbjm gsftinbo fohmjti opu fybdumz he responded mppi nb uijt jt dpnqmjdbufe jmm fyqmbjm fwfszuijoh they were ushered inside and introduced as jwz man from mundania and pmfdusb then they sat on the worn comfortable couch and ivy made sure to sit right next to grey and put her hand on his suitcase so that she could understand what he was saying greys father was old ivy remembered from pewters pictures that magician murphy had been of middle age when he and vadne escaped from xanth and this was nineteen years later so his age wasnt surprising greys mother was of middle age no longer young and had gained a fair amount of weight it really would have been hard to distinguish this couple from any other mundanes but increasingly she was able to see the remnants of the folk they once had been it was really too bad what two decades of mundane life could do to folk first grey said i have to tell you that i now know about xanth both his parents stiffened remaining ex pressionless this was evidently a secret they had pre served throughout i know about the deal you made with compewter and why you never told me about it it was because you didnt want me to go there and have to serve the machine the parents exchanged a mundanish glance zft the magician said ivy needed no translation he had just con firmed the thing they had come to confirm but compewter didnt leave it to chance grey said it sent a sending who brought me ivy here from xanth she is the daughter of king dor and queen irene and is a sorceress in her own right he paused andshe is my fiancee they stared at ivy incredulously ivy nodded feeling abruptly choked after a long moment vadne fumbled for a handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes then she stood and opened her arms to ivy ivy got up and went to her and embraced her there was a thing about betrothals that women understood on a level men did not the language didnt matter then the language did zpvyou are really of xanth vadne asked slowly man from mundania man from mundania ivy was startled she was speaking intelligibly yes i am but how can you vadne smiled i came from xanth too she reminded her still piecing out the longunused words for almost twenty years i have not dared to speakwe had to learn mundanish oh of course it must have been horrible horrible vadne agreed except for grey he was our joy even here grey was looking at them puzzled ohhe hears us talking in xanthian ivy said he cant speak it with out magic we never taught him vadne agreed we eschewed xanth so that he would never learn but now tell him ill tell the rest ivy said there is more vadne asked surprised much more vadne turned to grey qsjodftt jwz xjmm ufmm vt uif sftu efbs she said pleasantly he looked disgrun tled but did not object probably he was dismayed to dis cover that ivy could converse with his parents in a language he could not but he realized the sense of it you see grey helped me get back to xanth ivy explained brightly he didnt believe in it but he liked me so he helped me then i took him in and by the time he came to believe in magic we well we were betrothed then we discovered he had magic himself in fact he was a magician xibu murphy demanded astonished a magician ivy repeated you see you well yoa summoned the stork for him in xanth so he was xan thian and we think maybe your going to mundania before the stork delivered him affected his talent so now he can null magic even mine so hes a magician of null magic anyway my folks said i couldnt marry him unless he had a talent and so now we can marry but we wondered how a mundane could have a talent and when we found out we learned about compewter and the deal you made to get out of xanth but we think maybe theres a way around it waitwait vadne said seeming dizzy we thought he might have magic but thisthis is all so sudden so what we want to do is bring you back to xanth ivy continued blithely because magician murphys tal entwell if he would promise to serve the existing order and foul up pewter instead of my father mean i know he wanted to be king but that was a long time ago murphy and vadne were staring at her but we are banned murphy said we would be put back in the brain corals pool you werent really banned ivy said you just thought the current folk would be mad at you and i guess they are because your curse really messed up my little brother but if you promised not to do it anymore you dont understand vadne said in a fit of jeal ousy i turned a girl into a book and wouldnt turn her back thats why im banned ohmillie the ghost ivy said remembering but shes alive now and so is the zombie master and they have twin children i think they would forgive you if you asked anyway if magician murphy used his talent to make things go wrong for compewter maybe grey could somehow get out of that deal and then we could marry and stay in xanth im sure my father would say its all right because he doesnt want me to have to leave xanth or anything so if you will agree to come and renounce your claim to the throne i renounced it when i fled xanth murphy said fer vently i would give anything to return and so would i vadne agreed as fervently we have dreamed of xanth constantly but never spoken of it but we have to go right away ivy said because electra here is aging and we have to get her back shes actually fifteen years old in xanth both turned to stare at electra it is true electra said your curse magician murphy caused me to sleep for nine hundred years or soi never was sure about the exact countand wake at the age i went to sleep but now man from mundania man from mundania i am out of the magic and those nine hundred years are taking effect my curse murphy asked i did not curse any chil dren i was with the sorceress tapis who opposed you on the isle of view oh now i remember there were two or three girls with her one very pretty that was millie the maid or the princess both were beautiful i was the nothing girl murphys brow furrowed and you come to ask me to return to xanth i would think you would hate me not exactly your curse caused me to become be trothed to a handsome young prince of course i will die if he doesnt marry me but it has been very nice knowing him and ivy so i believe you did as much good for me in your devious fashion as evil i really hold no grudge though i would not want to suffer your curse again murphy considered would you accept my apology for the evil i did you of course but i am at present in a mature state i might feel otherwise in my normal childish state then i will wait to proffer my apology until you return to that childish state and shall meditate on ways to ame liorate the predicament you are in perhaps my talent can be turned to the benefit of others beside my son then youll come ivy asked excited we will both come and ask your father for permission to stay and suffer what consequences there may be murphy said i am sure i speak for my wife too when i say that we shall do all in our power to make amends for the mischief we have done if only we are permitted to return and remain in xanth then its decided ivy said but we must hurry because we have only two days to get electra back we can do it in one murphy said i have a car but the house the arrangementswe cant just leave vadne protested phone your friend next door and tell her the house is hers until we return if we are accepted in xanth we will never return vadne nodded she hurried to the strange mundane in strument called the telephone within an hour they were on their way the five of them piled into the murphys car with some sandwiches and milk that vadne had packed for the trip the car zoomed along the road at a dizzying speed in much the way the taxi had somehow avoiding collisions with all the other cars that zoomed by in the opposite direction almost close enough to touch they drove the rest of the day and didnt stop at night now the bright lights of the other cars flashed in the dark ness making ivy even more nervous but when she glanced at electra and saw her visibly older she knew that speed was best ivy did not realize she had fallen asleep until she was awakened by a bumping jolt we have run out of road magician murphy said we shall have to continue on foot they piled out and started walking magician murphy had a flashlight which in mundania had the odd property of sending out a conical beam of light they marched on into the region that was the isthmus of xanth ivy leading because she was the one who was native to the time of xanth they had left that meant she could lead them back to it if someone from another time of xanth led they would return to his or her time which could be another matter then ivy heard a voice calling in the distance who is there that was donkey ivy is here she called back they oriented on the centaur and soon joined forces they were back in xanth ivy felt an enormous relief she had not realized how nervous she had been about this until they were clear of drear mundania how could she ever hope to survive there for a lifetime but why did you bring three mundanes donkey asked and where is electra the middleaged woman who was electra stepped up to man from mundania him i have put on some years but i will lose them again if you have patience it is you he exclaimed dismayed what hap pened i forgot i was nine hundred years old in mundane terms she said with a wry smile it has been an inter esting experience that i hope will soon be over then ivy introduced magician murphy and vadne we shall have a problem as we do not have steeds for all she said we may have to break into two parties one fast one slow my wife arid i will be happy to take our time mur phy said it has been so long it will take us time to acclimatize and i would prefer to wait until i am back to my normal state electra said i will be happy to remain until you do donkey of fered then suppose grey and i ride ahead on the ghost horses and the rest of you proceed more slowly down the enchanted path ivy said by the time you arrive ev erything should be normal and castle roogna will be prepared to receive you that turned out to be satisfactory to them all and it was decided but first they had to deliver sending to a screen as they had promised oh certainly there is an artifact of that description nearby donkey said i explored this region thoroughly while watching for your return he led them to the place it turned out to be a polished slab of stone with a deep crack at one side grey put the disk in the crack and the stone glowed print appeared deal consummated it said but what is there for you to do way out here in no where ivy asked first i must capture an invisible giant the screen printed then i must practice controlled variants of reality in time i may be able to fashion an empire and challenge my sire for mastery of xanth man from mundania ivy exchanged the remainder of her supply of glances with grey uh how long will this take he inquired perhaps as little as three hundred years de pending on circumstances surely you can do it faster than that grey said en couragingly not so i calculated for optimum conditions it is more likely to fall in the range of ten to the third power to ten to the fourth power years fortu nately i am a patient device that is fortunate ivy agreed i hope my own quest is even more fortunate your quest should be resolved within the month thank you sending she said pleased but then she remembered that this was the time limit compewter had set for grey to wrap up his other business before coming to serve sending must have realized this then as they rode the ghost horses on down the path she asked grey what is ten to the third power a thousand he said thats one of the few things i remember from college math which is almost as bad a course as freshman english you poor thing but you may never have to suffer ei ther of those torments again if we resolve our quest within a month but sending didnt say which way it would be re solved oooops her pleasure converted mystically to uncer tainty they still didnt know how to get around greys obligation to compewter their trip to mundania had confirmed the worst but offered them a chance to nullify it that was all a chance if magician murphy could make something go wrong with compewters plot i hope your fathers curses are as potent as they were nine hundred years ago ivy said i know hell do the very best he can for me grey replied my parentsthey havent always gotten along well together but they were always good to me i never really understood their ways i think until i saw com pewters flashback scene i only knew that despite their man from mundania arguments they had some mysterious and powerful reason to stay together now i know that it was their shared vision of xanth about which they could never speak for me and for xanththey will do anything i know that abso lutely and and youre glad they will be here she finished for him so your family is together im glad he agreed with feeling maybe my par ents were evil before but they arent now make sure you explain that to my parents she said laughing but underneath she remained in deep doubt it was such a slender straw they were grasping at if it failed what would become of them chapter i prophesy rey saw that ivy was pensive and under stood why nothing had been decided and there was no guarantee magician murphys curses had evidently been extremely potent in the distant past but this was now not the past and the magician was almost twenty years out of practice in those intervening years he had been simply major murphy a mundane office worker who earned just enough mundane money to avoid poverty he had been fortunate in finding an employer who was satisfied with a person with a language handicap and fortunate in the way his efforts turned out it was as if there were some rebound from his xanth talent changing the curse to good luck but this had hardly made up for the almost complete blah ness of mundania now grey understood what he had not grasped before that the dreadful drabness of his own life was only a reflection of the much greater drabness of his parents lives they had known xanth so were aware of the magnitude of their loss they had protected him from that awareness but now the full significance of it was clear what would he do if he had to leave xanthand ivy from time to time grey had pondered suicide not with any great passion but as a prospect to relieve the inexo rable boredom of his soso existence he had never actu ally tried it not because of any positive inspiration but man from mundania man from mundania because he couldnt figure out any easy way to do it with out pain so he had muddled on through while his grades ground slowly down feeling guilty for not doing better but somehow unable to change it maybe he had been hoping for some impossible miracle to happen that would rescue him from the mire of his dull life yet knowing deep down that it would never happen then ivy had come his life had changed if he should lose her and return to mundania alone no he did not have to ask what would become of him he knew anything that could go wrong would go wrong that was his fathers talent could it really act in a positive manner helping grey by fouling up the evil machine grey had all too little confidence in that but what else was there to try so he smiled and encouraged ivy and she smiled and encouraged him but neither was fooling the other their happiness hung on an impossibly slender thread and so thats the story ivy concluded magician murphy and vadne will be here in a few days to ask your pardon for their crimes of the past and they will support you as king if you let them stay in xanth and will try to help grey get around compewters plot i cant marry grey until we find that way and if we cant find it within a month she shrugged so you have decided to leave xanth rather than serve pewter king dor asked grey yes i dont want the evil machine to use me to take over xanth if i had no talent of consequence it would be bad because of my influence with princess ivy as it is it is worse because i could do a lot of damage xanth doesnt need another evil magician we always did like you grey queen irene said as we came to know you we liked you better and we like you best now but what you say is true we shall of course welcome your parents and allow them to stay in xanth but the irony is that you may not be able to remain here with them but until that month is done hope remains dor said knowing the devious power of the magician murphy i would say it is a significant hope grey smiled and thanked them but the gloom did not let go of his soul compewter seemed to have it locked up tight what could possibly go wrong with its plot when it was so close to completion the easiest wrongness was simply greys absence from xanth and that was the one that he so dreaded someho some way ivy murmured in the hall and kissed him but her cheer was cracking at the edges nothing happened while they waited for the arrival of the other party grey and ivy picked exotic fruits in the orchard fed tidbits to the moat monsters made the ac quaintance of the guardian zombies peeked at the baby bed monster under greys bed grey was new to magic so had a childlike acceptance of some things despite being eighteen and played innocent games with dolph and nada the castle was excellent for hide and seek because it had many secret recesses that the ghosts were happy to show off when asked according to ivy the castle was not as well stocked with ghosts as it once had been because three of them had been reanimated as living folk but it could still legitimately be called haunted as long as a sin gle ghost remained in short it was almost as dull as mun dania grey disagreed with her xanth could never be dull he said why even if it didnt have magic thereswell look at that picture for they happened to be standing by a portrait in the hall one of a number that were ele gantly framed ivy glanced at it oh yes thats mother when she was my age she was miss apull on the pinup calendar i wish i could look like that at my age you look like you he said thats more than enough it will have to do she said but she was pleased then the party arrived magician murphy looked im proved and vadne much improved both the exercise and man from mundania man from mundania the renewed experience of xanth had been good for them electra was back to her regular form and skipping like a child again she hugged everyone and even stole a naughty kiss from dolph the formalities were brief magician murphy formally apologized for the mischief he had done in the past and promised to support king dor and all his works in the future vadne asked to be allowed to visit millie the ghost at castle zombie so she could apologize to her for the incident of the book dor granted them both pardons now murphy said turning to grey i hereby lay my curse on the geis that is on you my son and wish it evil whatever can go wrong with it will go wrong thank you father grey said trying to project the feeling of confidence what a dismal hope you and me sorceress will be our guests for dinner magician king dor said formally zora will show you to your suite now neither of greys parents spoke but grey knew them they were overwhelmed by the generosity with which they had been met and could not speak vadne who he now realized had resented the fact that she had never been known as a sorceress despite having a formidable talent would be loyal to king dor for life because of that one remark they followed zora zombie out grey lingered wanting to thank the king and queen for their kindness to his parents but ivy caught his arm they know grey mother wasnt a sorceress either un til the elders reconsidered the standards have been mod ified xanth needs all the good magic it can get uh sure he agreed as she hauled him off you see we also understand about good and evil magic ivy continued guiding him upstairs grandpa trent was an evil magician because he tried to take power before his time and he was exiled to mundania but then he returned when they needed a king and he became king and then he wasnt evil any more its all in the attitude and in the situation now that your folks are supporting mine they arent evil either no matter what happened long ago but how would my folks have felt or yours if you and i were not engaged but you see we are betrothed she said blithely so theres no reason for trouble between our folks because if our children have good magic but thats presuming we can marry he protested and we cant marry if i have to serve compewter i dont think you appreciate just how potent your fa thers magic is ive been talking to my father who visited king roognas time when he was twelve and he met your father then and he said that curse was amazing the gob lins and harpies were fighting see andhere ill show you on the tapestry they had reached her room she opened the door and hauled him in and stopped this isnt the way i left it she exclaimed glaring at the tapestry whos been here the door swung closed behind them as it did its hinge made a noise prince dolph it squealed i thought so and what is he now that fly on the ceiling the hinge said ivy grabbed a fly swatter from a drawer change dolph or ill bash you into a smithereen she cried stalking the fly the fly became a bat who headed for the window but ivy got there first change before i mash you into guano the bat became a pale green goat who ran for the door grey stop that greenback buck ivy called null his magic grey put out a hand the moment it touched the bucks hom the animal became prince dolph ah youd never have caught me if that hinge hadnt squealed dolph complained ivy would not be distracted youre not supposed to be in my room when im home what were you doing just watching the tapestry the boy said guiltily and what were you watching that made you sneak in here right now dolph scumed his feet together justthings man from mundania ivys outrage expanded you were watching nada change clothing well she is my betrothee dolph mumbled trying to catch a glimpse of her panties ivy con cluded triumphantly do you know what mother will do to you for that dont tell please dont tell dolph begged ill do anything ill think about it ivy said now get out of here you little sneak before i enhance you into a human be ing dolph was only too glad to make his escape how can you cow him like that when he can turn into a dragon if he wants to grey asked its the natural right of big sisters now just let me reset the tapestry hey isnt that the goblinate of the golden horde grey asked seeing the picture that had been frozen on it i thought dolph was watching nada he had some sympathy for the boys interest nada was one finelooking girl and doubtless her panties were impressive grey had never seen them himself she had lost her clothing during the episode on parnassus thats right obviously dolph scrambled the weave so i wouldnt know it was all he could do in the moment before he changed forms scrambled the weave you knowhe just made a random reset of the pic ture so i couldnt tell where it had been set if hed had more time he would have put it back the way i had left it hes pretty cunning about that sort of thing usually he just didnt expect me back so quickly he probably figured id take time out to kiss you in the hall for a while she glanced at him sidelong correctly only then we were discussing your fathers curse and i decided to show you on the tapestry so we came on in and caught him un awares so this setting is pure chance ill just whats happening if those are the same goblins who she looked at the frozen picture more closely im sure man from mundania they are see theres the mean old chief but this must be years ago because hes not quite so ugly as he was when we crossed him ouch that means theres no chance to help their vic tims for he saw that a partly of three gremlins had been captured the goblins were just in the process of taking whatever possessions the gremlins had little chance ivy agreed i wonder how they caught those gremlins theyre usually way too smart for goblins they caught us he reminded her lets play this through she said just out of idle curiosity then we can go on to magician murphys old time curses the picture moved the figures zipping backwards rap idly like video tape being rewound then it steadied the goblins were out of sight and two gremlins were walking down the path oh i see ivy said grimly the third isnt in their party shes aa a shill a judas goat but why would she lure her own kind into a trap to save her life they watched as the two ap proached the third who was tied to a tree and gesticulat ing obviously a maiden in distress the two hurried up to untie herand the goblins pounced from the bushes nearby they searched the cap tives and just at the point where the tapestry had been randomly frozen they found a scrap of paper on one they were evidently quite exited about it and saved it carefully then they hauled the two off toward the hate spring and the cooking pots the third they hustled into a cave she would be saved for future mischief i hate those goblins grey exclaimed cant any body stop them its sort of live and let live in xanth ivy said but i would certainly like to see them get their comeup pance i wonder what was written on that paper ivy played the tapestry back and caused it to expand man from mundania the paper but the markings on it were incomprehensible maybe grundy could read it she said he speaks all languages so maybe he reads some too of course that paper has probably been burned by now anyway grey said i really didnt mean to get off on a sidetrack why not little things can be interesting ivy went to the door hey dolph she called her little brother appeared immediately anything he repeated worriedly go find grundy and bring him back thats it he asked incredulously no thats just incidental im still pondering qh dolph became the bat and flew away youre going to turn him in grey asked no but ill make him sweat for a while hes very well behaved when hes sweating soon grundy golem and rapunzel were there grundy peered at the expanded image of the paper i cant quite make out what it says it seems to be an address of some kind butoh say say what ivy asked thats humfreys writing the good magicians who else id know his scrawl anywhere but of course i cant read it he enchants messages so that only those whose business it is can read them then thats why the goblins couldnt read it ivy said they knew what it was but it was no good to them but you said its an address probably telling where to find him if they need him the golem said those gremlins must have done him some service so they had an answer on tap too bad they never got to use it ivys eyes lighted an answer she exclaimed dont get excited princess you dont have an answer coming to you and if you did humfreys gone so you couldnt get it anyway but the address she persisted the magic address man from mundania that would change when he moved and always be cur rent of course it would the golem agreed but the folk he gave it to are gone and nobody else can read it so whats the point could read it ivy said if i had the original paper i could enhance its legibility and orientation and find out where the good magician is now the others stared at her realizing that it was true and if you found him you could ask him how to foil pewters plot rapunzel said oh ivy what a coincidence that you should learn of that paper just now coincidence ivy asked musingly no i think its murphys curse this is just the kind of fluke that happens when that curse is operating then grey began to hope this time they appeared to be a party of three a young peasant man a pretty peasant girl and a homely young centaur with a donkeylike hide they were not these things exactly but they played their parts carefully for their mission was important and not without risk had the need to find humfrey and solve greys problem not been so urgent king dor and queen irene would never have permitted this excursion but the parents had had to agree that this was their best chance actually queen irene had quietly approached grey dur ing one of the few times when ivy was otherwise occu pied and hinted that there might be another way to deal with compewter a sphinx might take a stroll and acci dentally step on the evil machines cave squashing it and all inside it flat then there would be nothing for grey to serve but grey had demurred that would be an unethical solution by his definition he could not conspire so di rectly against compewter who had after all made a deal with greys parents and fulfilled his part of it it was greys own responsibility to solve his problem whatever the out come i thought you might feel that way irene said ap provingly there is an ethical dimension to power we man from mundania shall remain clear and allow you to deal with your problem yourself grey had thanked her though his prospect of success seemed bleak the more he learned of ivys folks the better he liked them they walked north from the invisible bridge over the gap chasm this time instead of taking the enchanted path north they veered to the east following a lesser trail that wasnt magically protected but that led to a centaur range in fact chester and cherie centaur had once lived there before moving to castle roogna to tutor the young prince dor and princess irene a few centaurs still lived there though it was a diminishing community that was desperately in need of nubile fillies in a past generation it had been short of centaur colts which had led in part to the defection of chem centaur to another type of as sociation the winged centaur chex was the result the centaurs of this region were a good deal more liberal than those of centaur isle far to the south but not that liberal and neither chex nor her dam were welcome there now so the region continued to decline victim as much of its conservatism as of its bad fortune monsters were en croaching becoming increasingly bold despite the profi ciency of centaur archers peasant gid ivy rode the centaur while peasant boy grey walked beside it was evident that they were going to visit the centaurs home range perhaps to discuss with the centaurs there some type of commission or employ ment few peasants could afford centaur tutors but on occasion some child with excellent magic turned up and then the centaurs could be prevailed on for instruction in the rudiments there were goblins not far from this region but they had not yet been so bold as to attack the centaur com munity even goblins were able to appreciate the effec tiveness of aroused centaurs losses would be prohibitive but the goblins did lurk watching their opportunity there were stories oh gentle peasants a sweet voice called they looked a slender young woman was running to man from mundania ward them her comsilk hair flowing behind she was so slight as to be almost transparent but nicely contoured what is it sylph ivy inquired so this was a sylph grey had not encountered one be fore but of course there were a great many of the crea tures of xanth he had not yet metand might never meet if their quest for the good magicians answer proved un successful oh kind peasants and brave centaur surely you have come to fulfill the prophecy the sylph said prophecy ivy asked my friend the lovely centaur damsel is captive of an ogre who means to fatten her horribly and then crunch her bones the sylph explained according to the prophecy only a bold gray centaur with a young human couple as companions can hope to rescue her from a fate exactly as bad as death surely you are the ones it refers to for you answer the description perfectly that is an interesting prophecy ivy remarked but an ogre is a fearsome creature what could poor peasants do against such a monster oh wonderful folk i know not the sylph cried distraught but there must be some way for the proph ecy says so will you not at least come and see and get our own bones crunched by the ogre ivy asked i think we should take another path now let us not be hasty the gray centaur protested he turned to the sylph you say this filly is fair oh she is lovely sir she was a bit thin but the ogre has been making her eat all she can hold and now she is quite buxom and soon she will be fat and he will crunch her bones i beg you come and see her and perhaps you can free her she would be most grateful but the ogre ivy protested we dont dare ap proach he forages by day leaving her chained i am too frail to break the chain indeed all normal folk are but the prophecy says you will find the way please please come and see while the ogre is away i think we should at least look the gray centaur said man from mundania reasonably one might almost have thought he had some ulterior interest in the matter ivy sighed well the centaurs are in need of young fillies but we must be ready to flee at the first sign of the ogre oh thank you thank you thank you the sylph ex claimed i am ever so relieved right this way she skipped along the path ahead her hair flouncing nicely they followed grey had kept his mouth strictly shut not interfering they had just played out a little charade they had surveyed this matter with the tapestry and dis covered that the goblins had a new ploy they used their captives to beguile travelers into goblin ambushes and then pounced on the hapless travelers and bore them off to the pot the sylph was a captive who had been promised her freedom if she lured three travelers in for capture of course the goblins would renege on that pledge and surely the sylph suspected it but it was at least a hope while the alternative was certain if she did not cooperate she would be dumped in the pot immediately it occurred to grey that it was about time someone did something about those goblins they were not nice neigh bors the sylph led them deeper into the jungle this was no longer the regular trail for there were no centaur hoof prints on it it was one the goblins had scuffed out for this purpose goblins were good a scuffing trails especially for a nefarious purpose they were making sure the prey had no chance to escape the ambush grey permitted himself a grim little smile the goblins had a surprise coming they reached a clearing there was nothing in it except a mound of garbage evidently left by the goblins the sylph turned tears streaked down her face oh i am so sorry good folk she said they made me do it do what ivy asked with simulated confusion they have my child captive my darling sylvanie and she is first into the pot if i do not do all they demand and me too if i fail the sylph continued i know its wrong man from mundania and i hate myself for doing it but my man defied them and they boiled him and oh i have no pride left only i must save my daughter and so i have done this awful thing to you and i do not beg your forgiveness only your un derstanding now grey saw the goblins they were appearing from all around closing the net with what for them was surely delicious slowness savoring the horror in their prey they wanted their victims to suffer on the way to the pot what is your name ivy inquired i am sylvia sylph she replied still weeping my man was sylvester we were just traveling through as you were and they caught us we will all be cooked and eaten i know that but i just have to struggle through as long as i can hoping somehow to save sylvanie though i know i cant now you must suffer you innocent folk and i apol ogize abjectly for what i have done to you but i cannot help myself now the goblins ringed them closely grey recognized the ugly chief grotesk too bad that one hadnt landed in the gap chasm back when they had last met would you help us if we helped you and your child escape ivy asked oh yes yes but it is hopeless they will never let any of us go they are the meanest tribe of these parts they have no mercy they delight in torturing innocent folk do not go into the pool if you can possibly avoid it because enough wench the chief cried harshly leave us to our sport the sylph was instantly quiet ivy turned her face to look directly at grotesk oh goblin what do you mean to do with us she asked as if affrighted well peasant girl i may turn you over to my lusty henchmen for their amorous sport then let you take a nice drink from our nice pool before giving you a nice hot bath in our pot or maybe ill give you the nice drink before you engage my henchmen that could be even more inter esting as for this bedraggled centaur the chiefs eyes man from mundania widened hey i recognize this beast the one who looks like a mule donkey the creature said whatever we had you captive before only you got away andand these are the ones who helped you es cape curses ivy said they have found us out kill them right now the chief cried all of them the sylph slut too dont give them any chance at all the goblins raised their clubs and spears and cocked their stonethrowing arms ivy jumped off the centaur the centaur disappeared in its place was an immense lowslung sixlegged dragon with steam puffing from its nostrils grey jumped forward and grabbed the sylph by her thin arm cover your face he said pulling her into the cen ter of the circle formed by the dragons curving tail the gap dragon the chief cried terrified yes grey said he came to see you dance chief what the dragon pursed his lips and touched the chiefs big feet with a small jet of steam the chief danced with pain ivy poked her head over the dragons neck that was just a sample goblin she said do you know what my friend will do to you if you threaten to hurt one hair of my head she swept off the peasant cap and let her goldengreen hair tumble out youyou really are the princess ivy the chief ex claimed the dragons friend i really am she agreed now you just walk along back toward your camp and all your minions with you and my friend will steam any who stray what are you going to do with us well grotesk ivy said with relish i may turn you over to my lusty friend for his sport then let you drink from your nice pool before giving you a nice steam bath butbut now march frogface she snapped before my friend loses his patience her friend of course was not the real stanley steamer but her little brother dolph man from mundania working off his penance for spying on nadas panties it didnt matter dolph in dragon form could get just as steamed as the real dragon after seeing what the goblins were up to dolph was surely just as outraged as ivy and grey were the goblins marched the party wended its way back to the goblin camp whenever a goblin tried to stray the dragon jetted steam at the seat of his pants and he quickly danced back into place the truth was that the goblins could have scattered and most of them would have gotten away and they would have done just that if any ordinary dragon had manifested but they lived close enough to the gap chasm to be familiar with the dread gap dragon and they were terrified of him their trap had been neatly re versed and they were as helpless to escape it as they had expected their prey to be they reached the hate spring grey knew that ivy re mained angry about the way these goblins had tortured her with it before even though that had brought about the breakthrough of their betrothal he stayed clear letting her handle it her way now she said there is something i want from you goblin and i am going to get it are you going to give it to me the chief laughed take off your dress and ill give it to you har har har ivy signaled the dragon a jet of scalding steam shot out it singed a group of six goblins standing by the pool they screamed and jumped into the water then they began fighting among themselves for the wa ter made them hate the first other creatures they saw the water splashed droplets striking others nearby and they too began fighting in very little time a dozen goblins were unconscious are you going to answer me ivy asked the chief evenly i told you lie down and spread your there was another blast of steam a second group of goblins were singed into the water another fight broke out finishing about ten more goblins man from mundania mem from mundania now we can do this until all your tribe is gone ivy said if that is the way you prefer it i suspect there is a prophecy that you will be the last to enter that pool before we get what we want shall we test it for accuracy the chief looked at the sprawled goblins exactly what is it you want he asked grudgingly i thought youd never ask ivy said brightly where is the piece of paper you stole from the gremlins what paper more steam hissed more goblins were goosed into the water another awful fray occurred oh that paper the chief said after the fracas had died out we burned it long ago this time the dragon steamed a large group of goblins they screamed as their skin was burned they could cool themselves only by plunging into the water by the time this action was done more than half the tribe was uncon scious or worse in my cabin the chief mumbled send a goblin for it go jump in the lake he retorted the steam was running low but ivy touched the dragon enhancing him and the steam became so hot it smoked half the remaining goblins leaped into the pool not even waiting for that jet to catch them yet more fighting broke out princess sylvia sylph said hesitantly i will fetch it if you wish no you fetch your child ivy said sylvias eyes brightened oh yes she hurried off at this point only four goblins remained standing be sides the chief send a goblin ivy repeated grimly the chief grimaced go bucktooth bucktooth broke away from the diminished group and walked to the chiefs hut in a moment he returned with a box open it bucktooth ivy said princess i cant the goblin protested it is spelled against intrusion i thought so open it chief like stewed brains i will more steam hissed two more goblins leaped into the pool they scrambled out and attacked the two remaining goblins the box fell to the ground the melee ended up back in the water soon all four were unconscious will you let me go if i do the chief asked i will treat you with the same compassion you have treated others the chief leaped at herbut the steam caught him in mid air and blasted him back into the pool he splashed about i hate you he screamed stay in the pool ivy said the goblin obviously wanted to rush out and attack her but he saw the snout of the dragon covering him and refrained the longer he remained in the water the worse his hatred grew but there was nothing he could do about it he began frothing at the mouth finally he waded across and out the far side and stumbled into the jungle grey knew that whatever creature the goblin encountered there would be in for trouble maybe it would be a firebreathing dragon but how can you open the box sylvia asked grey walked across and picked up the box he worked the catch and it opened he had nulled the magic that sealed it there was the bit of paper he took it out and handed it to ivy she inspected it yes i can see that this is spelled to be intelligible only to the person who truly needs to see the good magician she said i can null that spell too grey offered no you cant read xanthian she demurred the magic has to remain but we truly need to see him so i am sure it will respond to us she concentrated on it yes its coming clear now he is living somewhere in in she looked up dismayed where grey asked alarmed in the gourd there was a moment of silence then the dragon van ished and dolph stood in his place i can go there he exclaimed man from mundania man from mundania ivy gazed at him sourly but youre grounded remem ber until you decide between nada and electra i only got you sprung today because i promised id keep a big sisterly eye on you all the time sylvia sylph reappeared leading a pretty child by the hand i will go into the spring now only i beg of you spare my daughter ivys head snapped around what my punishment for what i did sylvia said but sylvanie is innocent please let her go ivy got her composure together it had showed signs of unraveling let me explain sylvia you did not deceive us we deceived you we knew about the prophecy trap that you had to approach any travelers with a story about someone like one of them being in trouble so they would follow you into the goblins trap we have been captive of these goblins ourselves we know what they are like but we needed this paper so we used you to lead us in this is my brother prince dolph who assumed the form of the centaur and then the dragon you know he wasnt tempted by any lady centaur oh i dunno dolph said she sounded sorta nice i could have ridden on her back and used her long hair for reins or maybe just reached around her torso to hang on while she galloped shut up ivy knew he was teasing her she refocused on sylvia so we bear no grudge against you we saw how sorry you were to do it now you are free to go you are captive no more the sylph just stood there but what i didi must be punished grey interposed do you have anywhere to go now that your man is dead the sylph shook her head sadly no ivy melted as he had known she would then you and sylvanie will come with us to castle roogna but my child is innocent i beg of you to decide your punishment grey said your daughter must be with you but she will not be punished maybe you could give her your bed grey suggested ivy turned to him my bed sylvanie is a child she needs a young bed monster i thought maybe grabby who otherwise doesnt have long to live ivy agreed yes of coursesylvanie gets my bed the childs eyes went huge my very own bed mon ster she piped the sylph almost dissolved oh thank you thank you ivy looked over the wreckage that was the goblinate of the golden horde i think it will be some time before this outfit causes much more trouble she said with sat isfaction then dolph became a roc they climbed on his gigantic feet clinging to the talons grey and ivy on one foot sylvia and sylvanie on the other the wings spread and napped and they lurched into the air in a moment they were over the gap chasm dolph waggled his wings in a salute to the real gap dragon and flew on very shortly they were gliding down to castle roogna grey and ivy talked privately to king dor and he agreed that he would punish sylvia sylph by requiring her to do service at castle roogna as a maid for an indefinite pe riod during which time her child would be tutored by a centaur the two would share a room at the castle and the child would get ivys old bed zora zombie would instruct the sylph in her duties such as waxing the floor ivy said laughing that will be terrible punishment grey smiled evidently the girls did not like the smell of the wax though it reminded him of home maybe it was its mundanish quality that bothered them then they pondered their approach to good magician humfrey he was in the gourd that explained why nobody had been able to find him because the tapestry could not track him there and the magic mirror was limited they were not able to understand the exact address for the man from mundania regions of the gourd had little revelance to those of waking life the full inscription went like this damescroft silly goose lane little halingberry bishops storkford hurts angleland grey shook his head im not sure ill ever understand these xanth addresses this isnt a xanth address ivy corrected him its a gourd address it makes no sense to me either i can find it i can find it dolph said eagerly the night stallion gave me a free pass to the gourd remem ber any of its creatures will help me if i ask and none will hurt me or anyone i speak for you just want to get out of being grounded ivy ac cused him uhhuh but you need me you need me in the gourd ivy grimaced it was true dolph had a special advan tage in the gourd if they wanted to locate the good ma gician at all let alone within greys time limit for settlement with compewter they had to use ivys little brother so it was decided grey and ivy and dolph would make one more excursion together this time into the devious realm of dreams rather than risk it physically they would enter the normal way by looking into gourds growing right here at castle roogna that way friendly folk could keep an eye on them and bring them back if there seemed to be a need grey felt more positive than he had in a long time his fathers curse was working already it had led to the chance discovery of the address paper and their acquisition of it anything that could go wrong with compewters plot was now going wrong if that curse held they would find the man from mundania good magician and get their answer and that could com plete the disruption of the plot but much xanth magic did not operate the same in the dream realm could murphys curse extend there if not their mission could after all prove in vain man from mundania chapter gourd hey set up piles of pillows in the garden each before a gourd on a vine dolph lay down on the center setting with ivy to his left and grey to his right they linked hands nada turned dolphs gourd so that the peephole came to face him he had to go first to set the scene it was individual to each person and remained at the point that person had last been until he returned and changed it dolph had a standard setting that he had encountered at the time he rescued electra they would join him there if they were in physical contact with him as they entered dolphs eye met the peephole he froze in place intent on what he saw there he would not move until some outsider broke the contact by moving the gourd or putting a hand between the peephole and his eye grey went next ivy knew he could null the magic of the gourd if he chose and probably he could void it at any time while he was inside the dream realm indeed he could have done so during their prior adventure had they but known it maybe the night stallion had guessed at something of the kind because he had sheered away from a confrontation with grey ivy had wondered about that at the time but had forgotten the matter in the press of sub sequent events now it made more sense to her but grey was not using his talent now he wanted to find the good magician as much as she did he froze in place ivy went last her mother turned the gourd for her and she too froze as her eye locked on the peephole but she did not see this her awareness was now within the realm of the gourd it was a huge building a palace or castle with tiled walls and thick supporting columns strange folk hurried in every direction each one intent on his or her own busi ness glancing neither to left or right pausing for nothing she was holding her brothers hand as she had been before entering the gourd she let go once the scene had been set they were all right grey was standing on the other side what is this amazing place she inquired an airport grey said a mundane bad dream dolph said grey smiled much the same thing airports are al ways rushed and the planes are always late even though theyre listed as being on time and the baggage is a giant lottery system so many travelers were beating the odds and keeping their bags by carrying them onto the planes that the government had to change the law making them check their bags and now the losses are back up to par or even beyond it its a bad dream all right this cant be where the good magician is living ivy said ill ask someone dolph said confidently he stepped boldly forward hey you he called at a passing man the man eyed him with mild annoyance and rushed on i thought you were supposed to be able to get help here in the gourd ivy said i am but i havent been here in a long time maybe they dont recognize me he tried again this time hail ing a woman hey miss dont you touch me you sexist she snapped jerk ing away im not a sexist he protested i dont even know what it is man from mundania then youre a juvenile delinquent she said over her shoulder as she zoomed away got you dead to rights ivy murmured this is getting us nowhere grey said mundanes never help strangers you have to get someone in authority i think i see a policeman now ill ask him dolph looked and quailed thats the dread demon in blue he chased us all over the place but grey was already stepping out to intercept the man officermay we get some help the demon bore down on them not only was he garbed in blue he was big and fat and looked ferocious ya disturbina peace he demanded complaints aboutya gonna runyain we are looking for an address officer grey said if you could but the mans beady eye had fixed on dolph hey iknowya youn that barebroad he is prince dolph ivy said indignantly youre supposed to help him prince dolph the man exclaimed whyntya sayso whatcha need you mean youre not going to chase us dolph asked gaining courage stallion sez giveya anythingya want whatchawant we need to find an address ivy said damescroft dames what kinda placeya think thisis the blue man demanded indignantly none a that streetstuffhere damescroft ivy repeated carefully it must be a place the next part is silly goose lane never hearda it the man said with certainty no gooses here ill runin anyone tries it little halingberry ivy asked reading the next line lemme seethat the policeman said he took the paper well nowonder yareadingit backwards yawant angleland but i read it in the order its listed ivy protested listenup sugarplum thiss mundania erproximation thereof readfrom bottomup ivy glanced disbelievingly at grey but he agreed with man from mundania the policeman thats the way mundane addresses are read he said i assumed that it was different in xanth or i would have said something this isnt exactly xanth she reminded him its a bad dream he smiled and a bad dream in xanth is of mundania it certainly makes sense then he turned to the police man if you will just tell us where angleland is officer we shall be happy to go there and get off your beat well itsa longway butfer princedolph wegotta short cut taketha doorthere he pointed with a fat finger thank you officer grey said you have been most helpful they walked toward the indicated door hes almost decent dolph said amazed before he chased us all through this place because of grace said she was in decent but i thought grace is a walking skeleton grey said her bare bones may be frightening but hardly in decent oh when she was clothed with illusion ivy ex claimed so she looked like a bare nymph mundanes think bare nymphs are indecent grey agreed at least when they go out in public it certainly is a strange place ivy agreed they reached the door ivy put her hand on the knob and turned it the door swung open the scene beyond surprised them all it consisted of angles of every description some looked like thin pie slices while others were as square as the corners of cas tles and yet others were broad and dull i dont see why the good magician would want to live here dolph remarked maybe it improves further in grey said this re minds me too much of geometry who ivy asked its a branch of mathematics he explained one of those tortures like freshman english i hope never to face again man from mundania i can see why ivy said indeed this looked like an awful place to live they stepped into angleland some of the angles were stationary while some moved around ivy almost collided with a very pretty little one ooops pardon me the angle begged normally i see very well for i am acute but im afraid i wasnt looking where i was going you certainly are cute ivy agreed can you show us the way to hurts you say my sharp point hurts you oh im so sorry no no ivy said smiling i said that you look very nice youre the cutest angle ive seen here the angle blushed pleased well i am supposed to be you know but i wouldnt want to hurt anyone ivy realized that this angles horizons were limited thank you we shall keep looking they went on the next angle they encountered was relatively dull its point would not cut anything hello ivy said can you tell us where hurts is duh the angle said dolph nudged her from one side and grey from the other its stupid the one said its an obtuse angle the other said the angle heard then duh sure im obtuse im sup posed to be see my point is much wider than that acute gal you were just talking to he said this with evident pride yes i can see that ivy said and the dull angle smiled with satisfaction they went on the next angle was perfectly square do you know where hurts is ivy asked i wouldnt think of admitting to anything like that it replied i am after all a right angle but all we want are directions ivy said i am sure i am quite correct in declining to comment on that sort of thing ivy saw that this angle was hopelessly selfrighteous they went on they came to a wall have we run out of angles grey asked looking about man from mundania what do you think i ama curve the wall inquired certainly not an angle ivy said you look abso lutely straight to me precisely i am a straight angle a hundred and eighty degrees not a degree more not a degree less hes right grey murmured not at all lout the angle retorted the last one you talked to was a right angle i am a straight angle as i just informed you i deviate not an iota from my course do you know where hurts is do you suppose i am the straight man for your crude humor it will never work i shall not deviate hes too straight grey muttered it is impossible to be too straight or too narrow the angle proclaimed they moved on they came to a bend so wide it was bent backwards whats your angle ivy inquired now that is a subject for suitable cogitation it re plied whether it is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous questions or all we want ivy said firmly is to find the way to hurts do you know it as i was saying before you so rudely interrupted me that is a matter for reflexion and i am of course the one to do it being a reflex angle so let us consider what is to be gained or lost by your proceeding to such a painful locale on the one hand im hurting right now dolph said these angles think theyre real sharp but to me theyre pretty dull philistine the angle shot back you know grey said if puns are the way of it here maybe we should go for the big one hurts must be where the most cutting angles are the ones that can hurt you worst dolph agreed they headed back toward the acute angles now dont be thoughtless about this the reflex angle called there remain points to consider most carefully there in the sharpest heart of the most acute angles was a narrow bloodstained gate it had broken glass with man from mundania sharply acute angles along its bars and needlelike spikes along the top they had found the entrance to hurts ivy eyed the spikes she hardly relished squeezing through that you know grey everything here is magic because its the dream realm so you should be able to null it but if you do will it null the dream itself grey finished well does the exercise of other magic talents interfere with it dolph became a goblin not that i know of potbait he said true to the character he portrayed ivy touched the nearest cute angle and enhanced her so that she shone it doesnt seem to she agreed then i should be able to exercise my talent here with out wreaking havoc grey concluded provided i keep it moderate he reached out to touch the gate carefully why this isnt glass at all he exclaimed its illu sion its illusion now dolph said you bet it wasnt a moment ago its a matter of interpretation ivy pointed out since the entire dream world is crafted of illusion illu sions are real here grey just nulled out some of the glass illusions reality im glad dolph said when you get cut here you do bleed maybe not in your real body back in xanth but it hurts the same ivy remembered girard giant and his river of blood she knew it was true they squeezed through the nulled gate the shards of glass bent like leaves harmlessly they were in a horrible region this was evidently the setting for the bad dreams of those who feared pain all around there were suffering people some had loathsome diseases some had awful injuries and some seemed to be enduring unendurable emotional turmoil it was certain that all were hurting a meanlooking man wearing a black mask walked up he carried a whip i dont remember ordering three more actors he said gruffly are you sure you came to the right place man from mundania were just passing through ivy said quickly well theres a really bad dream coming up with a large cast the dungeon master said maybe wed better use you anyway can you scream well i am prince dolph dolph said i oh why didnt you say so you are merely touring of course what do you want to see the fastest way to bishops storkford ivy said the dungeon master scratched his hairy head we are bounded on the far side by a broad river with several good fords but i dont recall that particular one i can show you to the river anyway that will be fine ivy said they followed the dungeon master through the dun geon ivy tried to avert her eyes from the horrors of it lest it give her bad dreams that would later bring her right back here but it was impossible to overlook all of it a groan would attract her attention and she would see some one with a gory knife wound the knife still in it ready to hurt twice as much as it was pulled out a sigh would summon her eye to the other side and there would be an otherwise lovely maiden whose hair had been burned away leaving her bare scalp a mass of blisters ivy knew they were all actors only setting the scene so that the terrible dreams could be fashioned for the night mares to take but it was so realistic that it turned her stomach anyway i dont ever want to dream again dolph whispered i think i saw something like this in a horror movie once grey remarked you were tortured in mundania ivy asked ap palled no i watched it for fun for fun she repeated shocked but i didnt like it he reassured her hastily i certainly hope so how could she marry a man who liked awfulness like this yet she realized that there prob ably were mundanes who were of that type just so long as they never got into xanth they came to the river the water was muddy and the current swift anyone who tried to cross it could be swept man from mundania away and drowned indeed she spied a night mare picking up a justcompleted dream in which a desperate girl was drowning ivy hoped she never suffered that dream her self either the fords are supervised by various creatures the dungeon master explained i think the storks are up stream that way he pointed to the left you may walk along it until you find the one you are looking for keep an eye out for blood flowing into the river it can be slip pery thank you ivy said faintly you have been very kind its not my nature the man confessed but for prince dolph nothing is too good they followed the river upstream doing their best to ignore the activities by its bank but the activities in the river werent much more reassuring grotesque monsters loomed in it snapping their mottled teeth and rogue winds threatened to capsize tiny boats containing helpless women and children one section of the water was on fire and the fire was encircling several swimmers the more desperately they stroked to escape it the faster the flames advanced another area was calm and deep a sign said swimming and children were gleefully diving into the pool but they werent coming up again when ivy peered more closely at the sign she saw that a stray leaf had plas tered itself across a word at the top and she was able to make out the word no what was happening to those disappearing children in another place the sign was clear no pishing naturally several people were dangling their lines in the water what they couldnt see because of the blinding effect of the reflection of sunlight never mind where the sunlight came from in this realm of dreams was a monstrous kraken weed below its tentacles care fully latching onto each line then abruptly it tugged and the fishers tumbled forward into the water and disap peared in the swirl of tentacles ivy hoped she was never bad enough to have such dreams yet she could see that it was far better to experi ence the horror of the dream than the realityand those man from mundania who fished where it was forbidden might indeed get caught by a kraken so if the dream frightened them into safer behavior that was good thus a bad dream could be a good dream she had never realized that before but what was the good magician doing here surely the night stallion had his domain well under control and did not need any help from humfrey if the stallion had needed anything he should have sent a night mare to the good magicians castle in xanth to inquire something about this situation did not make sense was it possible that the address which guided them was false that magician humfrey was not here ivy squelched that thought because if humfrey wasnt here then they had no clue to where he was and they would not be able to get his answer and grey would be subject to the will of compewter that was unacceptable so ivy unaccepted it good magician humfrey was here that was final they came to the region of the fords the first was labeled frankford and was supervised by a mansized sausage with little arms and legs they passed it by farther along was one marked afford where those who wished to use it had to have plenty of mundane coinage to qualify then there was beeford strictly for the bees and ceeford where everyone was looking but not touch ing they passed the complete alphabet of fords finally leaving zeeford behind it was being used by strange striped horses at last they came to the various fords that were strictly for the birds they watched closely as they came to the ibisford and heronford and finally spotted the storkford here was where the storks were crossing carrying their squalling bundles ivy realized that this was part of the route the storks took to reach mundania it must wind down to the big gourd on no name key and from there they carried their babies to waiting mundane mothers grey had said that mundanes had a different way of get ting babies but naturally he was ignorant being a man but we arent storks grey protested they wont let us cross here man from mundania man from mundania we can cross dolph said he became a giant stork ivy smiled she went to where a pile of spare sheets was and took a large sturdy one she knotted the comers together so that it formed a big sling climb in grey she said but he protested when at the storkford do as the storks do you big baby she teased climbing in herself doubledisgruntled he joined her it was like a ham mock lumping them together but they really didnt mind that too much dolph walked out across the ford and no stork challenged him perhaps they assumed he was deliv ering a set of twins to a giant now we have to find little halingberry ivy an nounced looking at the address as they resumed their normal forms and positions at the far bank i dread to think how foolish that will be grey mut tered they were at the edge of a field of assorted berries the storks were following a path that led underground the plants there seemed to put their fruit below what kind is that dolph asked thats a bury plant ivy responded you have to be careful about eating them because of the pits you dont want to fall in grey looked at her as if uncertain whether their be throthal was a good idea but did not comment they passed many varieties of berries some seemed edible like the red and blue berries and some were odd like the londonberry then the heard something calling thats it ivy said confidently the plant haling us sure enough it was the halingberry plant but it was way too large it was the big halingberry they looked around until they found its offspring the little halingberry whose voice was relatively faint beside that was a road marked main lane now for silly goose lane ivy said she led the way down it she was getting the hang of this region there were many offshoots hot lane cold lane plain lane lois lane santa claus lane derby lane and oth ers in boring profusion some of them seemed to have interesting activities at their ends but ivy didnt want to waste time with bypaths then they got to the animal lanes and to the bird lanes after donald duck lane was sober goose lane and then silly goose lane were getting close ivy said relieved she stepped onto the laneand leaped eeeeek she screamed out raged what happened grey asked alarmed he hurried after herand made his own great leap ooooff it was dolph who caught on a silly gooselike boot rear he exclaimed trying to stifle a laugh which threat ened to overwhelm him when you get on it you get now its your turn little brother ivy said grimly sure dolph became a wackylooking goose and stepped forward naturally nothing happened to him since this lane was intended for this species he had outwitted it now we find damescroft ivy said pretending not to be disappointed grey was beginning to understand why she and her brother did not always get along there were houses here soon they reached the ones labeled croft eaglecroft handicroft welkincroft man scroft kidscroft and finally damescroft they had made it there before them stood a pretty cottage with white walls and a thatched roof this is the good magicians castle grey asked nothing like it dolph replied but you know there are always three challenges to get in and you have to surmount them or humfrey wont talk to you hes prob ably just as crotchety about that as hes been for the past century maybe this is illusion ivy said the challenge is to get in when we cant see what were getting into then let me see what i can do grey said he took a step forward and stretched out his hands concentrating the cottage nickered then disappeared in its place was a perfect replica of the good magicians castle as it was in xanth it was of stone with reasonably high turrets and a moat it looked deserted too man from mundania thats more like it ivy said i dont see a moat monster but thats the way it is now anyway we can cross over theoops for now she saw that there was no drawbridge over the moat it wasnt that the bridge had been drawn there was none at all they went to the edge of the moat it may be poi soned dolph said we dont want to risk it grey couldnt null real poison grey agreed also it might not be fair for me to use my power more than once we dont want the magician to be annoyed i can get us across dolph said he became the roc again they climbed onto his feet he spread his wings and flew across landing on the inner ledge ivy didnt say anything but she was ill at ease this was too easy the good magicians challenges were al ways challenging while they seemed to have conquered two of them without effort she was suspicious of that they were on the ledge between the sheer castle wall and the moat they walked along it seeking the entry normally the main gate would be where the drawbridge crossed the moat but they had no bridge to orient on they kept walking until they had completed a circuit around the castle there was no gate at all my turn ivy said i can get us in she concentrated on the impervious wall enhancing its state of perviousness it became less substantial so that water might percolate through it and air it was a shadow of its former self looking solid but becoming illusion she took the hands of her companions we can pass through this she said and led them into the wall and out of it inside the castle then she reversed the enhance ment so that the walls returned to their normal state they were all the way in now ivy heard footsteps a man turned the corner and stood in the lighted hall hugo ivy exiaimed walking toward him ivy he replied you are lovely ivy was unable to return the compliment for hugo was best described as homely you havent changed she said instead then hastily made introductions this is my man from mundania friend hugo the son of humfrey and the gorgon this is my betrothed grey murphy you know dolph of course hugo nodded right this way he said mom has cookies the kind you like punwheel ivy exclaimed as they followed him to the kitchen indeed the smell of freshly baked cookies was drifting down the hall the gorgon was there exactly as ivy remembered her tall stately with snakelets of hair framing her invisible face the good magician had made it invisible so that the sight of it would not stone those who saw it in the dark ivy was sure that face was just as solid and warm as any other the cookies were crisp and hot with just that bit of hardening that close proximity to the gorgons face caused my how youve grown ivy the gorgon exclaimed you were let me think only ten or eleven years old the last time i saw you im seventeen now ivy said proudly she introduced grey and of course the gorgon exclaimed over the be trothal they ate cookies while they compared notes the gor gon was eager for news of xanth and rather missed the old castle there but why are you here ivy asked the three of you just disappeared and we had no idea where you had gone until now the magician is on a quest the gorgon explained the question quest grey exclaimed why yes however did you know ivy explained about their sneak peak at the volumes the muse of history was working on but couldnt he just take care of it right there no this was of a preemptive nature the magician never was very tolerant of interruptions and this was so important that he decided to eliminate interruptions en tirely we have not been disturbed for seven years but there seemed to be more regret than pride in her voice but we have a question ivy said we must have man from mundania man from mundania the answer before we can get married so we tracked you down here and we will go home as soon as we see ma gician humfrey the gorgon shook her head im afraid he wont see you he is so wrapped up in his quest that he allows nothing to interrupt it but we must have that answer ivy protested i would be delighted to have him give it to you but he just wont he will just slide into another level of the dream realm and avoid you without ever taking his eyes from his texts but he left his texts behind ivy said the physical ones he has all of them duplicated per fectly here and all his other magic everything he needs for his questincluding privacy i think i could find him grey said i could null out the levels of magic illusion until no that wouldnt make him give an answer ivy said dispiritedly and that was it they had come all the way here for nothing no wonder the challenges they had faced when entering the castle had been perfunctory the good ma gician wasnt at home to questions anymore grey nulled the magic for them as they held hands and in a moment ivy looked up from her gourd they were back in castle roogna for a moment she was tempted to say they had gotten their answer but that would not be honest and besides if she could have figured out an answer herself they would not have needed to find the magician so their dilemma remained her dilemma really grey had never had any doubt he intended to be out of xanth before compewters deadline expired it was ivy who had to make her decision whether to go with him to drear mundania or remain in xanth without him oh grey she cried in torment i cant do either i love you but i also love xanth i cant endure without both i understand he said i love you and i love xanth and i know you must be together so i will leave you ivy clung to him her tears flowing no without you xanth would be as drear for me as mundania i will go with you though it destroy me but i am afraid it will destroy you he protested that is why i know you must not go then as she clung to him she remembered something she had forgotten your fathers curse it was working it gave us the clue to where the good magician was yes but it failed humfrey would not no she cried maybe it succeeded only we are giving up too soon i dont understand he said looking at her quizzi cally we did all we could no i think we only thought we did all we could she said uncertain whether she was experiencing a significant insight or grasping at a futile straw we thought we failed but we havent yet because we got on the wrong track but maybe we can get back on the right track what do you mean i mean the dream isnt over yet she said not over he asked blankly but we exited from the gourd and think back she said excitedly remember how easy it was to find the good magician there were exactly three challenges and we took turns overcoming them and we were in and there were hugo and the gorgon exactly as i remembered them yes so you said i hadnt met them before so i am seven years older but they arent she contin ued they were unchangedand they shouldnt have been the gorgon should have a gray hair or something and hugo should have been in his mid twenties but he wasnt because he wasnt real he was from my mem oryno more gray i made it all up we never found them at all gray nodded unchangedconforming to your mental images he said when they should have been older so it was a dream not the reality and the dream isnt over she repeated it side man from mundania tracked us made us think it was over but it isnt we can still search for the good magician he nodded working it out i did think that the chal lenges werent as horrendous as reputed so when i ban ished the illusion of damescroft it wasnt the reality we saw but another illusion we only dreamed your power worked she agreed and we only dreamed that you returned us to xanth thats the real challenge to penetrate the illusion that we are accomplishing anything he embraced her im having the illusion of kissing you he said kissing her its an excellent illusion she agreed kissing him back now lets get back to business we still have to find the good magician grey considered as i understand it we arc in the realm of dreams and everything we do here is part of the dream but we do retain our natural powers if i exercise mine persistently doubting everything like descartes who he laughed a mundane he doubted until he could doubt no more and decided that was the truth i only remember him because i missed him on a test but now i think maybe he had something if the good magician is here i should be able to find him by doubting away ev erything else but since everything here is dreams ill have to do it carefully and it may be trickyand maybe it wont work at all but will just put us out of the dream with nothing try it she urged its our only hope grey nodded uh maybe youd better enhance me just in case i need to be very strong and very accurate so i can dismantle the dream layer by layer yes ivy took his hand and began the enhancement chapter answer rey felt the power of ivys magic enhancing him he knew that his ability to null magic was being increased when his talent countered hers she could not enhance others but when hers worked on his he had much greater power than before if anyone could penetrate this network of deceptive dreams he couldnow what a pretty diversion it had been letting them dream that their powers were working when they werent or perhaps they were but not in the way they had supposed he had nulled the illusion of damescroft only to be de ceived by the illusion of the good magicians castle dolph had changed form and carried them across a moat that wasnt really there ivy had enhanced their way through the wrong wall they had all fallen for it being overcon fident and too accepting but ivy had caught on and thereby saved them the ex cruciation of returning to mundania she had won the true challenge by her wit rather than her talent now it was his turnand he suspected that his wit would be tested too for one thing had they really dreamed up those three challenges themselves he doubted it the challenges had been too pat more likely they had been devised by some one else for the trios benefit that meant that the good magician was hereand only ivys desperation had foiled man from mundania man from mundania the deception the one thing that could go wrong with it had gone wrong as he pondered it perhaps better able to come to terms with it because of ivys enhancement he realized that what they had experienced could indeed be taken as three chal lengesbut not of the simple type they had supposed the first could have been for dolph finding the address greys fathers curse could have enabled dolph to handle that challenge the second could have been for ivyand again the carefully set illusion had almost by chance been foiled as if the curse had helped her to understand its nature the third could be his own to ascertain the true state of things that might not be at all what they expected could murphys curse give him the openmindedness to see what he had to see he certainly hoped so there was only a week left in his grace period his decision in the dream ivy had just exposed had been correct if he found no way to void compewters claim he would return to mundania if ivy decided again to go with him but maybe they would not be faced with such an awful choice the good magician was said to have an answer for any question so if he could just locate humfrey all would be well he would be glad to serve for a year just to stay in xanth with ivy service here was better than freedom in drear mundania provided it was in a good cause pewters cause was evil so he had to resist the temptation to go along with it for the sake of being with ivy in xanth he hoped he still had the courage to leave both thats the best i can do ivy said if i enhance you any more you might explode she had said it in jest but then perhaps remembered the glowworm and didnt laugh grey concentrated on the landscape of xanth he saw before them he knew now that this seeming reality was illusion the stuff of the dream they needed to return to reality which was the appearance of the dream the landscape fuzzed then faded out they were back before the good magicians castle with dolph beside them hey what happened dolph asked i thought you two were on your way out of xanth it was part of the dream ivy explained we woke up from it in a manner but were still doing it she said watch grey concentrated on the castle he didnt want to null too much slowly it fuzzed and then it faded out leaving the cottage of damescroft as they had first seen it now were back where we started ivy said but if its not the castle and not the cottage what is it grey focused his doubt the cottage frayed and came apart in its placewas the castle he exchanged a third of a glance with ivy then he focused again the castle fuzzed out and the cottage returned well its got to be one or the other dolph said grey pondered and then he considered and then he cogitated and finally he settled down and thought maybe its neither he said but i think we all need to blank our minds until we expect nothing at all then whatever remains will be the truth i cant blank my mind dolph protested im al ways thinking about something what were you watching on the tapestry ivy asked wamingly the cottage fuzzed the image of something silken be gan to form such as a giant pair of panties my mind is completely blank dolph cried guiltily the image fuzzed back into a formless pile of cloth which then faded out the cottage reappeared blank grey said blank ivy agreed blankety blank dolph said grey focused his doubt again he doubted that either cottage or castle was there but he had no idea what might man from mundania really be there he kept his doubt as pure as he could expecting nothing the cottage was fuzzed out the castle tried to fuzz in dolph forestalled it with more doubt refusing to be tricked by the present illusion an amorphous cloud developed hovering uncertainly unable to become one form or the other grey continued doubting refusing to let it coalesce he kept his expecta tions blank only reality would be allowed to manifest gradually the cloud thinned revealingnothing oops ivy said grey looked at her but there should be something were out of the dream she explained you nulled it right down to nothing reality he exclaimed in disgust and realized that that was what he had expected dolph stepped forward whats that they looked there was a box sitting on the ground they walked toward the box the landscape seemed completely barren there were no trees or bushes and no sunshine or cloud it seemed to be a wasteland except for the box there turned out to be three boxes in a row each dark and oblong and large enough to hold a man oh no ivy breathed horrified coffins ttiere had been three in the good magicians family humfrey the gorgon and their son hugo the dream address dolph said sharing her horror it was the way to find thembut it didnt say they were alive could the good magician have seen his death coming and acted to hide himself from xanth so that no one would know but what was the point of that to let others think he would one day return ivy said her thoughts pacing his so that xanth wouldnt mourn for himor give its enemies courage enemies like compewter grey said seeing it but now we have undone his artifice so that xanth can no longer be protected even by the threat of humfreys re turn man from mundania compewter must have known ivy said thats why he acted now but grey wasnt quite satisfied with that why didnt compewter simply tell us humfrey was dead then so that there was no chance to get an answer ivy shrugged maybe pewter wasnt quite sure and maybe its not true grey said maybe were not out of this quest yet but if they are in coffins electra was in a coffin wasnt she grey strode to the nearest box now he saw an inscription on a plaque set in it but the words were indecipherable what does this say ivy approached she almost smiled do not disturb she read its in xanthian script this must be mun dania so you cant read it or something like that grey agreed electra was in a similar state i believe they checked the other coffins neither had a plaque maybe they dont mind being disturbed dolph offered probably so ivy said it was always the good ma gician who was grumpy about folk taking up his time then im going to open this one ivy was shocked but you cant do that its not nice to disturb the dead if he is dead grey said grimly i doubt it he put his hand to the lid of the coffin there was no fastening he lifted and it came up a wizened little man lay within looking just as if he were sleeping hey magician humfrey grey said boldly the eyelids flickered then the eyes opened the lips parted go away they said i am grey murphy and i need an answer grey said go away i am no longer giving answers here is my question how can i void the service i owe to compewter go away the mouth said grimacing ill give your answer when im done here man from mundania how long will that be the mouth formed a fifth of a smile is that another question no if you want an answer serve me until i return then you may have it if you still want it now go awayand dont slam the lid the eyes closed there is an answer ivy breathed but what good is it if he returns after a year or more and i have to leave xanth in a week grey demanded the good magicians near eye squinched open again no way mundane you must serve until i return with out interruption or i will not be responsible for the con sequence but i must serve compewter thats my problem after you complete your service to me the good magician said firmly otherwise you forfeit your an swer the eye closed again but how can i serve you if youre asleep grey asked hardly making sense of this go to my castle you will find a way the features fell into composure the good magician was back in his dream grey lowered the lid depressed apparently there was an answer to his problem but unless the good magician returned to his castle before the week was outwhich seemed unlikelygrey would have to go home to muh dania without it since humfrey had made it plain that there was no time limit on the service he would owe for the answer grey would have to forfeit long before com pleting the service the good magician always has a good reason for his crazy answers ivy said trying to put a positive face on it when the gorgon came to ask whether he would marry her he made her serve as a castle maid for a year before giving his answer but thats the very height of arrogance grey said so it seemed but it gave her that time to work with him so that she could change her mind on the basis of good information when she didnt change her mind he man from mundania married her by that time she was familiar with every as pect of the castle and his practice so had no problem it was really a very good way to do it as everyone else would have understood had they been as smart as hum frey well im not smart enough to see how having to leave xanth before i get his answer is going to do us any good neither am i she said but it must be so he let the subject drop because he didnt want to argue with her but his depression was back in full force to think that there was a solution to his problem but that he could not have it because of the insensitivity of the one who had itthat was even worse than there being no so lution they returned to xanth they couldnt just walk there because they didnt know the way through this featureless region so grey eased up on his doubt and the cottage returned then they retraced their route through the ad dress until they were back in the airport then grey resumed his doubting and fell out of the dream he lifted his head from the gourd cut the connec tion he said willing hands turned the gourds and ivy and dolph woke this time it was real immediately they were besieged by demands for the whole story but only dolph was interested in telling it you should have seen the guts and gore in the hurts he exclaimed next day they went to the good magicians castle dolph became a roc and carried them there and dropped them off promising to return in time to take them to the border of xanth before compewters grace period was up in fact he promised to return every day acting as courier for anything they needed that was certainly better than re maining grounded at castle roogna the two walking skeletons marrow bones and grace ossian came along also nominally to help clean up the castle but really as chaperones the king and queen did not want to make a show of it but they did not encourage the appearance of unseemly behavior in their daughter man from mundania man from mundania grey could hardly blame them at any time ivy could change her mind and remain in xanth effectively breaking off their betrothal there was a different flavor to that word and he liked it better than engagement and returning to the open market why should they risk having her prin cessly reputation tarnished in this short time break the betrothalhe hated to admit it but it did seem to him that this was her most sensible course she was a creature of xanth and could no more be happy for long outside it than as she put it a mermaid could live on land far from water there were magic devices that could make her forget him so that at least one of them could be happy when he returned to mundania he was not going to let her go with him what would become of him then without either betrothed or parents he did not want to think about but he knew it had to be he i fused to be the agent of xanths degradation no matter what it cost him personally the castle was bleak and bare the skeletons didnt mind they were pretty bare themselves they set about cleaning it out and fixing separate chambers for the two living folk soon nice soft beds were made though the skeletons really didnt see what was wrong with good old fashioned cold stone similarly they renovated the kitchen knowing that living folk had a hangup about eating reg ularly but once we get it cleaned up what else is there to do grey asked as they sorted through tumbled old vials and set them neatly on the shelves and whats the point fixing up a castle for someone who isnt coming back to it for they both knew that the good magician had no intention of returning soonif ever this service was a charade ivy shook her head she didnt know either but at least they were together for this brief time they were hard at work sorting dusty tomes when there was a disturbance outside marrow hurried in rattling grey and ivy looked up in alarm knowing it took a lot to rattle the skeleton a giant firebreathing slug is charging the castle marrow reported they went to a parapet and looked sure enough the monster was steaming through the moat causing the water to boil where the fire touched it was of course a slow charge for slugs were not rapid travelers but powerful wed better flee ivy said we cant stop something like that but surely part of my service is to protect the castle grey said i mean even if i have to leave in a few days i might as well do the best i can while im here but you cant even get close to that thing without get ting burned ivy protested it does seem uncertain of success marrow said but marrow can get close grey said maybe the slug is just lost marrow would you be willing to ap proach it and ask what it wants can you speak its lan guage only if it is from the gourd marrow said if only grundy golem were here ivy said he can speak any living language if we just had some alternate way to then she brightened maybe we do we do remember the sign language let me see if that works she had brought the book to the castle in case she had to return to mundania where she would be de pendent on this type of communication grey had not yet been able to bring himself to tell her of his decision that she had to remain in xanth now the slug was emerging from the moat and starting up the outer wall it was moving at a snails pace but making definite progress ivy leaned over the parapet hey sluggo she called waving her hands can you understand this she made the sign for hello a gesture resembling the throwing of a kiss with both hands grey was glad he understood it because otherwise he might have misunderstood it the slug paused looking up at her could it even see grey wondered it had no eyes just antennae man from mundania then the antennae moved one extended while the other retracted in a moment they reversed motion its answering ivy exclaimed it knows sign lan guage ask it what it wants grey said heartened what ivy said making the sign by drawing her right index finger down across her flat left palm want she held her two hands as if clutching something and drew them in to her the slugs antennae lined up then moved forward tcfe gether with marvelous slowmotion dexterity answer ivy translated she had picked up a mar velous facility for this type of communication in a short time grey realized that she must have enhanced her own learning ability for it except that she had been in mun dania at the time so her talent shouldnt have been oper ative he would have to ask her about that she faced grey it wants an answer but i dont know an answer grey exclaimed it thinks the good magician is back ivy grimaced ill try to explain she made the sign for conversationthe tip of one index finger moving to ward the lips while the other moved from them then re versing the motions the slug remained stuck to the wall responding with its antennae after a fair dialogue ivy turned to grey im not getting through i dont know all the terms and it isnt awfully bright as near as i can tell it wants to attend a slugfest maybe that doesnt mean the same as it does in mun dania grey said im not sure what it means she said but wed better tell the slug something so that it will go away otherwise its apt to slime the castle and its breath will set fire to the curtains grey pondered all right tell it to make up a bunch of notices in slugspeak and post them on trees and rocks and things where big slugs go the notices will say slug pest and give the time and place then any interested man from mundania slugs will go there at the proper time but tell it to allow a year or two because slugs dont travel very fast ill try ivy got busy with her signals after a time the slug satisfied turned around and slid slowly back through the steaming moat and away from the castle they returned to their tome sorting but soon there was another interruption a goblin is knocking at the door marrow reported you mean pounding grey asked remembering the nature of goblins no this is a constrained polite knocking it must be a trick ivy said let him in then pull up the drawbridge so his henchmen cant charge after he has opened the way in due course they met the goblin in one of the cleaned up chambers who are you and what do you want grey inquired gruffly i am very sorry to disturb you good magician but when i saw that you had returned wait grey said embarrassed im not the good magician im grey just doing a service for him in addition there was something odd about the goblin i beg your pardon grey the goblin said i am goody goblin if i may have an appointment i shall re turn at a more convenient time grey realized what was bothering him about this goblin he was being polite its not that the good magician isnt here right now and im not sure when i am certainly willing to accept an answer from an assistant goody said i realize that the good magician has far more pressing concerns than the problem of a mere goblin grey was beginning to feel like a heel uh just what is your problem goody i seem to be unpopular with my kindred since natu rally i would like to assume a posture of leadership and to win the favor of a pretty gobliness i wish to be advised of appropriate corrective action well id certainly like to help you but then grey had a bright notion i think you need to have a fouler man from mundania man from mundania mouth most goblins ive met are obnoxious and violent if oh i couldnt be violent goody protested that would be unsocial well maybe you wouldnt have to actually be violent if only you sounded violent you could bluff your way through what you need is a really foul vocabulary i would be glad to have it goody agreed may i purchase it from you grey glanced helplessly at ivy no i think you have to learn it she said but i think i know where you can that would be excellent just a moment she went to marrow and whispered the skeleton departed but returned in a moment with something ivy set it on a chair sit down she told goody why thank you the goblin said taking the chair because he was shortlegged he had to jump up and land on it but the moment he landed he sailed off again ј he exclaimed causing the white curtains to blush pink something flew from him and struck the wall so hard it was embedded grey caught on she had put a curse burr on the chair so you do know the terms ivy said evidently sup pressing her own delicate blush for it had been quite a word the goblin had fired forth you just need to be encouraged to use it go to the biggest wildest curse burr patch you can find and sit down in the middle of it grey said i guarantee that by the time you find your way out you will have the required vocabulary just make sure you remem ber the expressions that get you free they can only be used once against the curse burrs but are infinitely reus able against goblins oh thank you kind sir and lovely maiden goody said and what is your fee for this wonderful answer no fee grey said quickly were just here for a few days good luck the goblin stood up to his full lowly height no i am afraid i must insist you are doing me a service and i must do you one in recompense that is only fair fairnessin a goblin now grey had seen everything well er if you feel that way maybe you should uh stay here a while and when something comes up er excellent i am sure there will be something grace appeared show our guest to a suitable cham ber ivy said heartened goody goblin departed with the skeleton grey was sure he would make good among the goblins after undertaking the corrective course they returned to their tomesonly to be interrupted again this time it was a flying fan an instrument made of bamboo that propelled itself by waving back and forth so as to generate a jet of air ivy was able to communicate with it by sign language though some of this resembled a fan dance the fan turned out to be lost and was looking for fandom now grey had just a bit of mundane experience that related form a fan club he exclaimed then you will be in the middle of fandom satisfied the fan flew off to find a suitable length of wood to make a club they were about to return to the tomes when yet an other supplicant arrived this is getting out of hand grey muttered well never get anything done if this continues maybe we should haul up the drawbridge again ivy said i realize that seems unfriendly but with all these folk coming in well have no rest or privacy at all if we dont limit access im beginning to understand why the good magician was reputed to be reclusive and taciturn grey said if this is what his life was like before he set limits you see to the one thats inside and ill see to getting the defenses set up ivy said with a smile just dont do too much for her she departed when grey saw the visitor he understood ivys caution she was a lovely young human girl oh magician please man from mundania man from mundania i beg of you im desperate ill do anything she ex claimed please im only uh filling in and i may not be able to help you he said what im in love she exclaimed grandly but he doesnt know i exist please grey ascertained that it was a young man of her village she was interested in who saw her only as a friend she did not want to make a scene she only wanted him to return her love she was sure things would be fine then it seemed to grey that she was correct she was a good and lovely girl who would be good for a handsome lout like that just as ivy was good for grey himself grace he said and the skeleton appeared is there a vial of love potion in the collection you have been sort ing several grace agreed bring one here the skeletons were not always quick on the uptake perhaps because their skulls were hollow she brought one grey presented it to the maiden slip this in his drink make sure you are the first person he sees after he drinks you understand a mistake could be very awkward oh yes she exclaimed oh thank you magi cian she flung her arms around him and planted a kiss on his nose but what about my service no service this time he said but he realized that this aspect also of the good magicians practice made sense folk were too eager to get something for nothing and were already flocking to the castle if it was this bad on the first day how much worse would it be on the fol lowing days but in the future probably some service will be required so that when she spread the word it would discourage the freeloaders oh when she evidently thought he meant that she would have to return to do the service he realized that it would hardly be expedient to call her back she would have to do it before she left uh within the next few days grace will show you to a chamber for the night thats fine she agreed and departed with the skel eton they finished the day their tome sorting incomplete and retired to their separate chambers after an excellent evening meal grace prepared grey lay awake for some time thinking about things now he appreciated why good magician humfrey might not be eager to return here in any hurry what were his prospects an endless line of supplicants each requiring attention and research while his own work of whatever nature went undone grey and ivy had been here only a day and already the word had spread the good magician had been here a century or so yet he had to admit that he rather liked helping people and creatures he was learning things too he had thought that all goblins were like those of the golden horde now he knew better he had thought that monsters were for fighting or fleeing but the giant slug had only wanted advice each case had to be judged on its merits and none were truly unworthy it seemed a shame to shut them all out when they really did need help but of course he could not help them in a few days he would be gone even assuming he had competence for this he was a magician but his talent hardly applied to this sort of thing well if some creatures suffered from a dev astating hex or geis as they called it that was of magical origin he could probably nullify it if there was illusion he could nullify that too cutting through to the truth other cases could be handled by ordinary common sense or a little imagination others were amenable to the artifacts of the castle like the love potion so there actually was a lot that he and ivy could do certainly it was the kind of thing hed rather be doing than leaving xanth but he did have to leave xanth because soon com pewters grace period would be over and he would have to serve the evil machine if he were not gone from xanth compewter hardly cared about the welfare of individual folk the machine would set about taking over xanth and grey was aware that though his magic talent might not readily be turned to doing good it could certainly be man from mundania turned to doing evil by nulling the magic of anyone who opposed compewter he could not allow that to happen how he wished it were otherwise that his fathers curse had been effective almost it seemed it had been it had enabled them to locate magician humfrey and talk with him but the magician had refused to help in time sup pose grey stayed in xanth and the machine used him to destroy much of what was good and decent in it and then years later magician humfrey returned what kind of xanth would greet him no grey had to leave xanth there was no other way unhappily he slept in the morning there was a new person approaching the castle it was a female figure naked and wildhaired a nymph then grey recognized her mae maenad he exclaimed what could she want ivy demanded we left her well set up as the oracle on parnassus something must have gone wrong grey said i have a feeling that plain common sense wont fix it ivy glanced at him obliquely she was the first to call you magician and you did kiss her do you suppose grey laughed what attractive young woman would have any interest in a nothing like me ivys look transformed slowly from oblique glance to direct stare grey realized that he was in trouble uh he said with his usual social finesse ill settle with you later she muttered significantly right now wed better find out a way to slow her down until we can figure out exactly what she wants before she meets you a bright notion forged its way into greys mind the good magician had challenges didnt he that didnt ac tually stop the people who came but but slowed them down she agreed until he could do some research in his book of answers and she broke off and we dont uh have that book he finished we uh certainly dont she said mimicking him man from mundania with a brief smile we also dont have suitable chal lenges the layout of this castle was different each time someone approached it he must have had a lot of work done between visits but its solid stone you cant just move that around the whole thing would tumble down ivy pondered he must have had an easier way he had the centaurs rebuild this castle long ago now it oc curs to me to wonder why rebuild it when it was already standing and only needed refurbishing those centaurs re ally worked i saw them on the tapestry they seemed to have about ten different designs and they worked on them all but somehow it became only one castle like the dream castle and cottage maybe he said switching readily from one to the other according to the need to fool intruders according to the need she echoed grey i think youve got it i do there must be a command or something to change the castle to make it different something he could invoke grey nodded it was making sense wed better invoke it soon mae is almost here ill try ivy took a breath castlechange form they waited but nothing happened ivy tried other commands but nothing worked uh maybe since its my service were doing grey said i mean its my problem having to serve com pewter so im the one who owes the good magician the service the castlewell it sorta has to cooperate if it sorta does ivy agreed mimicking him again well give it a command grey turned to face the main portion of the castle in the name of good magician humfrey change form he intoned there was a rumble the castle shook walls slid around in a moment the platform they were on heaved and the stones of the wall rose up high grey discovered ivy in his arms they were no longer on a parapet but in a cupola whose arched windows over man from mundania man from mundania looked the moat they could see the slanting roofs of the castle different from before the entire layout of the cas tle had changed it obeyed me grey exclaimed amazed you didnt believe your own reasoning ivy inquired archly that it had to cooperate if you were to perform the service for the good magician i guess my faith wasnt strong he agreed then he looked down again but we still have to deal with mae well the drawbridge is up so that may slow her ivy said the maenads can swim they love to bathe in their wine spring except for he brightened thats it thats what she doesnt like blood is there a vial of imitation blood in the collection i mean something that would gotcha magician ivy said grace the lady skeleton appeared something funny has happenedshe began all under control ivy said smoothly is there a vial of blood in the chamber certainly concentrated blood extract that should do pour it into the moat the skeleton not having much brain didnt argue she went off to find the vial they watched from the cupola in due course a bony hand extended from a lower window something dribbled into the moat abruptly the moat turned deep red it looked as if the river of blood from girard had been diverted and now coursed around the castle there was even a wisp of vapor rising from it as if it were hot the good magicians vials remained potent mae came to the brink and stared into the moat evi dently appalled she had left the maenads because she had no taste for fresh blood what would she do now well if her concern was less than critical this would cause her to turn around and go back to mount parnassus saving them trouble the woman put her hands to her face in a gesture of grief suddenly grey felt like a mundane heel she was weeping the color of the moat faded in the vicinity of the wild woman the water turned clear the clearness spreading slowly outward what was happening her tears are washing out the blood ivy said i didnt know maenads could cry maybe true ones cant grey said i think she is surmounting the first challenge and we still dont know what her problem is or how to fix it she exclaimed grey nodded were here for only a few days but i want to do the best i can while i am here maybe its a test and if i do a good job the good magician will return at the last moment and give me my answer it was a wild hope that just might be she agreed this is certainly turning out to be more than just a castle cleaning there was a shadow in the sky theres another one already he said his heart sinking a roc neither moat nor walls will slow that down no its my brother silly ivy said well tell him to fetch us the book of answers so you can answer mae and send her back immediately it was evident that ivy remained uneager to have the shapely wild woman remain close to grey for any longer than was strictly necessary he liked that you tell dolph he decided ill figure out the next challenge i think we can use goody goblin after all see that you do ivy said darkly and hurried off in the direction of a roof terrace grey went in search of the goblin whose chamber might not be where it had been all the labyrinthine passages of the castle were different but there were not a great num ber and soon he did find the goblin do you know magician i must have been unobser vant yesterday goody remarked i could have sworn the passage was of another nature it was grey explained shortly we changed the man from mundania layout now i would like you to do me one service before you go gladly magician there is a wild woman coming into the castle you must go down and try to scare her off dont hurt her just frighten her a wild woman but they dont affright readily and i am hardly the type to the goblin paused realizing something i believe i saw a mirror chamber downstairs in that i could assume the aspect of twenty goblins if i made faces and moved around i might put on a good show but if she catches on then she wins the challenge and your service is done grey said you will then be able to go your way with a clear conscience excellent i shall intercept her as she passes through that chamber goody hurried down the hall but he still needed a third challenge what would really faze a wild woman grey snapped his fingers he searched out the maiden maiden there is a service you may be able to perform to acquit your debt to me what would that be magician she asked just a trifle warily there is a wild woman coming into the castle soon i want you to intercept her after she passes the goblin and give her a manicure and hair styling and female outfit tinga frilly dress slippers and uh he faltered panties she prompted uh yes that sort of thing oh yes i am excellent at that sort of thing she agreed but a wild woman you will stand athwart a locked door which bars her passage to me she must suffer the treatment or be forever barred if she departs without the treatment your debt is paid if she agrees to it you willhow long would it take to do it right hours perfect when it is done knock on the door and i will open it and you may go home man from mundania and if that didnt stop the wild woman nothing would he thought as he went looking for ivy but by that time he should have the book of answers and be able to handle her question he really appreciated humfreys system now mae encountered the goblin in the mirror chamber she screamed not in fear but in outrage it seemed that mae nads didnt like goblins she chased the first figure she saw and smacked into the mirror after several such smacks she began to catch on to the nature of the chal lenge she noted her own reflections in the mirrors and avoided these finally she found a panel in which there was neither a goblin nor wild woman and leaped through it for that was the exit she had won the second challenge and it had only taken her an hour to do it meanwhile dolph had taken off for castle roogna as a roc he could cover the distance rapidlybut once there he would have to convince king dor to give him the vol ume which was kept locked up for safety until the good magicians return ivy would have sent a note but even so it could take hours would the book arrive in time the maiden intercepted the maenad there was another screech of outrage almost the wild woman turned back but the same flaw of character that caused her to avoid blood made her decide to submit to this transcendent in dignity the maiden started to beautify and civilize her appearance two hours passed grey knew that the beautification could not last much longer where was dolph then the roc showed on the horizon the big bird was carrying a book it turned out to be a monstrous volume grey clutched it in his arms and set it on a table evidently sized for it he opened itand was bewildered by such a maze of en tries that he could not make any sense of them it would take him an hour just to find his place the door opened a stunning mundane woman entered grey blinked this had to be the maenadbut what a change grace must have found a cache of supplies for this job she was in a lovely pink dress with bows and man from mundania man from mundania wore pink slippers with flowers on top and her hair was bound in another bow with another flower her finger and toenails were delicately tinted and so were her lips her legs were so smooth that they were surely exhibited in hose and there was a definite suggestion of panty out of sight she looked as if she were going to a debutante party she had come for her answer surmounting all the chal lengesand he was unable to use the book of answers now what was he to do her petite mouth opened the question incipient youre beautiful he said partly to stave off her question and partly because it was true you have humiliated me she cried you have made me cry and chase a goblin andwhat youre beautiful he repeated if you wish i will null out all that magic as you stand before a mirror and you will see that your beauty owes nothing to enchantment or nymphly arts any time you wish to retire from the oracle im sure you could readily nab a village lout she considered maybe i will it has occurred to me since meeting you thatthere may after all be uses for men other than as food but right now i have a question he had hoped he had diverted her now he was in for it ask i am running out of gibberish to spout when i sit over the cleft the priest says i cant be a priestess unless i have plenty of vilesounding gibberish how can i get it his worst fear had come true here was a question he couldnt answer how could a person find gibberish to spout when it no longer came naturally then he remembered how goody goblins nice lan guage had deteriorated when he had sat on a curse burr suppose mae did the same thing he looked at her form and knew he couldnt recom mend that remedy it would be a defilement of beauty but another memory came to him of his father in past years laboring over a mundane torture known as income tax much of the problem had been the maddeningly in comprehensible tax manual grace he said the lady skeleton appeared fetch the volume labeled revised simplified tax man ual soon grace was back with the volume one of the pile of dusty tomes grey and ivy had sorted through he had thought that particular one useless but had been too busy to throw it out yet he opened the tome now i want you to look at this and try your best to make sense of it a book mae asked frowning skeptically she looked at the page it shouldnt be hard to blip toggle subtract twentyeight percent of line from the total of lines and whichever is less coherent and zap frag gle form under line a unless outgo is more than indicated in supplementary brochure q in which case fromp beezle she looked up this is sheer gibber ish precisely grey said this is the volume of gibber ish no one has made sense of it in centuries take it with you and you will never run out of inspiration oh thank you magician she exclaimed clutching the tome to her bosom and what service grey started to say that she needed to perform no ser vice then realized that he just might need a wild woman to challenge some other visitor the good magicians pol icy of requiring a term of service was not merely to dis courage applicants but to make the system feasible it all fitted togethernow that he had spent a day as it were in the good magicians shoes remain for a while he said gruffly the skeleton will show you to a room i shall notify you of your service in due course then seemingly abruptly his time was up they had spent most of a week putting humfreys castle in order and in handling the constant pleas for answers the good magician had not returned and now it was evident that he was not going to their wild hope had proved vain dolph was ready to change form and carry grey and ivy away marrow and grace had agreed to supervise the shutting down of the castle with the help of those who man from mundania owed service the brief restoration of answers was about to end ivys determination to come with him remained firm she bid a tearful farewell to the castle and the creatures of it and would do the same as they stopped by castle roogna on the way to the isthmus forced to choose be tween him and her homeland she had done him the im mense kindness of choosing him and he would always remember and treasure that no matter how dreary his life in mundania became with her it would have been bear able without her it would be unbearable but he had to do what he had to do he would fly with her back to castle roogna then say what he had to say in the presence of her family he knew that king dor and queen irene would understand and would support his position ivy might hate him for a time but she did have magic alternatives its time he said through the lump in his throat i wish i could stay here forever hectic as it may be i really like feeling useful but i cant that was only the half of it this coming flight would be his last with her and with her love ivy was blinking back her tears she took his hand proffering silent comfort how little she knew dolph changed form he became the roc precariously perched on the roof one of his huge claws happened to slip on a dead leaf on a tile he lost his balance and had to spread his wings to recover the tip of one wing clipped a turretand a flying feather was broken dolph changed back he jammed a crushed finger into his mouth i cantmmphfly with thatmmphbroken feather he said around it you poor thing ivy said with instant sympathy ill bandage it but how will we get to the isthmus in time grey asked he knew that no other mode of transport would be fast enough they had depended on dolph and had stayed just as late as they could risk it he felt guilty for that knowing he was playing it too close but savoring his last moments in xanth and with ivy man from mundania look in the book of answers ivy said over her shoulder as she took her brother off for bandaging he shrugged and decided to do just that he went to the book and opened it maybe there was a magic way to fix a feather instantly he had begun to get a glimmer of the way the book was organized it was alphabetical but so detailed with so many subentries and crossreferences that it was easy to get lost on the way he looked for feather and discovered such an enormous listing of types and classes and qualities of feathers that he decided it would be faster to look up roc instead he flipped over the pages and naturally turned too many finding himself in the ss he started to flip the pages back and his eye happened to light on the entry immediately by his left thumb service curious he read it this too had many subtypes and qualifications one he saw at the bot tom of the page was good magicians grey paused his hand still about to turn the page he read that portion that by ancient custom and prac tice having the force of law service to the good magician such as in payment for answers takes precedence over all other services of any type regardless of their dates of inception notwithstanding commitments that may have been made or inferred or otherwise designated for the reason that this was almost as obscure as the tax manual it must have taken the good magician most of his century or so of life to decipher this opacity it would have been fasci nating to unravel the actual meaning of such entries maybe sitting by a warm fireplace with ivy in the evenings grey had to thumb tears out of his eyes the truth was that despite all its confusion and frustration this scant week in the good magicians castle had been wonderful he had somehow stumbled through and managed to do some favors for the good folk and creatures of xanth and each case had been a separate item of education opening his eyes to another intriguing aspect of the magic realm but mainly he had felt so very useful it had seemed as if what he did mattered to others never before he met ivy had he had that feeling and never before this castle had man from mundania he had it in relation to strangers he had felt however foolishly important for these few days he hated to give that up just about as much as he hated to leave xanth it wasnt just for him it was for those he had helped and might have helped in times to come had it been possible to stay takes precedence over all other services grey stopped still could that be true could it apply even to the service he owed to compewter he reread the passage carefully making sure he un derstood each part of it it did seem to be true and that just might mean oh here you are ivy said did you find a way for us to make it in time i found something else by pure coincidence grey replied excited iwe may not have to go not have to go but in another day compewter is this book the ultimate authority he asked i mean is there anything else that overrules its answers no nothing of course the good magician was always the ultimate authority on anything he was the magician of information after all so his book of answerswhy do you ask this says that service to the good magician takes pre cedence over any other service no matter when that other service was undertaken by the custom and law of xanth which seems to mean that until i complete my service to humfrey i cant serve compewter if thats true but he said he might never return she protested youd be stuck with serving him all your life and maybe never even get an answer no he said understanding dawning like sunrise on the millennium ive already had my answer i just didnt understand it before now i must serve if need be for the rest of my liferight here doing this and do you know its no bad thing she finished her confusion bright ening into awe no bad thing at all he agreed man from mundania then they were in each others arms hugging and kiss ing and crying with relief greys eye caught sight of a magic mirror on the wall he hadnt noticed it before but now he saw that it was tuned to the evil machines cave pewter had been watch ing all the time but on the machines screen were the words cursesfoiled again what an amazing coincidence that he should happen on this very passage in the book of answers after dolph had by sheerest mischance broken a feather so that coincidence mischance no it was more like magic the one thing or series of things that could have gone wrong with the evil machines longrange plot to conquer xanththat thing had occurred because of the nature of murphys curse on cornpewters ploy it was perhaps in cidental that this also accounted for greys lifelong hap piness with ivy perhaps grey knew better now thanks dad he murmured
