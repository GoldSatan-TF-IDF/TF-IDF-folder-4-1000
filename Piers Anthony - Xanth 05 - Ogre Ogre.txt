chapter nightmare tandy tried to sleep but it was difficult the demon had never actually entered her private bedroom but she was afraid that one night he would this night she was alone therefore she worried her father crombie was a rough soldier who had no truck with demons but he was away most of the time guarding the king at castle roogna crombie was fun when he was home but that was rare he claimed to hate women but had married a nymph and tolerated no inter ference by other males tandy remained a child in his eyes his hand would have hovered ominously near his sword if he even suspected any demon was bothering her if only he were here her mother jewel was on a late mission planting orange sapphires in a stratum near the surface it was a long way away so she rode the diggleworm who could tunnel through rock without leaving a hole they would be back after midnight that meant several more hours and tandy was afraid she turned over wrapped the candystriped sheet about her in an uncomfortable tangle and put the pink pillow over her head it didnt help she still feared the demon his name was fiant and he could dematerialize at will that meant he could walk through walls the more tandy thought about that the less she trusted the walls of her room she was afraid that any unwatched wall would permit the demon to pass through she rolled over sat up and peered at the walls no demon ogre ogre she had met fiant only a few weeks ago by accident she had been playing with some large round blue rubies rejects from her mothers barrelrubies were supposed to be redand one had rolled down a passage near the de mons rum works she had run right into a rum wrap a demon was using tearing it so that it became a bum wrap she had been afraid the demon would be angry but instead he had simply looked at her with a halfsecret halfsmile and that had been worse thereafter that demon had shown up with disturbing frequency always looking at her as if something demoniacally special was on his mind she was not so naive as to be in doubt about the nature of his thought a nymph would have been flatteredbut tandy was human she sought no demon lover tandy got up and went to the mirror the magic lantern brightened as she approached so that she could see herself she was nineteen years old but she looked like a child in her nightie and ladyslippers her brown tresses mussed from constant squirming her blue eyes peering out wor riedly she wished she looked more like her motherbut of course no human person could match the pretty faces and fantastic figures of nymphs that was what nymphdom was all aboutto attract men like crombie who judged the distaff to be good for only one thing nymphs were good for that thing human girls could be good for it too but they really had to work at it they fouled it up by assigning far more meaning to it than the nymphs did so were unable to proceed with sheer delighted abandon they were cursed by their awareness of consequence she peered more closely at herself brushing her tresses back with her hands rearranging her nightie standing straighten she was no child whatever her famer might choose to think yet she was not exactly buxom either her human heritage had given her a good mind and a soul at the expense of voluptuousness she had a cute face with a pert upturned nose and full lips she decided but not enough of the rest of it she couldnt make it as a nymph the demon fiant obviously thought she would do how ever maybe he didnt realize that her human component made her less of a good thing maybe he was slumming looking for an intriguing change of pace from the dusky demonesses who could assume any form they chose even ogre ogre animal forms it was said that sometimes they would change to animal form in the middle of the act ofbut no human girl was supposed to be able to imagine anything like that tandy couldnt change form in or out of bed and certainly she didnt want any demons attention if only she could convince him of that there was nothing to do but try to sleep again the de mon would come or he wouldnt since she had no control over that there was no sense worrying she lay down amidst the mess her bed had become and worried she closed her eyes and remained still as if sleep ing but remained tensely awake maybe after a while her body would be fooled into relaxing there was a flicker at the far wan tandy spied it through almostclosed eyes and kept her small body frozen it was the demon he really had come in a moment fiant solidified inside the room he was large muscular and fat with squat horns sprouting from his forehead and a short unkempt beard that made him look like a goat his hind feet were hooflike and he had a mediumlength tail at his posterior barbed at the tip there was a dusky ambience about him that would have betrayed his demonic nature no matter what form he took his eyes were like smoky quartz shielding an internal lava flow emitting a dull red light that brightened when his attention warmed to something by diabolic standards he was hand some enough and many a nymph would have been deli riously happy to be in tandys place tandy hoped fiant would go away after perceiving her alseep and disordered but knew he wouldnt he found her attractive or at least available and refused to be repulsed by her negative response demons expected rejections they thrived on them it was said that given a choice between rape and seduction they would always choose the rape the females too of course it was impossible to rape that kind she would simply dematerialize if she didnt like it which might be another explanation for fiants interest in tandy she couldnt dematerialize rape was possible maybe if she were positive welcoming him that would turn him off he was obviously tired of willing females but tandy couldnt bring herself to try that particular ploy if it didnt work where would she be ogre ogro fiant approached the bed grinning evilly tandy kept her eyes screwed almost shut what would she do if he touched her she was sure that screaming and fighting would only encourage him and make his eyes glow with preternatural lustbut what else was there fiant paused looming over her his paunch protruding the light from his eyes spearing down through slits ah you lovely little morsel he murmured a wisp of smoke curling from his mouth as he spoke be thrilled you soft human flesh your demon lover is here at last let me see more of you and he snatched the sheet away tandy hurled the pillow at him and bounced off the bed her terror converting to anger get out of here foul spiriti she screamed ah the tender morsel wakes cries welcome delight ful the demon strode toward her the blue tip of his forked tongue rasping over his thin lips his tail flicked similarly tandy backed away her terroranger intensifying i loathe you go away presently fiant said his tail stiffening as it elevated hone your passion to its height honey for i will possess its depth he reached for her his horns brightening in the reflected glare of his eyes desperate tandy wreaked her ultimate she threw a tantrum her body stiffened her face turned red her eyes clenched shut and she hurled that tantrum right at the demons fat chest it struck with explosive impact the demon sundered into fragments his feet hands and head flying outward his tail landed on the bed and lay twitching like a be headed snake tandy chewed her trembling lip she really hadnt wanted to do that her tantrums were devastating and she wasnt supposed to throw them now she had destroyed the demon and there would be hell to pay how could she answer to hell for murder the pieces of the demon dissolved into smoke the cloud coalescedand fiant formed again intact he looked dazed oh that kiss was a beauty he said and staggered through the wall tandy relaxed fiant wasnt dead after all but he was ogre ogre gone she had the best of both situations or did she he surely would not stay goneand now they both knew her tantrums would not stop him she had only postponed her problem nevertheless now she was able to sleep she knew there would be no more trouble this night and her mother would be home the next few nights fiant for all his boldness when he had his victim isolated stayed clear when a re sponsible person was in the neighborhood next day tandy tried to talk to her mother though she was pretty sure it wouldnt help mother you know that demon fiant who works at the rum refinery he oh yes the demons are such nice people jewel said smelling of mildly toasted sulfur that was her magic her odor reflected her mood especially beauregard doing his research paper which he has been working on since before i was bom hes a nice demon yes but fiant is another kind he they never make any trouble for me when i have to set gems in their caves the demons are such good neighbors the sulfur was getting stronger beginning to crinkle the nose jewel didnt like to hear criticisms most are mother naturally the demons didnt bother jewel without her there would be no gems to find and the demons were partial to such trinkets but this ones different he everyones different of course dear thats what makes xanth so interesting now she smelled of freshly blooming orange roses maybe different isnt quite what i mean he comes to my room at night oh he wouldnt do that that wouldnt be right the wrongness of such a thing showed in the smell of an over ripe medicine ball even immature medicine balls smelled unpleasantly of illness and aging intensified the effect but he did last night you must have dreamed it dear jewel said firmly and the aroma of carrion of a moderately sated dragon showed how distasteful any such notion was to jewel sometimes those nightmares carry irresponsible dreams tandy saw that her mother did not want to become aware of the truth jewel had been a nymph and retained ogre ogre many of her nymphal qualities despite the burden of expe rience that marriage and motherhood had imposed on her she had no real understanding of evil to her all people and all creatures were basically good neighbors including demons and in truth the demons had been tolerably well behaved until fiant had taken his interest in tandy her father crombie would understand though crombie was not only human he was a man of war well did he understand the ways of males but he hardly ever had time off and she had no way to advise him of her situation so he couldnt help now as she thought of her father tandy abruptly realized that jewel could not afford to lose her faith in people be cause then she would have to question crombies fidelity that could only disrupt her life evidently jewels thoughts were to some extent parallel to tandys because now there was the disturbing odor of a burning field of wild oats so tandy couldnt actually talk to her mother about this it would have to be her father in private that meant she had to get to him since he would not be home in time to deal with the demon it was said that no man could stand against a demon in combat but crombie was more than a man he was her father she had to reach him that was a problem in itself tandy had never been to castle roogna she had never even been to the surface of xanth she would be lost in an instant if she ever left the caves in fact she was afraid to try how could she travel all the way to her fathers place of employment alone she had no good answer the demon did not come the following night the night mares visited instead every time she slept they trotted in rearing over her bed hooves flashing ears fiat back snort ing the scary vapors that were the bad dreams they bore she woke in justified terror and they were goneonly to return as she slept again that was the way of such beasts finally she became so desperate she threw a tantrum at one of them the tantrum struck it on the flank the mare squealed with startled pain her hindsection collapsing and her companions fled tandy was instantly sorry as she generally was after throwing a tantrum she knew the dark horse was only doing its duty and should not be punished tandy woke ogre ogre completely tears in her eyes determined to help the ani malbut of course it was gone it was almost impossible to catch a nightmare while awake she checked where the mare had stood the floor was scuffled there and there were a few drops of blood tandy hoped the mare had made it safely home it would be sev eral nights before this one was fit for dreamduty again it was a terrible thing to lash out at an innocent creature like that no matter how bothersome it might be and tandy resolved not to do that again next time she slept she watched for the nightmares trying to identify the one she had hurt but they were a long time in coming as if they were now afraid of her and she could hardly blame them for that but at last they came for they were compelled to do their job even when it was dangerous to them timidly they approached with their burdens of dreams and these now related to the harming of equines they were making her pay for her crime but she never saw the hurt one and that made her feel increasingly guilty she was sure that particular night mare was forever wary of her and would not come again maybe it was lying in a stall wherever such creatures went by day suffering if only she had held her temper it was the job of nightmares to carry the unpleasant dreams that sleepers were scheduled to have just as it was jewels job to place the gems people were destined to find since the dreams were ugly they could not be trusted to voluntary participation thus nightmares had a bad reputa tion in contrast with the invisible daymares who brought in pleasant daydreams people tried to avoid nightmares and this made the horses job more difficult tandy wasnt sure what would happen if the bad dreams did not get delivered but was sure there would be trouble it was generally best not to interfere with the natural order she wondered idly what dreams the nightmares themselves had when they slept a few days later when tandy was settling down the demon fiant came again he walked right through the wall a lascivious grin on his face open up cutie im here to fulfill your fondest fancies and delve into your deep est desires his tail was standing straight up quivering for a moment tandy froze unable even to speak she ogre ogre had been bothered by this creature before now she was terrified staringeyed she watched his confident ap proach fiant stood over her as before his eyes glowing like red stars lie back spread out make yourself comfy he gloated i shall exercise your extreme expectations he reached for her with a longnailed diabolic hand tandy screamed this night jewel was home she rushed in to discover what was the matter but the demon marched calmly out through the wall before jewel arrived and tandy had to blame her scream on the nightmares that provided her with a fresh burden of guilt for of course the mares were innocent tandy knew she had to do something plant was getting bolder and soon he would catch her aloneand that would be worse than any nightmare he had proved he could sur vive one of her tantrums so tandy had no protection she would have to go to her father crombiesoon but how then she had an inspiration why not catch a nightmare and ride her to castle roogna the creature would surely know the way as the mares had the addresses of all people who slept but there were problems tandy had no experience rid ing horses she had sometimes ridden the diggle behind her mother traveling to the far reaches of xanth to place em eralds and opals and diamonds but this was different the diggle moved slowly and evenly phasing through the rock as long as someone made a tune it liked the nightmares she was sure moved swiftly and unevenly how could she catch oneand how could she hold on tandy was an agile girl she had climbed all over the caverns swinging across chasms on ropevines squeezing through tiny crevicesgood thing she was small swimming the chill river channels running fleetly across sloping rockslides throwing chunks at the occasional gob lins who pursued her if a nightmare got close enough she was confident she could leap onto its back and hang on to its flowing mane it would not be a comfortable ride but she could manage so all she really had to worry about was the first stepcatching her mare the problem was the nightmares came only during a ogre ogre persons sleep she might pretend sleep but she doubted she would fool themand if she grabbed one while awake it would surely dissipate like demonsmoke leaving her with nothing but a fading memory nightmares were after all a type of demon they could dematerialize in much the way fiant did that was how they passed through walls to reach the most secure sleepers in fact she suspected they became material only in the presence of a sleeper she would have to ride the nightmare in her sleep only that would keep it material or enable her to dematerialize with it tandy set about her task with determination it was not that she relished the prospect of such a ride but that she knew what would happen to her at the handsor what everof the demon if she did not ride she set up a bolster on two chairs and practiced on it pretending it was the back of a horse she lay on her bed then abruptly bounced off it and leaped astride the bolster grabbing a tassle where the mane should be and squeezing with her legs over and over she did this drilling the procedure into her self until it became fast and automatic she got tired and her legs got sore but she kept on until she could do it in her sleepshe hoped this took several days she practiced mostly when her mother was out setting jewels so that there would be no awkward questions the demon did not bother her by day fortunately so she was able to snatch some sleep then too when she was satisfied and also when she dared delay no longer because of fiants boldness and her mothers up coming overnight journey to set diamonds in a big kimber lite pipea complex jobshe acted she wrote a note to her mother explaining that she had gone to visit her father and not to worry nymphs tended not to worry much anyway so it should be all right she gathered some sleeping pills from the recesses where they slept put them in her pockets and lay down one pill was normally good for several hours before it woke and she had several they should keep her in their joint sleep all night but as the power of the pills took then magic effect on her body drawing her into their slumber tandy had an alarming thought suppose no nightmares came tonight ogre ogre ogre ogre ii suppose fiant came insteadand she was locked in slum ber unable to resist him that thought disturbed her so much that the first nightmare rushed to attend to her the moment she slept tandy saw the creature clearly in her dream a midnightcolored equine with faintly glowing eyesthere was the demon stigmaset amidst a flaring forelock the mane was glossy black and the tail dark ebony even the hooves were dusky yet she was a handsome animal with fine features and good musculature the black ears perked forward the black nostrils flared and the dark neck arched splendidly tandy knew this was an excellent repre sentative of the species im asleep she reminded herself this is a dream indeed it was a bad dream full of deep undertow currents and grotesque surgings and fear and shame and horror making her miserable but she fought it back nerved herself and leaped for the dark horse she made it her tedious rehearsals had served her well she landed on the nightmares back clutched the sleek mane and clasped its powerful body with her legs for an instant the mare stood still too surprised to move tandy knew that feeling then the creature took off she galloped through the wall as if it were nothing and indeed it felt like nothing for they had dematerialized the power of the nightmare extended to her rider just as the sleeping power of the pills extended to their wearer tandy remained asleep in the dreamstate fastened to her steed the ride was a terror walls shot by like shadows and open spaces like daylight as the mare galloped headlong and tailshort tandy hung on to the mane though the strands of it cut cruelly into her hands because she was afraid to let go how hard would she fall where would she be if she lost purchase now this was a worse dream than any beforeand the sleeping pills prevented her from wak ing they were already far away from her mothers neat apartment they cruised through rock and caverns water and fire and the lairs of large and small monsters they galloped across the table wheresix demons were playing poker and the demons paused a moment as if experiencing some chill doubt without quite seeing the nightmare they zoomed by a secret conclave of goblins planning foul play and these too hesitated momentarily as the ambience of bad visions touched them the nightmare plowed through the deepest recess where the brain coral stored the living artifacts of xanth and the artifacts stirred restlessly too not knowing what moved them tandy realized that when a nightmare passed a waking creature she caused a brief bad thought only in sleep did those thoughts have full potency now tandy had another problem she had to guide this steedand she didnt know how if she had known how she still wouldnt have known the way to castle roogna why hadnt she thought of this before well this was a dream and it didnt have to make sense take me to castle roognal she cried then ill let you go the nightmare neighed and changed course was that all there was to it it occurred to tandy that the steed was as frightened as tandy herself was such horses werent meant for riding so maybe the mare would cooperate just to be rid of her rider they burst out of the caverns and onto the upper surface of xanth tandy was used to strange things in dreams but was nevertheless awed her eyes were openat least they seemed to be though this could be merely part of the dreamand she saw the vastness of the surface night there were spreading trees and huge empty spaces and riv ers without cavecanyons and above was a monstrous ceil ing full of pinpoints of light in great patches she realized that these were stars which her father had told her aboutand she had thought he was making it up just as he made up tales of the heroic deeds of the men of legend ary xanths pastand that where there were none was be cause of clouds clouds were like the vapor surrounding waterfalls loosed to ascend to the heavens turn a cloud loose and naturally it did whatever it wanted then from behind a cloud came a much larger light surely the fabled sun the golden ball that tracked across the sky always in one direction no not the sun for that chose to travel for reasons of its own only during the day ogre ogre jewel had told her that though tandy wasnt sure jewel herself had ever seen the sun when tandy had asked her father whether it was true crombie had just laughed which she took to be affirmation of the orbs diurnal dispo sition of course things didnt need sensible reasons for what they did maybe the sun was merely afraid of the dark so stayed clear of night no this must be the moon which was an object of simi lar size but dimmer because it was made of green cheese that didnt glow so well evidently highflying dragons had eaten most of it for only a crescent remained the merest rind still it was impressive the mare pounded on tandys hands grew numb but her hold was firm her body was bruised and chafed by the bouncing she would be sore for daysl but at least she was getting there her bad dream slipped into oblivion for a while as dreams tended to fading in and out as me run continued abruptly she woke a dark castle loomed in the fading moonlight they had arrivedl barely in time too for now dawn was looming behind them the nightmare could not enter the light of day in fact the mare was already fading out for regardless of dawn it was no longer bound when tandy left the dream state the sleeping pills must have finished their nap and tandy had finished hers with them nothe stones were mostly gone they must have bounced out one at a time in the course of the rough ride and now only one was left not enough to do the job in a moment the mare vanished entirely freed by cir cumstance and tandy found herself sprawled on the ground battered and wideeyed she was stiff and sore and tired it had not been a rest ful sleep at all her legs felt swollen and numb from thigh to ankle her hair was plastered to her scalp with the cold sweat of nocturnal fear it had been a horrendous ordeal but at least she was in sight of her destination she got painfully to her feet and staggered toward the edifice as the blinding sun hefted itself ambitiously above the trees the land of xanth brightened about her and the creatures of day began to stir dew sparkled it was all strangely pretty ogre ogre but as she came to the moat and saw that there was the stirring of some awful creature within it orienting on her she had a horrible revelation she knew what castle roogna looked like from descriptions her father had made he had told her wonderful stories about it from the time she was a baby onward about the orchard with its cherry bomb trees bearing cherries a person dared not eat and shoes of all types growing on shoe trees and all manner of other wonders too exaggerated to be believed only an idiot or a hopeless visionary would believe in the land of xanth anyway yet she almost knew the individual monsters of the moat by name and the same for the guardian zombies who rested in the graveyard awaiting the day when xanth needed defense she knew the spires and turrets and all and the ghosts who dwelt within them she had a marvel ously detailed mental map of castle roognaand this pres ent castle did not conform this was the wrong castle oh woe tandy stood in dull defeated amazement all her effort her last vestige of strength and hope and her deviously laid plans to reach her father lay in ruins what was she to do now she was lost in xanth without food or water so tired she could hardly move with no way to re turn home what would her mother think something stirred within the castle the drawbridge low ered coming to rest across the small moat a lovely woman walked out of the castle subduing the reaching monster with a trifling gesture of her hand her voluminous robe blowing in the morning breeze she saw tandy and came toward herand tandy saw with a new shock of horror that the woman had no face her hood contained a writh ing mass of snakes and emptiness where human features should have been surely the nightmare had saved the worst dream for last dear child the faceless woman said come with me we have been expecting you tandy stood frozen unable even to muster the energy for a tantrum what horrors lay within this dread castle it is all right the snakeheaded woman said reassur ingly we consider that your phenomenal effort in catch ing and riding the nightmare constitutes sufficient chal os s lenge to reach this castle you will not be subject to the usual riddles of admission they were going to take her inside tandy tried to run but her strength was gone she was a spunky girl but she had been through too much this night she fainted chapter smash ogre smash tromped through the blackboard jungle of xanth looking at the pictures on the blackboards be cause like all his kind he couldnt read the words he was in a hurry because the foul weather he was enjoying showed signs of abating and he wanted to get where be was going before it did when he encountered a fallen beech tree across the path he simply hurled it out of the way letting the beechsand fall in a minor sandstorm when he discovered that an errant river had jumped its channel and was washing out the path and threatening to clean the grunge off his feet and make his toenails visible for the first time in weeks he grabbed that stream by its tail and flexed it so hard that it splatted right back into its proper channel and lay there quivering and bubbling in fear when an omery bullhorn blocked the way threaten ing to ram its horn most awkwardly into the posterior of anyone who distracted it smash did more than that he picked it up by the hom and blew a horrendous blast that nearly turned the creature inside out never again would that bullhorn bother travelers on that path it had been cowed this sort of thing was routine for smash for he was the most powerful and stupid of all xanths vaguely manlike creatures the ground trembled nervously when he tromped and the most ferocious monsters thought it pru dent to catch errands elsewhere until he was gone natu rally the errands fled with indecent haste wanting no part of this in fact no creature with any wit at all wanted any part of this for smash was an ogre ogre ogre ogre ogre he was twice the height of an ordinary man was broad in proportion and his knots of hairy muscles stood out like the boles of tormented old trees some creatures might have considered him ugly but these were the less imagina tive individuals smash was not ugly he was horrendous by no stretch of imagination could any ogre be considered less than grotesque and smash was an appalling specimen of the breed there had not been a more revolting creature on this path since a basilisk had crossed it yet smash like most powerfully ugly creatures had a rather sweet interior hidden deep inside where it would not embarrass him he had been raised among human beings had gone on an adventure with prince dor and princess irene and had made friends with centaurs he had in short been somewhat civilized by his environment incredible as this might seem most people believed that no ogre was dvilizable and that was certainly the safest belief to hold yet smash was no ordinary ogre this meant that he usually did not strike without some faint reason and that his natural passion for violence had been somewhat stifled this was a sad condition for an ogre yet he had borne up moderately well now he had a mission the bad weather cleared the clouds drew their curtains aside to let lovely shafts of sunlight slant down making the air sparkle prettily birds shook out their feathers and trilled joyfully everything was turning clean and pleasant smash snorted with disgust how could he travel in this he would have to camp for the afternoon and night and hope the morrow was a worse day he was hungry for it took huge and wasteful quantities of energy to sustain an ogre in proper arrogance he cast about for something edible and massive enough to sustain him such as a dead dragon or a vat of spoiling applesauce or a mossy rockcandy boulder but found nothing this region had already been scavenged out then he heard the squawk of a contented griffin and he sniffed the aroma of delicious pie the perceptions of ogres were acute rather than augly oddly though the griffin was some distance away smash located it precisely by sound and odor he tromped toward it this must be the creature that had cleaned out all the edibles of this region the griffin had captured a monstrous shoefly pie the winged shoes had been cooked to a turn the juices of their fine leather suffusing the pie which massed about as much as the griffin this was an ideal meal for an ogre smash marched up not bothering to employ any stealth the griffin whirled half spreading its wings issuing a warning squawk nobody in his right mind interfered with a feeding griffin except a sufficiently large and hungry dragon but smash was not in his right mind no ogre ever was there was simply not enough mind there to be right me give he three leave sight of me he said all ogres spoke only in inane rhyme and lacked facility with pronouns which they took to be edible roots but ogres generally made themselves plain enough in their brutish fashion the griffin had not had prior experience with an ogre that was its fortune there were very few ogres in these parts the griffin opened its eagle beak wide and screeched a warning challenge smashs bluff had been called that was unfortunate because no ogre was smart enough to bluff with dimwit ted joy he rose to the prospect of mayhem one he said counting off on his smallest hamfinger the griffin didnt move two after a brief search he found another finger the griffin had had enough of this it gave a raucous battle cry and charged which was just as well for smash had lost count this sort of intellectual exercise was horren dously difficult for his kind his head hurt and his fingers felt numb but now he was released from the necessity of counting all the way to three and that was a great relief he grabbed the griffin by its bird beak and lions tail whirled it around and hurled it out over the forest in a cloud of small feathers and fur the griffin startled by this reception spread its wings oriented circled decided the event must have been a fluke and started to come in for another engagement ogres did not have a monopoly on stupidity smash faced the lionbodied bird scram hami he bel lowed the blast of the bellow tore out half a dozen pinfeathers and two flight feathers and sent the griffin spinning out of ogre ogre control the creature righted itself again but this time de cided to seek its fortune elsewhere thus did it finally do something halfway smart yielding the stupidity title to the ogre smash took a flying leap into the center of the shoefly pie leatherlike pastry crust flew up the ogre grabbed a big handful of the delicious mess and stuffed it into his maw he slurped noisily on a boot chewed the tongue in half and masticated on a pleasantly tough heel oh it was good he grabbed two more handfuls crunching soles and sucking on laces and spitting the metal eyelets out like seeds soon all the pie was gone he burped up a few metal nails well satisfied after gorging he went to a stream and slurped a few gallons of shivering cool water as he lifted his head he heard a faint call help help smash looked about his ears rotating like those of the animal he was to orient on the sound it came from a nearby brambleberry bush he parted the foliage with one gross finger and peered in there was a tiny manlike crea ture help please it cried ogres had excellent eyesight but this person was so small that smash had to focus carefully to see him her it was naked and hadwell it was a tiny female imp who you he inquired politely his breath almost knocking her down im quieta the imp she cried rearranging her hair which his breath had violently disarrayed oh ogre ogremy fathers trapped and will surely perish if not res cued soon please i beseech you most prettily help him escape and i will reward you in my fashion smash did not care one way or another about imps they were too small to eat anyway be was for the moment full this one was hardly more massive than one of his fingers he did however like rewards okay dokay he agreed my names quieta not dokay she said primly she led him to a spot under a soapstone boulder it was of course a very clean place and the soap had been carved into interesting formations there was her fatherimp caught in an alligator clamp the alligators jaws were slowly chewing off his little leg ogre ogre this is my father ortant quieta said introducing them this is big ugly ogre pleased to meet you bigugly ogre imp ortant said as politely as the pain in his leg permitted smash reached down but his hamfingers were far too big and clumsy to pry open the tiny clamp queer ear he told the imps and obediently both covered their minuscule ears with minature hands smash let out a small roar the alligator clamp yiped and let go scrambling back to the farthest reach of its anchorchain where it cowered the imp was free oh thank you thank you so much ogrel quieta ex claimed here is your reward she held out a tiny disk smash accepted it balancing it on the tip of one finger his gross brow furrowing like a newly plowed field its a disposable reflector quieta explained proudly then seeing that he did not comprehend a mirror made from a film of soapbubble thats what we imps do we make pretty iridescent bubbles for the fairies and lenses for sunbeams and sparkles for the morning dew each item works only once so we are constantly busy i can tell you we call it planned obsolescence so now you have a nice little mirror but rememberyou can use it only one time smash tucked the mirror into his bag vaguely disap pointed somehow for no good reason he had expected more well you saved my father only once quieta said de fensively hes not very big either its a perfect mirror you know smash nodded realizing that small creatures gave small rewards he wasnt quite sure what use the mirror would be to him since ogres did not look at their own ugly faces very much because their reflections tended to break mir rors and curdle the surfaces of calm lakes in any event this mirror was far too small and frail to sustain his image since it could be used only once he would save it for an important occasion then he tromped to a pillow bush pounded it almost flat and lumpy and snored himself to sleep while the jungle trembled ogre ogre the weather was unconscionably fair the next day but smash tromped on regardless until he reached the castle of the good magician humfrey it was not particularly im posing there was a small moat he could wade through and an outer wall he could bash throughpractically an open invitation but smash had learned at castle roogna that it was best to be polite around magicians and not to bash too care lessly into someones castle so he opened his bag of belong ings and donned his finest apparel an orange jacket and steely gauntlets given to him four years ago by the cen taurs of centaur isle the jacket was invulnerable to pene tration by a weapon and the gauntlets protected his ham fists from the consequence of their own power he had not worn these things before because he didnt want them to get dirty they were special now properly dressed he cupped his mug and bellowed politely some creep asleep just in case the good magi cian wasnt up yet there was no response smash tried again me smash me bash that was letting the magician know delicately that he was coming in still no answer it seemed humfrey was not paying at tention having exhausted his knowledge of the require ments of human etiquette as he understood them smash proceeded to act he waded into the water of the moat with a great and satisfying splash washing was unogrish but splashing wasnt in a moment the spume dimmed the sun light and caused the entire castle to shine with moisture a sea monster swam to intercept him mostly that kind did not frequent rivers or moats but the good magician had an affinity for the unusual hi fly smash said affa bly removing a gauntlet and raising a hairy hamfist in greeting he generally got along all right with monsters if they were ugly enough the monster stared crosseyed for a moment at the huge fist under its snout noting the calluses scars and bama clelike encrustations of gristle then the creature turned tail and swam hastily away smashs greetings sometimes affected other creatures like that he wasnt sure why he redonned the gauntlet and forged on out of the moat reaching a brief embankment from which th wall rose he ogre ogre lifted one gauntleted hamfist to bash a convenient hole and spied something on the stone it was a small lizard dingy blah in color with medium sandpaper skin ineffi cient legs a truncated tail and a pungent smell its mean little head swiveled around to fix on the ogre smashs gauntleted hand snapped out covering the liz ard blocking its head off from view ogres were stupid but not suicidal this little monster was no ordinary lizard it was a basilisk its direct glance was fatal even to an ogre what was he to do soon the creatures poisonous body would corrode the metal of the gauntlet and smash would be in trouble he couldnt remain this way he remembered that prince dor had had a problem with a basilisk that was a cockatrice dor had sent news of a baleful henatrice and the cocklizard had hurried off at a swift crawl to find her but smash had no such resource he didnt know where a hen might be and realized that this one might even be a henatrice it was hard to look closely enough to ascertain the sexual status of such a creature without getting ones eyeballs stoned and if he had hap pened to know where a basilisk of the opposite sex might be how could he tell that news to this one he didnt speak the language for that he needed the assistance of his friend grundy the golem who could speak any language at all then he remembered the imps disposable reflector he fished in his bag with his left mitt and after several clumsy tries brought it out he stuck it to the tip of his gauntleted finger and poked it toward the region where the basilisks head should be carefully he withdrew his right hand averting his gaze this was delicate work if he aimed the mirror wrong or if it fell off his finger or if the basilisk didnt look there was a plop on the ground at his feet oh no the mirror had fallen dismayed he looked the basilisk lay stunned it had seen its own reflection in the mirror and suffered the natural consequence it would recover after a whilebut by then smash would be out of its range the mirror had not dropped it had shattered under the impact of the basilisks glare but it had done its job quietas little reward had proved worthwhile smash scooped out a handful of dirt and dumped it over the body of the basilisk so that he would not accidentally look at it as long as that mound was intact he would know he was safe now he hefted his right fist and smashed it into the stone wall sand fragments flew outward from the impact with satisfying force this was sheer joy only when exer cising the prerogative of his name did smash feel truly happy smashi smash smashi dust filled the air and a pile of rubble formed about him as the hole deepened soon he was inside the castle there was a second wall an arms reach inside the first oh goody this one was a lattice of bars not nearly as substantial as the first but much better than nothing for variety smash used his left fist this time after all it needed fun and exercise too he smashed it into the bars the fist stopped short oooh ouch only the gauntlet preserved it from injury but it still smarted this was much tougher stuff than stone or metall smash took hold of the bars with both hands and heaved his power should have launched the entire wall toward the clouds but there was nary a budge this was the strongest stuff he had encountered smash paused to consider what material could resist the might of an ogre thinking was hard for his kind his skull heated up un comfortably causing the resident fleas to jump off with hot feet but in due course he concluded that there was only one thing as tough as an ogre and that was another ogre he peered at the bars sure enoughthese were ogres bones lashed together with ogres sinews no wonder he had found them impervious this was a formidable barrier he could not bash blithely through itnor would he wish to for the bones of ogres were sacred to ogres little else was smash pondered some more his brain was already sweating from the prior effort now there was a scorched smell as the fur of his head grew hot ogres were creatures of action not cerebration but again his valiant and painful effort was rewarded he rammed through a notion oh ogres bones he said me know zones of deep deep ground where cant be found the wall of bones quivered all bad ogres craved inde cent burial after death it was one of their occasional links with the species of man the best interment was in a gar bage dump or toxic landfill for the disposal of poisonous plants and animals but ordinary ground would do if prop erly cursed and tromped down sufficiently hard me pound in mound with round of sound smash con tinued arguing his case with extraordinary eloquence that did it the wall collapsed into an expectant pile smash picked up a bone set it endwise against the ground and with a single blow of his gaundeted fist drove it so deep in the earth that it disappeared he took another and did the same me flail he nail he grunted invoking an ogrish ritual of disposal he was nailing the ground soon all the bones were gone me fling he string he said poking the tendons down after the bones with his fin ger and scooping dirt over the holes then he stomped the mound his big flat feet making the entire region reverber ate boomingly stray stones fell from the walls of the castle and the monster of the moat fled to the deepest muck at last it was time for the concluding benediction bone dark as ink me think he stink he roared and there was a final swirl of dust and grit the site had been cursed and the burial was done but now a new hazard manifested this was a kind of linear fountain the orange liquid shooting up high and fall ing back to flow into a channel like a small moat it was rather prettybut when smash started to push through it he drew back his hand with a grunt that was not water it was firewater he tried to walk around it but the ring of fire sur rounded the inner castle he tried to jump over but the flames leaped gleefully higher than he could licking up to toast his fur ogres could not be hurt by much but they did feel pain when burned this was awkward he tried to pound out a tunnel under the fire but the water flowed immediately into it and roasted him some more it danced with flickering delight with evilly glitter ing eyes forming within its substance winking mocking ogre ogre him and fingers of flame elevating in obscene gestures this was in fact a firewater elemental one of the most formidable of spirits smash pondered again the effort gave him a splitting headache he held his face together with his two paws t forcing the split back together squeezing his skull until the bone fused firm and hurried back to the moat to soak his head the cool shock of water not only got his head back to gether it gave him an idea ideas were rare things for ogres and not too valuable but this one seemed good wa ter not only cooled heads it quenched fire maybe he could use the moat to break through the wall of fire he formed his paw into a flipper and scooped a splash through the hole in the outer wall toward the firewall the splash scoredbut the fire did not abate it leaped higher crackling mirthfully he scooped again wetting the whole region but with no better effect the firewall danced un harmed mocking him with foulsmelling noises ogres were slow to anger because they lacked the wit to know when they were being insulted but smash was get ting there he scooped harder his paw moving like a crude paddle hurling a steady stream of moatwater at the wall still the fire danced though the water flooded the region smash labored yet harder feeling the exhilaration of chal lenge and violence until the level of the moat lowered and the entire cavity between the outer wall and the firewall surged with muddy fluid the sea monsters tail was ex posed by the draining water it hastily squiggled deeper still the fire danced humming a hymn of victory it could not be quenched water was as much its element as fire it merely flickered on the surface spreading wider reaching toward smash was there no way to defeat it hoool smash exclaimed frustrated but the blast of his breath only made the flame bow concavely and leap yet higher it liked hot air as well as cool water j smash couldnt think of anything better to do so he kept shoveling water the flood level rose and backwater coursed out through the gap smash tried to dam it up with rubble but the level was too high the fire still flickered merrily on the surface humming a tune about an old flame ogre ogre then the ogre had one more smart notion a prohibi tively rare occurrence for his kind he dived forward spread his arms and swam under the fire it couldnt reach him below the moatwater he came up beyond it the last hurdle navigated ccurrssess the firewater hissed furiously and flick ered out now smash stood within a cluttered room books over flowed shelves and piled up on the floor bottles and boxes perched everywhere interspersed with assorted statuettes and amulets and papers in the middle of it all like an other item of clutter hunched over a similarly crowded wooden desk was a little gnome of a man smash recog nized himthe good magician humfrey the man who knew everything humfrey glanced up from his tome dont drip on my books smash he said smash fidgeted trying not to drip on the books there was hardly room for him to stand upright and hardly a spot without a book volume or tome he started to drip on an amulet but it crackled ominously and he edged away me no stir magician sir he mumbled wondering how the good magician knew his name smash knew of hum frey by description and reputation but this was the first time the two had met well out with it ogre the magician snapped irritably whats your question now smash felt more awkward than ever the truth was he did not know what to ask he had thought his life would be complete when he achieved his full growth but somehow he found it wasnt something was missingand he didnt know what yet he could not rest until the miss ing element was satisfied so he had tromped to see the good magician because that was what creatures with seemingly insoluble problems didbut he lacked the intel lect to formulate the question he had hoped to work it out during the journey but with typical ogrish wit he had for gotten all about it until this moment there was no getting around it there were some few occasions when an ogre was too stupid for his own good no know he confessed standing on one of his own feet humfrey scowled he was a very old gnome and it was o fe ogre quite a scowl you came here to serve a years service for an answerand you dont have a question smash had a question he was sure he just didnt know how to formulate it so he stood silent dripping on stray artifacts like the unsmart oaf he was humfrey sighed even if you asked it it wouldnt be the right question he said people are forever asking the wrong questions and wasting their efforts i remember not long ago a girl came to ask how to change her nature cha meleon her name was except she wasnt called that then her nature was just fine it was her attitude that needed changing he shook his head as it happened smash knew chameleon she was prince dors mother and she changed constantly from smart to stupid and from beautiful to ugly humfrey was right her nature was just fine smash liked to talk with her when she was down at his own level of idiocy and to look at her when she was at his level of ugliness but the two never came together unfortunately still she was a fairly nice person considering that she was human very well humfrey said in a notverywell voice we are about to have a first an answer without a question are you sure you wish to pay the fee smash wasnt sure but did not know how to formulate that uncertainty either so he just nodded afbrmatively his shaggy face scaring a cuckoo bird that had been about to signal the hour the bird signaled the hour with a terri fied dropping instead of a song and retreated into its cubby so be it the magician said shrugging you will dis cover what you need among the ancestral ogres then he got up and marched to the door come on my effaced wife will see about your service numbly smash followed now he had his answerand he didnt understand it they went downstairsapparently somehow in a man ner that might have been intelligible to a creature of greater wit smash had gotten upstairs in the process of swimming under the firewall and emerging in the good magicians studywhere humfreys wife awaited them this was the lovely faceless gorgonfaceless because if her face were allowed to show it would turn men instantly ogre ogre to stone even faceless she was said to have a somewhat petrifying effect here he is humfrey said as if deliver ing a bag of bad apples the gorgon looked smash up and downor seemed to several of the little serpents that substituted for her hair hissed he certainly looks like an ogre she remarked is he housebroken of course hes not housebroken humfrey snapped he dripped all over my studyl wheres the girl tandy the gorgon called a small girl appeared rather pretty in a human way with brown tresses and blue eyes and a spunky tumedup nose yesm tandy you have completed your years service this date the gorgon said now you will have your answer the little girls eyes brightened like noontime patches of clear sky she squiggled with excitement oh thank you gorgon im almost sorry to leave but i really should re turn home my mother is getting tired of only seeing me in the magic mirror what is my answer the gorgon nudged humfrey her voluptuous body rip pling as she moved the answer spouse oh yes the good magician agreed as if this had not before occurred to him he cleared his throat considering also say what me pay smash said not realizing that he was interrupting an important cogitation the two of you travel together humfrey said smash stared down at the tiny girl and tandy stared up at the hulking ogre each was more dismayed than the other the ogre stood two and a half times the height of the girl and that was the least of the contrast between them but i didnt ask tandy protested what me task smash said simultaneously had he been more alert he might have thought to marvel that even this overlapping response rhymed the gorgon seemed to smile sometimes my husbands pronouncements need a little interpretation she said he knows so much more than the rest of us he fails to make proper allowance for our ignorance she pinched hum freys cheek in a remarkably familiar manner he means this the two of you smash and tandy are to travel through the wilds of xanth together fending off hazards ogre ogre ogre ogre together that is the ogres service in lieu of a years labor at this castleprotecting his companion it is also the girls answer for which she has already paid thats exactly what i said humfrey grumped you certainly did dear the gorgon agreed planting a faceless loss on the top of his head but it doesnt make sense tandy protested it doesnt have to make sense the gorgon explained its an answer oh now smash understood as far as he was able may i go back to my tome the good magician asked petulantly why of course you may the gorgon replied gra ciously patting his backside as he turned the good magi cian climbed back up toward his study smash knew the man had lost valuable working time but somehow the ma gician did not seem unhappy naturally the nuances of hu man interrelations were beyond the comprehension of a mere ogre the gorgon returned her attention to them hes such a darling she remarked i really dont know how he sur vived a century without me she focused seemingly on tandy and you might if you would do me a favor on the way the gorgon said i used to live on an island near the magic dust village which i think is right on your route to lake ogrechobee i fear i caused some mischief for that village in my youth i know i am not welcome there but my sister the siren remains in the area and if you would convey my greetings to her but how can i travel with an ogre tandy protested thats not an answer thats a punishment hell gobble me up the first time he gets hungryl not necessarily so the gorgon demurred smash is no ordinary ogre hes honest and halfway civilized he will perform his service correctly to the best of his limited understanding he will not permit any harm to come to you in fact you could hardly have a better guardian while traversing the jungles of xanth but how does this solve my problem even if im not gobbled up tandy persisted smash saw that her spunky nose was a correct indication of her character she had a fighting spirit despite her inadequate size traveling wont solve a thing theres nowhere i can go to the gorgon touched the girls lips with a forefinger let your problem be private for now dear just accept my assurance if my husband says traveling will solve your problem then traveling will solve it humfrey knew an ogre would be coming here at this time and knew you needed that sort of protection since you have so little fa miliarity with the outside world believe me it will turn out for the best but i dont have anywhere to go yes but smash does he is seeking the ancestral ogres a whole tribe of ogres im absolutely doomed the gorgons expression was facelessly reproving nat urally you do not have to follow the advice you paid for dear but the good magician humfrey really does know best i think hes getting old tandy said rebelliously maybe he doesnt know as much as he used to he likes to claim that hes forgotten more than he ever knew the gorgon said perhaps that is so but do not underestimate him and dont misjudge this ogre tandy pouted oh all right ill go with the monster but if he gobbles me up youll be responsible ill never speak to you again i accept the responsibility the gorgon agreed now smash is hungry she turned to him come to the kitchen ogre for a peck or two of raw potatoes they havent been cleaned and some have worms youll like them youre joking tandy said then she looked again at smash who was licking his chops youre not joking well spoke no joke smash agreed hoping there would also be a few barrels of dirty dishwater to glug down with the potatoes tandy grimaced chapter eye queue they traveled together but it was no pleasure for either smash had to take tiny slow steps to enable the girl to keep up and tandy made it plain she considered the ogre to be a monstrous lout she refused to let him carry her as he could readily have done despite the gor gons assurances she was afraid of getting gobbled she seemed to have a thing about monsters and male monsters in particular she hated them so they wended their tedious way south toward lake ogrechobeea journey that should have taken smash alone a single day but promised to take several days with tandy the good magician had certainly come up with a bad chore in lieu of his years service for an answer and smash still didnt know what question had been answered the scenery was varied at first they crossed rolling hills it took some time for tandy to get the hang of walk ing on a hill that rolled and she took several tumbles for tunately the hills were covered with soft green turf so that the girl could roll with the punches head over feet without much damage smash did note as a point of disin terest that his companion was not the child she seemed she was very small even for her kind but in the course of her tumbles she displayed wellformed limbs and torso she was a little woman complete in every small detail smash knew about such details because he had once traveled to mundania with prince dor and princess irene and that girl irene had somehow managed to show off every salient feature of her sex in the course of the adventure all the while protesting that she wanted no one to see tandy had ogre ogre less of each but was definitely of a similar overall configu ration and her exposures it seemed were genuinely unin tentional rather than artful she evidently had no notion of what to wear on such a trip in fact she seemed amazingly ignorant of xanth terrain it was as if she had never been here beforewhich of course was nonsense every citizen of xanth had lived in xanth as had even the zombies and ghosts who no longer lived but remained active after they passed the rolling hills they came to a more stable area where a tangle tree held sway tanglers were like dragons and ogres in this respect no sensible creature tangled voluntarily with one smash didnt even think about it he just stepped around it letting it sway alone but tandy walked straight down the neat clear path that always led to such trees innocently sniffing the pleas ant fragrance of the evil plant she was almost within its quiveringly hungry embrace before smash realized that she really didnt know what it was smash dived for the girl trying to snatch her out of the grasp of the twitching tentacles no gol he bellowed tandy saw him eeek the monsters going to gobble me she cried but it was smash she meant not the real menace she scooted on inside the canopy of the dread tree with a gleeful swish the hanging tentacles pounced five of them caught her legs arms and head the girl was hauled up and carried toward the slavering wooden orifice in the base of the trunk she screamed foolishly as was her kinds wont in such circumstances smash took only a moment to assess the situation thought with his brain was tedious and fatiguing and none too effective but thought with his muscles was swift and sure he saw tandy in midair wearing a pretty red print dress and matching red slippers tentacles were grabbing at these assuming them to be edible portions one tentacle was tugging at her hair dislodging the red ribbon in it in a moment the tree would realize that the red was only the wrapping and would tear that away and get down to seri ous business smash could handle a small tangler he was after all an ogre but this was a big tangler it had a hundred or more pythonlike tentacles and a personality to match its ogre ogre strength there was no way to negotiate or to reason with it smash had to fight the ogre charged in that wasnt hard tanglers wanted creatures to enter their turf it was the getting out again that was difficult he grabbed the mass of tentacles that had wrapped around the terrified and struggling girl tree let be he grunted hauling the works back away from the sapdrooling orifice now tanglers were ferocious but not unduly stupid this tree was fullsizedbut so was the ogre very few things cared to cross an ogre the tree hesitated and its coils about the girl loosened then the tree decided that it could after all handle this challenge and gain a respectable meal in the bargain it attacked smash with its remaining tentacles smash had been wary of this but was stuck for it he grabbed a tentacle in each hand and yankedbut the ma terial was flexible and stretchable and moved with him he lacked the leverage to rip the tentacles out meanwhile tandy was being carried back to the orifice trailing torn swatches of red cloth smash tried a new tactic he squeezed now the tree keened in vegetable pain as its two tentacles were con stricted into jelly dripped and spurted juice and finally were lopped off but the thing expected to take some losses and it could always grow new tentacles tandy was almost at the glistening maw a limber fiber tongue was tasting the red fabric by the dme smash could truncate all the tentacles the girl would be long digested smash hurled himself at the orifice he smashed his gauntleted fists into it breaking off the wooden teeth sap splashed burning his fur where it struck the tree roared with a sound like sundering timber but the tentacles kept coming the ogre braced himself before the orifice blocking the entry of the girl she banged into him before the tree real ized this and he was able to grab a couple more tentacles and pinch them off now the tree could not consume her until it dealt with himand he was turning out to be tougher than it had anticipated in fact he was turning out tougher than he had anticipated he had thought the tree had the advantage but he was faring pretty well ogre ogre it was a bad thing in xanth when a predator misjudged its foe the tree was now in trouble but had to fight on as new tentacles converged smash caught them twisted several together and tied their tips into a great raveled knot that he shoved into the orifice in the trunk the maw closed automatically squirting digestive sapand the tree suffered a most unpleasant surprise the keening of agony magnified piercingly during this distraction smash unwrapped the girl squeezing each tentacle until it let go soon tandy stood on the ground disheveled shaken but intact sogo smash said catching other questing tentacles to clear her escape the girl scooted out she might be small and ignorant but she didnt freeze long in a crisis now smash retreated cautiously glaring at hovering tentacles to discourage re newed attack but the tree had had enough the ogre had defeated it there was no further aggression smash stepped out privately surprised how was it he had been able to foil a tangler this size he concentrated with effort and managed to come to a conclusion he had grown since the last time he had tangled with a tangler before he would not have been strong enough to handle it now with his larger mass and the gauntlets he had the ad vantage his selfimage had not kept pace with his physical condition he knew his father crunch could have handled this tree he smash was now as powerful as that tandy was waiting for him down the path she was sadly bedraggled her dress in tatters and bruises on her body but her spirit remained spunky i guess i have to apologize to you smash she said i thoughtnever mind what i thought you risked your life to save me from my folly i was being childish you were mature suremature smash agreed uncertain what she was getting at people did not apologize to ogres so he had no basis for comprehension well next time you tell me no go ill pay better at tention she concluded he shrugged amenably that would make things easier the day was getting on and they were tired battling tangle trees tended to have that effect smash located a muffin bush with a number of fresh ripe muffins and ogre ogre ogre ogre used his finger to punch a hole in a limesoda tree so they could drink then he found a deserted harpy nest in a tree long since weathered out so that the filth and smell were gone he harvested a blanket from a blanket bush and used it to line the nest this was for tandy to sleep in it took her some time to catch on but as darkness loomed across the land in the grim way it had in the wilderness and the nocturnal noises began she was glad enough to clamber to it scad curl up in it he noted that she was good at climb ing though she hardly seemed to know what a tree was he settled down below on guard tandy did not sleep immediately curled in her nest she talked apparently this was a human trait you know smash ive never been out on the surface of xanth on foot before i was raised in the caverns and then i rode a night mare to the good magicians castle that was an accident i really wanted to go to castle roogna to see my father crombie but dawn came too soon and i was out of sleep ing pills andwell i sort of had to ask a question so as to have a nice place to stay until i figured out what to do i spent a whole year working inside the castle i never even set foot beyond the moat because i was afraid a certain party would be lurking for me so its not surprising i dont know about things like rolling hills and tangle trees that explained a lot smash realized he would have to watch her more closely to be sure she did not walk into a lethal trap the magicians rationale for having her travel with him was making more sense she certainly could not safely travel alone im sorry i distrusted you smash she continued in her talkative way you see i was raised near demons and in some ways you resemble a demon big and strong and dusky i was prejudiced smash grunted noncommittally he had not met many demons but doubted they could powder rock in the man ner of ogres i certainly have a lot to learn dont i she continued ruefully i thought trees were sweet plants and ogres were bad brutes and now i know they arent oops ogre nogrrr smash exclaimed emphatically tandy was quick to catch on she had the ready intelli gence of her kind you mean i shouldnt trust all ogres that they really do gobble people ogres prone to crunch bone smash agreed but you didnti mean she grew doubtful smash work hard girl to guard oh you mean because the good magician charged you with my protection she said relieved your service for your answer so ogres do gobble people and crunch bones but they also honor their obligations smash didnt follow all of the vocabulary but it sounded about right so he grunted assent very well smash she concluded ill trust you but will be wary of all other ogres and all other things of xanth too especially if they seem too nice to be true that was indeed best they lapsed into sleep no one bothered them in the night after all the night mares had to be wary of tandy after she had ridden one of them and he wasnt sure whether the mares knew how to climb trees as for himselfit was always the best pol icy to let a sleeping ogre lie they breakfasted on sugar sand and cocoanut milk tandy had never before drunk cocoa and was intrigued by the novelty she was also amazed by the way smash liter ally shoveled the sugar into his mouth hardly pausing to chew and crunched up whole cocoanuts husks and all you really are a monster she said half admiringly and smash grunted agreement pleased then they resumed their trek south encountering only routine creatures a toady was hopping north looking for some important person to advise when told that castle roogna was many days of hopping distant it contorted its broad and warty mouth into a scowl i hope i dont croak before i get there it said and moved on croaking it seemed was bad form for toadies then there was the quack with a wide bill and webbed feet and a bag of special magic medicines he was he ex plained looking for a suitable practice where his marvel ous remedies would be properly appreciated meanwhile did they happen to knew where pete was pete was a bog very good for delving since pete wasnt north where ogre ogre tandy and smash had come from and probably wasnt south where the magic dust village was supposed to be and wasnt west where the quack had come from it had to be east by elimination the quack coughed and his mind jogged by the term deposited some genuine fresh birdlime on the ground flies instantly materialized having a taste for lime and smash and tandy moved on by noon they were in rougher territory sweaters swarmed about them causing them to perspire until smash got fed up and issued a bellowing roar that blew them all away unfortunately it also blew the leaves off the nearest trees and several more tatters from tandys dress then they encountered a region of curseburrslittle balls of irritation that clung tenaciously to any portion of the body they encountered smashs face lit up in a horren dous smile me remember here he cried me whelped near you were born here amidst these awful burrs tandy smiled ruefully i should have known smash laughed it sounded like a rockslide in a canyon me sire crunch best of bunch he looked avidly about whelphood memories filtering back into his thick skull lat er his family had moved to the vicinity of castle roogna because his lovely mother whose hair was like nettles and whose face would make a zombie blush had felt their cub should have some slight exposure to civilization crunch the slave of love had acceded to this unogrish notion who could resist the blandishments of such a mushface as smashs mother oh this is awful tandy protested these burrs are getting in my hair it seemed human girls were sensitive to that sort of thing could be worse smash said helpfully she make curse curse she asked blankly smash demonstrated burrgrrr he growled a burr dropped lifelessly off his gross nose i dont think i can make such rhymes tandy said then a burr stuck her finger get away you awful thing she exploded the burr dropped off tandy looked at it comprehend ogre ogre ing she was certainly intelligent oh i see you just have to curse them away even so it was not easy for tandy had been raised as a nice girl and did not know many curses they hurried out of the burr region now they came to a dead forest the trees stood gaunt petrified in place id like to know how that happened tandy remarked smash knew but it was a long story in volving the romantic meeting of his parents and it was hard for him to formulate it properly so he let it go in the afternoon they came to a region of brambles these were aggressive plants with glistening spikes smash could wade through them imperviously for his skin was so tough he hardly felt the few thorns they dared to stick him with it was quite another matter for tandy who had deli cate and sweetsmelling skin the kind that was made to be tormented by thorns there were neatly cleared paths through the brambles that tandy was inclined to use but smash cautioned her against this lion ant between plant her small brow wrinkled i dont see anything then an antlion appeared it had the head of a lion and the body of an ant and massed about as much as the girl did it was of course ten times as ferocious as anything a nice girl could imagine it roared when it spied her strid ing forward aggressively smash roared back the antlion hastily reversed course it had been so distracted by the luscious prey that it had not before seen the unluscious guardian but smash knew that soon many more would arrive and would swarm over the intruders this was no safe place even for the likes of himself now i understand tandy said turning pale smash lets get out of here but already there were rustlings behind them the ant lions had surrounded them there would be no easy escape me know path avoid ant wrath smash said looking upward how fortunate that he had been raised in this vi cinity so that useful details of geography were coming back to his slow memory oh i couldnt swing from branch to branch through the ogre ogre trees the way im sure you can tandy said im agile but not that agile id be sure to fall but the antlions were closing in a full pride of them smash had to pick tandy up to get her out of their reach thus burdened he was unable to fight effectively realiz ing this the ants grew bolder closing in growling and snapping the situation was getting awkward then smash spied what he was looking forthe aereal path take care go there he said boosting the girl up by her pert bottom but its sidewise she protested peering at the path with dismay id fall offi stand tall no fall he insisted tandy obviously didnt believe him but an antlion leaped for her jaws gaping large front pincers snapping so she reached up to grab for the high path suddenly she landed on itsidewise im level she cried amazed the world has turned she stood up or rather sidewise her body parallel to the ground smash didnt worry about it he knew the properties of the path having played on it as a cub it was always levelto the person on it he was now far too massive to use it himself since the aereal path was getting old and brit tle but he didnt need to he was now unencumbered free to deal with the lions his own way the lions angered at the escape of the lesser prey pounced on the greater prey that was foolish of them smash emitted a battle bellow that tore their whiskers back and clogged then pincers with debris then began stomp ing and pounding lions yowled as the gauntleted fists con nected and screeched as the hairy feet found flesh then smash picked up two ants by their narrow waists and hurled them into the nettles he took a moment to rip a small hemlock tree out of the ground shaking the locks from its hem and bit off its top forming a fair club from the remaining trunk soon the path was clear the antlions like the tangle tree had learned new respect for ogres youre really quite something smash tandy called clapping her hands youre a real terror when you get worked up ill bet theres nothing more formidable than an angry ogre she had an excellent view of the proceedings ogre ogre from the elevated path dodging when an ant flew past antlions did not normally fly this was a consequence of being hurled out of the way ants were now stuck in a number of the jungle trees me know who smash grunted pleased ogres two she laughed that figures the only thing tougher than one ogre is two ogres she was now standing inverted her brown tresses hanging naturally about her shoulders as if she were upright she looked about from her vantage the ants arent gone just backed oif smash she re ported can you come up here smash shook his head no but he wasnt worried he could use the ant paths if the ants wanted a little more ogretype fun he would gladly accommodate them they proceeded south tandy tilting with the orientation of the aereal path sometimes upright sometimes not en joying the experience there is nothing much in the cav erns like this she commented smash tromped along the ant highways tearing through nettles when he needed to change paths soon the nettles and ants were left behind but the high path continued so tandy stayed on it smash knew it terminated at the magic dust village and since they had to pass there anyway this was convenient according to castle roogna information the magic dusters had once had a population problem not being able to hold on to their males so they had con structed the skyway to encourage immigration now there were plenty of people at the village so the path didnt mat ter but no one had bothered to take it down smash and tandy made excellent progress now they passed a region of hanging vines they were twined almost braided like queues and seemed to have eyes looking out from their recesses smash distrusted un familiar things in general and dangling vines in particular so he avoided the eye queues they could be harmless or they could be bloodsuckers this was beyond the region of his cubhood familiarity and anyway things could have changed in the interim one could never take magic for granted he also kept an eye on tandy above to make sure she did not brush against any vines as a result he didnt pay ogre ogre close enough attention to his big feetand stumbled over a minor boulder that was damming a streamlet much to the streamlets annoyance the boulder dam shattered of course it was only stone the streamlet gladly flowed through with a burble of thanks to its deliverer but smash suffered a momentary loss of balance his feet sinking into the sodden riverbed and he lurched headlong into a hanging vine the thing wrapped disgustingly around his head he snatched at it but already it was sinking into his fur and his flesh and hurting terribly when he tried to scrape it loose since an ogres course was generally that of most resistance smash put both hands to his scalp and scrapedand the burgeoning agony made him reel stop smash stop tandy screamed from above youll rip off your head smash stopped i concur there is no sense in that tandy stared down at him what did you say i said there is no sense in mortifying my flesh since the queue does not appear to have seriously incapacitated me smashyoure not rhyming whyso i am not he agreed startled that must be the curse of the eye queue it has disrupted my natural mechanism of communication its done more than that tandy exclaimed smash you sound smart that must be a fallacious impression no ogre is unduly intelligent well you sure sound smart she insisted that eye queue as you call it must have added some brains to your head that seems reasonable he agreed after cogitating mo mentarily without effort the effect manifested concur rently with my contact with that object probability sug gests a causal connection this of course is much worse than any purely physical attack would have been it has temporarily unogred me i must expunge it from my sys tem oh no dont do that she protested its sort of inter esting really i dont mind you being smart smash its much easier to talk with you ogre ogre in any event i seem unable for the moment to deacti vate it smash said it seems i must tolerate this curse for the time being but i assure you i shall be alert for an antidote okay she said if thats the way you feel indubitably they went onand now smash noted things that hadnt interested him before he saw how erosion had caused rifts in the land and how the forest stratified itself with light indifferent vegetation and fungi at the nether levels and bright broad leaves above to catch the descending light of the sun the entire jungle was a cohesive unit functioning compatibly with its environment all over xanth things were integratingin his new awareness how blind he had been to the wonders of magic all his life as dusk closed the aereal path descended to the ground and they arrived at the magic dust village a troll came forth to meet them ogre do you come in peace or may hem the creature inquired standing poised for flight while other villagers hastily manned the fortifications and cleared children and the aged from the region in peace tandy said quickly i am tandy this is smash who is protecting me from monsters the trolls eyes gaped this was an unusual expression even for this type of creature protecting you from yes now we have no prejudice against monsters here the troll said scratching his long and homy nose with a discol ored claw im a monster myself and some of my best friends are monsters but only a fool trusts an ogre well im a fool tandy said this ogre fought a tan gle tree to save me are you sure you arent a kidnap victim you certainly do look good enough to eat smash did not appreciate the implication which would have passed him by had he not suffered the curse of the eye queue vine my father is crunch the vegetarian ogre he said gruffly my family has not kidnapped any one in years the troll looked at him startled you certainly dont sound like an ogre did the transformerking transform you to this shape ogre ogre i was whelped an ogre smash insisted the first traces of roar coming into his voice then the troll made a connection ah yes crunch married a cursefiend actress you have human lineage that must account for your language it must smash agreed drolly he found he didnt care to advertise his misadventure with the vine he would be laughed out of the village if its inhabitants learned he was intelligent but i should advise you purely in the interest of amity that i have been known to take exception to the appellation halfbreed i am a true ogre he picked up a nearby knot of green wood and squeezed it in one hand the green juice dripped as the wood pulped until at last there was a pool of green on the ground and the knot had become a lump of coal yes indeed the troll agreed hastily no one here would think of using that term welcome to our table for supper you are surely hungry we are only passing through tandy said were going to lake ogrechobee you cant get there from here the troll said the re gion of madness intervenes madness tandy asked alarmed from the airborne magic dust we process magic is very potent here and too much of it leads to alarming ef fects you will have to go around they did not argue the case smashs inordinate intelli gence coupled with his memories of this region corrobor ated the information he knew it would be impossible for him to protect tandy in the region of madness there were tales of the constellations of the night coming to life and of reality changing dangerously in xanth things were mostly what they seemed to be so that illusion was often reality but illusion could be taken too far in the height ened magic of the madness smash was now too smart to risk it they joined the villagers supper creatures of every type came forth to feed all well behaved elves gnomes goblins a manticore fauns nymphs fairies human beings centaurs griffins and assorted other creatures the hostess was the trolls mate trolla it is much easier to arrive than to depart she explained as she served up helpings of ogre ogre smashed potatoes and poured out goblets of mead we have never had opportunity to construct an exit ramp and our work mining the source of magic is important so we stay you may choose to remain also we labor hard but it is by no means a bad life smash exchanged a glance with tandy since it occurred to him that this might be the sort of situation she was look ing for but she was negative we have a message from the sister of a neighbor of yours we must get on and de liver it a neighbor trolla asked she is called the siren there was a sudden hush you know tandy said the sister of the gorgon you are friend to the gorgon trolla asked coldly i hardly know her smash said quickly remembering that this village had suffered at the gorgons handsor rather her face having had all the men turned to stone fortunately that mischief had been undone at the time of the loss of magic when all xanth had become as drear as mundania briefly numerous spells had been aborted in that period changing xanth in ways that were still unrav eling i had to see good magician humfrey and shes his wife she asked us to say hello to the siren oh i see trolla relaxed and the others followed her example there were murmurs of amazement and awe the good magicians wife and she turned him to stone not anywhere we could see tandy said then blushed uh that is trolla smiled hes probably too old for such enchant ment anyway so the sight of her merely stiffens his spine or whatever she gulped a goblet of mead the siren no longer lures people since a smart centaur broke her magic dulcimer she is not a bad neighbor but we really dont associate with her they finished their repast smash happily consuming all the refuse left after the others were done the villagers set them up with rooms for the night smash knew these were honest wellmeaning folk so he didnt worry about tan dys safety here as he lay on his pile of straw smash thought about the place of the magic dust village in the scheme of xanth stray references to it bubbled to the surface of his mem orythings he had heard at different times in his life and thought nothing of since ogres thought nothing of every thing from these suddenly assimilating fragments he was now able to piece together the role of this village geologi cally here it was that the magic dust welled to the surface from the mysterious depths the villagers pulverized it and employed a captive rocbird to flap its wings and waft huge clouds of the dust into the air where it caused madness close by technicolor hailstorms farther distant and magic for the rest of xanth as it diluted to natural background intensity if the villagers did not perform this service the magic dust would tend to clump and the magic would be unevenly distributed causing all manner of problems certainly the magic dusters believed all this and la bored most diligently to facilitate the proper and even spreading of the dust yet smashs eye queueinfected brain obnoxiously conjured caveats questioning the reali ties the villagers lived by if the magic really came from the dust it should endure as long as the dust did fading only slowly as the dust wore out yet at the time of no magic all xanth had been rendered mundane instantly that had happened just be fore smash himself had been whelped but his parents had told him all about it they had considered it rather ro mantic perhaps even a signal of their love crunch had lost his great strength in that time but other creatures had been affected far more and many had died then the magic had returned as suddenly as it had departed and xanth had been as it was before there had been no great move ments of dust then no dust storms that suggested that the magic of xanth was independent of the dust the dust came from below and if it brought the magic the nether regions must be more magical than the surface tandy had lived below yet she seemed normal she did not even appear to have a magic talent so how could the magic be concentrated below but smash decided not to raise these questions openly as they would only make things awkward for the villagers and perhaps the belief of the dusters was right and his vinesponsored objections were wrong after all what could a queue of eyes understand of the basic nature of xanth his thought turned to a bypath a magic talentthat must be what tandy was questing for he as an ogre was fortunate ogres had strength as their talent when smash had gone to mundania outside the magic ambience of xanth he had lost his strength and his rhyme distress ingly now he had lost his rhymes and his naivete but not his strength was the infliction of the curse of the eye queue really so bad there were indeed pleasures in the insights this artificial intelligence afforded him yet ogres were sup posed to be stupid he felt sadly out of place smash decided to keep quiet most of the time and let tandy do the talking he might no longer be a proper ogre in outlook but at least he could seem like an ogre if he generated an illusion of continuing stupidity perhaps in time he would achieve it again certainly this was worth the hope meanwhile his shame would remain mostly se cret ogre ogre chapter catastrophe in the morning they walked along an old ground bound path to the small lake that contained the sirens isle it was pretty country with few immediate hazards and so smash found it dull while tandy liked it very well the siren turned out to be a mature mermaid who had probably been stunning in her youth and was not too far from it even now she evidently survived by fishing and seemed satisfied with her lot or more correctly her pond we bring greetings from your sister the gorgon tandy called as they crossed the path over the water to the island immediately the mermaid was interested she emerged from the water and changed to human formher fishtail simply split into two wellformed legsand came to meet them still changing she had been nude in the water but it hardly mattered since she was a fish below the waist but as she dried the scales that had covered her tail converted to a scalesequin dress that nudged up to cover the upper portion of her torso for a reason that had never been clear to smash it was all right for a mermaid to show her breasts but not all right for a human woman to do the same the finny part of her flukes became small shoes it was minor but convenient magic after all smash thought she might otherwise get cold feet my sister she ex claimed her newly covered bosom heaving how is she doing well shes married to the good magician humfrey oh yes i had news of thati but how is she recently recently tandys brow furrowed smash caught on to the nature of the sirens question she wants to know whether the gorgon is pregnant he murmured tandy was startled ohi dont know about that i dont think so but she does seem happy and so does the magician the siren frowned im so glad she found hers i wish i had found mine and smash now perceived from this dose range and the magnification of his interpretive intel lect that the siren was not happy at all she bad lost her compelling magic twenty years ago and had very little left such things had not before been concerns of smashs ogres hardly cared about the nuances of the lifestyles of nymphal creatures now thanks to the curse of the eye queue smash felt the sirens problem and felt the need to alleviate it we are going to lake ogrechobee perhaps if you went there you would find yours the siren brightened thats possible but we are having trouble finding the way he said the madness intercedes its a nuisance the siren agreed but there are ways around it we would like to know of one well theres the catapult yet you have to pay the cats price what is the cats price tandy asked warily if its a kind of demon we might not like it it likes catnipand thats not easy to get smash could get it tandy said brightly he fought a tangle tree and a pride of antlions well hes an ogre the siren agreed matteroffactly that sort of thing is routine for them why dont you come with us and show us where the catnip is tandy suggested then we can all go to the catapult and on to lake ogrechobee the siren considered i admit i dont seem to be ac complishing much here i never thought id travel with an ogrel she faced smash are you tame ive beard some bad things about ogres theyre all true smash agreed ogres are the worst brutes on two legs but i was raised in the environs of castle roogna so am relatively civilized ogre ogre hes really very nice when you get to know him tandy said he doesnt crunch the bones of friends ill risk it the siren decided ill lead you to the cat nip she adjusted her dress packed a few fish for nibbling on the way and set oft leading them east of the lake the catnip grew in a section of the jungle separated by a fiercely flowing stream they had to use a narrow catwalk past a cataract that was guarded by a catamount dont fall into the water the siren warned its a catalyst that will give you catarrh catatonia and catalepsy i dont understand tandy said nervously is that bad a catalyst is a substance that facilitates change smash explained drawing on his new eye queue intellect in the case of our living flesh this is likely to mean deterioration and decay such as catarrh which is severe mflammation inside the nose catatonia which is stupor and catalepsy which is loss of motion and speechlessness we had better stay out of this water it is unlikely to be healthy yes unlikely tandy agreed faintly but the cata mount is on the catwalk it will throw us off oh i wouldnt be concerned about that smash said he strode out on the catwalk it dipped and swayed under his mass but he had the sure balance of his primitive kind and proceeded with confidence no violence tandy pleaded the catamount was a large reddish feline with long whiskers and big paws it snarled and stalked toward smash its tail swishing back and forth no violence a fright would have been fun but smash realized now that the girls would worry so he used his intellect to pon der on a peaceful option what about the one he had used on the moatmonster at the good magicians castle i want to show you something kitty he said he leaned forward and held out his right hand the catamount paused distrustfully smash carefully closed his gauntleted hamflngers into a huge gleaming fist shafts of sunlight struck down to elicit new gleams as smash slowly rotated his fist it was amaz ing how each shaft knew exactly where to go smash nudged this metallic hamfist under the cata ogre ogre mounts nose now kitty he said quietly if you do not vacate this path expeditiously you are apt to have a closer encounter with this extremity does this eventuality meet with your approval the felines ears twitched as if it suffered indigestion it seemed to have a problem with the vocabulary it consid ered the extremity the fist sent another barrage of glints of reflected sunlight out seeming to grow larger the ogre stood perfectly balanced and at ease muscles bulging only slightly fur lying almost unruffled after a moment snarl ing ungraciously the catamount decided not to dispute the path this time it backed away well well smash thought his bluff had workednow that he had the wit to bluff of course it would have been fun to hurl the catamount into the water below and see what happened to it but that pleasure was not to be this time a catbird sailed down out of the sky it had the body of a crow and the head of a cat meow it scolded the cata mount and issued a resounding catcall then it wheeled on smash claws extended catascatchcan the ogres mitt moved swiftly the hamfingers caught the catbird who screeched piteously smash brought it down pulled out one large tailfeather and lofted the crea ture away the catbird flew awkwardly its rudder mal functioning the fight had been taken out of it along with much of the flight a catfish protested from below it lifted its cathead from the flowing water and yowled its voice had a nasal quality the creature did indeed seem to be suffering from catarrh and perhaps catalepsy though probably it had built up a certain immunity to the curses of the water smash hurled the feather down into its mouth the catfish choked and sneezed disappearing now smash tandy and the siren crossed without imped iment sometimes its really handy having an ogre along tandy remarked she seemed to have swung from absolute distrust to absolute support and smash was not displeased the path led through a field of cattails growing in cat sup where cattle grazed fattening up in case some cata clysm came it terminated at a catacomb the catnip ogre ogre grows in there the siren said pointing to the teeth of the comb that barred the entrance but its dangerous to en ter because if the cataclysm comes the cattle will stampede into it then i will go alone smash said he brushed the comb aside and marched on down the way soon became dark but ogres had good night vision so he wasnt much bothered dont invite catastrophe the siren called after him i certainly hope not smash called back though in truth he wouldnt have minded a little of that to make things interesting i will be pusillanimously careful deep inside the cave he found a garden of pleasantly scented mintlike plants with felinely furry leaves each had a spike of blue flowers these must be the catnips smash took hold of one and pulled it up by the roots being uncertain which part of the plant he needed and stuffed it into his bag the flowers nipped at him but lacked the power even to be annoying he grabbed and crammed more plants until he felt he had enough he turned to departand spied a dimly glowing object it was set in the cave wall beside the exit framed in stone set with yellow catseye gems it was a furry hump with a tail descending from it evidently the posterior of some sort of feline a pussywillow no too large for that smash recalled reference to one of the barbarian customs of the mundanes in which they killed animals and mounted their heads on walls that was stupidperfectly edible heads going to waste someone must have done the same for this cats rear smash considered then decided to take the trophy along it certainly wasnt doing any good here in the dark per haps the girls would like to see it smash realized that it was a measure of the degradation foisted on him by the eye queue that he even thought of showing something in teresting to others but he was stuck with it he reached out to grab the stone frame the catseyes blinked wamingly the thing was firmly set so he applied force the frame ripped out of the walland the roof col lapsed puzzled smash put one fist up over his head the rock fell on this and cracked apart piling up on either side ogre ogre smash climbed up through the rubble toting his bag of plants but was unable to bring the posteriortrophy in a moment he reached daylight oh youre all right tandy cried i was so afraid rockfalls cant hurt ogres smash said i tried to take a trophy but the roof fell in he dusted himself off a trophy tandy asked blankly the rear end of some kind of cat mounted in the wall that was the catastrophe the siren cried i told you not to invite it catastrophea trophy of the rear of a cat now smash understood he had not properly applied his new intelli gence and had done considerable damage to the catnip garden as a result he would try to be more careful in the future as long as he was cursed with intellect he might as well use it i had better clear the rocks out of the garden smash said this too was an unogrish sentiment but the eye queue and the presence of the girls seemed to have that effect on him no dont bother the siren said you wouldnt know how to set it right the caterpillar will take care of that after we leave it likes to push rocks around they crossed the catwalk past the cataract again and proceeded to the catapult this was a feline creature the size of a small sphinx crouched in a clearing its tail ex panded into a kind of netting at the end large enough for a boulder to rest on there was a basket nearby just that size the siren approached the catapult will you hurl us to lake ogrechobee please she asked we have some catnip for you the cat brightened it nodded its whiskered head they laid the catnip plants down before it then moved the bas ket to the expanded tail the three of them climbed in and drew the wicker lid over enclosing themselves the cat sniffed the catnip its tail stiffened ecstatically then it nipped the catnip as the potent stuff took effect the tail suddenly sprang up carrying the basket along sud denly the party of three was flying they looked out between the slats xanth was cruising by beneath them all green and blue and yellow there ogre ogre were scattered lowhanging clouds around them white be low all other colors above where they couldnt be seen from the ground some were rainclouds shaped like pools brimming with water stray birds were taking baths in them and flying fish were taking breathers there too the basket clipped the edge of oae of these rainclouds and tore a hole in it the water poured out in a horrendous leak there was an angry uproar from below as the unscheduled deluge splashed on the forest but this was the region of madness anyway no one would be able to prove the differ ence now it occurred to smash to wonder about their descent they had risen smoothly enough but the fall might be less comfortable then some sort of material popped out of the lid of the basket it spread into a huge canopy that caught the air magically and held back the basket the descent became slow and they landed by the shore of lake ogrechobee they opened the basket and stepped out that was funi tandy exclaimed girlishly but how will the cata pult get its basket back an orange creature hurried up vaguely catlike ill take that it said who are you tandy asked i am the agent of this region it is my job to see that things get where they belong the catapult has a contract for the return of its baskets oh then you had better take it but i dont know how youll be able to carry that big basket through that thick jungle or past the region of madness no problem im half mad already the orange agent picked up the basket and trotted north the vegetation wilted and died in the creatures vicinity making a clear path ohthats its magic talent tandy said agent or ange kills plants they turned to lake ogrechobee it was a fine blue expanse of water with a whirlpool in the center dont go there the siren cautioned the cursefiends live there what is wrong with the cursefiends smash asked my mother was one the siren turned her gaze on him startled ohi un ogre ogre derstood you were an ogre thecursefiends are of human derivation i didnt mean to my mother is an actress she had to play the part of an ogress in an adaptation of prince charming a mundane tale naturally she was the ingenue naturally the siren agreed faintly but my father crunch happened onto the set inno cently looking for bones to crunch and spied her and was instantly smitten by her horribleness and carried her away naturally she married him yes of course the siren agreed looking wan i am jealous of her fortune im of human derivation myself the cursefiends fired off a great curse that killed a huge forest smash continued but my parents escaped the curse by becoming vegetarians most ogres crunch bones so this confused the curse and caused it to misfire you were raised in a nonbonecrunching home tandy exclaimed im still an ogre he said defensively im glad it worked out so well the siren said but i think it would be wise to avoid the cursefiends they might not appreciate your position i suppose so smash admitted but they are excellent actors no one ever confused my mother for a human being im sure they didnt the siren agreed i saw one of the cursefiends plays once it was very well done but it can be awkward associating with someone who throws a curse when aggravated smash laughed it certainly can be i acted unogrish once letting a wyvem back me off from an emerald i had found my mother set that emerald in place tandy ex claimed and my mother threw a curse at me he continued it scorched the ground at my feet and knocked me on my head i never let any monster back me off again that was cruel tandy said she shouldnt have cursed you cruel of course not it was ogre love the only kind our kind understands she cursed my father once and it ogre ogre ogre ogre was two days before he recovered and the smile never left his face well i dont know tandy said and she seemed un usually sober did she have some connection to the curse fiends smash filed the notion for future reference they walked around a portion of lake ogrechobee trying not to attract attention there were no ogres in evi dence and no traces of their presenceno brokenoff trees or fragmented boulders or flatstomped ground there seemed to be no threats either the entire lake was girded as far as they could see by a pleasant little beach and the water was clear and free of monsters evi dently the cursefiends had driven away anything danger ous look at the noses tandy cried pointing across the water smash looked there were scores of nostrils swim ming in pairs toward the shore making little waves as they drew near he saw that the nostrils were the visible tips of more extensive snouts which continued on into long reptilian bodies ohthe chobees the siren said relaxing theyre mostly harmless chobees arent related to other kinds of bees they dont sting once in a while one strays up to my lake but what big teeth they have tandy said theyre imitation teeth soft as pillows a chobee scrambled out onto the beach it had short fat green legs and a green corrugated skin the siren petted it on the head and the chobee grinned she touched one of its teeth and the tooth bent like rubber snapping back into place when released but smash had a nagging doubt i remember something my father said about the chobees most of them are inno cent but some oh yes thats right the siren agreed a few a very few have real teeth those kind are dangerous lets stay away from the bad ones then tandy said what do they look like i dont know the siren admitted they look just like the nice ones smash said slowly dredging his memory but then any of these could be a bad one tandy said alarmed true smash agreed unless the cursefiends got rid of them how could the cursefiends tell the difference if we cant tandy asked if a chobee eats a cursefiend its probably a bad one the siren said smiling obscurely do we need to tell the chobees apart the same way tandy asked worriedly the siren laughed musically her voice was only a shadow of what it must have been when she had her luring magic but it remained evocative of course not dear lets avoid them all that seemed easy enough to do as the three of them could walk faster than the reptiles could soon the chobees gave up the chase and nosed back into the water where they buzzed away toward the deeper por tions of the lake tandy watched the wakes their nostrils left with relief at one point the lake become irregular branching out into a satellite lake that was especially pretty a partial causeway crossed the narrow connection between the large and small lakes ill wade across smash said delighting in the chance to indulge in some splashing i dont know tandy said the nice paths can be dan gerous she had learned from her experience with the tan gler and the antlions now she distrusted all the easy ways i will explore the water the siren said i will be able to tell very quickly whether there are dangerous water creatures near besides im hungry i need to catch some fish she slid into the small lake her legs converting to the sleekly scaled tail her dress fading out if you find a monster send it my way smash called im hungry too she smiled and dived belowthe surface a barebreasted memymph swimming with marvelous facility in a mo ment her head popped up tresses glistening no monsters here she called not even any chobees i believe that causeway is safe i find no pitfalls there that was all smash needed too bad he muttered he waded in sending a huge splay of water to either side ogre ogre but tandy remained hesitant i think ill just walk around it she said good enough smash agreed and forged on into deeper water the causeway dropped lower but never deeper than chest height on him he conjectured that it might have been constructed by the cursefiends to prevent large sea monsters from passing they preferred deep water and avoided shallows maybe the smaller lake had been de veloped as a resort region this suggested that there could be monsters in lake ogrechobee they just happened to be elsewhere at the moment maybe they represented an addi tional protection for the fiends converting the whole of the large lake into a kind of moat it really didnt matter since he had no business with the cursefiends after all they had not let his mother go willingly to marry his father she had had no further contact with her people after she had taken up with crunch the ogre and it occurred to smash that this could not have made her feel good so his attitude toward the fiends was guarded he would not try to avoid them but neither would he try to seek them out neutrality was the watchword he had never thought this out be forebut he had not suffered the curse of the eye queue before either he still hoped to find some way to be rid of it as these frequent efforts of thought were not conducive to proper ogrish behavior he glanced across the water of the little lake tandy was picking her way along the beach looking very small he felt unogrishly protective toward herbut of course this was his service to the good magician ogres were gross and violent but they kept their word also the eye queue curse lent him an additional perception of the virtue of an ethical standard it was a bit like physical strength the ideal was to be strong in all respects ethical as well as physical and tandy certainly needed protection besides which she was a nice girl he wondered what she was looking for in life and how it related to his journey to seek the ancestral ogres had old magician humfrey finally lost his magic and had to foist tandy off on an ogre m lieu of a genuine answer smash hoped not but he had to entertain the possibility suppose there was in fact no an swer for tandyor for himself smash had no ready answer for that even with his un ogre ogre wanted new intelligence so had to let the thought lapse but it was disquieting high intelligence it seemed posed as many questions as it answered being smart was not nec essarily any solution to lifes problems it was much easier to be strong and stupid bashing things out of the way with out concern for the consequences disquiet was no proper feeling for an ogre now he got down in the water and splashed with all limbs this was proper ogre fun the spray went up in a great cloud surrounding the sun and causing its light to fragment into a magic halo the whole effect was so lovely that he continued splashing violently until pleasantly winded when he stopped he discovered that the water level of the small lake had dropped substantially and the sun was hastening across the sky to get out of the way severely dimmed by all the water that had splashed on it but his thorough washing did not clear the eye queue from the fur of his head somehow the queue had sunk into his brain and the braided eyes were providing him new visions of many kinds it would be hard indeed to get those eyes out again at last he waded out at the far side the siren swam up converted her tail to legs and joined him on the warm beach you made quite a splash smash she said had i not known better i would have supposed a thunderstorm was forming that good he agreed well satisfied of course it wasnt all good he was now unconscionably clean but a few good rolls in the dirt would take care of that that bad the siren said with a smile he studied her as she gleamed wetly her scalesuit creeping up to cover the fullness of her front she seemed to be turning younger though this might be inconsequential i illusion i think the swim was good for you too siren you look splendid privately he was amazed at his words she did look splendid and her affinity to the voluptuous gor gon was increasingly evident but no ordinary ogre would have noticed let alone complimented her in the fashion of a human being the curse of the queue was still spreading i do feel better she agreed but its not just the swim its the companionship i have lived alone for too long now ogre ogre ogre ogre that i have company however temporarily my youth and health are returning so that explained it people of human stock had need for the association of other people this was one of the ways in which ogres differed from human beings ogres needed nobody not even other ogres except to marry he looked again at the siren her nymphlike beauty would have dazzled a man and led him to thoughts of moonlight and gallivanting smash however was an ogre full breasts and smoothly fleshed limbs appealed to him only aestheticallyand even that was a mere product of the eye queue an uncursed ogre would simply have be come hungry at the sight of such flesh which reminded himhe needed something to eat he checked around for edibles and spied some ripe banana peppers he stuffed handfuls of them into his mouth something nagged him as he chewed fleshfemale hungerah now he had it a girl in danger of being eaten wheres tandy he asked i havent seen her smash the siren said her fair brow furrowing she should be here by now shouldnt she we had better go look for her in casewell lets just see ill swim you check the beach agreed smash crammed another double fistful of peppers into his face and started around the beach con cerned he blamed himself now for his selfish carelessness he knew that tandy was unfamiliar with the surface of xanth liable to fall into the simplest trap if something had happened to her i find nothing here the siren called from the water maybe she went off the beach for a matter of hygiene good notion smash checked the tangled vines beyond the beachand there in due course he found tandy hi hol he called to her waving a hamhand tandy did not respond she was kneeling on the turf looking at something are you all right smash asked worry building up like a sudden storm but the girl neither moved nor answered the siren came out of the water dripping and changing in the effective way she had and joined smash oh shes fallen prey to a hypnogourd a hypnogourd smash remembered encountering that fruit before anyone who peeked in the peephole of such a gourd remained mesmerized until some third party broke the connection naturally tandy had not been aware of this so she had peeked being girlishly curiousand re mained frozen there gently the siren removed the gourd breaking the con nection tandy blinked and shook her head but her eyes did not quite focus her features coalesced into an expres sion of vacant continuing horror hey come out of it dear the siren said the bad vision is over it ended when you lost contact with the gourd everythings all right yet the girl seemed numb the siren shook her but still tandy did not respond maybe its like the eye queue smash said it stays in the mind until removed the gourds arent usually that way the siren said perplexed of course i have not had much personal expe rience with them since i have lived alone theres no one to break the trance for me so i have stayed clear but i met a man once a mundane back when i was able to lure men with my music he said the gourds were like computer gamesthat seems to be something he knew about in mun dania one of their forms of magiconly more compelling he said some people got hooked worse than others tandy was raised in the caves she has no experience with most of xanth she must be susceptible whatever she saw in there maintains its grip on her mind that must be it usually people have no memory of what they see inside but maybe that varies also that same mundane spoke of acidheads which i think are creatures whose headswell i cant quite visualize that but it seems they suffered flashbacks of their mad dreams after their heads were back in normal shape maybe tandy is ill go into that gourd and destroy whatever is bothering her smash said then shell be free smash you may not have your body in there i have never looked into a gourd but i dont think the same rules apply as those we know you could get caught there too it could be catastrophe ogre ogre i will be more careful to avoid that trophy this time smash said with an ogrish grimace he applied his eye to the peephole he was in a world of black and white he stood before a black wooden door set in a white house there was no sound at all and the air was chill faintly ominous vibra tions wafted in from the near distance there was the dif fuse odor of spoiling carrion smash licked bis lips carrion always made him hungry but he did not trust this situation tandy was not here of course and he saw nothing that could account for her con dition nothing to frighten or horrify a person he decided to leave however he perceived no way out he had arrived full formed within this scene there was no obvious exit he was locked into this visionunless he had entered through this door and turned about to face it without realizing and could depart through it doors generally did lead from one place to another he took hold of the black metal doorknob the thing zapped him with a small bolt of lightning he tried to let go but his hand was locked on he wore no gauntlets evi dently he had left them behind the electric pain pulsed through his fingers locking the muscles clenched with its special magic there was a wash of pain literally his black hand was now glowing with red color in stark contrast with the monochrome of the rest of the scene smash yanked hard on the knob the entire door ripped off its hinges the pain stopped the red color faded his fingers relaxed at last and he hurled the door away behind him before him was a long blank hall penetrating the som ber house from the depths of it came a horrendous groan this did not seem to be the way out he was sure he had not walked any great distance inside the gourd but it did seem pleasant enough and was the only way that offered smash stepped inside a chill draft rustled the fur on his legs the odor of putrefaction intensified the floor shuddered as it took his weight there was another groan smash strode forward impatient to get out of this inter estingly drear but pointless place worried about tandy he ogre ogre needed to consult with the siren to work out some strategy by which he might find whatever had scared tandy and deal with it otherwise he would have felt free to enjoy the further entertainments of this house had he realized what kind of scene was inside the gourd he would have entered it years ago something flickered before him smash squinted and saw it was a ghost you trapped too he asked sympa thetically and walked through it the ghost made an angry moan and flickered to his frontside again boooooo it booooooed smash paused was this creature trying to tell bun some thing he had known very few ghosts as they did not ordi narily associate with vgres there were several at castle roogna attending to routine hauntings do i know you he asked do we have any mutual acquaintances yoowwelll the ghost yowded its hollow eyes flashing darkness id help you if i could but im lost myself smash said apologetically and brushed on through it again the ghost disgusted for some obscure reason faded away the passage narrowed this was no illusion the walls were closing on either side squeezing together smash didnt like to be crowded so he put one hamhand on each wall and pushed outward exerting ogre force something snapped then the walls slid apart and lay tilted at slightly odd angles it would probably be a long time before they tried to push another ogre around at the end of the hall was a rickety staircase leading up smash pressed one hairy bare foot on the lowest step and shoved down testing it the step bowed and squeaked pit eously but supported his weight smash took another stepand suddenly the entire stairway began to move carrying him upward magic stairs what would this enjoy able place think of next the stairs accelerated faster and faster they went mak ing the dank air breeze past smashs face at the top of the flight they ended abruptly and he went sailing out into blank space ogres liked lots of violent things hut were not phenome nally partial to falling however they werent unduly con cerned about it either smash stiffened his legs in a mo ogre ogre ment he landed on hard concrete naturally it fractured under the impact of his feet he stepped out of the nibble and looked about he seemed to be in some sort of deep well or oubliette the circular wall narrowed above making climbing out difficult then a shape appeared in silhouette holding a big stone over its head the figure had horns and looked like a demon smash was not especially partial to demons but he greeted this one courteously enough up yours devil he called the demon dropped the stone down the well smash saw the dark shape looming but had no room to step out of the way then light flared smash blinked it was broad daylight in the forest of xanth are you all right the siren asked i didnt dare let you stay out too long i am all right smash said how is tandy unchanged im afraid smash i dont think you can destroy what is bothering her because the horror is now in her mind we could smash the gourd and it still wouldnt help her smash considered his skull no longer heated up when he did that i believe you are correct i saw nothing really alarming in there perhaps i should go into the gourd with her and show her that its not so bad the siren frowned i suspect ogres have different defi nitions of bad just what happened in there only a haunted house shocking doorknob ghost squeezing wallsi suppose those could have been awk ward for a human person moving stairs a demon drop ping a rock down a well why would a demon do that i dont know i happened to be below at the time maybe it didnt like my greeting tandy stirred her eyes swung loosely about her lips pursed flaccidly she looked disturbingly like a ghost no no house no demon a graveyard she lapsed into staring her mouth beginning to drool evidently you had separate visions the siren said us ing a puff from a puffball growing nearby to clean up the girls face that complicates it ogre ogre maybe if we go in together well share a vision smash conjectured but there is only one peephole smash poked his littlest hamfinger into the rind of the gourd two now you ogres are so practical they set the gourd before tandy who immediately peered into the first peephole then smash squatted so that he could peer into the second he was back in the well the rock was plunging at his head hastily he raised a fist since he didnt want a head ache the rock shattered on the fist falling around him in the form of fragments pebbles and gravel so much for that if the demon would just drop a few more stones down smash would soon have this well filled up with rub ble and could step out but the demon did not reappear too bad smash looked around the gloom tandy was not with him he was in the same vision he had left picking it up in the same moment he had left it he was using a different peephole but that didnt seem to matter probably tandy was back in her original vision at the same point it had been interrupted getting scared by whatever had scared her before it seemed the gourd programmed each vision separately however it was all the same gourd tandy had to be somewhere in here and he intended to find her rescue her from her horror and smash that horror into a quivering pulp so it wouldnt bother her again all he had to do was make a sufficient search he took hold of a stone in the wall of the well and yanked it out three more stones fell out with it smash took another this time five more fell this old well was not well constructed he stood on these and drew out more stones the well filled in beneath him steadily and before long he was back at the surface there was no sign what soever of the demon who had dropped the first rock on him that was just as well for smash might have treated that demon a trifle unkindly perhaps snapping its tail like a rubber band and launching the creature on a flight to the moon the least that demon could have done was to stay around long enough to drop a few more useful boulders down the well ogre ogre now he stood in a chamber surrounded by doors he heard a faint despairing scream tandy he went to the nearest door and grasped the knob it shocked him so he ripped the door out of its socket and threw it away the room inside was a bare chamber a false lead he tried the next door got shocked again and ripped it out too another bare chamber he went to the third doorand it didnt shock him the doors were leam ingi he opened this one gently but it led only to another decoy chamber finally he opened one that showed an outdoor walk he hurried down this hurdling a square that he recognized as a covered pitfallogres naturally knew about such things having had centuries of ancestral experience avoiding such traps set for them by foolish menand emerged into a windy graveyard battered gravestones were all around marking sunken graves some stones tilted forward precariously as if trying to peer into the cavities they demarked it occurred to smash that the buried bodies might have climbed out and gone elsewhere accounting for the sunkenness of the graves and the suspicions of the headstones but this was not his concern the odor of carrion was stronger out here maybe some of the corpses had not been buried deep enough a wind came up cutting around the stone edges with dismal howl ing smash breathed deeply appreciating it then concen trated on the business at hand tandy he called where are you for she had said she was in a graveyard and this must be the place he heard a faint sobbing carefully he traced down the source it was slow work because the sound was carried by the wind and the wind curved around the gravestones in cold blue streams searching out the best edges for making moaning tunes but at last he found the huddled figure cowering behind a white stone crypt tandy he repeated its i smash the tame ogre let me take you away from all this she looked up pale with fright as if hardly daring to recognize him her mouth opened but only drool came out he reached out to take her arm to help her to her feet ogre ogre but she was as limp as a rag doll and would not rise she just continued sobbing she seemed little different from her xanth self something was missing smash considered for once he was thankful for the eye queue because now he could ponder without pain what would account for the girls lethargy and misery he had thought it was fear but now that he was here she should have no further cause for that it was as if she had lost something vital like eyesight or or her soul suddenly smash remembered how vulnera ble souls could be and knew that if anyone were likely to blunder into a soulhazardous situation tandy was the one she knew so little of the ways of xanth no wonder she was desolate and empty your soul tandy he said holding her so that she had to look into his face where is it listlessly she nodded toward the crypt smash saw that it had a heavy tight stone door scrape marks on the dank ground indicated it had recently been opened she must have gone inside perhaps trying to escape the graveyard and had been ejected without her soul i will recover it he said now she bestirred herself enough to react no no she moaned i am lost save yourself i agreed to protect you he reminded her i shall do it he set her gently aside and addressed the crypt the door had no handle but he knew how to deal with that he elevated his huge bare fist and smashed it brutally forward into the stone ouch without his gauntlets his hands were more tender he could not safely apply his full force but his blow had accomplished its purpose the stone door had cracked marginally and jogged a smidgen outward he ap plied his homy fingernails and hauled the door unwillingly open a dark hole faced him as his eyes adjusted he saw a white outline it was the skeleton of a man it reached for him with bonefingers smash realized where the bodies in the sunken graves had gone they had been recruited for guard duty and were walking about this crypt but he was not in the mood for nuisance he grabbed the skeleton by the bones of its arm and hauled it violently out of the crypt the thing flew through the air and landed as a jumble of bones the ogre proceeded on into the hole other skeletons appeared clustering about him then connections rattling smash treated them as he had the first disconnecting their footbones from their legbones and other bones causing the bonepile to grow rapidly soon the remaining skeletons reconsidered not wishing to have him roll their bones and left him alone deep in the ground the ogre came to a dark coffin the smell was mouthwateringly awful something really rotten was in there was tandys soul in there too he picked up the box and shook it all right all right a muffled voice came from the coffin you made your point ogre you arent afraid of anything what do you want give back tandys soul smash said grimly i cant do that ogre the box protested we made a deal her freedom for her soul i let her out of this world i keep her soul thats the way we deal here souls are the currency of this medium the siren let her out by removing the gourd smash argued she never had to pay coincidence i permitted it once the deal was struck the negotiation is sealed smash had lived and thought like an ogre a lot longer than he had lived and thought intelligently now he re verted to convenient old habits he roared picked up the coffin and hurled it against the wall the box fell to the floor somewhat sprung and several ceiling stones dropped on it nauseating goo dribbled from a crack in it dirt sifted down from the chamber wall to smooth the outlines maybe further negotiation is possible after all the voice from the coffin said somewhat shaken would you consider trading souls smash readied his hamfist again wait the voice cried alarmed it evidently wasnt used to dealing with real brutes i merely collect souls i dont have the authority to give them back if you want the girls soul now your only option is to trade the ogre considered he might smash the coffin and its occupant to pieces but that would not necessarily recover the soul if tandys soul were in there it could get hurt in the battering so maybe it was better to bargain trade what another soul of course how about yours this box thought he was a typically stupid ogre no well someone elses what about that buxom mature nymph out in xanth with the sometime fishtail she probably has a luscious bouncy juicy soul smash considered again he decided with an unogrish precision of ethics that he could not make any commit ments on behalf of the siren not her soul and not mine then the girls soul must remain smash got another whiff of the stench from the coffin and knew that tandys soul could not be allowed to rot there he still did not consider the deal by which the coffin had gotten tandys soul to be valid he stooped to pick up the battered coffin again wait the voice cried there is one other option you could accede to a lien the ogre paused explain a lien is a claim on the property of another as security for a debt the coffin explained a lien on your soul would mean that you agree to replace the girls soul with another souland if you dont then your own soul is for feit but you keep your soul in the interim or most of it it did seem to make sense how long an interim shall we say thirty days six months smash said you think im stupid i did think that the coffin confessed after all you are an ogre and it is well known that the brains of ogres are mostly in their muscles in fact their brains are mostly muscles not true smash said an ogres skull is filled with bone not muscle i stand corrected my skull is filled with necrosis how about sixty days four months split the difference ninety days okay smash agreed but i dont agree you are enti tled to keep any soul just because you tricked an innocent girl into trading it off for nothing are you sure youre an ogre you dont sound like one im an ogre smash affirmed would you like me to throw you around some more to prove it that wont be necessary the coffin said quickly if you disagree with the assessment you must deal with the boss the night stallion he makes decisions of policy the dark horse close enough some do call him that he governs the herd of nightmares it began to fall into place this is where the nightmares live by day when theyre not out delivering bad dreams to sleepers exactly all the bad dreams are generated here in the gourd from the raw material of peoples fundamental fearsloss pain death shame and the unknown the stallion decides where the dreams go and the mares take them there your girlfriend abused a mare so it took a lien on her soul and when she came here that lien was called due so her soul is forfeit and now we have it and only the night stallion can change that why dont we set you up for an appointment with the stallion and you can settle this directly with him an appointment when well he has a full calendar bad dreams arent light fancies you know theres a lot of evil in the world that needs recognition its a lot of work to craft each dream correctly and designate it for exactly the right person at the right time so the stallion is quite busy the first opening is six months hence but my lien expires in three months youre smarter than the average ogre for sure you might force an earlier audience but youd have to find the stallion first he certainly wont come to you within three months i really wouldnt recommend the effort of locating him smash considered again it seemed to him that this cof fin protested too profusely something was being concealed here time for the ogre act again perhaps so he said there is therefore no point in restraining my natural incli nation for violence he picked up a rock and crumpled it to chips and sand with one hand he eyed the coffin but im sure you can find him the box said quickly all you have to do is seek the path of most resistance thats all i can tell you honest smash decided that he had gotten as much as he could from the coffin good enough give me the girls soul and ill leave my threemonth lien and meet the stallion when i find him do you think a soul is something you can just carry in your hand the coffin demanded derisively yes smash said he contemplated his hand slowly closing it into a brutishly ugly fist that hovered menacingly over the coffin quite the coffin agreed nervously sweating another blob of stinking goo the soul floated up a luminescent globe that passed right through the wood smash cupped it carefully in his hand and tromped from the gloomy cham ber neither coffin nor skeletons opposed him tandy sat where she had been the picture of hopeless girlish misery here is your soul smash said and held out the glowing globe unbelievingly she reached for it the globe expanded at her touch becoming a ghostshape that quickly overlapped her body and merged for an instant her entire body glowed right through the tattered red dress then she was her normal self oh smash you did it she exclaimed i love you you recovered my soul from that awful corpse i promised to protect you he said gruffly how can i reward you she was actually pinching her self amazed by her restoration smash too was amazed he had not before appreciated how much difference a per sons soul made no reward he insisted its part of my job my ser vice for my answer she considered yes i suppose but how ever did you do it i thought there was no way i had to indulge my natural propensities slightly he admitted glancing at the pile of bones he had made the bones shuddered and settled lower eager to avoid his atten tion oh i guess you were more terrible than the skeletons were she said naturally that is the nature of ogres were worse ogre ogre than anything smash thought it best not to inform her of the actual nature of his deal lets get out of here oh yes but how that was another problem he could bash through walls but the force holding tandy and himself inside the gourd was intangible i think well have to wait for the siren to free us all she has to do is move the gourd so we cant look into it any more but she doesnt know when well be finished in here oh i dont want to stay another minute in this horrible place if i had known what would happen when i peeked into that funny little hole its not a bad place this smash said trying to cheer her it can even be fun fun in this awful graveyard like this smash had spied a skeleton poking around a grave perhaps looking for a new convert he sneaked up behind it ogres didnt have to shake the earth when they walked they did it because they enjoyed it b he bellowed the skeleton leaped right out of its footbones and stum bled away terrified tandy had to smile youre pretty scary all right smash she agreed they settled down against a large gravestone tandy huddled within the protection of the ogres huge hairy arm it was the only place the poor little girl felt safe in this region chapter prints of wails i he siren greeted them anxiously as they woke to the outer afternoon of xanth i gave you an hour this time smash i just didnt dare wait longer she said are you all right i have my soul back tandy said brightly smash got it for me the siren had been looking her age for her human stock caused her to be less than immortal now relief was visibly restoring her youthfulness thats wonderful dear she said hugging her then looking at smash the siren sob ered again but usually souls cant be recovered without hell to payah that is some sort of quid pro quo are you sure ive got mine smash said jovially such as it is ogres do have souls dont they as far as i know only people of human derivation have souls the siren said but all of those do even if their human ancestor was many generations ago and so we three qualify im sure yours is as good as any smash and perhaps better than some it must be stronger and stupider anyway he said im so glad its all right the siren said seeming not entirely convinced she evidently suspected something but chose not to make an issue of it at this time older females tended to be less innocent than young ones he realized but also more discreet they considered their situation there seemed to be no ogres and no merfolk at lake ogrechobee despite its name ogre ogre now i remember smash said the cursefiends drove the ogres away they migrated north to the ogre fenogre fen i dont know why i didnt think of that be fore because you werent cursed by the eye queue before silly tandy said you werent very smart but thats all right well just go up to the ogre fen and find your tribe but thats the entire length of xanth the siren pro tested who knows what horrors lie along the way yes fun smash said funny the good magician didnt remind you about the ogres change of residence the siren said well theres certainly not much doing here i would like to travel with you a little longer if i may at least until i find a lake inhabited by merfolk sure come along we like your company tandy said immediately and smash shrugged it really made little dif ference to him he was partially preoccupied by his prob lem with the lien on his soul he would soon have to find a pretext to go back into the gourd to search for the night stallion and fight for his soul but first lets abolish this menace once and for all the siren said she picked up the hypnogourd and lifted it high overhead throwing it violently to the ground no smash cried but before he could move the gourd had smashed to earth it fragmented into pinkish pulp black seeds and translucent juice there was no sign of the world he and tandy had toured within it the magic was gone the ogre stood staring at the ruin now how could he return to that world to settle his account somehow he knew his lien had not been abated by the destruction of the gourd his avenue to that world had merely been closed it would take time to manifest but he knew he was in very bad trouble is something wrong the siren asked did you leave something in there it doesnt matter smash said brusquely after all she had meant well and there was nothing to be done now no point in upsetting the girls no matter how privately satisfy ing it might have been to rant and rave and stomp ogre ogre ogre style until the whole forest and lake trembled and roiled with reaction to the violence they trekked north through the variegated jungle and tundra and intemperate zones of xanth most of the local flora and fauna left the party alone wisely not wishing to antagonize an ogre upon occasion some gnarled old bull spruce would paw the earth with a branchhoof and poke a limbhom into the way but a short sharp blow with smashs gauntleted fist taught such trees manners progress was good they were just considering where to spend the night when they heard something there was a thin barely audi ble screaming and a cacophony of ugly pantings breath ings and raspings something unpleasant is going on the siren said ill investigate smash said glad for the chance for a little relaxing violence he tromped toward the commotion a crowd of multilegged things was chasing a little fairy lass who seemed to have hurt one of her gossamer wings she was running this way and that but wherever she went creatures like squished caterpillars with tentacles moved to block the way dribbling hungry drool the fairy was screaming with fright and horror and the pursuers were reveling in her discomfort playing cruelly with her before closing for the kill whats this smash demanded one of the creatures turned toward him though it was hard to tell which side was its front stay out of what does not concern you trashface it said insolently now smash normally did not involve himself in what did not concern him but his recent experience with tandy in the gourd had sensitized him to the plight of small pretty females in distress also he did not like being told to stay out despite the compliment to his face therefore he reacted with polite force get out of here you ghastly par ody oho the ghastly cried so the dumb brute needs a les son too immediately the creatures oriented on smash from a distance they were repulsive from up close they were worse they launched purple spittle at him belched ob ogre ogre scenely all over their bodies and scratched at him with dirty claws but several still chased the hapless fairy lass smash became moderately perturbed now it seemed the reputation of ogres was on the line he picked up a ghastly it defecated on his paw he heaved it into the forest it scurried back he pounded another into the groundbut it merely squished flat then rebounded he tore one apart but it just stretched impossibly and snapped back to its normal shapelessness when he let go leaving a slug of smelly slime on his fingers now the fairy screamed louder the ghastlies had almost caught her smash had to act quickly or he would be too late to help her but what would stop these creatures fortunately his new intelligence assisted if throwing pounding and stretching didnt work maybe tying would he grabbed two ghastlies and squeezed and squished them together tying a knot in their infinitely stretchable limbs then he tied in a third and a fourth and a fifth soon he had a huge ball of tied ghastlies since they kept coming stupidly at him their rebounding and stretching didnt do them much good it merely tightened the knots in due course all the ghastlies were balled together spitting hiss ing scratching and pooping on each other constantly smash dropped the ball wiped himself off on some towelleaves and checked on the fairy she was as fright ened of him as she had been of the ghastlies he did not chase her he had only wanted to make sure she was not too badly hurt when the fairy saw him stop she stopped she was a tiny thing hardly half the height of tandy a nude girl form with sparldingly mussed hair and thin iridescent wings with scenic patterns you arent chasing me ogre no go your way in peace fairy but why did you tie all the ghastlies in a knot if you didnt want to gobble me up to help you escape she had difficulty assimilating this i thought you were an ogre but you neither sound nor act like one we all have our off days smash said apologetically tandy and the siren arrived hes a gentle ogre the siren explained he helps the helpless she introduced the three of them ogre ogre im john the fairy said then before they could react she continued i know i know its not a proper name for the like of me but my father was away when i was born and the message got garbled and i was stuck with it so now im on a quest for my proper name but i got tossed by a gust and hurt my wing and then the ghastlies why dont you travel with us tandy asked until your wing gets better monsters dont bother us much we have one of our own she gripped smashs dangling ham hand possessively john considered evidently uncertain about traveling with a monster then the ball of ghastlies began working loose and she decided yes i will go with you it should take only a day or so for my wing to mend smash did not comment he had not asked for any com panions but tandy had been forced on him and she had a propensity for inviting others perhaps it was because xanth was so new to her that she felt the company of oth ers who were more familiar with it would improve things maybe she was right the siren had certainly helped them get out of the gourd it didnt really matter smash could travel with three as well as with one now night came smash foraged for food and found a patch of spaghetti just ripening near a spice tree he har vested several great handfuls shook the spice on them and proffered this for their repast the girls seemed a trifle doubtful at first but all were hungry and soon they were consuming the delicious slippery stuff ogrestyle by the handful and slurpful then they found a basket palm with enough stout hanging baskets for all and spent a reasona bly comfortable night but before they slept the siren questioned john about the kind of name she was looking for why dont you just take any name you like and use it oh i couldnt john said i can answer only to the name i was given since i was given the wrong one i must keep it until i recover the right one how can you be sure there is a right one if your father was misinformed oh no he knew who i was he sent back a good name but somehow it got lost and the wrong name arrived in stead by the time he got home it was too late to fix it smash understood the sirens perplexity he like her had not been aware that names were so intricately tagged does that mean that someone else got your name the siren asked of course some male fairy got my name and must be as unhappy with it as i am with his but if i find him we can exchange them then everything will be just fine i see the siren said i hope you find him soon in the morning they breakfasted on honeydew that had formed on the leaves of the basket tree then resumed the trek north john buzzed her healing wing every so often and the pattern on it seemed to come alive in a three dimensional image like flowers blooming but she could not yet fly she had to be content to walk she was a cheery little thing good company and full of cute anec dotes about life among the fairies it seemed the fairy kingdom was a large one with many principalities and in terstate commerce between groups and internecine trade wars they started to climb none of them was familiar with this section of xanth which was east of the region of madness so they merely proceeded directly north with luck it wouldnt be too bad but it was bad the mountain became so steep it was impossible to climb normally they could not go around it because the sides of the channel they traveled had risen even more steeply they had either to proceed forward or to retreat all the way to the base and try another approach none was willing to retreat smash used his gauntleted fists to break out sections of rock making crude steps for the others fortunately the really steep part was not extensive and by noon they stood at the top it was a lake hardly on the scale of ogrechobee but impressive enough brimful with sparkling water this must be an old volcano john said i have flown over similar ones though not this big we must beware water dragons like such lakes especially if they are hot on the bottom smash grimaced he didnt like water dragons because they tended to be too much for an honest ogre to handle but he saw no sign of such a creature here no droppings no piles of bones no discarded old scales or teeth what are those tandy inquired pointing there were marks on the surface of the water they were roughly circular indentations with smaller indenta tions on one side of each large one they look like prints the siren said as if some creature walked on the water is that possible smash put one foot on the water it sank through the ripples moved across the prints erasing them not possi ble he decided still they decided to stay clear of the water until they knew more about it seemingly minor mysteries could be hazardous to their health in xanth they walked around the west side of the lake following one of those suspi ciously convenient paths because there was no other route between the deep water and the climike outer face of the mountain but as they bore north following the curve of the cone they encountered an outcropping of spongy rock magma smash conjectured forcing another subterra nean memory to the surface slightly heated i dont care who it is its in our way tandy com plained indeed the rock blotted out the path forcing them to attempt a hazardous scramble i shall remove it smash decided he readied his hamfist and pounded one good pound on the magma the rock responded with a deafening reverberation they all clapped their hands over their ears while the mountain shook and the lake made waves finally the awful noise died away that magma comes loud the siren said magma cum laude the ogre agreed not hearing well yet it sure is some sound tandy said looking dizzy the fairy agreed they decided they didnt like the sound of it and would try the other side of the lake where the way might be quieter as they walked the path back an awful moan slid across the water what is that tandy demanded anxiously the wailing of whatever made the prints the siren conjectured ogre ogre oh so these are the prints of wails close enough the siren grimaced i hope we dont meet the wail though ive had some experience with mu sic on water and this makes me nervous yes you ought to know tandy agreed my father said you could bring any man to you from afar if he heard you yes when i had my magic she said sadly those days are gone and perhaps it is just as well but i do get lonely they approached the east side of the lake but here they encountered more trouble an ugly head lifted on a serpen tine neck it was not exactly a dragons head and not ex actly a sea monsters head but it had affinities with both it was not large as monster heads went but it hissed vi ciously enough smash was tired of being balked he did not mess with this minor monster he reached out with one hand and caught the neck between gauntleted thumb and forefinger immediately another head appeared similar to the first and just as aggressive smash caught this one in his other glove then a third came this was getting awkward had he stumbled onto a whole nest of serpents hastily smash smashed the first two heads together crushing both and reached for the third they all connecti the siren exclaimed its a many headed serpent indeed it was four more heads rose up making seven in all smash crushed two more but had to move quickly to prevent the remaining three from burying their fangs in his limbs he rose to the need however by catching one under his feet and the last two in his hands in a moment all had been crushed and he relaxed smash look out tandy cried more heads apparently a couple of the ones he had dealt with had not been completely destroyed and had revived this was unusual things seldom recovered from the impact of ogre force he grabbed theseand discovered they sprouted from the same neck their junction formed a neat y he was sure he hadnt encountered this configuration before more heads tandy screamed ogre ogre now there were six more in three pairs new heads were growing from the old ones its a hydra the siren cried each lost head generates two more you can never get ahead of it ive got too many heads of it smash muttered step ping back the hydra was generating a small forest of hiss ing heads each lunging and snapping at anything in range two were squaring off at each other you cant kill a hydra the siren continued its es sence is immortal it draws its strength from the water then i shall remove the water smash said it will be easy to bash a hole in this rim and let the lake out oh please dont do that the siren protested im a creature of water and i hate to see it mistreated you would ruin a perfectly lovely lake and drown many inno cent creatures below and kill many innocent lake denizens there is an entire ecology in any such body was the mermaid becoming the conscience of the group smash hesitated thats true john admitted pretty lakes should be left alone most of them have much more good than evil in them smash looked at tandy i agree she said we dont want to harm others and this water is nice the ogre shrugged he didnt want trouble with his friends as he thought about it with his amplified eye queue intelligencewhich remained a nuisancehe real ized they were right wanton destruction could only beget a deterioration of the environment of xanth and that would in the long run damage the prospects of ogres no harm to others he agreed gruffly if any other ogres ever heard of this he would be in trouble imagine not destroying something oh i could kiss you tandy said but i cant reach you smash chuckled good thing now well have to swim across the lake do all of you know how to swim oh i couldnt swim john said my wings would break maybe you can fly now the siren suggested maybe the fairy tried buzzing her pretty wings making the flowerpattern blossoms again she seemed to ogre ogre lighten as the downdraft of air dusted dirt out from the ridge but she did not quite take off then she jumped a gust of wind passed at that moment carrying her out over the rim she agitated her wings furiously but could not sustain elevation and began to fall smash reached out and caught her before she crashed into the rocky slope she screamed then realized he was helping her not attacking her he set her carefully back on the ledge where she stood panting prettily and quivering with reaction not yet it seems the siren said but you might sit on smashs back while he swims i suppose the fairy agreed faintly her little bare bosom was heaving it occurred to smash that the loss of the ability to fly might be quite disturbing to a creature whose natural mode of travel was flight he might react similarly if he lost his ogre strength they entered the water tandy could swim well enough and of course the siren converted to mermaid form and was completely at home john perched nervously on smashs head and was so light he hardly felt her weight he began stroking across the lake careful not to splash enough to cause trouble despite his pleasure in splashing some sacrifices were necessary when one traveled in com pany the siren led the way easily outdistancing the others that creature certainly could swim she was in her ele ment then something loomed from the north it was huge and dark like a lowflying thundercloud scooting across the water simultaneously the awful wailing came again and now smash realized it came from the cloudthing there was also a pattering drumbeat punctuating the wails the siren paused in place i dont like this she said that thing is trotting on the surface of the water i feel the vibrations of its footfalls and its headed for us i could outdistance it i think but tandy cant and smash cant do much without imperiling john we had better get out of the water its coming too fast john said it will catch us before we get back to shore she was right the monster loomed rapidly onward cast ogre ogre ing a dark shadow it was not actually a cloud but was composed of grayblue foam with a number of holes through which the wailing passed and hundreds of little feet that touched the water when it moved to one side they saw the prints left on the surface just like the ones they had seen before the prints of wails oh we are doomed john cried save yourself smash dive under the water hide from it an ogre hide from a monster little did the fairy grasp the magnitude of the insult she had innocently rendered no smash said ill fight it its too big to fight it probably smothers its prey by surrounding it tandy said she was being practical she seemed much less afraid of things since having discovered the ultimate nature of fear inside the gourd monsters were only monsters when ones soul was intact you cant fight fog or jelly smash realized she was probably right these assorted girls were making more sense than he would have thought before he came to know them in the water with a delicate and flightless fairy on his head he could not fight effi ciently anywayand if there was nothing really solid to punch out his fists would be of little use it galled him to concede that there were monsters that an ogre couldnt handle but in this case it seemed to be so curse this eye queue that made him see reason ill lead it away the siren cried she was hovering in the water her powerful tail elevating her body so that it was as if she stood only waistdeep she would have been a considerable sight that way for a human male it seemed to smash that she should have no trouble attracting a mer man at such time as she found one you swim on across the lake the siren continued she set off toward the west moving with amazing velocity she was like a bird in flight across the surface of the lake when she was a fair distance away she paused and be gan to sing she had a beautiful voice with an eerie qual ity a little like the wailing of the monster perhaps she was deliberately imitating it the monster paused then it rotated grandly and ran toward the siren its little feet striking the water without splashing leaving the prints that mystery had been ogre ogre solved though smash did not understand how the prints remained after the wailing monster moved on but of course the effects of magic did not need any explanation once the monster had cleared the area lured away by the siren smash and tandy swam on across it was a fair distance and tandy tired slowing them it seemed there were not many lakes this big in the underworld finally smash told her to grab hold of one of his feet so he could tow her the truth was he was getting tired himself he would have preferred to wade but the water was far too deep for that it would have been unogrish to confess any weakness however they made it safely to the north lip they drew them selves out and rested hoping the siren was all right soon she appeared swimming deep below the surface her tail gave her a tremendous forward thrust and she was a thing of genuine beauty as she slid through the wa ter her hair streaming back like bright seaweed her body as sleek and glossy as that of a healthy fish then she came up her head bursting the surface her hands rising auto matically to brush back her wet tresses mermaidlike my that was interesting she said flipping out of the water to sit on the rim her tail hidden in the water so that now she most resembled a healthy nymph the monster was friendly tandy asked doubtfully no it tried to consume me but it couldnt reach below the water because its magic prints keep it above it tried to lure me close but im an experienced hand at luring crea tures and was too careful to be taken in then you were in real danger tandy was now very sensitive to danger from monsters that lured their victims whether by an easy access path or a convenient peephole no danger for me the siren said flinging her damp hair out as she changed to human legs and climbed the rest of the way from the water few creatures can catch my kind in our element not that there are many quite like me most merfolk cant make legs thats my human heri tage of course my sister the gorgon never was able to make a tail it was her face that changed magical heredity is funny stuff but i talked briefly with the monster he considers himself a whale a whale of a what smash asked ogre ogre just a whale isnt that a mundane monster john asked it was gen erally known in xanth that the worst monsters were mun dane as were the worst people yes but this one claims some whales migrated to xanth grew legs so they could cross to inland waters and then kept the legs for lakerunning some find small lakes theyre puddlejumpers some find pools of rum theyre rumrunners he says hes of the first water a royal mon ster a prince of his kind a prince of whales tandy said is he really i dont think so thats why he wails life is hard all over smash said without much sympa thy lets get down off this mountain indeed the sun was losing strength and starting to fall as it did each day never learning to conserve its energy so that it could stay aloft longer they needed to get to a com fortable place before night fortunately the slope on this side was not as steep so they were able to slide down it fairly readily as they neared the northern base where the forest re sumed a nymph came out to meet them she was a deli cate brown in color with green hair fringed with red her torso though slender and full in the manner of her kind was gently corrugated like the bark of a young tree and her toes were rootlike she approached tandy who was the most human of the group pleasedo you know where castle roogna is i tried to reach castle roogna a year ago tandy said but i got lost i think smash knows though oh i wouldnt ask an ogre the nymph exclaimed hes a halfway tame ogre tandy assured her he doesnt eat many nymphs smash was getting used to these slights he waited pa tiently for the nymph to gain confidence then answered her question as well as he could i have been to castle roogna but im not going there at the moment and the way is difficult it is roughly west of here ill find it somehow the nymph said ive got to she faced west now wait tandy protested as smash had suspected she would the girl had sympathy enough to overflow all ogre ogre ogre ogra xanth you cant get there alone you could easily get lost or gobbled up why dont you travel with us until we find someone else who is going there but youre going north the nymph protested yes but we travel safely because of smash tandy indicated him again nobody bothers an ogre there is that the nymph agreed i dont want to bother him myself she considered seeming somewhat tired i could help you find food and water im good at that sort of thing im a hamadryad oh a treenymph the siren exclaimed i should have realized what are you doing out of your tree its a short story let me find you a place to eat and rest and i will tell it the dryad kept her promise soon they were ensconced in a glade beside a large eggplant whose ripe eggs had been hardboiled by the sun nearby was a sodapond that spar kled effervescently they sat in a circle cracking open eggs using the shells to dip out sodawater proper introduc tions were made and the dryad turned out to be named fireoak after her tree she was despite her seeming youth over a century old all her life had been spent with her fireoak tree which had sprouted from a fireacom the year she came into being she had grown with it as hamadryads did protect ing it and being protected by it then a human village had set up nearby and villagers had come out to cut down the tree to build a firehouse fireoak made fine fireresistant wood the dryad explained its own appearance of burning was related to saint elmos fire an illusion of burning that made it stand out beautifully and discouraged predatory bugs except for fireants in vain had the dryad protested that the cutting of the oak would kill both it and her the villagers wanted the wood so she had taken advantage of the full moon that night to weave a lunatic fringe that shrouded the tree hiding it from thembut that would last only a few days when the moon shrank to a crescent so would the fringe betraying the trees location she had to accomplish her mission before then but how can a trip to castle roogna help john asked they use wood there too dont they the king is there fireoak replied i understand he is an environmentalist he protects special trees it is true smash agreed he protects rare monsters too now for the first time he realized the probable basis for king trents tolerance of an ogre family near castle roogna they were rare wilderness specimens he always looks for the solution of least ecological damage the dryad looked at him curiously you certainly dont talk like an ogre he blundered into an eye queue vine tandy ex plained it cursed him with smartness how are you able to survive away from your tree the siren asked i thought no hamadryad could leave for more than a moment thats what i thought fireoak said but when death threatened my tree desperation gave me extraordinary strength for my tree i can do what i must i feel terribly insecure however my soul is the tree tandy and smash jumped the analogy was too close for comfort it was no easy thing to be separated from ones soul i know the feeling the siren said i lived all my life in one lake but i suddenly realized that it had become a desolate place for a lone mermaid so i am looking for a better lake but i do miss my original lake for it contains all my lifes experience and i wonder whether it misses me too how will you know the new lake wont be desolate for you too fireoak asked it wont be if it has the right merman in it the dryad blushed her face for an instant showing the color of the fire of her tree oh youre a hundred years oldand you have no experi ence with men tandy asked well im a dryad fireoak said defensively we just dont have much to do with menonly with trees what sort of experience have you had the siren asked tandy a demonheid rather not discuss it it was tan dys turn to blush anyway my father is a man most fathers are the siren said ogre ogre mine isnt smash protested my father is an ogre she ignored that i inherited my legs from my father my tail from my mother she was not a true woman but he was a true man you mean human men really do have uh dealings with mermaids tandy asked human men have dealings with any maid they can catch the siren said with a wry smile i understand my mother wasnt hard to catch my father was a very hand some man but he had to leave when my sister the gorgon was born after a pause fireoak resumed her story so if i can just talk to the king and get him to save my tree every thing will be all right what about the other trees john asked fireoak looked blank other trees the other ones the villagers are cutting down maybe they dont have dryads to speak for them but they dont deserve destruction i never thought of that fireoak said i suppose i should put in a word at castle roogna for them too it would be no bad thing to lobby for the trees they found good locations in the trees and settled down for the night smash spread himself out on the glade ground no one would bother him his head was near the liquidly flowing trunk of a water oak fireoak had chosen he overheard the hamadryads muted sobbing evidently her separation from her beloved home tree was harder on her than she showed by day and the threat to that tree was no distant concern smash hoped he could find a way to help her if he had to he could go and stand guard over her tree himself but he didnt know how long that would take he didnt want to delay his own mission too long lest the time for the good magicians answer should run out there was also the matter of the gourdcoffins lien on his soul anything he had to do he had better get done within three months already he felt not quite up to snuff as if part of his soul had been leached away taking some of his strength with it next day the five of them marched north the land lev eled out but hazards remained tandy blundered into a ogre ogre chokecherry bush and smash had to rip the entire plant out of the ground before its vines stopped choking her far ther along they encountered a power plant whose branches swelled out into strange angular configurations and hummed with power woe betide the creature who blun dered into that around midday they discovered a lovely vegetable tree on whose branches grew cabbages beans carrots tomatoes and turnips all in fine states of ripeness here were all the ingredients for an excellent salad but as smash ap proached it tandy grew nervous i smell a rat she said sniffing the air there are big rats down in the caves where i live i know their odor well they always mean trouble smash sniffed sure enough there was the faint aroma of rats what were they doing here i smell it too john said i hate rats but where are they the siren was walking around the tree somewhere in or near the vegetable tree she announced i fear this plant is not entirely what it appears fireoak approached it let me check im good with trees she was showing no sign of the agony of her separa tion from her tree but smash knew it remained her night in a tree must have restored her somewhat though of course it wasnt her tree the hamadryad stood close to the vegetable tree slowly she touched a leaf this is a normal leaf she said then she touched a potatoand one of its eyes blinked get away from here fireoak screamed its a rat then the fruits and vegetables exploded into action each one sprouted legs tail and snout and dropped to the ground a major swarm of rats had camouflaged itself by masquerading as vegetables luring the unwary into con ctbut the smell had given them away once a rat al ways a rat by the smell of it the siren tandy and john scurried back in time to avoid the first surge of the ratrace but fireoak stood too close the beasties swarmed around her biting at her legs causing her to trip and fall smash leaped across swooping down with one hand to lift the hamadryad clear of the ground several rats came ogre ogre up with her chewing savagely at her barklike skin she screamed and tried to brush them off but they clung tena ciously and bit at her hands smash shook her but hesitated to do it vigorously enough to fling away the rats lest it hurt her as it was bits of bark and leaf were flying off smash had to pinch the rats off one by one and their claws and teeth left scratches on the dryads body by the time the last was gone she was in an awful state oozing sap from several scrapes the swarm of rats surrounded smash and tried to bite his feet and climb his hairy legs smash stomped ferociously shaking the glade and crush ing several rats with each stomp but there were hundreds of the little monsters coming at him from every direction moving rapidly they threatened to get on him no matter how fast he stomped he didnt dare set the dryad down lest the same fate befall her his great strength hardly availed against these relatively puny enemies get away from him tandy screamed from a safe dis tance leave him alone you rats she seemed really an gry it was almost as if she were trying to defend him from the enemy that of course was a ludicrous reversal of their situation yet it touched him oddly smash stomped away from the tree but the rats stayed with him in order to run he would have to do two things move the dryad back and forth as his arms pumped and flee a known danger the one seemed physically hazardous to another person while the other was emotionally distaste ful so he moved slowly stamping while the rats began climbing his legs then tandys arm shot out as if hurling a rock her face was red her teeth bared her body rigid as if she were in a state of absolute furybut there was no rock in her hand she was throwing nothing something exploded at smashs feet he was knocked off them barely catching his balance all around him the rats turned bellyup stunned he stared at the carnage standing still because his legs were numb he set down the hamadryad who stepped daintily over the bodies what happened tandy sounded abashed i threw a tantrum smash left the twitching rats and went to join her his ogre ogre feet felt as if they were nothing but bones with the flesh melted off though this was not the case thats a spell thats bad temper my talent she said eyes downcast when i get mad i throw a tantrum sometimes it does a lot of damage im sorry i should have controlled my emo tion sorry smash said bewildered looking back at the rum of the ratswarm thats a wonderful talent oh sure she replied with irony my mother had a similar talent of course she was a cursefiend they all throw curses maybe i have cursefiend ancestry tandy said sourly my father crombie came from a long line of soldiers and they do get around quite a bit now the others came up you did that tandy fire oak asked you saved me a lot of misery if smash had put me down amidst those awful rats or if they had climbed up him and gotten to me as they were trying to she winced feeling her wounds she was obviously in considerable discomfort thats an extremely useful talent for the jungles of xanth the siren said you really think so tandy asked brightening i al ways understood it wasnt nice to be destructive it isnt smash asked surprised then they all laughed sometimes perhaps it is the siren concluded they found some genuine vegetables for lunch then re sumed the march but soon they heard a ferocious snuf fling and snorting ahead low to the ground oh that might be a dragon with a cold john said worriedly i cant say i really like dragons theyre too hot i will go see smash said he discovered he was rather enjoying this journey violence was a natural part of his na turebut now he had people to protect so there was a certain added justification to it it was more meaningful to bash a dragon to save a collection of pretty little lasses than it was to do it merely for its own sake the eye queue caused him to ponder the meaning of the things he did and so it helped to have at least a little meaning present at such time as he got free of the curse he could forget about these inconvenient considerations ogre ogre he rounded a brushbush and faced the snorting mon ster hamfists at the readyand paused dismayed it was no dragon it was a small oink with a squaredoff snout and a curledup tail but it snorted like a huge fire breathing monster smash sighed he picked up the oink by the tail and tossed it into the brush all clear he called the others appeared its gone tandy asked but we didnt hear any battle it was only a short snort the ogre said disgusted he had so looked forward to a good fight another person might have represented it as the most tremendous of dragons the siren said why to make it seem he had done a most valiant deed why do that smash asked perplexed she smiled obviously you dont suffer from that syn drome i suffer from the eye queue curse cheer up smash tandy said were bound to en counter a real dragon sometime yes the ogre agreed cheering as directed after all the thing to do with disappointments was to rise above them the eye queue told him that speaking of dragons john said there is a story that circulates among fairies about dragons and their parts and ive always wondered whether it was true ive met some dragons smash said whats the story that if a dragons ear is taken off you can listen to it and hear wondrous things smash scratched his head several fleas jumped off startled since his skull no longer heated much when he tried to think the fleas had no natural control i never tried that it must be sort of hard to get a dragons ear tandy remarked i doubt they part with them willingly fireoak considered there are stories the mockingbirds tell to mock the ignorant they would nest in my tree sometimes and talk of marvelous things and i never knew how much to believe one did once mention such a quality of a dragons ear it said the ear would twitch when any ogre ogre thing of interest to the holder was spoken anywhere so one would know to listen but often the news was not pleasant for dragons have ears for bad news and as tandy says dragons ears are very hard for normal people to come by next dragon i slay i will save an ear smash said intrigued they continued north till dusk with only minor adven tures avoiding tangle trees clinging vines and strangler figs scaring off tiger lilies and dogwood and ignoring the trickly illusions spawned by assorted other plants swarms of biting bugs converged but smash blew them away in his usual fashion with selected roars by nightfall the party was close to something significant but smash couldnt re member what they located a forest of black blue and white ash trees whose shedding ashes covered the forest floor any recent footprints showed and because each color of tree spread its ashes at a different hour it was possible to know how recently any creature had passed white prints were the most recent blue prints were older and somehow more in tricate with maplike traceries on them and black prints dated from the night some ashes had been hauled but no dragons or other dangerous creatures had been here in the past few hours amidst this forest was a handsome cottonwood that pro vided cotton for beds for them all i always thought camp ing out would be uncomfortable tandy remarked but this is getting to be fun now if only i knew where i was going you dont know the siren asked surprised good magician humfrey answered my question by telling me to travel with smash tandy said so im trav eling its a pretty good trip and im learning a lot and meeting nice new people but thats not my answer smash is looking for the ancestral ogres but i doubt thats what im looking for i understand the good magician is getting old the si ren said hes pretty old tandy agreed but he knows an aw ful lot and your sister the gorgon is making him young again she would the siren said i am jealous of her power ogre ogre over men in my heyday i used to summon men to my isle but she always took them away and of course they never looked at other women after she was through with them because they had turned to stone smash knew the fact was the gorgon had been as lonely as the siren despite her devastating power the gorgon had been smitten by the first man who could nullify her talent magician hum frey so she had gone to him with a question would i he marry her he had made her serve a year as housemaid and guardian in his castle before giving her his answer he would evidently that was the sort of man it required to capture the heart of the gorgon smash understood that their wedding officiated by prince dor when he was tem porary king had been the most remarkable occasion of the year attended by all the best monsters smashs father crunch had been there and tandys mother jewel by all accounts the marriage was a reasonably happy one consid ering the special nature of its parties i wonder what it is like to be with a man fireoak said in a halfwistful question her injuries of the day had fatigued her greatly perhaps making her depressed evi dently their conversation of the preceding night had re mained on her mind my friends always told me men were difficult to get along with john said a girl cant live with them and she cant live without them well ive tried living without the siren said im ready to try with good and ready at least it shouldnt be dull first pool i find with an available merman watch out poor merman the fairy said oh im sure hell deserve whatever i give him i dont think hell have cause to complain any more than magi dan humfrey has with my sister we draw on similar lore all girls do but it seems terribly original to each inno cent man there was general laughing agreement you speak as if no man is here tandy said sounding faintly aggrieved theres a man here listening to our secrets fireoak cried alarmed smash ogre ogre there was another general titter dont be silly john said hes an ogre cant an ogre also be a man the tittering subsided yes of course dear the siren said reassuringly and a good one too we take smash too much for granted none of us could travel freely here without his formidable protection we ought to thank him instead of imposing on him smash lay still he had not intended to feign sleep but thought it best not to join in this conversation it was inter esting enough without his participation he had not known about this conspiracy of the females of xanth but now he could remember how he had seen it in action when prin cess irene snared prince dor and even when his mother pacified his father it did seem that the distaff knew things that the males did not and used them cleverly to achieve their desires whats a lady ogre like tandy asked one passed my tree once fireoak said she was huge and hairy and had a face like a bowl of overcooked mush someone had sat on i never saw anything so ugly in all my life well she was an ogress the siren said they have different standards of beauty you can bet they know what bullogres like though i suppose an ogre wants a wife who can knock down her own trees for firewoodno offense fireoakand kill her own griffins for stew so he doesnt have to interrupt his dragon hunting for trifles they laughed again and their chatter meandered across other femalish subjects recipes prettifying spells jungle gossip and such until they all drifted off to sleep but the images they had conjured enchanted smashs imagination an ogress who could knock down her own trees and slay her own griffinswhat an ideal mate and a face like squashed mushwhat sheerest beauty how wonderful it would be to encounter such a creature but the only ogress he had met was his motherwho wasnt really an ogress but a cursefiend acting the part she acted very well but when she forgot her makeup her face no longer looked like mush smash had always pre tended not to notice how distressingly fair her face and form became in those unguarded moments so as not to em ogre ogre barrass her the truth was had his mother the actress chosen to pass among females like these smash now traveled with she could have done so without causing alarm and of course as soon as she prepared herself she was the com pleat ogress again as brutish and mean as any ogre could ask for certainly his father crunch loved her and would move mountains for her despite her secret shame of an unogrish origin one of those mountains had been moved to rest near their home so that she could climb it and look out across xanth when the mood took her at last smash slept he still wasnt used to doing so much thinking and it tired him despite the amplification the eye queue provided he had never had to work things out so rationally before or to see the interrelationships among diverse things well one day he would win free of the curse and be a true brute of an ogre again he slept chapter dire strait next morning they came up against the barrier smash had been unable to remember it was a huge crevice in the earth a valley so deep and steep that they shrank back from it it extended east and west there seemed to be no end to it no way around how can we go north tandy asked plaintively this awful cleft is impossible now i remember it smash said it crosses all of xanth down near castle roogna there are magic bridges castle roogna fireoak asked she looked wan as if she had not been eating well though she had been provided with all she wanted smash suspected her absence from her beloved tree was like an ordinary persons need for water she would have to return to it soon or die she was suffer ing from deprivation of soul and would soon become as tandy had been within the gourd if not helped her rat wounds only aggravated the condition hastening the pro cess thats right tandy said brightly if this crack passes near castle roogna you can follow it there your problem is solved yes solved the hamadryad agreed wanly now the siren noticed her condition dear are you well as well as i can be the dryad replied gamely the rest of you must go on across the chasm i will find my own way to castle roogna i think you have been away from your tree too long the siren said you had better return to it to restore your ogre ogre strength before attempting the long trip to castle roogna but there is not time fireoak protested the moon is waning night by night soon the lunatic fringe will sunder and my tree will be exposed yet if you perish on the way to see the king you can do your tree no good the siren pointed out it is indeed a dire strait the dryad agreed sinking to the ground the siren looked at smash where is your tree dear she asked fireoak north of the chasm i had forgotten about but how did you cross a firebird helped me because i am associated with a fireoak but the bird is long gone now i think we must nevertheless cross over soon and return you to your tree the siren said again she looked mean ingfully at smash we will go with you to guard your tree smash said catching on tandy clapped her hands oh how wonderful to think of that smash we can help her smash said nothing the siren had really thought of it but he was amenable they couldnt let fireoak perish from neglectand she surely would otherwise they could certainly guard her tree from harm no one would come near an ogre but first they had to get to the treeand that meant crossing the chasmin a hurry how were they going to do that you chipped steps in the printsofwails mountain tandy suggested but that was slow the siren said it could take sev eral days we must cross today they stared into the chasm baffled there seemed to be no way to cross it rapidlyyet they had to somehow for now all could see how the hamadryad was failing fireoaks surface had turned from lightly corrugated skin to deeply serrated bark from young nymph to old tree trunk her green hair was wilting and the tinge of red was turning black her fire would soon be out there must be a path john said if we just spread out and look surely well find it ogre ogre that was a positive idea they commenced their search for the path there was the sound of galloping hooves from the west the group ran back together and smash faced the sound ready for whatever might come two centaurs appeared moving rapidly one was male the other female centaurs could be good news or bad de pending smash was conscious of his orange jacket and steel gauntlets gifts of the centaurs of centaur isle but knew that there could be rogue centaurs in this wilderness what were these two doing here then smash recognized them chetl chem he ex claimed the two drew up panting a light sheen of sweat on their human and equine portions smash embraced each in turn then turned to make introductions these are friends of mine from the castle roogna region he faced the other way and these are friends of mine from all over xanth smash the filly centaur exclaimed what happened to your rhymes im cursed with intelligence among other things yes i can see the other things chet said contemplat ing the assorted females i never knew you were inter ested we sort of imposed on him tandy said yes smash is imposeable chem agreed she was young so lacked the imposing proportions of her mother the last time smash had seen her she had been playing childrens galloping games in another year or so she would be looking for a mate he wondered why she was not still in centaurschooling as her mother was very strict about education we came here to do the same the same smash asked were traveling north yes chem said good magician humfrey told me where to intercept you you see im doing a thesis on the geography of uncharted xanth completing my education but my folks wont let me travel alone through that region so and so i escorted my little sister this far chet fin ished he was a handsome centaur with noble features a fine coat and excellent muscles on both his human and ogre ogre equine portions but a purple scar marred his left shoulder where a wyvem had once bitten him causing serious ill ness i know shell be safe with you smash youre a big ogre now safe were about to try to cross this gulf smash pro tested and we dont know how oh yes the gap chasm i brought you a rope chet presented a neat coil humfrey said you would need it a rope suddenly their way down into the chasm was clear centaur rope was always strong enough for its pur pose ill help get you down chet said but im not sup posed to go myself i have to return immediately to castle roogna with a message or two whats the message smashs curse of intelligence enabled him to catch on a village is about to cut down a fireoak tree for timber the trees hamadryad will die the king must save the tree ill tell him chet agreed where is it smash turned to fireoak who sat listlessly on the ground where is your tree the hamadryad made a feeble motion with her hand this is no good chet said chem lets use your map the filly walked over to fireoak show me on my pic ture she said an image formed between them it was a contour map of the land of xanth a long peninsula with the gap chasm across its center and the ocean around it show me where the tree is chem repeated fireoak looked slowly orienting on the scene there she said pointing to a region near the northern rim of the gap chem nodded there is a human village there just set ting up thats already on my chart she looked at her brother got it chet got it chem the male centaur replied you always do make the scene smash the moment youre down in the gap ill gallop back and tell the king im sure hell han dle the business about the tree but it will take me a couple days to get there so youll have to protect the tree until ogre ogre then he glanced about was there any other message it seems there should be more than one the people looked around at each other finally tandy said id like to send a greeting to my father crombie if thats all right chet tapped his head making a mental note one greet ing to crombie from daughter got it he looked more carefully at tandy he always bragged he had a cute daughter i see he was correct tandy blushed she hadnt known her father had said that about her they tied the rope to the trunk of a steelwood tree chem insisted on going down first that will prove the rope is safe she explained even smash doesnt weigh more than i do of course she was correct for though her human portion was girlishly slender her equine portion was as solid as a horse she backed down her four hooves bracing against the steep side of the chasm the rope looped once about her small human waist just below her moderate bosom and she used her hands to give herself slack by stages when she got down to where the slope leveled out enough to en able her to stand she released the rope the siren went down next having less trouble because she had so much less mass then tandy followed by the fairy who fluttered her wings to make herself even lighter than she was smash then made a harness out of the end of the rope set fireoak in it and stood on the brink to lower her carefully to chems waiting arms finally smash himself descended merely applying one gauntlet to the rope and sliding rapidly down chet undid the upper end from the steelwood tree and dropped it into the chasm they would need the rope again on the north slope im on my way with one and a half messages chet called and galloped off remember two days the slope continued to level until they stood at the base here grass grew but no trees it was pleasant enough and the north slope was visible a short distance away they walked across studying the rise for the most suitable place to ascend ogre ogre it certainly wasnt good for climbing with a party of girls the ground sloped gently up to a comer from there the cliff went almost straight up a dizzying height beyond the reach of the rope even if there were any place or way to anchor it we must do whatwe started to do before the siren said spread out and look for a suitable place to climb i believe there are paths here and there chem said i dont have them on my map because few people remember the gap chasm it has an enduring forgetspell on it but there has been enough travel in xanth so that people have to have crossed it and not just at the magic bridges a forgetspell the siren said how interesting that accounts for fireoaks forgetting it and im sure smash has been here before too i hope thats the extent of the spell what do you mean tandy asked oh im just a worrier over nothing i dont think so tandy said if theres any danger you should warn us the siren sighed youre right yet if there is danger here its too late for us to avoid it since were already here its only that once i heard something about a big dragon in a chasmand this is a chasm it would be hard to escape a monster here but of course thats farfetched lets look for good hiding places too tandy said just in case just in case john agreed overhearing oh suddenly i dont really like this place so we must try to get out of this chasm as fast as we can smash said though the prospect of danger did not bother him there really had not been much violence on this journey chem trotted east while smash lumbered west since these were the two fastest movers of the group the girl siren and fairy spread out in between they left the ha madryad in the shade of a bush since she was now too weak to walk the cliff face changed sloping at different angles and different heights but smash found nothing that would really help it looked as if he would have to bash out a stairway of sorts tedious as that would be but could he ogre ogre get the party up that way within two days let alone in time to save the hamadryad and her tree there was a commotion to the east chem was galloping back her lovely brown hairmane flinging out tail swish ing nervously dragon dragon she cried breathlessly the sirens concern had been justified ill stop it smash said enthusiastically charging east no its big its the gap dragon now smash remembered the gap dragon ranged the gap chasm trapping and consuming any creatures foolish enough to stray here the forgetspell had deceived him again the monster really profited from that spell since no one remembered the danger but it was coming back to him now this was a formidable menace the siren tandy and john were running west behind them whomped the monster it was long and low with a triple pair of stubby legs its scales were metallic glistening in the sunlight and clouds of steam puffed out of its nos trils its body was the thickness of a goodsized tree trunk but exceedingly limber it moved by elevating one section and whomping it forward then following through with an other because its legs were too short for true running but the clumsyseeming mechanism sufficed for considerable velocity in a moment the gap dragon would overtake the siren smash lumbered to the fray he stood much taller than the dragon but it reached much longer than he thus they did not come together with a satisfying crash the dragon scooted right under smash intent on the nymphlike morsel before it the ogre screeched to a stop literally his calloused hamfeet churning up mounds of rubble he bent forward and grabbed the dragons tail as it slid westward he lifted it up holding it tightly in both hands this would halt the monster alas he had underestimated the dragon the creature whomped onward the tail lost its slackbut such was the mass and impetus of the monster that it wrenched the ogre into a somersault he flipped right over hanging on to that tail and landed with a whomp of his own on his backon the dragons tail but smashs own mass was not inconsiderable the ogre ogre ogre ogre shock of his landing traveled along the body of the dragon in a ripple when the ripple passed a set of legs they were wrenched momentarily off the ground when it arrived at the head the mouth snapped violently the jaws reaching close to the desperately fleeing siren fell short now smash had the gap dragons baleful attention the dragon let out a yowl of discomfort and whipped its head around its tail pinned under the ogre thrashed about so that smash had trouble regaining his feet the dragons neck curved in a sharp utum bonelessly supple the head traveled smoothly back along the length of the body the monster hardly needed its legs for this sort of maneuver in a moment the spreading jaws were at smashs own head ready to take it in the ogre still flat on his back stabbed upward with a gauntleted fist the jaws closed on it but the fist continued inexorably punching past the slurpwet tongue and into the back of the throat the dragons head was so large that smashs whole arm was engulfedbut that strike in the throat caused the monster to gag and the jaws parted again smash recovered his arm before it got chomped the ogre sat up but remained in the midst of the coils of the dragon the two grotesque heads of ogre and dragon faced each other snout to snout smash realized that this time he had gotten himself into an encounter whose out come he could not know the gap dragon was his match delightful for the first time since attaining his full strength smash could test his ultimate but at the moment they were all tangled up in an ineffective configuration unable to fight decisively smash made a face bulging his eyes and stretching his mouth wide open yyrwil he yyrwiled the gap dragon made a face back wrinkling up its snout horrendously and crossing its eyes so far that the pupils exchanged places rrooarw it rrooarwed smash made a worse face swallowing his nose and part of his low forehead ggrummf he ggrummffed the dragon went him one better perhaps two better swallowing its snout up past the ears and partway down its neck ssstth it ssstthed the monster was outdoing him petulantly smash bit j into a rock and spit out a stream of gravel the dragons teeth were pointed so it could not match that instead it hoisted a petard of steam at him the greasy ball of vapor curling the hairs of his face and clogging his nostrils so much for the niceties now the real action com menced smash threw himself into the sheer joy of combat the fundamental delight of every true ogre it had been some time since he had crunched bones in earnest of course this dragon was mostly boneless but the principle remained he punched the dragon in the snoat this sort of punch could put a fistsized hole in an ironwood tree but the dragon merely gave way before the force of it and was only slightly bloodied then the dragon struck back snapping sidewise at smashs arm that sort of bite could lop a mouthful of flesh from a behemoth but the gauntlet ex tended back far enough to catch the edge of the bite and strike sparks from the teeth then smash boxed the dragons right ear with his left fistand the ear squirted right off the skull and flew out of sight the dragon winced that smarted but the monster hardly needed that ear and came back with a blast of steam that cooked the outer layer of the ogres head smashs thick skull stopped the heat from penetrating to the eye queuecorrupted brainmore was the pity he thought so much for the second exchange of amenities smash had had slightly the better of it this time but the fight was only warming up now the pace intensified smash took hold of the dragons upper jaw with one hand the lower jaw with another and slowly forced the two apart the dragon resisted and its jaw muscles were mighty well leveraged and experienced but it could not directly withstand the full brute force of a concentrating ogre slowly the jaws separated the dragon whipped its body about in a moment the sinuous length of it was wrapped about the ogres torso engulfing him anew while smash forced open the jaws the dragon tightened its coils constricting him all this was in slow motion yet it was a race would smash rip the head apart first or would the dragon squeeze the juice out of him the answer was uncertain smash was having trouble breathing he was beginning to lose strength it seemed to him that this should not be hap pening or at least not this fast but the dragons jaws were now quite far apart and should soon break neither ogre nor dragon would give they remained their strength in balance the jaws were on the verge of breaking the torso on the verge of smothering who would succumb first it occurred to smash that he might break open the dragons jaw but be unable to extricate himself from its convulsed coils and smother because he couldnt breathe or the dragon might crush himbut suffer a bro ken jaw in smashs dying effort both could lose this en counter in the good old days before the eye queue vine had fallen on him smash would not have wasted tedious thought on such a thing he would merely have bashed on through to kill andor be killed hardly caring which now he was cursed with the notion of meaning to what point was this violence if neither participant survived it was discomfiting and unogrish but smash found he had to change his tactic this one had little promise of success since it would not free him from the serpents toils he was in a dire strait and bulling ahead would only worsen it he drew the dragons head forward toward his own face the dragon thought this meant smash was weaken ing and went forward eagerly in a moment the dragon believed it could chomp the ogres face off its breath steamed out its woodsmoke fragrance toasting smashs skin he tried to sneeze but was unable to inhale because of the constriction in which he was held sure of victory now the dragon cranked its jaws margin ally closer together and lunged smash deflected the thrust as much as he could and jerked his head to the side the dragons head plunged down as smashs hands let goand the huge wedgeteeth chomped savagely on the uppermost coil this was a device smash had used on the tangle tree with good effect it took the gap dragon a moment to catch on mean while it chewed it surely felt the bite but did not yet realize that this was its own doing or that its teeth had not contacted ogre flesh it took a while for the difference in taste to register the dragon wrenched its supposed prey upward driving the teeth in deeper the coil loosened giv ing smash half a gasp of breath then at last the dragon realized what it was doing its jaws began to open to free itself from its own bite and to emit a honk of sheer pain and frustrationbut smashs two gauntleted hamhands came down on either side of it clasping the snout pressing it firmly closed on the meat the jaw muscles were weaker this way the dragon could not release its bite still the ogre could not use his hands for further attack for the moment he let go the jaws would open it was another position of stalemate blood welled out around the dragons lower fangs and dripped off its chin coating smashs gauntlet the fluid was a deep purple hue thick and gooey smelling of ashes and carrion it probably had caustic properties but the gauntlet protected smashs flesh as it had when he held the basilisk the centaur gifts were serving him well now it was the dragons turn to scheme dragons were not the brightest creatures of xanth but as with ogres their brains were largely in their muscles and they were cunning fighters the dragon knew it could get nowhere unless it freed itself from its own bite and knew that its own coils anchored the ogre in place so that he could put his clamp on that bite by and by it realized that if it released the ogre the ogre would lack anchorage and could then be thrown off so the dragon began laboriously uncoil ing smash held on gasping more deeply as the constriction abated his strategy was getting him freebut it would free the dragon too this fight was a long way from over at last the coils were gone the dragon wrenched its forward section awayand smashs lower hand slipped on the blood coating it and he lost his hold now they faced each other again the dragon with blood ied jaw and little jets of purple goo spurting from the deep fangholes in its body the ogre panting heavily from sore ribs on the surface smash had had the better of this round but inside he doubted it his rib cage was made of ogres bones nevertheless it was hurting something had been bent if not broken he was no longer in top fighting condition the dragon evidently had found the ogre to be stiffer ogre ogre competition than anticipated it made a feint at smash and smash raised a fist then the dragon dived abruptly back as if fleeing suspicious smash pausedthen saw that the dragon was going after fireoak the hamadryad who was still lying helplessly on the ground this was very bad form it suggested that smash was no longer worth noticing as an opponent his temper heated and bent toward the snapping point chem centaur leaped to fireoaks defense intercepting the dragon before smash reoriented she reared her fore hooves flashing in the air striking at the dragons snout but she could not hope to balk such a monster for long the siren and john were running up to help but smash knew they could only get themselves in trouble he grabbed the dragons tail again this time bracing himself firmly against the rocky ground so as not to be flipped over the moving body took up the slack again with a heavy shock that transmitted straight to the ogres braced feet the feet plowed into the ground throwing up wakes of dirt and stones then driving down deeper when the dragon finally halted smash was braced kneedeep at an angle in the ground he was strong but the dragon had mass that mere strength couldnt halt instantly the dragons nose had stopped a short distance from the hamadryad infuriated at this balk the creature turned again lunging at the ogre smash exploded out of the ground kicking dirt in the dragons snoot he reached for the jaws but this time the dragon was wise enough to keep its mouth shut it wanted no more prying open it drove at the ogre with sealed jaws trying to knock him down before taking a bite smash boxed at the head denting the metal scales here and there and rebloodying the smashed earsocket but could do no real damage the dragon weaved and bobbed presenting a tricky target while gathering itself for some devastating strike the ogre looked toward the assembled girls get away from here he bellowed he wanted no more distractions from the main event one of them was sure to get inciden tally gobbled by the dragon from the other side tandy called ive found a ledge ogre ogre its out of reach of the dragon we can use the rope to climb to it while smash destroys the dragon she had boundless confidence in his prowess smash knew he was in the toughest encounter of his life but he could proceed with greater confidence the moment he knew the girls were safe he looked where tandy pointed and saw the ledge about halfway up the steep slope there was a pining tree on it its mournful branches drooping greenly the sad needles hanging down they would be able to loop the rope about the trunk of this tree and haul them selves up to it then the dragon taking advantage of smashs distrac tion leaped at him the ogre ducked throwing up a fist in his standard defensive ploy but the dragons mass bore him down the huge metal claws of the foremost set of feet raked at his belly attempting to dismember him smash had to fall on his back to avoid themand the weight of the dragon landed on him now the stubby legs reached out on either side the claws clutching the earth anchoring the long body smash was pinned he tried to get up but lacked leverage he reached out to grab a leg but the dragon cunningly moved it out of reach meanwhile the sinuous body was moving elsewhere along its line bringing another set of legs to bear these would soon attack the pinned ogre it would be easy for these free claws to spear through his flesh repeatedly and sooner or later they would puncture a vital organ but smash had resources of his own he reached up to embrace the serpentine segment he was just able to com plet the circuit his fingers linking above it now he had his leverage he squeezed ogres were notorious for several things the manner in which their teeth crunched bones into toothpicks the way their fists pulverized rocks and the power of their battle embrace a rockmaple tree would have gasped under the pressure smash now applied so did the gap dragon it let out a steamwhistle of anguish but its body was flexible and compressible when it had been squeezed down to half its original diameter smash could force it no farther without taking a new gripand the moment he released his present one the body would ogre ogre spring out again his compression was not enough the dragon was in pain but still able to function now it was again bringing its other claws into play that would be trouble for the outsides of smashs arms were exposed they could be clawed to pieces he drew on another weaponhis teeth they did not compare with those of the dragon but they were formid able enough in their own fashion he pretended the under belly before him was a huge tasty bone and started in the first chomp netted him only a mouthful of scales he spit them out and bit again this time he reached the underlayer of reptilian skin still pretty tough but no match for an ogres teeth he ripped out a section exposing the muscular layer beneath he sank his teeth into that again the monster whistled with pain it struggled to draw backbut smashs embrace held it firm the com pression made it worse the ogres teeth could take in twice as much actual flesh with each bite the dragons claws ripped out of the ground it humped its midsection lifting smash into the air the huge head swung around blasting forth steam now the ogre had to let go for the back of his neck could not withstand much steamcooking he dropped off spitting out a muscle it would have been nice to chew the thing up and swallow it but he needed his teeth clear for business not pleasure the dragon was doubly bloodied now yet still full of fight it snorted a voluminous and slightly bloodflecked cloud of steam charged smashand sheered off at the last moment leaving the ogre smiting air with his fists the serpentine torso whizzed by faster and faster until the tail struck with a hard crack against smashs chest it was quite a smack smash was rocked back but his orange centaur jacket was made to protect him from physi cal attack and it withstood the lash of the sharp tail other wise smash could have been badly gashed or even cut in half the tail at its extremity was long and thin like a whip with edges like a feathered blade smash wanted no more of that he spied a boulder half buried in the ground he ripped it from its mooring and hurled it at the dragon the dragon dodged but smash threw another and a third eventually he was bound to score and the dragon knew it ogre ogre the dragon ducked behind a small ridge of rock and disappeared smash lobbed a boulder at it without effect cautiously he moved up and peered behind the ridgeand found nothing the dragon was gone he bent to study the ground ahthere was a hole slanting downa tunnel the diameter of the dragon the monster had fled underground he dislodged a larger boulder and rolled it to cover the hole that would seal in the dragon at least until tandy and the others could vacate the gap chasm it was too bad he hadnt been able to finish the fight but it had been an excellent one and such ironies did occur in the wilds of xanth then two sets of claws came down from behind him the dragon had emerged from another hole and ambushed him from the rear that was what came of getting careless in the enemys home territory smash tried to turn but the claws landed on his shoulder and hauled him backward to the opening jaws this time he could not attack those jaws with his hands he could not reach them he was abruptly doomed tandy appeared beside the boulder look out smash she cried unnecessarily get away from here smash shouted as he felt the dragons steam on the back of his neck but tandys face was all twisted up in terror or horror or anger her eyes were squeezed almost shut and her body was stiff she paid no attention to him then her arm moved as she threw something invisible smash realizing her intent almost too late dropped to his knees though the talons dug cruelly into his shoulder the tantrum brushed over his head making his fur stand on end the dragon caught the full brunt of it in the snoot and froze in place half a jet of steam stuck in one nostril smash turned and stood the gap dragons eyes were glazed the monster had been stunned by the tantrum quick run tandy cried it wont hold that dragon long run that was hardly the way of an ogre you run i shall bind the dragon no ogre ogre you lunkhead she protested nothing will hold it long smash picked up the dragons whiplike tail he threaded the tip of it into the smashruined ear through the head and out the other ear drawing a length of it through then he used a finger to poke a hole in the boulder and a sec ond hole angling in to meet the first inside the stone he passed the tail tip in one hole and out the other exactly as if this were another dragonhead then he fashioned an ogre hangknot and tied the tail to itself now ill go he said satisfied they walked to the cliff face behind them the gap dragon revived it shook its head to clear itself of confu sionand discovered it was tied it tried to draw back and the tail pulled taut against the boulder a little puzzle for the dragon smash explained pri vately he was nettled because he had had to have help to nullify the monster that was not an ogres way but the infernal common sense foisted on him by the eye queue reminded him that without an ogre the girls would have very little chance to survive and the hamadryads tree would be cut down so he beat down his stupid pride and proceeded to the next challenge chem john fireoak and the siren rested on the ledge the rope dangled down carelessly all right girls its over tandy called ready for us to come up no one answered it was as if they were asleep hey wake up tandy cried irritated we have to be on our way and theres a long climb ahead the siren stirred what does it matter she asked dole fully smash and tandy exchanged glances one cute girl glance for one brute ogre glance what was this are you all right siren smash called the siren got to her feet standing precariously near the edge of the ledge im so sad she said wiping a tear life has no joy no joy tandy asked bewildered smash tied the dragon we can go on now thats wonderful thats nothing the siren said i will end it all and she stepped off the ledge ogre ogre tandy screamed smash leaped to catch the siren for tunately she was coming right toward him all he had to do was intercept her fall and swing her about and set her safely on her feet she tried to kill herself tandy cried appalled something was definitely wrong smash looked up at the pining tree the other three sat drooping like the tree it self then he caught on the pining tree it makes people pine oh no tandy lamented theyve been there too long getting sadder and sadder now theyre suicidal we must get them down from there smash said the siren stirred oh myi was so sad you were near the pining tree tandy informed her we didnt realize what it did the siren mopped up her tearstained face so that was it thats a crying shame ill climb up and carry them down smash said then youll get sad tandy said we dont need a sui cidal ogre failing on our heads it does take a while for full effect the siren said the longer i sat the sadder i got it didnt strike all at once thats our answer tandy said ill go up and push people off the ledge and smash can catch them quickly before i get too sad myself what about chem the siren asked shes too heavy for smash to catch safely well have to lower her on the rope they decided to try it tandy climbed the rope picked up the weeping john and threw her down smash caught the fairy with one hand avoiding contact with her delicate wings then tandy pushed fireoak on the ledge finally she tied the end of the rope about the centaurs waist passed the rope behind the tree and forced her to back down while smash played out the other end of the rope gradually it was slow but it worked except for one thing tandy remained beside the tree since the rope was now taken up by the centaur and the tree was getting to her she wandered precariously near the edge her tears flowing then she stepped off ogre ogre if smash moved to catch her he would let chem fall if he did not he figured it out physically before solving it mentally he held the rope in his right hand while jumping and reach ing out with his left hand he caught tandy by her small waist and drew her in to his furry body without letting chem slip tandy buried her face in his pelt and cried with aban don he knew it was only the effect of the pining tree but he felt sorry for her misery all he could do was hold her that was a nice maneuver smash the siren said coming up to take the girl from his arm i couldnt let her fall he said gruffly of course you couldnt but the siren seemed thought ful it was as if she understood something he didnt now they were all down and safebut unfortunately at the bottom of the gap chasm the gap dragon was still twitching trying to discover a way to free itself without pulling out either its brains or its tail which was more important wasnt clear john revived oh my that was awful she exclaimed now i feel so much better i could just fly and she took off flying in a loop well she can get out of the chasm the siren said smash looked at the fairy and at the dragon and at the pining tree there was a small ironwood tree splitting the difference between the pining tree and the top of the cliff wall he had an idea john can you fly to the top of the chasm carrying the rope the fairy looked at the rope way too heavy for me could you catch it and hold it if i hurl the end up to you she inspected it again maybe if i had something to anchor me she said doubtfully im not very strong that ironwood tree i could try smash tied an end of the rope to a rock then hurled the rock up past the ironwood tree john flew up and held the rope at the tree now smash walked over to the gap dragon which was still trying to free itself from the boul der without hurting its head or its tail in the process smash knocked it on the head with a fist and it quieted ogre ogre down the dragon was no longer in fighting condition and couldnt roll with the punch smash untied the tail disconnected it from the boulder unthreaded the head and tied the tip of the tail to the nether end of the rope then he dragged the inert dragon to the base of the chasm wall and placed its tail so that it reached well up toward the top now drop that stone he called the fairy did so the rock pulled the slack rope up and around the ironwood trunk when it began to draw on the dragons tail the weight of the rope wasnt enough the fairy flew down and sat on the rock adding weight and it dropped down farther finally smash was able to jump and catch hold of it john flew back to the ground while smash hauled the dragon up by the tail but soon the weight was too much instead of hauling the dragon up smash found himself dangling this was a matter of mass not strength we can solve that chem said shaking off her re maining melancholy she had received a worse dose of pin ing than the others perhaps because of her size and be cause she had been closest to the tree use the boulder for ballast smash rolled the boulder over he hooked a toe in the hole he had punched in it then drew on the rope again this anchorage enabled him to drag the dragon farther up the slope when it got to the point where both ogre and boulder were dangling in the air chem added her consid erable weight to the effort by balancing on the boulder and clinging to smash ill bet youve never been hugged like this before she remarked smash pondered that while he hauled on the rope trying to get the dragon up actually he had embraced his friend chet her older brother and amolde the archivist the middleaged centaur who was now in charge of liaisons with mundania but those had been males and his recent company had attuned him somewhat more to the differ ence of females chem was not of his species of course but she was clinging to him with extraordinary constriction because it was hard for her human arms to support her equine body she was pleasant to be close to her present hug was almost like that of an ogress ogre ogre all these girls were pleasant to be close to he realized as the eye queue curse enabled him to think the matter through each had her separate female fashion sort of rounded and soft structured for holding but it seemed best not to let them know that he noticed they allowed themselves to get close to him only because they regarded him as a woolly monster who had no perception of their nonedible attributes he hauled on the rope bringing the dragon up another notch now smash was approaching the limit of his strength for the dragon was a heavy monster and there was a long way to haul when the job got near the end ogre boulder and centaur were all getting light any more and they would be swinging in the air but at last it was done now the gap dragon was sus pended by its tail from the ironwood tree its snout just touching the level ground at the base of the chasm smash climbed the rope to the tree caught the trailing tip of the dragons tail and knotted it about the tree then clinging to the tree he untied the rope and flung it upward over the tip of the cliff he had had the foresight to leave chem and the boulder anchoring the rope at ground level before doing this john flew up and caught the rope she dragged the end to a tree beyond the chasm and tied it firmly with a fairy knot smash climbed the rest of the way up and stood at last on the northern side of the gap chasm now they had their escape route climb the dragon climb the rope he called down his voice echoboomed back and forth across the chasm but finally settled down to the bottom where they could hear it tandy came up placing her feet carefully against the dragons metal scales which tended to fold outward be cause of its inverted position making the footing better the siren followed not quite as agile chem and fireoak were more of a problem the centaur had let herself down readily enough but lacked the muscle either to climb the dragon vertically or to haul herself up along the rope to the top and the hamadryad was too weak even to make the attempt smash could handle that he slid down the rope and ogre ogre dragon picked up the dryad and carried her to the top then he returned for the centaur he had her hold on to him again circling her arms about his waist while he hauled himself up by hands and feet progress was slow for her hooves could not grip the dragons scales comfort ably but eventually they made it to the ironwood tree at this point the nature of the problem changed the rope went straight up to the overhanging lip and smash doubted chem could hold on to him while he climbed that also he was tiring and might be unable to haul himself and her up using only his arms so he parked her wedged between the ironwood trunk and the cliff while he rested and considered but he was not provided much time for either the gap dragon quiescent until now stirred it was a tough ani mal and even a punch in the head by the fist of an ogre could not put it to sleep indefinitely it twisted about trying to discover what was happening i think you had better climb back up your rope now chem said tie the end about your waist i will draw you up from above i will make a harness she decided she looped the rope around her body in various places this way i can defend myself smash clambered up the taut rope while the dragon thrashed about with increasing vigor as smash crossed the cliff lip he saw the dragons head mining back up along its body toward the centaur filly that could certainly be trouble atop the cliff smash took hold of the rope and drew it up the weight was great but the rope was magically strong he had to brace carefully lest he be pulled back over the cliff again he was reminded that strength alone was not sufficient anchorage was at times more impor tant he solved the problem by looping the rope about his own waist so that he could not be drawn away from the tree and could exert his full force john was hovering near the lip that dragon has spot ted chem she announced with alarm its reaching up i dont know whether it can smash kept on hauling he could go only so fast since ogre ogre he had to take a fresh grip each time and tense for the renewed effort he hated to admit it even to himself but he was tiring more rapidly what had become of his ogre endurance yes the dragon can reach her john reported its lunging snapping shes fending it off neatly with her hooves but shes swinging around without much leverage she cant really hurt it its trying againyoud better lift her up higher smash smash was trying but now his best efforts yielded only small slow gains his giant ogre muscles were solidifying with fatigue now the dragon is trying to climb its own tail to get higher so it can chomp the rope apart or something the fairy said this time she wont be able to stop it pull her up quickly but try as he might smash could not the rope began to slip through his exhausted hands the siren leaped up i have a knife she cried ill go down and cut off the dragons tail so it wib drop to the bottom of the chasm out of reach no tandy protested youll have no way to get up again ill do it john said quickgive me the knife the siren gave her the knife the fairy dropped out of sight beyond the ledge smash tried to rouse himself to re sume hauling on the rope but his body was frozen into a deathlike rigor he could only listen the siren lay on the bank her head over the cliff look ing down the dragons head is almost there she re ported john is down near the tree shes afraid of that monster i can tell by the way she skirts it but shes ap proaching the tied tail now shes sawing on it with the knife shes not very strong and those scales are tough the dragon doesnt see her its orienting on chem oops now it sees john that knife is beginning to hurt it as she digs through the scales its slow work the dragon is turn ing its head about opening its jaws chem is slipping down farther shes kicking at the dragons neck with her fore feet trying to distract it now shes throwing dirt at it from the chasm wall john is still sawing at the tail i think shes r ogre ogre down to real flesh now the dragon is really angry its blasting out steamoh she paused horrified what happened tandy demanded her face pale with strain the steamjohn the siren took a ragged breath the steam shriveled her wings both of them theyre just tatters johns clinging to the tree trunk still sawing at the tail what awful courage she has she must be in excruciat ing pain the fairy had lost her newly recovered wings and was suffering terriblybecause of smashs failure in an agony of remorse he forced strength through his frozen muscles and hauled again on the rope now it came up its burden seeming lighter and soon the centaur was over the lip of the chasm and scrambling to safety but what of john there goes the dragon the siren cried she did it she cut through the tail theres dragon blood all over her and shes lost the knife but the dragons bouncing down the slope in a cloud of dust and steam now the monsters rolling at the base its galumphing away what of john tandy cried shes sitting there by the ironwood tree her eyes are closed i dont think she quite comprehends what has hap pened her wings tandy was fashioning the rope into a smaller harness lower this to her well draw her up smash merely stood where he was listening his brief surge of strength had been exhausted now he could do nothing he felt ashamed for his weakness and the horrible consequence of it but had no further resource john had thought she would be safe in the company of an ogre chem drew the fairy up smash saw john huddled in the harness her oncelovely wings with the blossoming flower patterns were now melted amorphous husks useless for flying would they ever grow back it seemed unlikely well we crossed the chasm tandy said she was not happy none of them was one of their number had lost her invaluable wings another was too wasted to stand and smash was too tired to move if this was typical of the hazards they faced traversing central xanth how would they ever make it the rest of the way ogre ogre well now a new voice declared smash turned his head dully to view the speaker it was a gnarled ugly goblinat the head of a fairsized troop of goblins goblins hated people of any type the strait had become yet more dire chapter lunatic fringe if you fight well shove you all over the brink without your rope the goblin leader said he was a stunted black creature about johns height with a huge head hands and feet his short limbs seemed twisted as if the bones had been broken and reset many times and his face was similarly uneven with one eye squinting the other round the nose bulbous and the mouth crooked by goblin standards he was handsome the goblins spread out to surround the party they peered at the ogre centaur hamadryad fairy siren and girl as if all were supreme curiosities you crossed the gap the leader asked tandy took it upon herself to answer what right have you to question us i know your kind from the caves you dont have any useful business with civilized folk the leader considered her whom do you know in the caves girlthing everybody who is anybody she retorted the de mons the diggleworm the brain coral the leader seemed fazed who are you i am tandy daughter of crombie the soldier and jewel the nymph you know who sets out those black opals you goblins steal to give to your goblin girls my mother thats who without her there wouldnt be any gems of any kind to find anywhere there was a muttering commotion you have adequate connections the goblin leader grudged very well we wont eat you you may go girlthing what of my friends tandy asked suspiciously ogre ogre they have no such connections their mothers dont plant gems in the rocks well cook them tonight oh no you wont my friends go with me if thats the way you want it the goblin said indiffer ently thats the way i want it come this way then youll all go in the pot together thats not what i meant tandy cried it isnt the goblin seemed surprised you said you wanted to be with your friends but not in the pot the goblin shook his head in confusion females change their minds a lot exactly what do you want i want us all to continue our trip north through xanth tandy said enunciating clearly i cant do it alone i dont know anything about surface xanth i need the ogre to pro tect me if he werent worn out from fighting the gap dragon and hauling us all up out of the gap hed be cramming all of you into the pot nonsense ogres dont use pots tandy huffed herself up into the resemblance of a tan trum but before she completed the process a goblin lieu tenant sidled up to whisper in the leaders ear the leader nodded maybe so he agreed he turned back to tandy you are five females guarded by the tired ogre yes tandy agreed guardedly how many others has he eaten none tandy responded indignantly he doesnt eat friends he cant be much of an ogre then he beat up the gap dragon the goblin considered there is that he came to a decision my name is gorbage goblin i control this sec tion of the rim but i have a daughter and we are exoga mous what tandy asked bewildered exogamous twit girls must marry outside their home tribes but there is no contiguous goblin tribe we are apart from the main nation of goblins the dragons extended their territory recently cutting us off he scowled the other goblins keep forgetting us the slugbrains i dont irnnw whv ogre ogre smash knew why it was the forgetspell laid on the gap chasm these goblins lived too close to it so suffered a peripheral effect so my daughter goldy goblin must cross to another tribe gorbage grumbled but travel beyond our territory is now hazardous to the health she needs a guard tandys face lighted with eventual comprehension you want us to take your daughter with us to the next goblin tribe north of here beyond the dragons in the midst of the five forbidden regions near the firewall yes five forbidden regions firewall smash wondered about that it didnt sound like the sort of territory to take five or six delicate girls through you will let us go if we do that tandy asked you and the ogre tandys face set she was a very stubborn girl at times all of us the goblin leader wavered thats a lot to ask we havent had fresh meat in several days i dont care if you never have fresh meat again the girl flared you can cook up zombies if you get hungry i want all my friends its only one daughter youre taking north after all remember the feminine wiles the siren murmured tandy considered the ogre cant do all the guarding she said reasonably when he fights off a big dragon or a tangle tree or something he gets tired then he has to rest and someone else stands guard like the centaur if we cross a lake the siren scouts it out first we never know whose skill will be useful she paused then with an effort turned on extra charm it you really want your daughter to travel safely gorbage capitulated with bad grace oh very well all of you go its a bad deal for me but goldy will slaughter me if i dont get her matched soon shes a cussheaded lass like all her kind smash was amazed tandy had with a little timely ad vice from the siren talked them out of disaster and gotten them all free passage through goblininfested territory al ready his own strength was filtering back all he needed ogre ogre was a little rest but there was no longer any need for vio lence goldy goblin turned out to be a petite amazingly pretty lass the goblin females were as lovely as the goblin males were ugly thank you so much for taking me she said politely is there anything i can do in return tandy had the grace to take this seriously we have to stop by a fireoak tree in this vicinity if you could show us the best route to it certainly theres only one fireoak hereabouts with a resident hamadryad nymph goldy paused spying fire oak isnt that she yes shes trying to save her tree we must get her back to it as soon as possible i know the way but the path to it goes by a hypno gourd patch so you have to be careful i dont want to go near the gourds tandy cried horri fied but smash remembered his contact with the coffin in side the other gourd was it possible that i want a gourd he said the siren was perplexed why would you want a terri ble thing like that something i may have forgotten in there the siren frowned but dropped the subject they trekked on smash carrying the hamadryad he tried not to show it but his strength had returned only par tially fireoak was light the kind of burden he could nor mally balance on his little finger without effort but now he had to control his breathing lest he pant so loudly he call attention to himself he would be no help at all if they happened on another dragon maybe he just needed a good meal and a nights sleep yet it had never before taken him so long to recover from exertion he suspected something was wrong but he didnt know what they came to the region of hypnogourds the vines sprawled abundantly and gourds were all about smash stared at them half mesmerized he had thought his soul lost when the siren smashed the other gourdbut was it possible that the gourd had been a mere window on the otherworld reality his eye queue was crazy enough to ogre ogre think this was so could he use another gourd to return to that world and fight for his soul he felt small hands on his arm what is it smash tandy asked im deathly afraid of those things but you seem fascinated whats with you and those awful gourds he answered not fully conscious of his situation i must go fight the night stallion a dark horse the ruler of the nightmares he has a lien on my soul oh no is that how you rescued my soul smash snapped out of it he hadnt meant to say any thing about the lien to tandy im gibbering ignore it so thats why you wanted another gourd the siren said you had unfinished business there i didnt realize now the goblin girl approached the ogres been into a gourd ive seen that happen before some people escape unscathed some lose their souls some get only halfway free we lost a lot of goblins before we caught on now we use those gourds as punishment thieves are set at a peep hole for an hour they usually escape with a bad scare and never thieve again murderers are set there for a day they often lose their souls it varies some people are cleverer than others and some luckier the lien is like a delayed sentence a month or two and its all over a lien the siren said how long for you smash three months he replied glumly and you said nothing she cried indignantly what kind of a creature are you but she answered herself im mediately a selfsacrificing one smash you should have told us yes tandy agreed faintly i never realized how can a person nullify such a lien the siren asked getting practical he has to go back in and fight goldy said if he doesnt he just gets weaker bit by bit as the stallion calls in the soul its too late to fight once the lien is due he has to do it early while he has most of his strength but a person can redeem himself if he goes in early the siren asked sometimes the goblin girl said maybe one out of ten one of our old goblins is supposed to have done it a ogre ogre long time ago in his youth were not sure we believe him he mumbles about trials of fear and pain and pride and suchlike making no sense at all but it is theoretically pos sible to win so thats why smash has gotten so weak the siren said he was using his strength as if he had plenty to spare but he has an illness of the soul i know about that fireoak breathed i didnt know tandy said clouding up oh its all my fault i never would have taken my soul back if i didnt know either the siren said calming her but i should have suspected maybe i did suspect i just didnt pursue the thought fast enough i forgot that smash is no longer a simpleminded ogre he has the devious eye queue contamination making him react more like human folk the curse of human intellect replacing the primeval beastly innocence tandy agreed i too should have re alized tandy weve got to help smash destroy that lien yes tandy agreed emphatically we cant leave him to the law of the lien smash almost smiled despite the seriousness of the situa tion during his travels with prince dor he had encoun tered the law of the loin was this related ill help goldy said the siren frowned what is your interest your tribe was going to eat us all how can i get to another goblin tribe if i dont have a strong ogre to clear the way i do know a little bit about the matter i suppose you do have a practical interest the siren agreed we all need the ogre until we find our own indi vidual situations what do you know about the gourds that might help our people have reported details of the gourd geogra phy its the same for every gourd theyre all identical inside but each person enters at a different place and its possible to get lost so it is best to carry a line of string to mark the way but a person is out the moment his contact with the peephole is broken how can he get lost ogre ogre its not that sort of lost goldy said theres a lot of territory in there and some pretty strange effects some talk of graves others of mirrors a person always returns to the spot he left and the time he left no matter how long hes been away from it a break in the sequence is only an interruption not a change if hes lost in gourdland hes still lost when he returns there even if hes been a long time out of his gourd he doesnt know where hes going because he doesnt know where hes been but if he strings the string itll mark where hes been and hell know the moment he crosses his trail and thats the secret smash was getting quite interested he had been out of his gourd for some time but apparently could still return what secret the night stallion is always in the last place a person looks in the gourd the goblin girl explained so all you have to do to reach him is always look in a new place never in a place youve been before thats a waste of time and effort you are apt to get caught in an endless loop and then you are really lost you may never find him if you rehash your old route you do know something about it tandy agreed but suppose smash threads the maze finds the night stal lionand is too weak to fight him oh its not that sort of strength he needs the goblin girl said weve had physically strong goblins go in and physically weak ones and the weak ones do just as well all kinds lose in the gourd physical strength may even be a liability destroying the facilities does not destroy the commitment only defeating the stallion does that on the stallions own terms what are the stallions terms goldy shrugged no one knows our one surviving gob lin refuses to tell assuming he knows he just sort of turns a little grayer i think there is no way to find out except to face the creature i think we have enough to go on tandy said lets take a gourd along we have to get to the fireoak tree be fore the lunaticfringespell gives out she went to harvest a gourd her concern for smash overriding her fear of the thing ogre ogre ogre ogre i think the peephole is a lunatic fringe the siren mut tered they moved on smash pondered what the goblin girl had said if physical strength was not important in the struggle with the night stallion why was it important to join this contest early before weakness progressed too far was that a contradiction or merely a confusion he con cluded that it was the latter there was weakness of the body and of the spirit both might fade together but they were not identical smash was physically weak now be cause he had overextended himself otherwise it should have taken him three months to fade his soul had proba bly suffered relatively little so far but if he waited till the end of the lien term to meet the stallion then his soul would be weak and he would lose the nonphysical contest yes that seemed to make sensethings didnt have to make sense with magic but it helped they arrived at a pleasant glade within it was a crazy sort of shimmer that made smash feel a little crazy himself he turned his eyes away my tree the hamadryad cried suddenly reviving smash set her down where there behind the lunatic fringe she seemed to grow stronger instant by instant and in a moment pranced into the glade her body wavered and vanished i guess the spell is still holding tandy said she fol lowed fireoak carrying the gourd and disappeared simi larly the others went the same route when smash contacted the fringe he felt a momentary surge of dizziness then he was through there before him was the tree a mediumlarge fireoak its leaves blazing in the late afternoon sunlight the hamadryad was hugging its trunk in ecstasy her body almost indistinguishable from it and her color was returning she had rejoined her soul the tree too seemed to be glowing and leaves that had been wilting were now forging back into health evidently it had missed her also there was something very touching about the love of nymph and tree for each other tandy approached him her blue eyes soulful smash if i had known she choked up she shoved the gourd at him well let you go into it until the lunatic fringe fades and the people attack this tree the siren said maybe youll have time to conquer the night stallion and regain your full strength she produced a ball of string that the ha madryad must have had stored in her tree use this so you wont get lost in there but first eat something chem said bringing an arm ful of fruits and get a nights sleep no i want to settle this now smash said oh please do at least eat something tandy pleaded you can eat a lot in a hurry true wordsand he was hungry ogres were usually hungry so he crammed a bushel of whole fruits into his mouth and gulped them down ogrefashion and drank a long pull of water from the spring at the base of the tree as the sun dropped down behind the forest singeing the distant tips of trees smash took leave of the six females as if setting out on a long and hazardous trek then he settled down against the trunk of the tree put the gourd in his lap and applied his right eye to the peephole instantly he was back in the gourd world he stood be fore the crypt having just gotten up from his snooze tandy was not there for a moment he had feared that she would be locked into this adventure with him since she had been here before but of course she was free now a chill wind cut around the stonework ruffling his fur the landscape was bleak all gravestones and dying weeds and dismal dark sky beautiful he exclaimed i would like to stay here forever then his eye queue in its annoying fashion forced him to amend his statement mentally he would like to stay here forever after he rescued his soul from the lien and regained his full strength and saved the hamadryads tree and had gotten tandy and all the others to wherever they were going and found his answer from the good magi cian after these details then this paradise of the gourd would be a nice retirement spot he had been afraid he would find himself somewhere else and be unable after all to pursue his quest to its close despite what the goblin girl had said this was a different gourd and might not know where his adventure in the last ogre ogre gourd had ended now he was reassured and confident that he could locate the night stallion and abate the lien after all he was an ogre wasnt he he held his ball of string since he had willed it to ac company him but again he had forgotten to bring his gauntlets or orange jacket he backtracked to the back of the haunted house and anchored one end of the string to a post then crossed the graveyard to the far gate letting the string unravel behind it was a goodsized ball so he was confident he would have plenty to mark his way a skeleton came out to see what was going on smash made a horrendous face at it and the thing fled so fast its bones rattled yes the bonefolk remembered him here beyond the gate was a broad bleak open plain illumi nated by ghastly pale white moonlight black ugly clouds scudded horrendously across the dismal sky forming dark pictureshapes that resembled trolls goblins and ogres naturally the other creatures were fleeing before the ogre shapes smash was delighted this was an even better scene than the last whoever had set up this gourd world had had ogre tastes in mind where should he go now it was not his purpose to dally amidst the delights of the terrain but to locate the night stallion yet he knew that he would have to cover a lot of territory before he reached the last place to look so he had better move rapidly anywhere getting the ground covered he tromped forth straight across the beautifully barren plain the cracked ground shuddered pleasantly under the impact of his feet he was regaining his strength yet now he knew thanks to the goblin girl that physical strength was not necessarily what it took to prevail here he had used it to cow the voice in the coffin forcing it to release tandys soulbut had suffered the compromise of his own soul probably the coffin had given him nothing that had not already been allocated he had fooled himself thinking an ogres power would scare the dead the curse of the eye queue was making him see uncomfortable truths yet perhaps he should not take this revelation on faith either he could go back and rattle the coffin some more and determine just how much it feared his violence after all the skeletons now fled from him nothat was a temptation to be avoided for it would cause him to back ogre ogre track his own trail the one thing he needed to avoid doing smash continued resolutely forward black dots appeared on the bleak horizon quickly they expanded racing toward him on beating hooves the night mares this was where they stayed by dayhere where night was eternal the mares were handsome animals absolutely black with flaring manes flying tails and darkly glowing eyes their limbs were sleekly muscular and they moved with the velocity of thought in moments they surrounded him galloping around him in a circle squealing wamingly they did not want him going the way he was going but since the night stallion did not seem to be among them he had to proceed smash ignored their warning he tromped onwardand their circle stayed with him despite his speed experimen tally he dodged to one side and the circle remained cen tered on him he leaped and the circle leaped with him just as he had thought these were magical creatures ori enting magically the feet of a dreamhorse had no essential connection with the ground prince dor had once men tioned escaping the nightmares by sleeping on a cloud be yond their reach but probably prince dor had not had any bad dreams scheduled that night the mares could go any where and smash could not escape their circle by running not that he wantd to he liked these fine healthy ani mals they were an ogres type of creature he remem bered how one of them had given tandy a ride to the good magicians castlewhich had perhaps been a better desti nation for her than the one she had sought the good magi cian had provided tandy a home for a year and a solution to her problemmaybe her father crombie the soldier at castle roogna might not have been much help smash knew the man casually crombie was getting old no longer the fighter he used to be he was also a woman hater who might not have taken his daughters problem seriously but if he had taken it seriouslywhat could he have done without leaving his post at castle roogna and the nightmaresone had helped tandy travel but then had put in for a lien on her soul causing her awful grief some help that had been maybe these nightmares needed to feel the weight of an ogres displeasure ogre ogre still he did not know enough to act what was tandys problem that the magician had answered she had never quite said did it relate to that nightmare lien on her soul but she had incurred that lien in order to reach the good magician that hardly seemed profitable also she had not been aware of the lien so she would not have put a ques tion about it how would traveling with an ogre abate her problem had it been the magicians intent that smash redeem that girls lost soul with his own that was possiblebut his understanding of the magicians mode of operations argued against it humfrey did not need to fool people about the nature of their payments for their answers he should not pretend the service was merely protection duty when in fact it was soul substitution so that too remained an enigma so far tandy had recruited fellow travelers with aban don and now there were six females in the party that was probably as unlikely a group as existed at the moment in xanth normally such maidens fled ogres and for good reasonogres consumed such morsels were it not for smashs commitment not to indulge his natural appetites because of the service he owed the good magician he shook his head flinging loose a few angry fleas no he could not be sure of his motive there his father crunch was a vegetarian ogre married to a female of human deri vation so smash had been raised in an atypical ogre home his folks had been permitted to associate with the people of castle roogna as long as they honored human customs smash himself had not operated under the restriction of oath or of human tastebut had always known he would be banished from human company if he ever reverted to the wild state anyone who made trouble for king trent ran the risk of being transformed to a toad or a stinkbug for trent was the great transformer it had been easy to conform so smash had not actually crunched many hu man bones and had carried away no delicious human maidens perhaps he had been missing something vital but he remained unwilling to gamble that one good meal would be more satisfying than the human friendships he had maintained so perhaps it was more than the good magicians service that protected tandy and the others ogre ogre ogres werent supposed to need companionship but the curse of the eye queue showed him that he was to that extent atypical of his kind like the siren he now knew he would be lonely alone smash suddenly realized that the ring of mares was only half the diameter it had been while he tromped forward thinking his slew of unogrish thoughts they had been con stricting their loop soon they would be almost within reach of him and if they closed on him all the waywhat then mere horses could hardly hurt an ogre each weighed about as much as he did but they were only mares with the foreparts of sea horses and the rear parts of centaurs they were basically pretty and gentle true their ears were flat back against their skulls and their manes flared like dangerous spikes their tails flicked like weapons their teeth showed white in the moonlight and their eyes stared slantwise at him as if he were prey instead of monsterbut he knew he could throw any of them far out across the plain if he chose when he had his normal ogre strength why should they want to come within his reach in a moment he had the answer these were standard nightmares used to carry bad dreams to their proper dream ers they had not been cursed with the eye queue they had no superequine intelligence they were giving him the standard treatment crowding him trying to scare him smash burst out laughing imagine anything scaring an ogre the mares broke ranks startled this was not s p the victim was not supposed to laugh what was wrong smash was sorry i didnt mean to mess up your act mares he said apologetically circle me again and ill pretend to be frightened i dont want you to get in trouble with your stallion in fact id like to meet him myself i dont suppose you could take me to him still the mares milled about their formation was in a shambles they were not here to play a game but to ter rify since that had failed they had other business to at tend to after all night had been drawing nigh when he entered the gourd the group began breaking up probably they would be all over xanth within the next hour bearing their burdensome dreams ogre ogre ogre ogre wait smash cried which of you gave tandy a ride one mare hesitated as if trying to remember a year ago smash said a small human girl brown hair throws tantrums the black ears perked forward the mare remembered she sends her thanks smash said you really helped her the mare nickered seeming interested did these crea tures really care about the welfare of those on whom they visited the bad dreams yet his eye queue warned him that it was not safe to judge any creature by his or her job some ogres did not crunch bones some mares might not hate girls did you mean to destroy her he asked by taking a lien on her soul the mares head lifted back nostrils flaring you didnt know smash asked when she wandered into the gourd the coffincreep stole her soul on the pre text she owed it for the ride the mare snorted she hadnt known that made smash feel better life was a jungle inside the gourd as well as in xanth with creatures and things grasping whatever they could get from the unwary but some were innocent she might visit here again he continued you might see her following my string he pointed to the line he had laid out behind him if you like you could give her an other ride and sort of explain things to her it would help her catch up to me quickly but no more liens the mare snorted and pawed the ground she was not interested in giving rides maybe i can make a deal with you smash said i dont want tandy getting in trouble in here not at the risk of her soul certainly is there anything i can do for you outside the mare considered then she brightened she licked her lips something to eat smash asked and the mare nodded something nice she agreed again rock candy she neighed nay smash played the guessing game but could not quite come up with the correct item all the other mares had departed and this one was fidgeting he could not hold her longer well if i find it maybe ill know it smash said maybe tandy will know and bring it with her if she comes you keep in touch okay the nightmare nodded then turned and trotted off no doubt she was going to pick up her load of unpleasant dreams for delivery to her clientele of sleepers maybe some of them were his friends at the fireoak tree good luck smash called after her and she flicked her tail in acknowledgment alone again he wondered whether he had been foolish what business did he have with nightmares what would a nightmare want from a person that the mare could not pick up for herself on her rounds he was an ogre who loved violence and horror and he was here on a personal mission yet somehow he felt it was best to get along with any creature he could perhaps something would come of it this confounded eye queue not only did it set him to trying unogrish things it rendered him confused about the meaning of these things and full of uncomfortable self doubt what a curse it was he faced resolutely forward and resumed his tromping he saw something new on the horizon and proceeded to ward it soon it manifested as a buildingno as a castle no larger yet an entire city enclosed by a forbidding wall as he drew close he discovered the city was solid gold every part of it scintillated in the moonlight shades of deep yellow but when he drew closer yet he found that it was not gold but brassjust as shiny but not nearly as precious still it was a marvel the outer wall was unbroken riveted metal gleaming at every angle the front gate was the same so large it dwarfed even smashs monstrous proportions this was the sort of city giants would inhabit smash considered that the little knobs of the haunted house had shocked him how much worse would this one be he was not at all sure he could rip this door from its moorings it was big and strong and he was now relatively weak this was not a situation he liked to admit but he was no longer properly stupid about such things he pondered drawing on the full curse of the eye ogre ogre queue what he needed was insulationsomething to pro tect him from shock but there was nothing near the city wall rose out of sand he might use his orange jacketbut he was not wearing it here in the gourd all he had was the string and that wasnt suitable no help for it he would have to touch the metal ac tually there might be a metal floor inside that he would have to walk on if he were going to get shocked it would happen with every step might as well find out now he extended a hamfinger and touched the knob there was no shock he grasped and turned the knob it clicked and the door swung inward it wasnt lockedl there was a bright metal hall leading from the gate into the city smash walked down it half expecting the door to slam shut behind him it did not he continued through the hall his bare furry soles thumping on the cool metal he emerged into an open court with a paving of brass the moonlight bearing down preternaturally all was silent no creatures roamed the city ho smash bellowed loud enough to disturb the dead as seemed appropriate in this realm no dead were disturbed if they heard they were ignor ing him the city seemed to be empty there was an eerie quality to this that smash liked but he wondered who had made this city and where those people had gone it seemed like far too interesting a place to desert if ogres built cit ies this was the sort of city they would build but of course no ogre was smart enough to build a single building let alone a city certainly not a lovely city of brass he tromped through it his big flat feet generating a muted booming on the metal street brass buildings rose on either side their walls making blank brass faces at precise right angles to the street he looked up and saw that the tops were squared off too there were no windows or doors of course that didnt matter to the average ogre he could always bash out any windows when and where he wanted all was mirrorshiny he could see his appalling reflection in every surface that faced him brass ogres paced him to either side and another walked upside down under the street smash remembered the story his father crunch had told of entering a sleeping city and discovering the lovely mush ogre ogre faced ogress who had become smashs mother this city of brass was pleasantly reminiscent of that was there an ogress here for him that was an exciting prospect though he hoped she wasnt made of brass he traversed the city but found no entrance to any building if an ogress was sleeping here she was locked away where he couldnt reach her smash banged on a wall making it reverberate but though the sound boomed pleasantly throughout the city no one stirred he punched harder trying to break a hole in the wall it was no good he was too weak the brass was too strong and he lacked his protective gauntlets his fist smarted so he stuck it in his mouth smash was beginning to be bothered before there had been halfway interesting things like walking skeletons elec trified doors and nightmares now there was just brass what could he accomplish here he invoked the curse of the eye queue yet again and did some solid thinking so far each little adventure within the gourd had been a kind of riddle he had to overcome some barrier or beat some sort of threat before he could continue to the next event so it was probably not enough just to enter this empty city and depart that might not count he had to solve the riddle thus narrowing the op tions reducing the remaining places for the night stallion to hide straight physical action did not seem to be the re quirement here what then was there must be a nonphysical way to deal with this im passive place perhaps to bring it to life so it could be con quered maybe a magical spell but smash did not know any spells and somehow this city seemed too alien to be magical what else then he paced the streets still unreeling his string careful never to cross his own path and in a little private square directly under the moon he discovered a pedestal signifi cant things were usually mounted on pedestals directly un der the moon he remembered so he marched up to it and looked he was disappointed there was only a brass button there nothing to do except to press it there might be serious consequences but no selfrespecting ogre worried about that sort of thing he turned his big hamthumb down ogre ogre and mashed the button with luck all hell would break loose as it happened luck was with him most of hell broke loose there was a pleasantly deafening klaxon alarm noise that filled all this limited universe with vibrations then the metal buildings began shifting about moving along the floor of the city squeezing the streets and the court in a moment there would be no place remaining for him to stand this was more like it at first smash planned to brace himself and halt the encroaching buildings by brute ogre strength but he lacked his full power now and anyway it was better to use his brain perhaps the eye queue was gradually subverting him causing him to endorse its na ture already it seemed like less of a curse and he knew because ironically of the intelligence it provided him that this was a significant signal of corruption mental power tended to corrupt and absolute intelligence tended to corrupt absolutely until the victim eschewed violence entirely in favor of smart solutions to stupid problems smash hoped he could fight off the curse before it ever ruined him to that extent if he stopped being stupid bru tal and violent he would no longer be a true ogre nevertheless the expedience of the moment forced him to utilize his mind he knew that a block that moved one way had to leave a space behind it unless it happened to be expanding rapidly he zipped between buildings emerg ing from the narrowing aisle just before the two clanged together sure enough there was a new space where a building had stood it was perfectly smooth brass except for a cubic hole where the center of the building had been probably that was the anchoring place like part of a lock mechanism a heavy bolt would drop down from the build ing to wedge in that hole and keep the building from slid ing about when it wasnt supposed to when he had pressed the brass button the lock bolts had lifted freeing the build ings buildings like clouds bashed about all over the place when given the freedom to do so the klaxon had sounded to warn all crushable parties that motion was commencing so they could either get out of the way or pick their favor ite saiiishin snot it all made a sort of violent sense his ogre ogre eye queue informed him he liked this city better than ever now the building blocks were bouncing back converging on him smash moved again avoiding what could be a crushing experience he found himself in a new open space with another anchorage slot but the blocks were moving more quickly now as if get ting warmed up because they were big he needed a cer tain amount of time to run between them if they speeded up much more he would not have time to clear before they clanged that could be awkward well brain what do you say to this he asked chal lengingly can you outsmart two buildings that plan to catch me and squish me flat his vinecorrupted brain thus challenged rose to the oc casion get in the pit it told him smash thought this was crazy but already the brass was moving sounding off with its tune of compression and he had to act he leaped into the pit as the blank metal face of the building charged him too late it occurred to him or to his eye queueit became difficult at times to distinguish ogremind from vinemindthat he could be crushed when the bolt dropped down to anchor the building but that should hap pen only when the building was finished traveling and wanted to settle down for a rest he would try to be out by then if he failedwell squishing was an ogrish kind of demise it was dark there as the metal underbody of the building slid across he felt slightly claustrophobicanother weak ness of intelligence since a true ogre never worried about danger or consequence what would happen if the building did not move off then light flashed down from above smash blinked and discovered that the center of the building was hollow glow ing from the inner walls he had found his way inside he scrambled up and stood on the floor still holding his ball of string the building was still moving but there was no way it could crush him now the building floor covered everything except the square where the anchorage hole would be when it lay at anchor so he could simply ride along with it ogre ogre ogre ogre he looked aboutand spied an army of brass men and women each individual fully formed complete with brass facial features hair and clothingthe men fully clothed the women less so but they were statues erected on plat forms that like the floor moved with the building noth ing here was of interest to an ogre he knew brass wasnt good to eat then he spied another brass button well why not maybe this one would make the building stop moving of course if this one stopped and the other buildings did not there would be a horrendous crash smash jammed his thumb down on the button instantly the brass statues animated the metal people spied the ogre and converged on him and smash found himself leaning against the fireoak tree tandy stood before him holding the gourd she had broken his line of vision to the peephole are you all right smash she asked with her cute concern certainly he grumped why did you interrupt me it was just getting interesting the lunatic fringe is tearing she said worriedly the human villagers are in the area and will soon discover the tree well bring me back when they do smash said i have metal men to fight inside metal men and women solid brass oh she said uncomprehending remember youre in there to fight for your soul i worry about you smash he guffawed you worry about me youre human im an ogre yes she agreed but her face remained drawn i know what its like in there you put your soul in peril for me i cant forget that smash you dont like it in there he pointed out i do and i agreed to protect you this is merely another aspect he took the gourd back and applied his eye to the peephole the brass people were converging exactly where they had been when he left they seemed not even to be aware of his brief absence the building was moving toobut it had not moved in the interim his eye queuecursed brain found all this interesting but smash had no time for that nonsense at the moment the brassies were almost on him the first one struck at him the man was only half smashs height but the metal made him solid smash hauled him up by the brassard and threw him aside smash still lacked the strength to do real damage but at least he could fight weakly in his strength he would have hurled the brass man right through the brass wall of the building a female grabbed at him smash hooked a forefinger into her brassiere and hauled her up to his eye level why are you attacking me he asked curious rather than an gry were only following our program she said kicking at him with a pretty brass foot but if you fight me i shall have to fight you he pointed out and i happen to be a monster dont try to reason with me you big hunk of flesh im too brassy for that she swung at him with a metal fist but he was holding her at his arms length so she could not reach him something was knocking at his knee smash looked down a man was striking at him with his brass knuckles smash dropped the brass girl on the brass mans brass hat and the two crashed to the floor in a shower of brass tacks they cried out with the sound of brass winds now a halfdozen brassies were grabbing at smashs legs and he lacked the strength to throw them all off at once so he reached down to pluck them off one at a time he was under the tree again he saw the problem imme diately half a dozen brassiesno these were men and women of the human villagewere converging on the tree bearing wickedlooking axes the hamadryad was scream ing smash had no patience with this he stood up towering over the villagers ogrefashion he roared a fine ogre roar the villagers turned and fled they didnt know smash was short of strength at the moment otherwise they could have attacked him and perhaps put him in difficulty in the same way the brassies were doing in the gourd he had replaced the illusion of the lunatic fringe with the illusion of his own formidability the hamadryad dropped from her tree her hair glowing like fire catching him about the neck she was now a vi ogre ogre brant healthy creature you great big wonderful brute of a creature she exclaimed kissing his furry ear smash was oddly moved as the centaur had noted ogres were seldom embraced or kissed by nymphs he handed the hamadryad back into her tree then set tled down for another session in the gourd none of them had anywhere to go until the king got the news and acted to protect the tree permanently and he wanted to wrap up this gourd business wake me at need he said noting that the shimmer of the lunatic fringe was now almost gone if trees had ogres to protect them instead of cute but helpless hamadryads very few trees would be destroyed of course ogres themselves were prime destroyers of trees using them to make tooth picks and such so he was in no position to criticize he applied his left eye to the peephole this time giving his right orb a rest he stood in an alley between buildings what was this the sequence was supposed to pick up exactly where it had left off what had gone wrong the two buildings slid toward him forcing him to scoot out of the way smash emerged into a new spaceand saw his line of string he was about to cross his own path but he couldnt retreat the buildings were clanging behind him still his cursed eye queue wouldnt let him leave well enough alone it wanted to know why the gourd scene had slipped a notch was the gourd getting old beginning to rot breaking down its system he didnt want to be trapped in a rotting gourd the buildings separated starting to converge on a new spot the alley reopened the string he had just set out run ning down its lengthand stopping smash ran to the end of it the string had been severed cleanly it ended at the point he had reentered the vision but as the buildings separated smash saw another cut end of string that must be where he had been before just a little distance away he had jumped no farther than he could have bounded by foot but he hadnt jumped physi cally he had left the scene then returned to it slightly dis placed why the buildings reversed course and closed on him again they certainly wasted no time pondering questions smash ogre ogre ran back his mind working and suddenly it came to himhe had switched eyes his left eye was a little apart from his right eyeand though that distance was small in the real world of xanth it was larger in the tiny world of the gourd so there had been a shift and a break in his string well that had freed him of the brass folk but smash couldnt accept that he didnt want to escape he wanted to win to conquer this setting and go on to the next know ing he had narrowed the night stallions options he wanted to do his job right leaving no possible loophole for the loss of his soul so he had to go back to the place he had left off and resume there he followed his prior line dragging his new line behind him he found the square pit as the building moved off it and he got down into it the building swung back and the interior light came on smash climbed out and ran to the end of his string the brass folk saw him and came charging in smash tied the two ends of string together making his line com plete then stood as half a dozen people grabbed him this was where he had left off now it was all right he resumed plucking individual brass folk off one of them was the girl in the brassiere you again he in quired holding her up by one finger as he had done be fore it was really the best place since she was flailing all her limbs wildly do i have to drop you again dont you dare drop me again she flashed her brass surface glinting with ire she took an angry breathwhich almost dislodged her for she had a full brassiere and his purchase on it was slight i have a dent and three scratches from the last time you monster she pointed at her arms theres a scratch theres another but i wont show you the dent well you did kick at me smash said reasonably won dering where the dent was i told you we have to then he was back in xanth again smash saw the prob lem immediately a cockatrice was approaching the tree the baby basilisk had evidently been recently hatched and was wandering aimlesslybut remained deadly dangerous put me down you lunk ogre ogre startled smash looked at the source of the voice he was still holding the brass girl dangling by her brassiere hooked on his finger she had been brought out of the gourd with him hastily smash set her down carefully so she would not dent he had a more immediate matter to attend to how could he get rid of the cockatrice oh look the brass girl said what a cute chickl she stepped over to the terrible infant reaching down dont touch it the siren cried dont even look at it too late the brass girl picked up the baby monster oh arent you a sweet one she cooed turning it in her hand so she could look it in the snoot no several voices cried again they were too late the brass girl stared deeply into the monsters baleful eyes oh i wish i could keep you for my very own pet along with my other pets she said touching her pert nose to its hideous schnozzle i dont have anything like you in my collection the chick hissed and bitbut its tiny teeth were ineffec tive against the brass oh how nice the girl said you like me dont you apparently the little monsters powers were harmless against the metal girl she was already harder than stone uh miss the siren said im called biyght the brass girl said of building four in the city of brass who are you im called the siren the siren said biythe we would appreciate it if biyght the girl corrected her brassily sorry i misheard biyght if you would but i think i like biythe better this place is so much softer than im used to so you can use that sim siren two syllables thats all right i prefer one syllable sim you can change names at will john asked incredu lously of course all brassies can cant you no the fairy said enviously biythe that animal the siren broke in its deadly to us so if you would ogre ogre smash had been looking around to see if there were any other dangers at this point his eye fell on the gourdand even from a distance his consciousness was drawn into the peephole and he was back among the brassies this time he stood within the building but apart from the crowd and his string had been interrupted again he was using his right eye the brass folk spied him and charged this was getting pointless wait he bellowed they paused taken aback why one inquired because i accidentally took one of your number out of the gourd and if anything happens to me shell be forever stranded there they were appalled almost galvanized that would be a fate worse than death one cried that would be he paused balking at the awful concept that would belife another brass man whispered there was a sudden hush of dread yes smash agreed cruelly so i have to fetch her back and i will but youll have to help me anything the man said his brass face tarnishing tell me how to get out of here on my own thats easy take the ship the ship but theres no water here several brassies smiled metallically its not that kind of ship its the lunafringeshuttle you catch it at the luna triptych building show me to it smash said they showed him to a brass door that opened to the out side you cant miss it they assured him its the biggest block in the city smash thanked them and stepped out the buildings were still moving but now he had the experience and confidence to travel by their retreating sides avoiding colli sions he glanced back at the building he had left and saw the number inscribed on the side but there was no sign of the door he had exited by apparently it was a oneway door that didnt exist from this side soon he spied a building twice the size of the others that had to be the one he ducked into an anchor hole as the building approached and m a moment was inside ogre ogre there was the fringeshuttle like a monstrous arrowhead standing on its tail it had a porthole in the side big enough to admit him so he climbed in he found himself in a tight cockpit that the cock seemed to have vacated there was only one place to sit comfort ably a kind of padded chair before a panel full of dinguses so he sat there knowing he could bash the dinguses out of the way if they bothered him there was another brass but ton on the panel and he punched it with his thumb the porthole clanged closed a wheel spun itself about air hissed straps rose up from the chair and wrapped themselves around his body a magic mirror lit up before his face an alarm klaxon sounded the ship shuddered then launched upward like a shot from a catapult punching through the roof in moments the mirror showed clouds falling away ahead then the moon came into view growing larger and brighter each moment it was now a halfcircle of coursethat was why the lunatic fringe no longer shrouded the fireoak treenot enough moon left to sustain it but the half that remained seemed solid enough except for the round holes in it of course cheese did have holes that was its nature now it occurred to him that the brassies might have mis construed his request they had shown him the way out of the city of brassbut not out of the gourd well nothing to do now but carry this through maybe the ship could get him back to the fireoak tree he didnt really want to go to the moon though the view of all that fresh cheese made him hungry after all it had been at least an hour since he had eaten that bushel of fruit so he checked the panel before him and found a cou ple of projecting brass sticks he grabbed them wiggling them about the moon veered out of the mirrorpicture and smash was flung about in his chair as if tossed by a storm for tunately the straps held him pretty much in place he let go of the sticksand after a moment the moon swung back into view evidently he had messed up the ships program his eye queue curse caused him to ponder this and he concluded that the sticks controlled the ship when they were not in use the ship sailed where it wanted which was ogre ogre evidently a hole in the cheese of the moon maybe this luna shuttle was the mechanism by which the moons cheese was brought to xanth though he wasnt sure what use metal people would have for cheese smash took hold of the sticks again and wiggled more cautiously ogres were clumsy only when it suited them to be so they could perform delicate tasks when no one was watching the moon danced about but did not leave the screen he experimented some more and soon was able to steer the ship where he wanted and to make it go at any speed he wanted finenow he would take it back to xanth and land be side the fireoak tree then he could turn it over to biythe brassie so she could fly back to her city and building then blips appeared on the screen they were shaped like little curseburrs and were hurtling toward him what did they want then flashes of light came near him the ship shook the screen flared red for a moment as if it had been knocked half silly smash understood this sort of thing it was like getting knocked in the snoot by a fist and having stars and planets fly out from ones head the entire night sky was filled with the stars flung out from peoples heads in the course of prior fights but smash didnt care to have his own lights punched out the thing to do was to hit back and destroy the enemy he checked the panel again enjoying the prospect of a new type of violence there was a big button he hadnt noticed before naturally he thumbed it a flash of light shot toward the blips evidently from his own ship it was throwing its sort of rocks when he told it to very well in this strange gourd world he could accept the notion of a fist made of light but it wasnt aimed well and missed the blips it lanced on to blast a chunk of cheese out of the moon grated cheese puffed out into space in a diffuse cloud where some of the blips went after it no doubt they were hungry too smash pressed the button again sending out another fist of light this one missed both blips and moon but he was getting the feel of it he had to have his target in the very center of the mirror where there was a faint intersection of lines like the center of a spider web funny place for a ogre ogre spider to work maybe it had been trying to catch stray stars or blips or bits of blasted cheese to center the target he had to work the two sticks in a coordinated fashion he did so after glancing nervously about to make quite sure no one was near to see him being so well coordinated of course it took more than strength to balance his whole body on a single hamfinger or to smash a rock into a particular grade of gravel with one blow but that was an ogre secret it was fashionable to appear clumsy when he had a blip centered he pushed the button with his big left toe so he wouldnt have to stop maneuvering this time his aim was good the beam speared out and struck the blip which exploded with lovely violence and pretty colors this was fun not as much fun as physical bashing would be but excellent vicarious mayhem ogres could ap preciate beauty toothe splendor of bursting bodies or of blips flying apart forming intricate and changing patterns in the sky he oriented on another blip but it took evasive action meanwhile all the other blips were nearer and their lightfists were striking closer he had to dodge them and that interfered with his own strikes well he was not an ogre for nothing he licked his chops worked his sticks looped about oriented fired dodged and oriented again two more blips exploded beau tifully then the fight intensified but smash loved combat of any kind and was good at it he didnt have to use physical fists he almost liked this form of fighting better because it was less familiar and therefore more of a challenge he knocked out blip after blip and after a while the remaining blips turned tail and fled past the moon he had won the battle of the luna fringe he was tempted to pursue the blips so as to continue the pleasure of the fight a little longer but realized that if he wiped them all out at this time they would not have a chance to regenerate and return for future battles better to let them go for the sake of more fun on future days also he had other business ogre ogre he turned the ship about and headed for xanthwhich resembled a small disk from this vantage like a greenish pie that made him hungry again well he would be care ful not to miss it he accelerated zooming happily onward chapter dragons ear he was back in xanth smash something else is coming tandy cried thats all right he said ive won another battle i feel stronger and he did he knew he was winning the gourd campaign getting closer to the night stallion and recovering physical strength in the process it had been in large part his former hopelessness that had weakened him he had believed his soul was doomed until learning that he could fight for it in another gourd biythe brassie was still here now he wonderedhow had she been carried out with him when he had not been physically in the gourd his eye queue curse provided him with the answer to a question any normal ogre would not even have thought of biythe was here in spirit just as he had been inside the gourd in spirit it was very hard to tell such spirit from reality but each person knew his own reality and was not fooled no doubt biythe spirits real body remained in the gourd in a trancestate since the brassies spent much of their time as statues anyway waiting for someone to come push their button no one had noticed the difference or rather they had noticed and been alarmed because she re mained a statue while they were animate so they knew that her vital element her soul was elsewhere yes it all made sense everything in xanth made sense once a per son penetrated the seeming nonsense that masked it differ ent things made different sorts of sense for different peo ple he would have to take the brass girl back his curse not ogre ogre only forced intelligence on him it forced unogrish moral awareness at the moment he wasnt even certain that such awareness was a bad thing inconvenient as it might be when there was mayhem to be wreaked but the treechopping attack party was coming again smash oriented on the group as it galloped just beyond view the villagers must have gotten reinforcements the individuals were larger than basilisksevidently biythe had deposited the chickatrice safely elsewherebut smaller than sphinxes they were hoofed in fact thats my brother chem exclaimed now i recog nize his hoofbeat but theres something with himnot a centaur smash braced himself for what could be a complicated situation if some monster were riding herd on his friend chet they hove into view holey cow the siren breathed that was exactly what it wasa cow as full of holes as any big cheese she had holes in her body every which way through which daylight showed she was worse than the moon a big one was in her head about where her brain should have been evidently that didnt impede her much even her horns and tail had little holes her legs were so holey they seemed ready to collapse yet she functioned perfectly well in fact she carried two human riders who braced their hands and feet in her holes she was a big cow and her gait was bumpy so these handholds and footholds were es sential now smash recognized the riders dor irene he cried happily prince dor the siren asked and his fiancee yes they are taking forever about working up to mar riage chem murmured with a certain equine snideness its been four years now and grundy the golem smash added spying the tiny figure perched on the back of the centaur all my friends were your friends too tandy said nettled the party drew abreast of the fireoak tree whats this the golem cried snow white and the seven dwarves ogre ogre ogre ogre smash stood among the damsels towering over them not comprehending the reference but the eye queue curse soon clarified it obnoxiously some of the mundane set tlers in xanth had a story by that title and compared with smash the ogre the seven females were dwarvishly short as was even chem the centaur it seems you have a way with women smash prince dor said dismounting from the holey cow and coming to greet him whats your secret i only agreed not to eat them smash said to think how much simpler my life would have been if i had known that dor said i thought girls had to be courted you never courted me princess irene exclaimed she was a striking beauty by human standards nineteen years old the other girls all took jealously deep breaths watch ing her i courted you but you never would marry me you never would set the date dor retorted her mouth opened in a pretty of indignation you never set the date ive been trying to theyve been fighting about the date since before there was anything to date grundy remarked he doesnt even know what color her panties are i dont think she knows herself dor retorted i do too irene flashed theyre she paused then hiked up her skirt to look green its only a pretext to show os her legs smash ex plained to the others so i see tandy said enviously and her panties john said she like fireoak the si ren and chem didnt wear panties so couldnt show them off biythes panties were copperbottoms you creatures are getting too smart irene complained then she did a double take turning to smash what hap pened to your rhymes i got cursed by the vine the ogre explained it de prived me of both rhyme and stupidity in one swell foop in a foop oh you poor thing she said sympatheti cally now that incorrigible ogre charm is working on irene too prince dor muttered of course it is idiot she retorted all women have a secret passion for ogres she turned to smash now you had better introduce us all smash did so with dispatch tandy siren john fire oak chem goldy and biythethese are dor irene grundy and chet and vice versa moooo lowed the holey cow each with a big round hole in it and the holey cow smash amended satisfied the bovine swished her tattered tail and began to graze the cropped grass fell out the holes in her neck as fast as she swallowed it but she didnt seem to mind i delivered your message chet said king trent has declared this tree a protected species and all the other trees in sight of it and sent prince dor to inform the vil lage there will be no more trouble about that oh wonderful the hamadryad cried im so happy she danced a little jig in air hanging by one hand from a branch the trees leaves seemed to catch fire harmlessly both nymph and tree were fully recovered from the indis position of their recent separation i could just kiss the king kiss me instead dor said im the messenger oh no you dont irene flashed taking him firmly by the ear kiss me instead of dor chet offered theres no shrew guarding me the hamadryad dropped from her branch flung her arms about the centaur and kissed him maybe i have been missing something she commented but i dont think there are any males of my species you could take up with one of the woodland fauns princess irene suggested you do have pretty hair the hamadryads hair under its red fringe was greenas was irenes hair ill consider it fireoak agreed how did you gather such a bevy prince dor asked smash they certainly seem affectionate unlike some i have known he moved with agility to avoid irenes swift kick i just picked them up along the way the ogre said each has her mission john needs her correct name the siren needs a better lake ogre ogre they all need men the golem put in i need to go home biythe said oh ill take you there now smash reached for the gourd shes from a hypnogourd princess irene asked this should be interesting i always wondered what was inside one of those things smash hooked his finger into biythes brassiere and lifted her high well thats one way to pick up a girl dor remarked ill have to try that sometime wont work irene said i dont wear a not even a green one tandy asked brightening smash looked into the gourds peephole the two of them were in the brass spaceship descending rapidly toward xanth oh biythe exclaimed terrified she flung her brass arms about smash ill fall ill fall save me ogre but i have to bring it down to return to your building smash said he was having difficulty because there was hardly room for two he grabbed for a control stick jerked it aroundand the brass girl jumped what are you doing with my knee she cried oh smash saw now that he had hold of the wrong thing but it was almost impossible to operate the controls with her limbs in the way the ship veered crazily which set biythe off again her nerves certainly were not made of steel the more she kicked and screamed the worse the ship spun and the more frightened she became they were now plunging precipitously toward ground then they were back under the fireoak tree we thought you had enough time to drop her off tandy said then she paused frowning biythe was wrapped around smash her metal arms hug ging his neck desperately her legs clasping his side he had firm hold of one of her knees i think we interrupted something princess irene re marked sardonically biythes complexion converted from brass to copper smash suspected his own was doing much the same as his eye queue now made him conscious of unogrish propri ogre ogre eties the two disengaged and smash set the brass girl down on the ground where she sat and sobbed brass tears we were crashing smash explained lamely ohmundane slang chet said but i think she wasnt quite ready for it its really no business of ours what you call it grundy said smirking oh dont be cruel the siren said this poor girl is terrified and we know smash wouldnt hurt her some thing is wrong in the gourd in due course they worked it out smash would have to return to the brass building first then come back for biythe who it seemed was afraid of interplanetary heights but now dawn was coming and other business was pressing they had to inform the local village of the pro tected status of the tree and its environs and then chet and his party had to return to castle roogna in addition biythe was no longer so eager to jump into the gourd with or without the ogre if she went alone she might find her self crashing in the ship and have no way to get back out side since she was not an outside creature it would be better to send her back later once things were more settled oh chet said almost forgot i gave tandys message to crombie and he made a pointingthats his talent you know pointing out thingsand he concluded that if you went north youd face great danger and lose three things of value but when he did a pointing back where you came from there was something else youd lose that was even more important he couldnt figure out what any of the things were but thought youd better be advised he says youre a spunky girl who will probably win through in the manner of your kind tandy laughed thats my father all right he hates women and he knows im growing up so hes starting to hate me too but im glad to have his advice whats back at your home thats worse than the jungle of xanth chet asked tandy remembered the demon fiant never mind im not going home until that danger is nullified ill just take my chances with the three things ill lose in the jungle ogre ogre but she found the message disquieting she had no things to losebut she knew her father never made a mistake when he pointed something out princess irenes talent was growing plants she grew a fine big mixedfruit bush and they dined on red green blue yellow and black berries all juicy and luscious smash had always liked irene because no one remained hungry in her presence and she did have excellent legs not that an ogre should notice of courseyet it was hard not to imagine how delicious such firmly fleshed limbs would taste uh before you go the siren said i understand you have a way with the inanimate prince dor whatever gave you that idiotic notion fishtail a rock beside the prince inquired the siren was sitting next to a bucket of water and was soaking her tail she got uncom fortable when she spent too long out of the water i picked up something and i think it may be magical the siren continued but im not sure in what way and dont want to experiment foolishly she brought out a be draggled halfmetallic thing what are you prince dor asked the thing i am the gap dragons ear it answered the con founded ogre bashed me off the dragons head smash was surprised how did you get that i picked it up during the fight then forgot about it what with the pining tree and all the siren explained the gap chasm does have a forgetful property irene said i understand thats dors fault but the gaps been forgotten for centuries hasnt it the siren asked we can only remember it now because were still quite close to it well forget it again when we go on north how can dor possibly be responsible oh he gets around irene said giving the prince a dark look hes been places none of us would believe he even used to live with millie the sexappeal maid she was my governess when i was a child dor pro tested besides she was eight hundred years old and looked seventeen irene retorted you werent conscious of that dor concentrated on the ear what is your property he asked it ogre ogre i hear anything relevant it said i twitch when my possessor should listen thats how the gap dragon always knew when prey was in the gap i heard it for him well the gap dragon still has one ear to hear with dor said how can we hear what you hear just listen to me dummyi the ear said what else do you do with an ear thats a mighty impolite item tandy said bothered can we test it the siren asked before you go prince dor oh let me try john said she seemed much recov ered though her wings remained nubs it would be long before she flew again if ever the siren gave her the ear john held it to her own tiny ear she listened intently her face showing puzzlement its a rushing sound maybe like water flowing she re ported is that relevant well i didnt twitch the ear grumped you take your chances when theres nothing much on how is that rushing noise relevant dor asked the ear obvious stupid the ear said thats the sound of the waterfall where the fairy she wants is staying it is john demanded so excited that her wingstubs fluttered the one with my name thats what i said twerp do you tolerate insults from the inanimate the siren asked the prince only stupid things insult others gratuitously dor said thats for sure you moron the rock agreed then it reconsidered hey the siren laughed now i understand you have to consider the source prince dor smiled you resemble your sister of course ive never seen her face the rest will do the siren said flattered do only smart people compliment others gratuitously perhaps he agreed or observant ones but i do ob tain much useful information from the inanimate now we must go talk with the villagers and head back to castle roogna it has been nice to meet all of you and i hope you all find what you wish there was a chorus of thankyous prince dor and ogre ogre princess irene remounted the holey cow chet kissed chem goodbye and grundy the golem scrambled onto his back get moving horsetail then grundy paused thought fully exactly as the rock had they moved off toward the village dor will make a fine king one day the siren re marked but irene will run the show chem said i know them well no harm in that the siren said and the other girls laughed agreeing wed better get started north tandy said now that the tree is safe how can i ever thank you fireoak exclaimed you saved my life my trees life same thing some things are simply worth doing for themselves dear the siren said i learned that when chems father chester destroyed my dulcimer so i couldnt lure men any more her sunshine hair clouded momentarily my father did that chem asked surprised i didnt know it stopped me from being a menace to navigation the siren said i was doing a lot of damage uncaringly it was a necessary thing likewise it was necessary to save the fireoak tree yes chem agreed but she seemed shaken they bade farewell to the hamadryad promising to visit her any time any of them happened to be in the vicinity and started north at first they passed through normal xanth country sidecarnivorous grasses teakettle serpents whose hisses were worse than their fires poisonous springs tangle trees sundry spells and the usual ravines mountains river rap ids slow and quicksand bogs illusions and a few normally foulmouthed harpies but nothing serious occurred they foraged along the way for edible things and took turns lis tening to the gap dragons ear though it was not twitch ing this became more helpful as they gradually learned to interpret it the siren heard a kind of splashing as of someone swimming she took this to be the merman she wanted to find goldy heard the sounds of a goblin settle ogre ogre ment in operation where she was going smash heard the rhyming grunts of ogres biythe persuaded to try it jumped as the ear twitched in her hands and she actually heard herself mentioned the brassies missed her and feared the ogre had betrayed their trust i must go back she cried as soon as i recover enough of my courage my nerves arent iron you know but when chem tried it her face sobered it must be out of order all i get is a faint buzzing the siren took back the ear thats funny i get the buzzing too now they passed the ear around everyone heard the same thing and it twitched for none of them smash applied his eye queue curse to the ear either it is malfunctioning he decided or the buzzing is somehow relevant to all of us without being specific to any of us no one is talking about us no one is lurking for us so it is just something we should know about lets assume its not malfunctioning tandy said the last thing we need is a glitching ear especially when my father says there is danger ahead so wed better watch out for something that buzzes it seems to be getting louder as we go indeed it was now there were variations in it louder buzzes in front of background ones an elevating and lower ing of pitch it was in fact a whole collection of buzzes sounding threedimensional as some pitches became louder and clearer while others faded back and some faded out entirely what did it mean they came across a wall made from paper it traveled roughly eastwest and reached up to the top level of the trees too high for smash to surmount it was opaque he could not see through it at all however a wall of paper could hardly impede an ogre he readied a good punch careful john cried that looks like smashs fist punched through the wall the paper sepa rated readily but glued itself to his arm flypaper the fairy concluded smash tried to pull the sticky stuff off but it stuck to his other hand when he touched it the more he worked at ogre ogre ogre ogre it the more places it adhered to soon he was covered with the stuff slow down smash chem said im sure hot water will clean that off i saw a hotspring a short distance back she took him to the hotspring and washed him off and it did clean him up her hands were efficient yet gentle smash discovered he liked having a female attend to him this way but of course he couldnt admit it he was an ogre next time use a stick to poke through that paper the centaur advised but when they returned to the wall they found the oth ers had already thought of that they had poked and peeled a hole big enough for anyone to pass through but theres one thing tandy warned there are swarms of flies over there so that was what the ear had warned them of they were going to pass through a region of flies that didnt bother smash he normally ignored flies biythe was also unworried no fly could sting brass but tandy chem goldy john and the siren were concerned they didnt want stinging flies raising welts on their pretty skins if only we had some repellent tandy said in the caves there are some substances that drive them off some repellent bushes do grow in these parts goldy said let me look she scouted about and soon located one the only problem is they smell awful she held out the leaves she had plucked she had not overstated the case the stench was appall ing no wonder the flies stayed clear of it they discussed the matter and decided it was better to stink than to suffer too great a detour in their route north they held their breath and rubbed the foul leaves over their bodies then reeking of repellent they stepped through the rent in the flypaper and proceeded north there was a sound behind them marching along the pa per wall was a monstrous fly in coveralls toting a cart it stopped at the rent unrolled a big patch of paper and set it in place sealing it over with stickum then the flypaper hanger moved on to the east following the wall were sealed in tandy muttered a dense swarm of stingflies spotted them and zoomed inonly to bank off in dismay as the awful odor smote it good enough smashs nose was already acclimating or get ting deadened to the smell which wasnt much worse than that of another ogre after all they walked on watching the flies there were many varieties and some were beautiful with brightly colored patterned wings and furry bodies john became very quiet obviously she missed her own patterned wings there were deerflies and horseflies and dragonflies looking like winged miniatures of their species the deerflies nibbled blades of grass the horseflies kicked up their heels as they galloped and the dragonflies even jetted small lances of fire at one spot there was music fiddler flies were play ing for damselflies to dance it seemed to be a real fly ball this became a pleasant trip since there seemed to be no dangerous creatures here the flies had driven them all away but then the sky clouded and rain fell it was a light fallbut it washed away their repellent suddenly they were in trouble having failed to take immediate shelter the first flies to discover this were sweatgnats soon a cloud of them hovered about each person except biythe causing everyone to sweat uncomfortably smash inhaled deeply and blew the gnats away but as soon as the turbu lence ebbed they were back worse than ever other flies saw the clouds and in turn converged some of these were itchers causing intolerable itches others were bleeders causing blood to flow from painless bites but the worst as it turned out were the flybys because they flew by ob served and carried the news of new prey to all corners of the kingdom of the flies after that the very sky was dark ened by the mass of the converging swarms there seemed to be no effective way to fight them for there were far too many to swat or shoo away then the swarms drew off a little and a pair of shoe flies marched up a formation of bowflies sent a fly arrow shooting in the direction smashs party was supposed to go it seemed better to obey rather than fight for there were sawflies and hammerflies and screwdriverflies that could be most awkward to fend off they marched and the swarms paced them buzzing out ogre ogre a tune that sounded like a requiem smash had not imag ined that so many flies existed in xanth they coated the trees they popped out of myriad holes in the ground they formed clouds in the sky that rained droppings the party arrived at a palace fashioned of flypaper coated with fly ash here surrounded by a cluster of fawn ing damselflies perched the lord of the fliesa huge de monic figure with multiplefaceted eyes he was reading the flyleaf of a book titled the sting by wasp bzzzzzz the fly lord inquired looking up with sev eral facets the query seemed to be directed at smash but he did not comprehend fly talk he grunted noncommittally bzzzzzz the fly repeated angrily smash had an idea he lifted the gap dragons ear to his own maybe that would provide a translation all he heard was the roaring and hissing of dragons no help there the fly buzzed again angry light glinting from quite a number of facets giant guardflies swarmed up to grab the ear dont fight them smash tandy cried alarmed the ogre didnt like it but realized they could all be bitten and stung to death if he made trouble it was the curse of the eye queue again making him react intelli gently hejet the flies take the ear they dragged it to the fly lord who cocked his head in order to listen to it and the ear twitched almost knocking the fly off his perch bzzzzzz he buzzed angrily and there was a flutter of alarm among the damselflies it seemed the lord had used very strong language but he got back up to listen bzzzzzz and the guardflies hovered in military readiness bzzzzzz and the surrounding swarms retreated the fly lord angled a few facets at smash as if pon dering a suitable action then he buzzed out another com mand instantly the guardflies closed on smashs party again and the bowflies fired off another arrow pointing the way i dont know whether the gap dragons ear has pro vided us with doom or reprieve chem said but wed better go along ogre ogre they went along the arrows pointed them to the east soon they arrived at the flypaper wall at this point a squadron of big spearflies charged threatening to run ev ery member of the party through they got the message they all plunged through the wall they got terribly stuckup with flypaper but the flies let them be it seemed they had been banished from fly land they staggered around looking for another hotspring for washing but before they found one a small flying dragon spied them it winged rapidly east i fear this is dragon country the siren said look at the dragonclaw marks on the trees smash saw that all the trees were marked and the scratches were definitely those of dragons the largest and deepest scrapes were also the highest the biggest monsters set the most imposing signatures we had better move he said in his present state he could not adequately protect this party against a pack of dragons annoying as it was to admit that fact even privately but they couldnt move very well tangled in flypaper it was collecting dirt and leaves and stray bugs making each member of the party resemble a harpy dipped in glue long before they found a hotspring they heard the heavy tread of the feet of a land dragon you know what the siren said angrily the flies of fered us up to the dragons and the ear too john cried spying the gap dragons ear on the ground thats to frame us goldy said the dragons will think we killed one of their number and theyll really chomp us smash braced himself ill try to hold them off you havent yet recovered enough strength the siren said and many big dragons are coming dont try to fight she took the ear from john and listened to it it twitched in her hand someones talking about us an ogre a centaur and five nymphs that wont do us much good if the dragons eat us tandy muttered whats it like to be eaten biythe asked clothed in ogre ogre paper she looked just like the others with hardly any of her metal showing thats rightyou have had even less experience in reg ular xanth than i have tandy said but i doubt youll ever be eaten your body is brass well everything is brass where i come from biythe replied my pet bird is brass my sheep is brass even my ass is brass thats the way it is in the city of brass what does that have to do with being eaten monsters dont eat brass here tandy explained i cant be eaten biythe asked sounding disappointed oh you could try john said when the first dragon comes you could volunteer to be the first eaten but i think you alone among us are secure from that fate i wonder the brassie said thoughtfully already the first dragon was arriving it was a huge eightlegged land rover snorting smoke smash strode for ward to meet it knowing it would have been too much for him even when he had his full strength it wasnt the drag ons size so much as its heat it could roast him long before he hurt it but the dragon would attack regardless of whether he fought and it was an ogres way to fight maybe he could hurl some boulders at it and score a lucky conk on its noggin then biythe ran past him intercepting the dragon the dragon exhaled bathing her in flame but brief heat could not hurt her she continued right on up to its huge snout eat me first dragon she cried the dragon did not squat on ceremony it opened its monstrous jaws and took her in in one bite and broke half a dozen teeth on her hard metal biythe frowned amidst the smoke and piled fragments of teeth you can do better than that dragon she urged indignantly the dragon tried againand broke six more teeth come on creature biythe taunted show your mettle on my metal ive received worse dents just from being droppedbut i wont say where now several more dragons arrived they paused curious about the holdup another snatched biythe away crunch ing down hard on her bodyand it too lost six teeth ogre ogre the brass girl was insulted is that all there is to it what kind of experience is that here i visit this great big soft slushy living world at great inconvenience and you monsters arent doing a thing abashed the dragons stared at her she still looked like a clothed flesh person finally a third one triedand lost its quota of teeth if you dumb dragons cant eat one little girl when shes cooperating what good are you biythe demanded dis gusted she shook tooth fragments off her body marched up to one of the largest monsters and yanked at a whisker youeat me or else the dragon exhaled a horrendous belch of flame it burned biythes remaining flypaper to ashes but didnt hurt her seeing that the monster backed off dismayed if a thing couldnt be chomped or scorched it couldnt be handled you know i think we have had a stroke of luck the siren said the dragons naturally assume we are all like that luck john asked biythe knows what shes doing she knows she needs us to get her back to her world shes helping us get out of a fix smashs eye queue operated maybe we can benefit further we need a nice steady stream of steam to melt off the flypaper a steam bath the siren agreed but very gentle biythe tried it she approached a big steamturbine dragon bathe me monster or ill make you eat me she said imperiously cowed the dragon obeyed it jetted out a wash of rich white steam and vapor in a moment the brass girl stood shining clean well polished the fly ash all sogged off now my friends biythe ordered a little lower on the heat theyre tougher than i am and dont need so much she was playing it cool nervously the others stood in place while the dragon sent forth a cooler blast smash and the girls stepped into it the vapor was as hot as john could stand but since she had already lost her wings it ogre ogre didnt hurt her the others had no trouble all the flypaper was steamed off smash also became aware that hisfleas were gone now that he thought about it he realized that he hadnt been scratching since entering the kingdom of the flies those flyrepellent leaves must have driven off the fleas too now a dragon approached with an elf on a leash do any of you freaks speak human the elf asked smash exchanged glances with the others biythe brassie had been speaking to these monsters all along and they had understood didnt this elf know that better to play it stupid me freak some speak he said emulating his former ogre mode the elf considered him the little mans expression ran a brief gamut from fear of a monster to contempt for the monsters wit what are you doing here with these six females me anticipate girls taste great smash said slurping his tongue over his chops again the fearful contempt i know ogres eat people but what are you doing here in dragonland smash scratched his hairy head as if confused me crit icize buzzing flies oh they booted you the elf made crude growls at his dragon and smash realized he was translating much as grundy the golem did for the king of xanth maybe biythe had gotten through to the dragons mainly by force of personality the dragon growled back youll have to check in with the dragon lady dragon lady not afraidy smash asked stupidly the elf sneered of the like of you hardly come on now ignoramus ignoramus smash smiled inwardly not while he re mained cursed with the eye queue but he shuffled be hind the dragon gesturing the girls to follow the siren fell in beside smash as they walked ive been listening to the ear she murmured the voice that talked about us before was the elfs the dragon lady ogre ogre knows about us already now the ear is roaring like a ter rible storm i dont know what that means maybe we have to get to that storm smash whispered then the elf turned hearing him talk and the conversation had to end they came to a huge tent fashioned of dragonet inside the net was the dragon ladya scintillatingly regal queen of her species she reclined half supine in her huge nest of glittering diamonds whenever she twitched the precious stones turned up new facets like the eyes of the lord of the flies reflecting spots of light dazzlingly she switched her barbed blue tail about restlessly growling and arched her bright red neck it was really quite impressive she had been reading a book of monster comics and seemed not too pleased to be interrupted her majesty the illustrious dragon lady demands fur ther information oaf the elf said becoming imperious in the reflected glory of his mistress oaf eh smash played stupider than ever me slow no know he mumbled is it true you are impossible to eat smash held out a gauntleted fist the dragon lady reached delicately forward with her snout and took a care ful nip the metal balked her goldtinted teeth and she quickly desisted she growled if you arent edible what use are you her majesty wants to know the elf demanded what a question tandy cried indignantly people creatures rule xanth dragoncreatures rule xanth the elf retorted drag ons tolerate other creatures only as prey nonetheless the dragon ladys growl was muted smash suspected that she was not eager to incite a war with the transformerking of the human folk in response to another growl from his mistress the elf turned again to smash what are we to do with you he demanded smash shrugged me only distrust place where me rust actually neither his stainless steel gauntlets nor biythes brass rusted water was more likely to cause trou ble with the fires of the dragons but he was mindful of ogre ogre ogre ogre the ears stormsignal if he could trick the dragon lady into casting them into the storm their chances should be better than they were here metalrust the elf mused as the dragon lady growled true our ironscaled dragons do have a problem in inclement weather he glanced suspiciously at smash i dont suppose you could be fooling us me ghoul big fool smash said amiably obviously the elf agreed with open contempt so the dragon lady ordered the inedible party dumped into the region of air since the region of water did not border dragonland an abrupt demarcation established the border the near side was green turf and trees the far side a mass of roiling stormcloud smash didnt like this for he knew the others could not endure as much punishment as he could but now they were committed and it did seem better than staying among the dragons they took the pre caution of roping themselves together with chems rope so that no one would blow away they stepped across the line instantly they were in the heart of the wind choking on dust it was a dust storm not a rainstorm the flying sand cut cruelly into their skins smash picked up several girls and hunched his gross body over them protecting them somewhat as he staggered for ward then he tripped for he could not see his own flat feet in this blinding sand and fell and rolled holding him self rigid so as not to crush the girls he fetched up in a valley formed in the lee of a boulder chem thumped to a stop beside them here the sand by passed the party mostly and it was possible for each per son to pry open an eye or two thanks to the rope all were present though battered what do we do now tandy asked frightened the siren sat up and put the ear to her ear nothing here she reported but maybe the noise of this sand storm is drowning it out smash took the ear and listened i hear the brass space ship he said biythe took it i hear my own folk theyre playing the brass band i must be ready to go home are you sure the siren asked yes i think i am now the brass girl said i have experienced enough of your world to know i like mine bet ter you are all nice enough people but you just arent brass all too true the siren agreed we must find another gourd so smash can take you back we might all prefer your world at this moment maybe thats the silence you heard tandy said a gourd no theres lots of noise in the gourd smash said its an ogrishly fun place lets find that gourd biythe exclaimed she was hardly bothered by the sand she was merely homesick not until this storm dies down the siren said firmly gourds dont grow in this weather but this is the region of air the wind will never die biythe protested chem nodded agreement i have as you know been mapping the inner wilds of xanth thats why im here my preliminary research augmented by certain references along the way suggests that there are five major elemental regions in unknown xanth those of air earth fire wa ter and the void this certainly seems to be airand probably the storm never stops here well just have to plow on out of it i can plow biythe said eagerly she milled her brass hands and began tunneling through the mounded sand in moments she had started a tunnel good idea tandy exclaimed ill help she shook sand out of her hair and fell in behind the brass girl scoop ing the sand farther back soon the others were helping too for as the tunnel progressed the sand had longer to go before it cleared finally they were all doing it in a line with smash at the tail end packing the sand into a lengthening passage behind progress was slow but relatively comfortable peri odically biythe would tunnel to the surface to verify that the storm was still there when they came to a sheltering cliff they emerged and made better time on the surface the landscape was bleak all sand and more sand there were dunes and valleys but no vegetation and no water ogre ogre ogre ogre the wind was indefatigable it howled and roared and whistled it formed clouds and swirls and funnels doing its peculiar sculpture in the sky every so often a funnel would swoop in near the cliff trying to suck them into its circular maw but it could not maintain itself so close to the stone smash was aware that this must be a great frustra tion to the funnels which were rather like ogres in their wayall violence and brainlessness then they came to another demarcation as they stepped across it the winds abruptly ceased the air cleared miraculously but this was no improvement for the violence of the air was replaced by the violence of the land the ground shuddered and not by any ogres tread it was an earthquake oh i dont like this chem said ive always been accustomed to the firmness of ground beneath my hooves smash glanced at her the centaur girl was standing with her forelegs braced awkwardly in different directions her brown coat dulled by the recent sandscouring her tail all atremble and her human breasts dancing rather appeal ingly maybe the ground is firmer farther north he sug gested they turned northand encountered an active volcano redhot lava boiled out of it and flowed down the slope toward them oh this is worse yet chem complained slapping at a spark that landed in her pretty tail she was really shaken this was just not her type of terrain the siren listened to the gap dragons ear again say she said the sounds differ depending on which way i face she rotated listening intently to the north its a horrendous crashing thats the volcano we see i can hear the sound as i see it belch to the south its the roar ing of winds weve already been there to the west a sus tained rumblethe main part of the earthquake to the east she smiled beautifically a lovely quiet still si lence graves are silent tandy said with a shudder better a graveyard than this chem said we can walk on through a cemetery sometimes tandy agreed they turned east the ground shifted constantly beneath them as if trying to prevent progress but they were deter mined to get free of this region as the sun set tiredly beyond the volcano fortunately not landing inside it they reached another demarcation of zones just beyond it was a patch of hypnogourds the si lence was not of the grave but of a garden area i never thought id be glad to see a patch of those tandy said grimly this is where we spend the night the siren said while were at it lets find out whether those gourds are edible save one save one biythe cried of course dear try this one the siren handed the brass girl a nice big gourd biythe hesitated then looked into the peephole she looked back up theres nothing there she said nothing there it had not occurred to smash that any of the gourds could be inoperative he took the gourd from biythe and looked in and found himself in the spaceship spinning toward the ground hastily he grabbed the controls and tilted it back to equilibrium without the brass girl entangling him he could manage just fine in moments he brought the ship back to the city of brass and to the launching building he managed to turn it around and land fairly neatly then he got out and made his way through the moving buildings to the one where biythe lived number four following his string back he wondered idly whether he had left a trail of string strewn all over the sky near the moon he had lost that string in xanth but retained it here good enough the brassies clustered around him where is biyght they demanded were rehearsing with our brass band and we need her biythe she changed her name shell be back as soon as i can fetch her she heard you practicing and said she would come back very soon i had to find my way back here because spaceships scare her of course we are afraid of heights we dent when we fall too far biyght already had a dent in her dont speak of that to a stranger a brass girl told the male brassie ogre ogre so give me some time smash said and ill return her now i know how to do it they were not quite satisfied with this but let him be smash settled down in a niche that moved with the wall and snoozed chapter gourmet zoyrd he woke in xanth where tandy had taken away the gourd i never know how long to give you she said im very nervous about leaving you in there she lifted the gap dragons ear i kept listening in this and when it got pretty quiet i thought maybe it was time to bring you out i wasnt sure it was you i was listening to but since your health is relevant to mine smash took the ear he heard a guttural voice saying mirror mirror on the wall pass this fist or take a fall followed by a tinkling crash its not quiet now smash reported sounds like me talking she smiled talk all you want smash youre my main stay in this strange surface world i do worry when youre gone smash put his huge hairy paw over her tiny human hand i appreciate that tandy i know it would be bad for you if you got stranded alone in wilderness xanth but i am learning to handle things in the gourd and i am get ting stronger i hope so she said we all do need you and not just for protection from monsters chem says there seems to be a mountain range to the north that we cant scale the drag ons are to the east and the air storm to the south so well have to veer west back through the region of earthand that volcano is still spewing hot lava we shall just have to wait till the lava stops smash said yes but we dont know how long that will beand it ogre ogre ogre ogre will have to cool so we can walk over it i guess were here in the melon patch for a while yet so be it smash said he released her hand lest the inordinate weight of his own damage it did you say these gourds are edible oh yes certainly you can eat all you want were all full theyre very good just so long as you dont look in the peephole funny thing is theres no sign of any world in there no graveyard or anything she handed him a gourd peephole averted smash took a huge bite it was indeed good very sweet and seedy and juicy it did seem strange that something that could affect his consciousness could also be such good eatingbut of course that was the nature of things other than gourds a dragon could be a terrible enemybut was also pretty good eating once conquered that gourd i just looked into smash said between gulps why didnt it return biythe when she looked we discussed that while you were out tandy said she was the only one of the girls who remained awake the others were sleeping including the brass girl smash won dered briefly why a person made of metal needed to sleep then realized this was no more remarkable than a person of metal becoming animate at the punch of a button we concluded that she is merely a representation like you when youre in the gourd so she cant cross through by her self she has to be taken by one of us then her pretend body will vanish here just as yours vanishes there makes sense smash agreed consuming another gourd m a few bites did she disappear when i took her aboard the luna shuttle ship yes you remained holding nothing then she reap peared when we took the gourd away hugging you there was no room in that cockpit smash explained i understand she said somewhat distantly im out of the ship now and back in her building there wont be any trouble this time thats nice but please rest before you go back in there tandy said there is time while we wait for the lava to stop and smash glanced at her she was mostly a silhouette in the wan moonlight rather pretty in her pensiveness yes she shrugged take care of yourself smash ogres do he said cracking a smile it seemed to him that she had meant to say something more but of course girls changed their minds readily especially small girls whose minds were small or whatever when he was comfortably stuffed smash stretched out among the gourds and slept tandy settled against his furry forearm and slept too he was aware of her despite his unconsciousness and found he rather liked her cute little company he was becoming distressingly unogrish at times he would have to correct that as dawn brightened the lava dulled the volcano was quiescent the siren listened to the ear and reported si lence which she took to mean that they should wait for further cooling periodically she tossed damp fragments of gourd on the nearest hardening lava flow as long as it sizzled and steamed the time was not yet right are you ready to go home biythe smash asked the brass girl knowing the answer im back in the building good and ready ogre she agreed with alacrity she turned to the others no offense to you folk i like you but i dont understand this wideopen land its so much more secure in a brass building im sure it is dear the siren said embracing her maybe in due course the rest of us will find our own brass buildings and the way you have to sleep here instead of getting turned off by a buttonthats strange all creatures are strange in their own fashion chem said and we want to thank you for what you did with the dragons you may have saved our hides i took no risk biythe said but she flushed copper pleased then smash picked biythe up by her brassiere and keep your hand off her knee tandy warned everyone laughed and he looked into a delicious seeming gourd this time it worked they were both in the brass build ing the brassies spied them and clustered around there was ogre ogre a flurry of welcomings biythe was certainly glad to be home now if you folk can tell me some other way out of here i will depart smash said i dont want the space ship there must be some land route oh there is biythe said eagerly ill show you havent you had enough of me smash asked i feel i owe it to you to help you on your way she said defensively ill show you the way to the paper world as you wish smash agreed but you helped us con siderably what with the tunneling and such her face clouded turning leaden the dragons wouldnt eat me smash did not argue the point evidently the brass girl had more than one motive for her scene with the dragons biythe led him out a concealed door into a smaller chamber smash had to hunch over to fit in this one then the room jerked and moved causing him to bump into a wall this is an elevator biythe explained it leads to the paper works but it takes a little while ill wait smash said squatting down and leaning into a corner so he would not be bumped around too much biythe sat on one of his knees smash he suffered deja vu his eye queue insisted on run ning down the relevance immediately instead of allowing it to be the pleasant mystery nature intended tandy had ad dressed him in much the same way last night yes i wanted to talk to you a moment alone she confessed thats why i volunteered to show you the way theres something you should know where your dent is i cant show you that your knees in the way its some thing else you know something about the night stallion he asked interested no not that she said its about xanth oh smash im not part of your world but maybe i see something you dont those girls like you and i like them he admitted voicing the unogrish sentiment with a certain embarrassment how was be ever ogre ogre going to find his answer in life if he kept losing his iden tity theyre nice people so are you again she coppered i like them too i never knew flesh people before but thats not what i mean they theyre not just friends to you its hard for me to say be cause my own hearts made of brass theyre female youre male so so i protect them smash agreed because females arent very good at surviving by themselves ill help as long as they are with me and need protection that too but its more than that tandy especially yes she needs a lot of protection she hardly knows more of xanth than you do and shes not made of metal the brass girl seemed frustrated but she kept smiling her little teeth were brass too we talked some while you were in the gourdthats funny to think of my whole world as a gourdand tandy told us why she left home i may be violating a confidence but i really think you ought to know know what smash asked his eye queue informed him he was missing something significant that was an an noying part of the curse a true ogre wouldnt have wor ried why she left home you see there was this yemon named fiant who was looking for a wife well not a wife exactlyyou know a playmate you could call it that but tandy didnt want to play i gather a demon is like an ifrit not nice at all she refused to oblige him but he pursued her and tried to rape her what is that smash asked rape you actually dont know im not made of brass he reminded her theres lots i dont know there is a kind of plant in xanth by that name that girls shy away from she sighed the sirens right you are hopelessly natve maybe all males worth knowing are but of course thats why females exist someone has to know whats what look smashdo you know the way of a man with a woman her brass face was more coppery than ever and he realized this was an awkward subject for her ogre ogre of course not he reassured her im an ogre well the way of an ogre with an ogress certainly what was she getting at she paused im not sure were communicating maybe youd better tell me what is the way of an ogre with an ogress he chases her down screaming catches her by a rope of hair hauls her up by one leg bashes her head against a tree a few times throws her down sets a boulder on her face so she cant get away then tints rape biythe cried appalled thats fun he countered ogresses expect it and give back little ogres its the ogre mode of love well it isnt the human mode of love i know human beings are so gentle its a wonder they even know what theyre doing prince dor and princess irene have taken four years trying to get around to it now if they had a little more ogre heritage four seconds might be enough to ah yes she agreed well this demon tried to to make ogre love to tandy oh now i understand tandy wouldnt like that true shes no ogress so she left her home and sought help and the good magician told her to travel with you that way the demon cant get her sure if she wants that demon smashed ill do it thats my name thats not exactly what she wants you see she does want to marrysomeone other than the demon and she has a lot to offer the right male so she hopes to find a suitable husband on this journey but thats wonderful smash said in the best unogrish tra dition maybe well find a nice human man just right for her you didnt wait for my but smash your butt he asked looking at her brass posterior where your dent is but b u t she clarified as in however however has a dent she paused briefly forget the dent however she likes you ogre ogre certainly and i like her so i will help her find herself a man i dont think you understand smash she may not want to go with her ideal human man if she finds him if she likes you too well first he chortled nobody likes an ogre too well the brass girl shook her head doubtfully im not sure you are no ordinary ogre they inform me for one thing they told me youre much smarter than most of your kind thats because of the curse of the eye queue once i get rid of that ill be blissfully stupid again just like any other ogre maybe more so there is that biythe agreed i dont think tandy would like you to be just like any other ogre the room stopped moving after a jolt that bounced her off his knee well here we are at the paper world she said the elevator opened onto a literal world of paper greencolored fragments of paper served for a lawn brown and green paper columns were trees a flat paper sun hung in the painted blue sky at least this world had color in contrast with the monochrome of most of the rest of the gourd this is as far as i go biythe said as smash stepped out if its any comfort i think that in some ways youre still pretty stupid even with the eye queue thank you smash said flattered bye ogre the door closed and she was gone smash turned to the new adventure that surely awaited him paper was everywhere smash saw a bird idly he caught it out of the air in a paw not to hurt it but to look at it because it seemed strange it turned out to be strange in deed it too was made of paper the wings corrugated the body a cylinder of paper the beak a stiffened painted trian gle of cardboard he let it go and it flew away peeping with the rasp of stiff paper curious he caught a bug it was only an intricate convo lution of paper brightly painted when he released it the paper reconvoluted and the bug buzzed away there were butterflies also of paper the bushes and stones and pud dles were all colored paper it seemed harmless enough ogre ogre then a little paper machine charged up smash had seen machines during a visit to mundania and didnt like them they were ornery mechanical things this one was way too small to bother him seriously but it did bother him lightly it fired a paper spitball at him the spitball stung his knee smash smiled the minia ture machine had a name printed on its side tank it was cute the ogre stomped on the tank followed firing another damp paper ball it stung smash on the rump he frowned the humor was wearing thin he didnt care to have a dent to match that of the brass girl he turned to warn the tank awayand its third shot plastered his nose that did it smash lifted one brute foot and stomped the obnoxious machine flat it was only paper it collapsed readily but an unexpended spitball stuck to the ogres toe smash tromped on seeking whatever challenge this sec tion offered but now three more of the paper tanks arrived burpburpburp their spitballs spit in a volley at the ogre sticking to his belly like a line of damp buttons he stamped all three paper vehicles flat yet more tanks arrived and these were larger their spitballs stung harder and one just missed his eye smash had to shield his face with one hand while he stomped them he heard something behind a tank was chewing up his line of string that would prevent him from knowing when he crossed his own trail and he could get lost he strode back and picked up the tank looking closely at it the thing burped a huge splat of a spitball at him that plugged a nostril smash sneezedand the tank was blown into a flat sheet of paper words were printed on it get with it dope funnysmash had never learned how to read no ogre was smart enough for literacy but he grasped this message perfectly this must be another facet of the curse of the eye queue he pretended he did not fathom the words he turned againand saw a much bigger paper tank charging down on him he grabbed the tip of the card board cannon and pinched it closed just as the machine ogre ogre fired the backpressure blew up the tank in a shower of confetti but more and yet larger tanks were coming this re gion seemed to have an inexhaustible supply smash cast about for some way to stop them once and for all he had an idea he bent to scoop through the paperturf ground sure enough it turned to regular dirt below with rocks he found a couple of nice quartz chunks and bashed them together to make sparks soon he struck a fire the paper grass burned readily the tanks charged into the blazeand quickly caught fire themselves their magazines blew up in violent sprays of spit colored bits of paper flew up in clouds containing pictures and ads for products and all the other crazy things magazines filled their pages with soon all the tanks were ashes smash tromped on a paper tiger charged from the pa per jungle snarling and leaping smash caught it by the tail and shook it into limp paper the black and orange colors running he dipped this into a fringe of the fire and used the resulting torch to discourage other paper animals they faded back before his brightburning tiger and he pro ceeded unhampered apparently there was nothing quite so fearful as a burning tiger if this had been a battle he had won it now he came to a house of cards smash knew what cards were he had seen prince dor and princess irene playing games with them at castle roogna instead of get ting down to basics the way ogres would sometimes they had constructed elaborate structures from the cards this was such a structurebut it was huge each card was the height of smash himself with suit markings as big as his head and almost as ugly he paused to consider these at the near side was the nine of hearts he knew what hearts were the symbol of love this reminded him irrelevantly of what the brass girl had told him about tandy could it be true that the tiny human girl liked him more than was proper considering that ogres werent supposed to be liked at all if so what was his responsibility should he growl at her to discourage her that did seem best ogre ogre he entered the house of cards careful not to jostle it these structures collapsed very readily and after all this might be the way out of the paper land he felt he was making good progress through the worlds of the gourd and he wanted to go on to the last station and meet the dark horse the inner wall showed the two of clubs clubs were of course the ogres favorite suit there was nothing like a good heavy club for refreshing violence then there was the jack of diamonds symbolizing the wealth of dragons his curse of intellect made symbolism quite clear now he remembered how many of the bright little stones the dragon lady had had this was probably her card then there was the two of spades with its shovel symbol the suit of farmers in the center of the house of cards was the joker it de picted a handsomely brutish ogre with legs that trailed into smoke of course smash pushed against it assuming it to be his door to the next worldand the whole structure col lapsed the cards were not heavy of courseand in a moment smashs head poked above the wreckage he looked about the scene had changed the paper was gone the painted sky and cardboard trees existed no longer now there was a broad and sandy plain like that of the night mares realm except that this one was in daylight with the sun beating down hotly he spied an object in the desert it glinted prettily but not like a diamond curious smash stomped over to it it was a greenish bottle half buried in the sand fancily corked he found himself attracted to it a bottle like that its base properly broken off could make a fine weapon he picked it up inside the bottle was a hazy motion as of slowly swirling mist the cork had a glossy metallic seal with a word embossed fool well that was the nature of ogres he was thirsty in this heat maybe the stun in the bottle was good to drink smash ripped off the seal and used his teeth to pop the cork after all he was uncertain how long it would be be fore he came across anything potable here in the gourd but mainly his action was his eye queues fault because of it he was curious ogre ogre as the cork blasted free vapor surged out of the bottle it swelled out voluminously too badthis was neither edi ble nor potable and it smelled of sulfur smash sneezed the vapor formed a big greenish cloud swirling about but not dissipating into the air in a moment two muscular arms projected from it and the remainder formed into the head and upper torso of a gaseous mancreature about smashs own size who in the gourd are you smash inquired ho ho ho the creature boomed i be the ifrit of the bottle thou has freed me as thy reward i shall suffer thee to choose in what manner thou shalt die oh one of those smash said unimpressed a bottle imp he now recognized in retrospect this creature as the figure on the joker card he had taken it to be an ogre but of course ogres had hairy legs and big flat feet rather than trailing smoke dost thou mock me thou excrescence of excrement the ifrit demanded swelling angrily beware lest i squish thee into a nonentitious cube and make bouillon soup of thee look ifrit i dont have time for this nonsense smash said though the mention of the bouillon cube made him hungry he had squished a bull into a bouillon cube once and made soup with it he could use some of that now i just want to find the night stallion and vacate the lien on my soul if you arent going to help get out of my way surely i shall destroy thee the ifrit raged turning dusky purple he reached for the ogres throat with huge and taloned hands smash grabbed the ifrits limbs knotted them together in much the way he had tied the extremities of the ghastlies and jammed the creature headfirst back into the green bot tle oaf infidel the ifrit screamed his words somewhat distorted since his mouth was squeezed through the bottles neck what accursed mischief be this i warned you smash said using a forefinger to tamp more of the ifrit into the container dont mess with ogres they have no sense of humor struggle as he might the ifrit could not prevail against smashs power ooo ouch the voice came muffled ogre ogre from the glass ooooooo for smashs finger had rammed into the creatures gasous posterior then a hand came back out of the bottle it waved a white flag smash knew that meant surrender why should i pay attention to you he asked mmph of mum genuine free wish the voice cried from the depths of the bottle that sounded promising but i dont need a wish about how i will die mmmph oomph okay ifrit give me one positive wish smash re moved his finger the ifrit surged backward out of the bottle what is they wish horrendous one he asked nibbing his rear i want to know the way to the next world i was about to send thee there the ifrit exclaimed aggrieved the next gourd scene how do i get there oh the ifrit considered the closest be the mirror world but that be no place for the like of thee thy very visage would shatter that scene this creature was trying to lull him with flattery tell me anyway on thy fool head be it the ifrit made a dramatic gesture there was a blinding flash thou wilt besorree the creatures voice came fading away with descending pitch as if retreating at nearly the speed of sound smash pawed his eyes and gradually sight filtered back he stood among a horrendous assortment of ogres some were much larger than he some much smaller some were obesely fat some emaciatedly thin some had ballooning heads and squat feet others the other way around whats this he asked scratching his head though it had no fleas now this this this this the other ogres chorused in diminishing echo each scratching his head the eye queue needed only that much data to formu late an educated hypothesis mirrors ors ors ors ors the echoes agreed smash walked among the mirrors seeing himself pacing himself in multiple guises the hall was straight but after a ogre ogre while the images repeated suspicious he used a horny fin gernail to scratch a corner of one mirror then walked far ther down the hall checking corners sure enough he came across another mirror with a scratch on it just where he had made his mark it was the same one surely this hall was an endless reflection like two mirrors facing each other one of those endless loops he had been warned about in fact now he saw three lines of string he had been retracing his course he was trapped the ifrit had been right this was no place for the like of him already he was hungrier and there no food here how could he get out he could smash through a mirror and through the wall behind it of coursebut would that accomplish anything there were situations in which blind force was called for but other situations his eye queue curse reminded him obnoxiously called for subtler negotiation the trick was to tell them apart one could not conquer a mirror by break ing it one could only forfeit the game smash stared into the scratched mirror and his distorted image stared back the image was almost as ugly as he was but the distortion hampered it making it less repulsive than it should have been probably that was why it was snarling he turned and contemplated the three strands of string on the floor he saw where the first one started it came from another mirror so he had entered here through a mirror surely that was also the way to leave if he found some means to make another blinding flash would he be able to step through as before but he had no flash material then he remembered what he had beard in the gap dragons ear could that relate it had sounded like his voice talking about a mirror he decided to try it he positioned himself squarely before the mirror he el evated his hamfist mirror mirror on the wall he in toned imitating his own voice as well as he could pass this fist or take a fall then he punched forward his fist smashed through the glass and into the wall be hind it the mirror tinkled in pieces to the floor smash leaned forward to peer through the hole in the wall it opened on another hall of mirrors sure enough ogre ogre there was no escape there he was caught among the mir rors until he found the proper way out he tromped to the next mirror he raised his fist again and spoke his rhyme the he punched through with the same result this did not seem to be working but it was the only clue he had maybe when the other mirrors saw what was happening they would capitulate after all this technique had been effective with the shocking doorknobs the inani mate tended to be stupid as prince dor had shown but it did eventually leam what was good for it the change happened sooner than anticipated his fist did not strike the third mirror it passed through without resistance his arm and body followed it and he did a slow fall through the aperture he rolled on something soft and sat up he sniffed he looked he salivated he sat on a huge bed of cake replete with vanilla icing pastries and sweets were all about him piled high dough nuts strudel eclairs tarts cookies creampuffs ginger bread and more intricate pastries smash had been growing hungry before it had been well over an hour since he had last filled up now he was rav enous but again the damned curse of the eye queue made him pause the purpose of these worlds inside the gourd seemed to be to make him unhappy this food did not fit that purposeunless there were something wrong with it could it be poisoned poison did not bother ogres much but was best avoided one way to find out smash scooped up a glob of floor and crammed it in his big mouth the cake was excellent then he got up and explored the region keeping himself busy while waiting for the poison to act he had not eaten enough to cause real damage to the gross gut of an ogre but if he felt discomfort he would take warning he was in a large chamber completely filled with the pastries there was no apparent exit he punched experi mentally through a wall of fruitcake but the stuff seemed to have no end he suspected he could punch forever and only tear up more cake there appeared to be no reason able limit to the worlds that fit inside the gourd how then was he to escape this place ogre ogre his stomach suffered nothing but the ravages of increas ing hunger so he concluded the food was not poisoned still he hesitated there had to be some trap something to make him hurt if not poison what there seemed to be no threat no spitballshooting tanks no ifrit not even starva tion from delay well suppose he fell to and ate his fill where would he be still here with no way out if he remained long enough stuffing himself at will he would lose his soul by default in three months no point in that yet no sense in going hungry he grabbed a bunk of angelcake and gulped it down he felt angelic that was no mood for an ogre he chomped some devilsfood and felt devilish that was more like it he gulped some dream pie and dreamed of smiting the night stallion and recovering the lien on his soul wait he forced himself to stop eating lest he sink im mediately into the easy slough of indulgence better to keep hungry and alert his cursed taskmaster of an eye queue told him what did the eye queue care about hun ger it didnt have to eat but he went along with it for the moment knowing it would give him no peace otherwise he would reward himself only for making progress in solv ing this particular riddle that was discipline no ordinary ogre could master infuriating as it was still time was passing and he had no idea how to pro ceed there had to be something after all it wasnt as if he could simply eat his way out of here that thought made him pause why not eat out chew a hole in the wall until he ran out of edibleswhich would be another world no there would be too much cake for even an ogre to eat unless he knew exactly where a weak spot was weak spot surely so something that differed from the rest of this stuff smash started a survey course of eating looking for the difference all of it was excellent a master pastry chef had baked this chamber then he encountered a vein of licorice that was one confection smash didnt like it reminded him of manure true some ogres could eat and like manure but that just wasnt smashs own taste naturally he avoided this vein ogre ogre then his accursed annoying and objectionable eye queue began percolating again the eyes of the vine saw entirely too much especially what wasnt necessarily there manure what would leave manure in the form of a con fection answer some creature in charge of a chamber of con fections the night stallion perhaps when the stallion departed he would leave his token of contempt big brown balls of sweet manure what exit would the stallion use how could that exit be found answer the trail of manure would show the way horses hardly cared where they left it since it was behind them they left it carelessly thoughtlessly often on the run smash started digging out the licorice but when he did the foul stuff melted into other cake transforming it into licorice too that obscured the trail he had to do some thing about that he cast about but came up with only the least pleasant solution he would have to eat it that was the only way to get rid of it to consume the manure of the stallion fortunately ogres didnt have much pride about what they ate he nerved himself and bit in the licoricecake was awful truly feculent but he gulped it down anyway now his gorge was rising violently inside him ogres were supposed never to get sick no matter how rotten the stuff they ate but this was manure he ate on smash came to a round hole in the material of the cham ber the dung had led him to itsince this was the exit the stallion had taken smash scrambled through the passage knowing that if he could just choke down his revolted re volting stomach a little longer he would win this contest too he came to a dropoff and tumbled out spinning and turning in air now he was falling through darkness that last jolt of weightlessness was too much his stom ach burst its constraints and heaved its awful contents vio lently out the reaction sent him zooming backward through space smash puked it seemed for eons and worked up a velocity to rival that of the brass spaceship he hoped he didnt get lost in space beyond the stars chapter fond wand he was retching into the gourd patch apparent ly he had jetted himself right out of the gourd chem was using the hardened rind of an empty gourd to scoop the vomit away making room for more as it flowed volu minously from smashs mouth as he realized where he was his sickness abated he looked about the girls were in a sorry state all five of them were spattered we decided to get you out of the gourd before it got worse tandy said apologetically what happened i ate a lot of horseer manure smash said instead of cake and pastry ogres do have unusual tastes john remarked smash chuckled weakly wheres some decent food i dont want to eat any more gourds and im going to be hungry as soon as i feel better therell be food at goblinland goldy goblin said how far is that chem produced her map as i make it were close from what goldy tells me the main tribe of goblins is not far from here as the dragon flies just a few hours walk except that theres a mountain in the way so we have to go aroundacross the earth works that complicates it but i think the lava is cool enough now we had better get over it before more comes like hot vomit goldy muttered smash looked at the conic mountain it steamed a little but was generally quiescent yeslets cross quickly they started across goldy knew a little footcooling ogre ogre spell used by goblins and taught it to them it wasnt real magic but rather an accommodation to the local landscape smashs eye queue was cynical suspecting that any bene fit from the spell was simply illusion the belief in cooler feet yet his feet did feel cooler they had to skirt the volcanos eastern slope the cone rumbled annoyed but was in its offphase and could not mount any real action the ground however was rested it had energy to ex pend it shook making their travel difficult the shaking became more violent causing the hardened lava to craze to crack to break up and to form fissures exposing the redhot rock down below hurry chem cried her hooves dancing on the shift ing rocks smash remembered that insecure footing made her nervous now it made him nervous too oh i wish i coold fly again john cried terrified she stumbled and started to fall into a widening crack chem caught her get on my back she directed the fairy scrambled gratefully aboard the ground shook again a fragment turned under the sirens foot and she went down smash caught her lifted her high and saw that her ankle was twisted he would have to carry her now the volcano rumbled again it might be in its off phase but it wasnt entirely helpless a new fissure opened in its side and bright red lava welled out like fresh blood it spilled down toward them shifting channels to orient ac curately its coming for us tandy cried alarmed this land doesnt like us smash looked northeast the goblin territory was far across the treacherously shifting rocks already the lava plain was humping like a slow ocean swell as if trying to break free of its cool crust smash knew that if much more fragmentation occurred they would all fall through that crust into the liquid lava below too farl tandy cried despairingly we cant make it north chem said its better to the north they scrambled north though that horizon looked like a wall of fire the lava crust broke into big plates that in ogre ogre turn fragmented into platelets that slowly subsided under the weight of the party red lava squeezed up around the edges and leaked out onto the surface meanwhile the fresh lava from the fissure flowed down to join the turbu lent plain further melting the platelets there was now no retreat spread out goldy cried not too much weight on any one plate they did it the goblin girl was the most agile so she led the way finding the best plates and the best crossing places tandy followed glancing nervously back at smash as if afraid he would be too clumsy she did care for him it was obvious now that biythe had given him the hint but that was hardly worth worrying about at this moment they might all soon perish next in line was chem carrying john on her back her hooves handling the maneuvering well then came smash holding the siren in his arms her feet had converted back to the tail evidently that alleviated the pain in her ankle however her tail form was also her baretop form and the sight of all that juggling flesh made him ravenous again he hoped he never got so hungry that he forgot these were his friends the edges of the plates depressed alarmingly as they took smashs weight for it was concentrated in a smaller area than was the centaurs once a plate broke under his weight becoming two saucers and he had to scramble dip ping a toe in red lava it hurt terribly but he ran on your toe the siren exclaimed its scorched better that than falling in he grunted in case we dont make it she said id better tell you now youre a lot of creature smash ogres are big he agreed youre a fair morsel of creature yourself indeed she had continued to grow more youthful and was now a sight to madden men or so he judged from his alien viewpoint youre more than i think you know you could have been where youre going by now if you hadnt let the rest of us impose no i agreed to take tandy along and the rest of you have helped im not sure i could have handled the dragons alone or gotten out of the gourd ogre ogre you never would have gotten into the gourd alone she pointed out then you could have avoided the dragons would another ogre have taken tandy along he laughed he did that a lot since the advent of the eye queue for things he wouldnt have noticed before now evinced humorous aspects another ogre would have eaten the bunch of you i rest my case rest your tail too while youre at it if i fall into the lava youll have to walk alone it was her turn to laugh somewhat faintly or swim she said looking down at the lava cracks now they were at the border the wall of fire balked them goldy stood on the plate nearest it daunted i dont know how much fire there is she said goblin legend suggests the wall is thin but we cant stay here tandy said ill find out and she took a breath and plunged into the fire the others stood on separate plates appalled then tan dys voice came back its all right come on through smash closed his eyes and plunged toward her voice the flame singed his fur and the flowing hair of the mer maid then he was on firm ground coughing he stood on a burnedout field wisps of smoke rose from lingering blazes but mostly the ashes were cool far ther to the north a forest fire raged however and periodi cally the wind shifted bringing choking smoke and sprin kling new ashes to the west there seemed to be a lake of fire sending up occasional mushroomshaped masses of smoke to the east there was something like a flashing field of fire with intermittent columns of flame chem and john landed beside smash the fairy was busy slapping out smolders in the centaurs mane this is an improvement but not much of one chem said lets get off this burn i second the motion tandy agreed she too had suf fered during the crossing parts of her brown hair had been scorched black goldy appeared in similar condition none of the girls was as pretty as she bad been they moved east paralleling the thin wall of fire this was the region of fire but since fire had to have some thing to bum they were safe for the moment ogre ogre then a column of white fire erupted just ahead of them the heat of it drove them backonly to be heated again by another column to the side gas the siren said it puffs up from fumaroles then ignites and burns out can we tell where the next ones will be they watched for a few moments only where theyve been chem said the pattern of eruption and ignition seems completely random that means well get scorched the siren said unless we go around but there was no way around for the forest fire was north and the lava flows were beyond the firewall to the south also new foliage was sprouting through the ashes on which they stood emerging cracklingly dry it would catch fire and bum off again very soon it seemed the ashes were very rich fertilizer but there was very little water for the plants so they grew dehydrated here in the region of fire there was no long escape from fire how can we get through tandy asked despairingly smash put his eye queue curse to work yet again he was amazed at how much he seemed to need it now that he had it when he had never needed it before as if intelli gence were addictive it kept generating new uses for itself he was also amazed at what his stupid bonemuscle ogre brain could do when boosted by the queue and cudgeled by necessity go only where theyve been he said the others didnt understand so be showed the way follow mehe watched for a dying column then stepped near it as it flickered out there would be a little while before it built up enough new gas to fire again he waited in the diminishing shimmer of heat watching the other columns when another died next to his own he stepped into its vacated spot the other members of the party followed him ill as sume this is wit instead of luck the siren murmured smash was still carrying her though now she had switched back to legs and dress in case he had to set her down as they moved to the third fumarole the first fired again these flares did not dawdle long now they were in the middle of the columns unable to escape unscathed but ogre ogre ogre ogre smash stepped forward again into another dying flame panting in the stink of it yet surviving unbumed in this manner the party made its precarious and un comfortable way through the fires and came at last to the east firewall they plunged throughand found them selves in the pleasant rocky region of the goblins what a relief tandy exclaimed nothing could be worse than that except maybe whats inside a gourd you havent met the local goblins yet goldy muttered there was a small stream paralleling the wall cool and clean they all drank deeply catching up from their long engagement with the heat then they washed themselves off and tended to their injuries the siren bound her ankle with a bolt of gauze from a gauzebush and tandy tended to smashs scorched toe goldy will find her husband here smash said as she worked soon we may find a human husband for you he hoped he was doing the right thing bringing the matter into the open she looked up at him sharply who squealed she de manded biythe said you were looking for what does she know tandy asked smash shrugged awkwardly this wasnt working out very well not much perhaps when the time comes ill make my own decision smash could not argue with that maybe the brass girl had been mistaken biythes heart as she had noted was brass and perhaps she was not properly attuned to the hearts made of flesh but smash had a nagging feeling that wasnt it these females seemed to have a common aware ness of each others nature that males lacked maybe it was just that they were all interested in only one thing any way well deliver goldy soon they found no food so they walked on along the river which curved eastward north of the mountain range that separated this land from that of the dragons the goblins had to be somewhere along here perhaps occupying the mountains themselves goblins did tend to favor dark holes and deep recesses few were seen in open xanth though smash understood that in historical times the goblins had dominated the land it seemed they had become less ugly and violent over the centuries and this led inevitably to a diminution of their power he had heard that some isolated goblin tribes had become so peaceful and handsome that they could hardly be distinguished from gnomes that would be like ogres becoming like small giants astonishing and faintly disgusting the river broadened and turned shallow finally petering out into a big dull bog brightly colored fins poked up from the muck and nostrils surmounting large teeth quested through it obviously the main portions of these creatures were hidden beneath the surface it did not seem wise to set foot within that bog especially not with a sore toe they skirted it walking along the slope at the base of the mountain range the day was getting late and smash was dangerously hungry where were the goblins then the goblins appeared an army of a hundred or so swarmed around the party what are you creeps doing here the goblin chief demanded with typical goblin cour tesy goldy stepped forward i am goldy goblin daughter of the leader of the gap chasm goblins gorbage she announced regally never heard of them the chief snapped get out of our territory pasteface what goldy was taken aback she was very fair for a goblin but it wasnt merely the name that put her at a loss i said get out or well cook you for supper but i came here to get marriedl she protested the goblin chief swung backhanded catching the side of her head and knocking her down not here you dont for eign stranger slut he turned away and the goblin troops began to move off but tandy acted she was furious how dare you treat goldy like that she demanded she came all the way here at great personal risk to get married to one of your worthless louts and youyou the goblin chief swung his hand at her as he had at goldy but tandy moved faster she made a hurling ges ture in the air with her face red and her eyes squinched almost shut the goblin flipped feet over ears and landed stunned on the ground she had thrown a tantrum at him ogre ogre smash sighed he knew the rules of interspecies deal ings how goblins treated one another was their own busi ness that was why these goblins had left smash and the rest of his party alone their personal interplay was rough but they were not looking for trouble with ogres or centaurs or human folk unlike the prior goblin tribe this one honored the conventions but now tandy had interfered and that made her fair game the goblin lieutenants closed on her immediatelyand tandy like an expended fumarole had no second tantrum to throw in selfdefense but chem john and the siren closed about her you dare to attack human folk the siren demanded she was limping on her bad ankle but was ferocious in her wrath you folk arent human a goblin lieutenant said youre centaur fairy and memymphand this other looks to be part nymph too and she attacked our leader her life is forfeit by the rules of the jungle smash had not chosen this conflict but now he had to intervene these three with me he grunted in his stress reverting to his natural ogre mode he indicated tandy with a hamfinger she too me do the lieutenant considered evidently the goblins were hierarchically organized and with the chief out of order the lieutenant had discretionary power goblins were tough to bluff or back off once aroused especially when they had the advantage of numbers still this goblin hesitated three or four females were one thing an ogre was another a hundred determined goblins could probably overcome one ogre but many of them would be smashed to pulp in the process and many more would find then heads embedded in the trunks of trees and a few would find themselves flying so high they might get stuck on the moon most of the rest would be less fortunate so this goblin negotiated while others hauled their unconscious leader away this one must be punished the lieutenant said if our chief dies she must die so it is written in the verbal cove nant an eyeball for an eyeball a gizzard for a gizzard smash knew how to negotiate with goblins it was merely a matter of speaking their language he formed a huge and gleaming metal fist she die me vie the lieutenant understood him perfectly but was in a ogre ogre difficult situation it looked as if there would have to be a fight then the goblin chief stirred perhaps because he was uncomfortable being dragged by the ears over the rough ground he was recovering consciousness he isnt dead the lieutenant said relieved that wid ened his selection of options but still she must be pun ished we shall isolate her on an island isolation that didnt seem too bad nevertheless smash didnt trust it me scratch he said scratching his flealess head stupidly where catch the goblin studied him evidently assessing smashs depth of stupidity the island sinks he said you may rescue her if you choose but there are unpleasant things in the bog smash knew that he didnt want to see tandy put on a sinking island in that bog yet he did not have his full strength and hunger was diminishing him further and that meant he could not afford to indulge in combat with the goblins at this time in addition his eye queue reminded him snidely tandy had attacked the goblin chief and so made herself liable to the goblins judgment the goblins if not exactly right were also not exactly wrong the goblin lieutenant seemed to understand the struggle going on in the ogres mind goblins and ogres differed from one another in size and intelligence but were similar in personality both sides preferred to avoid the mayhem that would result if they fought we will give you a fair chance to rescue her me dance smash said ironically tapping the ground with one foot so that the terrain shuddered what chance a magic wand the lieutenant signaled and a goblin brought an elegant black wand me no fond of magic wand smash said dubiously he continued to use the ogre rhymes having concluded that stupidity or the appearance of it might be a net asset all you have to do is figure out how to use it the goblin said then you can draw on its magic to help the girl we dont know its secret but do know it is magic we will help you figure it out if you wish that was a considerable riski he bad to figure out the ogre ogre operative mechanism of a wand that had so baffled the goblins that they were willing to help him use it to defeat their decree of punishment they would have spent days months or years on it he might have minutes what chance would a smart man have let alone a stupid ogre what person of even ordinary intelligence would agree to such a deal why would the goblins risk such a device in the hands of a stranger anyway suppose he did figure out the opera tion of the wand by some blind luck he could be twice as dangerous to them as he already was ah but there was the answer an ogre was stupid al most by definition he could be far more readily conned out of his advantage than could a smart person also the activated wand might be dangerous acting against the user of course they would help him solve its secret if it de stroyed the user no loss only an absolutely idiotically calamitously stupid or desperate creature would take that risk john sidled up to smash goblins are cunning wretches she whispered we fairies have had some deal ings with them i think they mistreated goldy deliberately to get you into this picklement im sure of it goldy agreed a bruise was showing on her cheek but she seemed otherwise all right my own tribe is that way my father threatened to eat you all when he doesnt even like ogre or centaur meat just to force you to take me here it does seem to be an effective ploy smash whispered back but we would have taken you anyway had we known you if brass girls could blush copper goblin girls blushed tan you mean you folk like me certainly we do tandy agreed and you helped us cross the lava plates leading the way and you told us a tremendous lot about the hypnogourds so that smash knows how to save his soul well goblins arent too popular with other creatures goldy said wiping an eye nor with their own kind it seems tandy said because the chief hit me think nothing of it goblin ogre ogre men are just a little bit like ogres in that respect it makes them think they run things ogres arent too popular with other creatures either smash said they beat up their wenches too this lesson in comparative romance is fascinating john said still were in trouble pick tandy up and run out of here goldy advised thats the only way to deal with our kind but smash knew that the other girls would pay the pen alty for that he had fallen into the goblins trap he would have to climb out of it his one advantage was that he was thanks to the curse of the eye queue considerably smarter than the goblins thought me try to spy he told the lieu tenant very well ogre the lieutenant said smugly take the wand experiment with it while we place her on the is land goblins grabbed tandy and hustled her into a small wooden boat she struggled but they moved her along any way she sent a betrayed look back at smash evidently feeling with part of her mind that he should fight and he felt like a betrayer indeed but he had the welfare of the entire party in mind so he had to act with unogrish delibera tion this grated but had to be if the wand didnt work he would charge through the bog and rescue her regardless of the fins even if the fins proved to be too much for him he should be able to toss her to the safe bank before going under they dumped her on an islet that seemed to be mostly reeds as her weight settled on it the structure hissed and bubbled from below and slowly lowered toward the liquid muck surface a purple fin cruised in and circled the pneumatically descending isle smash concentrated on the wand while goblins and girls watched silently he waved it in a circle bobbed it up and down poked it at imaginary balloons in the air and shook it nothing happened go schmoe he ordered it but it ignored even that command he bent it between his hands it flexed then sprang back into shape it was supple and well made but evinced no magic property meanwhile tandys isle continued to sink the purple ogre ogre ogre ogre fin cruised in tighter circles tandy stood in the spongy center terrified but he couldnt watch her he had to concentrate on the wand it was evident that his random motions werent being successful what was the key eye queue find the clue he thought emphatically it was high time he got some use from this curse when it really counted the queue went to work it considered mental riddles a challenge it even enjoyed thinking assume the wand was activated by motion because that was the nature of wands they were made to wave about assume that trialanderror motion wouldnt do the trick because the goblins would have tried everything assume that the key was nevertheless simple so that the wand could be readily used in an emergency what motion was both simple and subtle a signaturekey he decided a particular motion no one would guess perhaps attuned to a particular person but how could he guess its nature tandys isle was almost down to muck level and the circling fin was almost within her reach or vice versa smash could not afford to ponder much longer goblin man help if can smash called after all the goblins wanted to know the secret too all we know ogre is that it worked for the crone we stole it from the lieutenant replied she would point it at a person or thing and the object would levitate that is rise the goblin thought smash would not know the mean ing of the more complicated term but when we tried it nothing levitation that would certainly help tandy but he needed to get it started in a hurry crone so smart how she start she looped it in a series of loops the goblin said but when we made the same loops nothing happened tandys feet were now disappearing into the muck only the submerged mass of the isle balked the finfor now give poop what loop smash demanded like this the goblin described a partial circle with a tuck in it that looks like a g john remarked apparently fair ies were literate too g a letter of the human alphabet suddenly smashs intellect pounced what was a signature except a series of letters a written name johns own case illustrated the importance of a name her entire mission was simply to locate her correct one one could not choose just any name because only the right one had power this should apply for wands as well as for fairies here in xanth maybe it was different inside the gourd where names could be changed at will what name of dame grungy grool the goblin answered she was a witch a witch with the initials g g suppose the wand tuned in to the signature of its holder smash described a big careful s nothing happened holding his disappointment in check he described a matching smash ogrehis initials still nothing the wand remained quiescent in his ham hand what now tandy screamed her isle was giving way and she was toppling into the muck smash aimed the wand like an arrow ready to hurl it at the fin tandys fall stopped midway she hung suspended at an angle above the bog right where smash was pointing the wand is working john cried amazed and grati fied slowly smash tilted the wand up tandy floated re maining in its power of course the activated wand had not moved in his hand before that wasnt the way it worked be had to move itto make some other object respond im flying tandy cried he made it work the goblin lieutenant exclaimed smash guided tandy carefully to land andset her down her feet were muddy and she was panting with reaction but she was otherwise unharmed he knew a spunky little girl like her would rebound quickly the goblin lieutenant rushed up give me that wand ogre dont do it john cried ogre ogre but smash ever the stupid ogre blithely handed over the wand it is goblin property he murmured forgetting to rhyme the goblin snatched the wand pointed it at smash and lifted it smash did not rise into the air the wand was not attuned to the goblin it remained useless to anyone else exactly as it had been when taken from its witchowner smash had suspected this would be the case but you made it work the goblin protested angrily and you tried to turn it against him goldy cried do you call that goblin honor well hes just a stupid ogre the goblin muttered what does he know ill tell you what he knows goldy flashed hes a lot smarter than me smart at heart smash said interrupting her goldy paused then exchanged a glance of understanding with him smarter than the average ogre she concluded the goblin lieutenant formed a crafty expression too subtle for the average ogre to fathom very well ogre teach her how to work the wand if its not a fluke he gave the wand to goldy so the goblins figured to get the secret from her smash understood perfectly but he smiled vacuously happily me teach she me goldy asked surprised smash you dont really want to smash put his huge mitt on her hand you have a mind of your own chiefs daughter he murmured use it gently he moved her hand making the wand ascribe the letters g g her initials then he stepped back i dont understand goldy said gesturing with the wand three goblins sailed into the air as the moving wand pointed at them shes got it the goblin lieutenant exclaimed good enough give it here girl he advanced on her goldy pointed the wand at him and lifted it he rose up to treetop height give what where dolt she inquired sweetly the lieutenant scrambled with hands and feet but ogre ogre merely made gestures in the air get me down wretch he screamed she waved the wand carelessly causing him to careen in a high circle do what who youll pay for this you bi the goblin broke off as he was pitched upside down just clear of the bog a blue fin cut across and began circling under his nose smash goldy said sweetly why dont you and your friends have a good meal while i try to get the hang of this wand i might need some advice to prevent me from acci dentally hurting someone and the goblin lieutenant spun crazily just missing a tree feed them feed them the goblin cried this crazy slyoung lady goblin will be the death of me i might at that if i dont learn to manage this thing better goldy agreed innocently the wand quivered in her hand and the goblin did a bonerattling shake in the air almost dropping to within reach of the slavering blue fin the goblins hastily brought out food smash stuffed himself in excellent ogre fashion on strawberryflavored cavern mushrooms and curdled seacow milk while the goblin girl experimented with the wand lifting first one goblin then another let someone else try it a goblin suggested craftily goldy glanced at smash who nodded then she handed the wand to the first taker the wand went dead again several goblins tried it with out result it occurred to smash that if one of them should have the inititals g g as was hardly beyond the reach of coincidence the wand might workbut that never hap pened probably it was not only the key but the particular person signing it another g g goblin would have to make his own g g signature that was a pretty sophisticated instrument give me that goldy said taking it back it still worked for her once the wand was keyed to a particular person it stayed that way since the goblins were illiterate they never would catch on to the mechanism most likely the meal concluded smash rubbed his belly and let out a resounding belch that blew the leaves off the nearest bush ogre ogre well i cant say it hasnt been fun goldy said offer ing the wand back to smash smash refused it wordlessly you mean i can keep it she asked amazed keep it the siren said i think you will have no trou ble getting a suitable husband here now probably a chief whatever you choose goldy considered contemplating the wand there is that power is a language we goblins understand somewhat too well she faced smash again ogre i dont know what to say no goblin would have done this for you hes no ordinary ogre tandy said giving smashs arm a squeeze keep the wand use it well i will goldy agreed and there seemed to be an un goblinish tear in her eye if any of you folk ever have need of goblin assistance just in getting out of here chem said any informa tion on the geography to the north would be appreciated goldy gestured toward the lieutenant with the wand information hastily the goblins acquainted chem with what they knew of the reaches to the north which wasnt much well fed the party set out as dusk fell following the bog to the river and the river until it petered out they camped near the firewall snacldng on some leftover mushroom tid bits goldy had arranged to have packed they would have to cross the region of fire again to get where they were going as the goblins had assured them that it went right up to the land of the griffins which beasts were hostile to travelers that was a generous thing you did smash the siren said you could so readily have kept the wand especially after they tried to trick you out of it and use it against you goldy had better use for it smash said why should an ogre crave more power one thing i dont understand john said you say you were victimized by the eye queue vine that makes you smarter than an ordinary ogre whose skull is filled with bone correct smash agreed uncomfortably but that does not account for your generosity does it ogre ogre you have let the rest of us impose on you and you did something really nice for goldy and i dont think another ogre would not even a smart one goblins are like ogres only smaller and smarter and they dont do anything for anybody smash scratched his head still no fleas maybe i got confused maybe so the fairy replied thoughtfully tandy and chem and the siren nodded smiling with that certain fe male knowingness that was so annoying chapter l heat wave jmashs eye queue would not leave well enough alone that was its most annoying trait he greeted the next morning with doubts how do we know the griffins are unfriendly he asked can we trust the information of the goblins we do know the fire is dangerous on the other hand we certainly do john agreed my wings will never grow back if i keep singeing them but griffins are pretty violent creatures and they do eat people lets travel near the firewall the siren suggested that way we can cross over and risk the fire if the grif fins turn out to be too ferocious they did that but soon the bog closed in squeezing them against the firewall the colored fins paced them ea gerly chem halted i think we have to make a decision she said as she updated her mapimage ill check the other side smash said setting down the siren he stepped across the firewall he was at the edge of the fumaroles amidst fresh ashes not far north the forest fire continued to rage there was no safe passage here he saw a shape in the ashes curious he uncovered it it was the burnedout remnant of a large tree trunk still smoldering the fall of ashes had smothered it before it finished its own burning smash wondered when a tree of this size ever had a chance to grow here maybe it had fallen across the firewall from the other side then he bad a notion he put his gloved hamhands on ogre ogra the charred log and heaved it back through the firewall then he stepped through himself a boat he announced a boat tandy exclaimed delighted of course they went to work with a will scraping out ashes and burnedout fragments and splinters then they launched the dugout craft in the muck smash ripped out a sapling to use as a pole so he could shove their boat forward he remembered traveling similarly with prince dor but this was more challenging because now he had responsibility for the party the colored fins crowded in as the craft slid through the bog at length smash became annoyed and used the tip of his pole to poke at the nearest fin there was a chomp and the pole abruptly shortened angry smash reached out with a gauntleted hand and caught hold of the offending fin he heaved it out of the water the creature turned out to be flshlike with strong flukes and sharp teeth what are you smash demanded shaking it the thing was heavy but smash had over half his ogre strength back now and was able to control his cap tive im a loan shark idiot the fish responded and smash did not have the wit until his eye queue jogged him snidely later to marvel that a fish spoke human language want to borrow anything prompt service easy terms dont do it john cried you borrow from one of them itll take an arm and a leg in return thats how they live you have already borrowed part of my pole smash told the shark i figure you owe me ill take a fin and a fluke thats not the way it works the shark protested no one skins sharks there is always a first time smash said he had a fundamental understanding of this kind of dealing he put his other hand on the things tail and began to pull the shark struggled and grunted but could not free it self what do you want it screamed i want to get out of this bog smash said ill get you out the shark was quite accommodating now that it was in a bad position just let me go ogre ogre dont trust it any farther than you can throw it john advised smash was not about to he used one finger to poke a hole in the sharks green fin and passed chems rope through it then he heaved the creature forward it landed with a dull muddy splash before the dugout the rope pull ing taut thats as far as i can throw it smash said the shark tried to swim away but as it moved it hauled the boat along behind it was not trustworthy but it seemed to be seaworthy or bogworthy now you can swim anywhere you want to sharky smash called to it but ill loose the rope only when we reach the north edge of this bog help help me brothersi the shark called to the other fins that circled near are you helpless one called back in that case ill be happy to tear you apart sharks never help each other john remarked thats why they dont rule xanth ogres dont help each other either smash said the same for most dragons and he realized that he had suf fered another fundamental revelation about the nature of power human beings helped each other and thus had be come a power in xanth far beyond anything that could be accounted for by their size or individual magic meanwhile the loan shark got the message it was living on borrowed time unless it moved it thrust north and the bog fairly whizzed by soon they were at the north bank they climbed out and smash unthreaded the rope the shark vanished instantly no one sympathized with it it had for once been treated as it treated others but now the griffins came probably another shark had snitched so the griffins had been alert for the partys ar rival since the creatures probably intended no good smash stepped quickly across the firewall for a peek at that situation he found himself in the middle of the forest fire no hope therel the great birdheaded lionbodied creatures lined up in specting the motley group the monsters were the color of shoe polish then they charged smash reacted automatically he swung his pole knock ing the first griffin back then he dived across the fire ogre ogre wall ripped a burning sapling out of the ground dived back and hurled the flaming mass at the remaining grif fins the sapling was of firewood which burned even when green in a moment the wing feathers of the griffins were burning the monsters squawked and hurled themselves into the bog to douse the flames the colored fins of the sharks clustered close youre using our muck a shark cried you owe us a wing and a paw the griffins did not take kindly to this solicitation a battle erupted muck feathers and pieces of fin flew out ward and the mud boiled smash and the girls walked northwestward following the curve of the firewall leaving the violence behind the landscape was turning nicer with occasional fruit and nut trees so they could feed as they traveled the siren rested by her tour in the boat and periodic dippings of her tail found she could walk now that light ened smashs burden there were birds here flitting among the trees picking at the trunks scratching into the ground the farther the party went the more there were now and then flocks darkened the sky not only were they becoming more nu merous they were getting larger then a flight of really large birds arrivedthe fabulous rocs these birds were so big they could pick up a medium sized dragon and fly with it was their intent friendly or hostile a talking parrot dropped down ho strangers it hailed them what melodies bring you to birdland smash looked at the parrot it was all green and red with a downcurving beak we only seek to pass through he said we are going north you are going west the bird said so they were the gradually curving firewall had turned them about they reoriented bearing north welcome to pass through birdland the parrot said there will be a twenty per cent poll tax one of your number will have to stay here that isnt fair tandy protested each of us has her own business we are not concerned with fairness the poll replied ogre ogre ogre ogre while the horrendously huge rocs drifted lower their enor mous talons dangling we are concerned with need we need people to cultivate our property so there will be more seeds for us to eat so we hold a reasonable share of those who pass a sharefor slavery tandy demanded her spunky spirit showing again call it what you will one of you will stayor all will stay the tax will be paid and the rocs dropped lower yet poll your number to determine the one smash knew it would be useless to fight he might break the claws of one roc but another would carry away the girls the big birds had too much power well see he said tandy turned on him well seel you mean youll go along with this abomination we dont have much choice smash said his eye queue once again dominating his better ogre nature well just have to cross this land then decide who will remain you traitor tandy flared you coward the siren tried to pacify her but tandy moved away her face red and body stiff and hurled an invisible tan trum at smash it struck him on the chest and its impact was devastating smash staggered back the wind knocked out of him no wonder the goblin chief had fallen those tantrums were potent his head gradually cleared smash found himself sitting down little clouds of confusion dissipating tandy was be side him hugging him as well as she could with her small arms oh im so sorry smash i shouldnt have done that i know youre only trying to be reasonable ogres arent reasonable he muttered its just thatone of ushow can we ever callously throw one to the wolves to the birds i mean it just isnt right i dont know he said well have to work it out i wish we had the wand she said the siren came to them we do have the ear she reminded them there is that tandy agreed let me hear it she took the gap dragons ear and listened carefully silent she reported smash took it from her and listened for him too it was silent chem had no better result i fear it has gone deador we have no future she said nowhere to go john was the last to listen her face brightened i hear something she exclaimed singingfairies singing there must be fairies nearby well thats what youre looking for the siren said lets see if theyre within birdland maybe we can get some advice on how to proceed there seemed to be nothing better to do smash lurched to his feet amazed at the potency of tandys tantrum he still felt weak an ogress could hardly have hit him harder yet more than that he marveled at her quick reversal of mood she had been almost savagely impetuousthen hu manly sorry too bad he mused she hadnt been bom an ogress that tantrumit also reminded him a bit of one of his mothers curses he shook his head foolish fantasy was pointless he had to clear his reeling noggin and get moving and find tandy a good humantype husband so the demon wouldnt bother her any more good magician humfrey must have known that there would be a suitable man for her some where in this wilderness a man she would never encounter unless she traveled here since smash was passing this way anyway it had been easy enough to take her along the truth was she was nice enough company tiny and temper amental as she was he had not had much company like that before and was becoming acclimated to it he knew this was unogrish maybe such ridiculous feelings would pass when he got rid of the eye queue curse they proceeded on following john who used the ear to orient on the fairies the rocs paced them they would not be able to depart birdland without paying their poll toll one body actually smash might have a way around that if he went back into the gourd and fought the night stallion and lost his soul would be forfeit pretty soon and there would be no point in proceeding north so in that event he might as well stay here himself the only problem was how would the others survive without him he had no confi dence that they were beyond the worst of the dangers of central xanth ogre ogro as they continued they saw more and more birds some were brightly plumed some drab some large some small some ferocious of aspect with huge and knifelike beaks some meek with soft little feathers there were bright blue birds dull blackbirds and brightly dull spotted birds there were fat round robins and thin pourbeakers they went on there were ruffled grouse angrily com plaining about things godwits making profane jokes sand pipers playing little fifes on the beach black rails lying in parallel rows on the ground oven birds doing the morning baking mourning doves sobbing uncontrollably goshawks staring with amazement a crane hauling up loads of stones and several big old red barn owls filled with hay nearby were grazing cowbirds and cattle egrets and a cat bird was stalking a titmouse tail swishing birds are funny folk the siren murmured i never realized there was so much variety in due course they came to the palace of the kingbird better bow good and low the parrot advised his high ness the bird of a feather the ruler of xanth first on the pecking order doesnt appreciate disrespect from inferi ors ruler of xanth chem cried what about the cen taurs what about king trent tandy asked who the parrot asked the human ruler of xanth in castle roogna never heard of him the kinglpird governs smash realized that to the birds the bird species domi nated xanth to the goblins the goblins governed the same was probably true for the dragons griffins flies and other species and who could say they were wrong each species honored its own leaders smash an ogre was quite ready to be objective about the matter when in birdland do as the birdbrains did he bowed to the kingbird as he would have done to the human king of xanth to each his own mark of honor the kingbird was reading a tome titled avion artifacts by omith ology and had no interest in the visitors soon smashs party was on its way again they came to a large field filled with pretty flowers these are our birdseed plants the parrot explained we ogre ogro have wormfarms and fishfarms and funnybonefarms and make periodic excursions to flyland for game but the bulk of our food comes from fields like this we are not apt at cultivationbirdshot doesnt seem to do well for usso we draw on the abilities of lesser creatures like yourselves indeed smash saw assorted creatures toiling in the field there were a few goblins an elf a brownie a gremlin a nixie and a sprite they were obviously slaves yet they seemed cheerful and healthy enough acclimated to their lot then smash had a notion john listen to the ear again the fairy did so the waterfall noise almost drowns it out but i think i hear the fairies close by she oriented on the sound going in the direction it got louder the others following they rounded a gentle hill descended into a waterfallfed gully and came across the fairies they were mending feathers it seemed some of the birds were too impatient to wait for new feathers to grow so they had the damaged ones repaired only fairies could do such delicate work each had a little table with tiny tools so that the intricate work could be done and most of them had damaged wings the birds tandy said appalled they crippled the fairies so they cant fly away not so the parrot said we do not mutilate our work ers because then they get depressed and do a poor job rather we offer sanctuary for those who are dissatisfied elsewhere most of these fairies were cast out of fairy land tandy was suspicious she approached the nearest work ing fairy is this true she asked do you like it here the fairy was a male finely featured in the manner of his kind he paused looking up from his feather oh its a living he said since i lost my wings i couldnt make it in fairyland so i have to settle for what i can get no monsters attack me here no one teases me for my wing handicap theres plenty of food and the work is not ar duous id rather be flying of coursebut lets be realistic ill never fly again smash saw one fairy down the line with undamaged ogre ogre ogre ogre wings what about him he asked why doesnt he fly away the fairy frowned he has a private complaint dont bother him but smash was in pursuit of his notion would it relate to his name look the fairy said we arent trying to aggravate your condition so why do you bother us leave him alone john had caught on oh smashim afraid to ask im an insensitive ogre smash said ill ask he tromped over to the fairy in question me claim he name he said in his stupid fashion the fairy naturally assumed the ogre was as dull as he was supposed to be it was all right to tell secrets to stupid folk because they didnt know enough to laugh i am called joan he said now go away monster smash dropped his pretense that must be as embar rassing for you as intelligence is for an ogre he said joans eyes widened and his wings trembled causing the cloud pattern on them to roil yes he agreed smash signaled to john diffidently she approached here is the one who got your name or one letter of it smash said trade him your h for his a and both of you will be restored the two fairies looked at each other joan john asked john joan asked i suspect the two of you are the same age and took delivery of your names by the same carrier smash said probably the paste orifice it always gums things up you should compare notes joan reached out and took johns hand smash was no proper judge of fairy appearance but it seemed to him that joan was quite a handsome young male of his kind and john was certainly pretty except for her lost wings here in birdland that particular injury did not count for much the two of them seemed almost to glow as their hands touched chem and tandy and the siren had joined smash what is that tandy asked is something wrong no chem said ive read of this effect but never hoped to see it its the glow of love at first touch then smash said in a burst of realization that he had suppressed until this moment they were destined for each other thats why their names were confused to bring them eventually together yes the centaur agreed i think johni suppose its joan nowwill be staying here in birdland so the fairys solution was the groups solution one of their number would remainhappily how neatly it had worked out but of course that was the way of destiny which was never the coincidence it seemed they made their acknowledgments of parting and left their fairy friend to her happy fate the birds satisfied let them go their best route north the parrot assured them was through the water wing there were very few monsters there and the distance to the northern border of xanth was not great they agreed to that route they had already encountered more than enough monsters and since the birds assured them there were no fires or earthquakes in the water wing the trek should be easy enough besides the ear had the sound of rainfall which suggested their immediate fu ture johnjoan hurried up as they were about to cross the border here is a heat wave she said my fiance had it for when he left birdland but now he wont be needing it just unwrap it when the time comes thank you smash said he took the heat wave it seemed to be a wire curved in the shape of a wave and was sealed in a transparent envelope the girls hugged their friend goodbye and smash extended his littlest hamfinger so the fairy could shake hands with him then they stepped across the border braced for anything anything was what they got they were in a drench pour not for nothing was this called the water wing by the birds there was ground underfoot but it was hard to see because of the ceaseless blast of rain chem brought out her rope and they tied themselves together againcentaur tandy siren and ogre sloshing north in a sloppy line smash had to breathe in through bis ogre ogre clenched teeth to strain the water out fortunately the wa ter was not cold this was a little like swimming after an hour they slogged uphill the rain thinned as they climbed but the air also cooled so they did not gain much comfort in due course the water turned to sleet and then to snow the poor girls were turning blue with cold it was time for the heat wave smash unwrapped the wire immedi ately heat radiated out suffusing the immediate region bringing comfort to each of them the fairys present had been well considered for all that it had been an accident of circumstance slowly the snow stopped falling but the climb continued this was a mountain they were on blanketed with snow by nightfall they still had not crested it and had to camp on the slope they were all hungry and smash was ravenous so he gave the siren the heat wave and headed out into the snow to forage he found some flavored icicles in a crevicecave and chased a snow rabbit but couldnt catch it so he headed back with the icicles they were only a token but somewhat better than nothing they would have to do it was colder out here then he had figured his breath fogged out before him and the fog iced over and coated him making rum a creature of ice his feet turned numb and his fingers too he hardly knew where his nose stopped and the ice began when he snorted icicles flew out like arrows now he slowed feeling lethargic wind came up cutting into his flesh buffeting him about so that he stumbled he dropped cumbersomely to the ground his fall cushioned by the snow he intended to get up as it was now far downhill to their camp but it was more comfortable just to lie there for a little longer his eye queue cried warning but after a while that too faded out and smash slept he dreamed he saw tandys father the soldier crombie whirling around in his fashion and pointing his finger the finger stopped pointing north but what was it pointing to smash remembered crombie had said tandy would lose three things that must be where it would happen then smash was being hauled awake that was much less comfortable than drifting to sleep bad been his ex ogre ogre tremities hurt burning like fire and freezing like ice simul taneously his head felt like thawed carrion and his belly was roasting as if he were mounted on a spit over a fire he groaned horrendously because that was what ogres did when roasted on a spit over a fire hes alive a voice cried joyfully as smash recovered more fully he learned what had happened he had frozen on the slope alarmed at his fail ure to return the girls bad organized a search party and located him he was as stiff as ice because that was what he had become they had feared him dead but had put the heat wave on his belly and thawed him ogres it seemed were freezestorable now that he was awake it was time to sleep they set tled down around the heat wave tandy choosing to rest her head against smashs furry forearm ah well that was harmless probably im glad we got you thawed monster she murmured im not letting you out alone again ogres do get into trouble he agreed it was strange to imagine anyone watching out for him and stranger yet to imagine that he might need this attention but it seemed he did on occasion in the night there was a horrendous roar smash dream ing againhe tended to do that when asleepthought it was an ogress and smiled a huge grimace but the three girls bolted up terrified wake up smash tandy whispered urgently a monsters coming but smash in a dreamdaze hardly stirred he had no fear of the most horrendous ogress the monster stamped near eyes glowing teeth gleam ing breath fogging out in dank cold clouds it was pure white and every hair seemed to be an icicle smash tandy hissed its an abomaboman awful snowman help the snowman looked over them as pale as a snowstorm it reached out to grab the nearest edible thing the girls cowered behind smash who was mostly covered by a nice snow blanket so that little of him showed this snow was not nearly as cold as that of the rest of the mountain be cause this was near the heat wave he was comfortable ogre ogre enough but it deceived the snowman who caught hold of smashs nose and yanked ouch suddenly smash woke up all the way a truly ogrish rage shook him he reached up one huge hairy arm and grabbed the snow monster by the throat the snowman was amazed he had never encountered a worse monster than himself before he had not known any thing like that existed he did not know how to deal with this situation fortunately smash knew how to deal with it he stood up not letting go and shook the hapless monster growrl he growled and dropped the creature on top of the heat wave there was a bubbling and hissing as the snowmans pos terior converted from ice to steam in one foop the mon ster sailed into the ah and shot out of there like a gust from a gale smash didnt bother to pursue he knew better than to stray from the vicinity of the heat wave again he was no snowmani it will be a long time before that creature bothers trav elers again chem remarked with private satisfaction yes we have adverse monster on our side tandy said patting smashs knee she seemed to like the notion smash was just glad he had enough of his strength back to handle such things as snow monsters but soon he would have to meet the night stallion and put it all on the line he had better get the girls beyond these dangerous wilder ness regions of xanth first just in case once more they settled down to sleep grouping closely around the heat wave by morning it had melted them deep into the snow so that they were in a cylindrical well there seemed to be no bottom to this layer of snow was the whole mountain made of it that could be since this was the water wing and snow was solidified water smash bashed out a ramp to the surface and the party resumed the trek they were all hungry now but had to be satisfied with mouthfuls of snow as they entered the icy ridge of the mountain the sun melted the remaining clouds and bore down hard on the snow the snow began to melt smash put the heat wave back in its envelope but soon they were sloshing through slush anyway ogre ogre then the slush turned to water and the slope became a river flowing over ice they tried to keep to their feet but the entire mountain seemed to be dissolving the treacher ous surface gave way beneath them and washed them all helplessly along in the torrent chem seemed to be able to handle herself satisfactorily in the water and of course the siren assumed her mer maid form and swam like a fish but tandy was in trouble because of the sheer rush of water she could swim well enough in level water but this was a cataract smash tried to swim to her but got bogged down him self he was not really a strong swimmer he normally waded or whomped through water but right now he was not at full strength and had been frozen and thawed this water was becoming too deep and violent for him too much indeed smash gulped for airand got water instead he coughed and gasped and sucked in a replace ment lungfulonly to fill up the rest of the way with wa ter this was awful he clawed at his throat trying foolishly to clear the water while his body struggled for air but it was no good the torrent was all about him finding excel lent purchase against his brute body and he could not breathe the agony of suffocation became unbearable then something snapped like the lid of his head and half his consciousness departed smash gave himself up for lost but it seemed to him that it had been more comfortable to be frozen than to be drowned then he was calm accepting the inevitable it was after all halfway pleasant doing without air maybe this wasnt really worse than freezing he drifted with the slowing cur rent relieved feeling like loose seaweed how nice just to float forever free then something was tugging fretfully at him it was the mermaid she wrapped her arms about one of his and threshed violently with her tail drawing him forward but his mass was too much for her progress slowed she needed air herself with all this exertion she let him go and smash sank blissfully to the depths while she shot up toward the surface slowly he became aware of more tugging this time on ogre ogre both arms he tried to shake himself free but his arms did not respond he watched himself being drawn upward from the gloom to the light there seemed to be two fig ures drawing him one on each arm each with a fishtail but maybe he was seeing double smash was not sure how long or far he was dragged time was compressed or dilated for him but he became aware that he was on a sandy beach with a nightmare tromping her hooves on his back he was mistaken it was a filly centaur chem was treading the water out of his body the experience was almost as bad as vomiting out all the stallion manure after that sequence in the gourd al most in due course smash recovered enough to sit up he coughed another bucket or two of water out of his lungs you rescued me he accused the siren i tried she said but you were too heavyuntil mor ris helped morris hi monster someone called from the water it was a triton now smash understood why there had seemed to be two merfolk hauling him along the siren and morris the merman we lost the ear and the heat wave but we saved you the siren said and chem rescued tandy now smash saw tandy who was lying facedown on the sand the centaur was now kneading her back using hands instead of hooves you breathed water too smash asked tandy raised her head ungh she agreed squishily did youfloat when i sank he answered if thats what dying is like its not bad lets not talk about death chem said this is too nice a place for that im already upset about losing the ear not more upset about that than i am with me for losing the heat wave the siren said maybe you should have thrown smash and me back and saved the magic items tandy said forcing a watery smile it was fated that we lose them smash said remember ogre ogre ing his dream soldier crombie said tandy would lose three things and our loss is her loss thats true tandy agreed but whats the third thing smash shrugged we dont have any third thing to lose maybe two covers it no my father always points things out right weve lost something else im sure we just dont know what it is maybe one of you should stay and look for the lost items the merman said he was a sturdy male of middle age roughly handsome it was evident that he could not make legs and walk on land the way the siren could he was a full triton maybe one of us should the siren said thoughtfully after that it feu naturally into place this was a pleas ant region on the fringe of the water wing where the drainage from the snow mountain became a lake that spread into the mainstream wilderness of xanth there was a colony of merfolk here mostly older scant of maids it looked very promising for the siren chapter visible void the three of themsmash tandy and chem proceeded north to the border of the void the last of the special regions of central xanth there is great sig nificance to these five elemental regions chem said historically the five elementsair earth fire water and the voidhave always been mainstays of magic so it is fitting that they be represented in central xanth and im extremely gratified to get them on my map these have been good adventures smash agreed but just what is the void the other elements make sense but i cant place that one i dont know the centaur admitted but im eager to find out i dont think this region has ever been mapped before by anyone now is certainly the time tandy said i hope its not as extreme as the others were chem brought out her rope lets not gamble on that i should have tied us when the snow mountain turned to slush but it happened so fast they linked themselves together as they approached the line it was abrupt on the near side the pleasant terrain of the merfolks lake spread southward on the far side was nothing they could perceive im the lightest tandy said ill go first pull me back if i fall into a hole she smoothed back her slightly scorched and tangled brown hair and stepped across the formidable line smash and chem waited the rope kept playing out ogre ogre slowly obviously tandy was walking not falling and not in any trouble is it all right tandy the centaur called rhetorically there was no answer the rope continued to move can you hear me please answer chem called her brow wrinkling now the slack went taut chem stood her ground refus ing to be drawn across the line smash tried to peer into the void but could see nothing except a vague swirl of fog from this side i think id better pull her back chem said swishing her brown tail nervously it too was somewhat bedraggled as a result of then recent adventures im not sure any thing is wrong maybe she just doesnt hear me chem hauled there was resistance she hesitated not wanting to apply unreasonable force what do you think smash smash put his eye queue to work but it seemed slug gish this time his logic was fuzzy his perception confused i dontseem to have much of an opinion he confessed she glanced back at him surprised no opinion you with your unogrish intelligence surely you jesti it best me jest smash agreed amicably she peered closely at him smashwhat happened to your eye queue i dont see the stigma on your head smash touched the fur of his scalp it was smooth there was no trace of roughness no on it gone he said oh no it must have been washed out when you nearly drowned thats the third thing weve lostyour intelligence that certainly affects tandys prospects here youre back to being stupid smash was appalled just when he needed intelligence he had lost it what would he do now in a crisis the centaur was similarly concerned but she had an an swer well have to use my intelligence for us both smash are you willing to follow my lead at least until we get through the void that seemed to make sense to smash she lead me accede ill try to haul her back chem drew harder on the rope and of course she had the mass to do it suddenly it ogre ogre went slack and the loose end of it slid back across the line oh awful the centaur exclaimed dismayed she switched her tail violently in vexation weve lost her oh awful smash echoed since his originality had dis sipated with his intellect what had happened to tandy i think id better step partway across so i can look without committing myself she decided you stay on this sideand dont let me cross all the way after a minute if i dont back out you haul me out slowly agreed me agree assuredly he said he was furious at the eye queue for deserting him in his hour of need of course he had intended to get rid of the cursebut not just yet not at the brink of the void now he was liable to do something ogrishly idiotic and cost his friends their lives even his rhyming seemed ludicrous now what was the point in it not until the curse of the eye queue had de scended on him had he appreciated how stupid a typical ogre seemedjust a hulking brute too dull to do more than smash things indeed his very name the centaur poked her forepart cautiously through the border it disappeared into the swirl smash felt very much alone though her hindquarters remained with him he marveled that a human girl as smart and pretty as tandy could have any interest in him even as an animal friend it must have been the eye queue that appealed to her the intelligence manifesting in the oddest of hosts the sheer anomaly of the boneheaded genius her interest would dis sipate the moment she discovered what had happened that of course was best it would free her full attention for her ideal humantype man whoever and wherever he might be yet smash remained disquieted the fact was he realized now the curse had had its positive aspect like the curse of the moon that human females labored underone of the things that distinguished them from nymphsit was awkward and inconvenient but carried the potential for an entirely new horizon fe males could regenerate their kind the eye queue enabled a person to grasp far broader aspects of reality now having experienced such aspects he would be returned to his for mer ignorance a minute had passed and gone some distance beyond and chem had not backed out in fact she was trying to ogre ogra proceed the rest of the way across the line smash knew he had to stop that even if he was now too stupid to perceive the danger in committing oneself to a potential courseof noretum he remembered the centaurs orders me take up slack haul she back he said inwardly condemning his ogrish crudity of expression he might be stupid did he have to advertise it so blatantly that started another chain of thought part of the vaunted dullness of ogres was not because of the fact but because they insisted on the distinguishing characteristic of expression he could have said because my friend the filly centaur a decent and intelligent person with a useful magic graphological talent may be in difficulty i am re quired to exert myself according to her expressed wish and draw her gently but firmly back across the demarcation between territories then we shall consider how best to pro ceed instead he had spouted the idiotic ditty in the ludi crous manner of his kind surely the eye queue vine had been as much of a curse in its untimely departure as in its arrival there was resistance either chem didnt want to come back or something was hauling her forward smash drew harder on the rope but the centaur braced forward fight ing it something was definitely amiss even an idiot could tell thati smash was tempted to give one monstrous tug on the rope and haul her back head over tail as an ordinary ogre would but several things restrained him first her mass was similar to his own he might lose his footing and yank himself across the line in the wrong direction sec ond the rope was bound about her humanoid waist which was delicately narrow too harsh a force could hurt her third he was not at full strength so he might not be able to move her effectively even if properly anchored then the rope went slack chem too was proceeding unfettered into the void smash dived for her disappearing rump his ogrish ac tion preceding his inadequate thought he was too late she crossed the line only her tail flicked back momentarily as if flicking free a fly smash caught the tail and worked his way along it hand over hand her forward impetus hauled him right up to the ogre ogre line then he got his balance dug his toes in and brought the centaur and himself to a halt now he exerted what remained of his power and drew her back it sufficed slowly her rump reappeared when he got her hind legs across he shifted his grip carefully picked up her two feet and wheelbarrowed her backward she could not effectively resist with her feet off the ground at last he got her all the way across she was intact that relieved one concern tell why she untie he grunted not letting her go chem seemed dazed but soon reorganized herself its not what you think smash its beautiful in the void all mist and fog and soft meadows and herds of centaurs grazing smash might be stupid but not that stupid she still in daze centaurs no graze her eyes rounded startled why thats right sea cows graze waterhorses graze black sheep graze centaurs eat in human fashion what am i thinking of perhaps she had seen a herd of grazing animals and jumped to a conclusion but that was of little moment at the moment that is dandy where is tandy oh tandy i didnt see her chem was chagrined i crossed the line to seek her and was so distracted by the beauty of the region that i forgot my mission im not usually that flighty true enough chem was a filly with all four hooves on the ground she was less aggressive than her father chester and less imperious than her mother cherie but still had qualities of determination and stability that were to be commended it was entirely unlike her to act in an impetu ous or thoughtless manner now something else occurred to smash there were var ious kinds of magic springs in xanth that trapped the un wary some caused a person to fall in love with the first creature of the opposite sex he or she saw that was how the species of centaur had originated some caused a per son to turn into a fish some healed a persons wounds instantly and cleanly as if they had never been had the group encountered one of those before john the fairy ogre ogre would have been able to restore her lost wings and some springs caused a person to forget she get wet she forget he asked wishing he could voice his concern more eloquently damn his bonehead wet chem was perplexed ohyou mean as in a lethespring no i didnt forget in that fashion as you can see and im sure tandy didnt for one thing there was no spring nearby certainly not within range of the rope its something else its just such lovely land so pleasant and peaceful i simply had to explore it nothing else seemed important somehow i knew that farther in there would be even more wonder and she paused and i just couldnt step back i realize that was very foolish of me but im sure that place is safe no monsters or natural hazards i mean smash remained doubtful tandy was gone and chem had almost been gone it had been no simple distraction of mind that kept her there she had untied her safety rope and resisted his pullback with all her might yet she seemed to be in full possession of her faculties now tandy must have been similarly seduced she now was wary of the easy paths leading to tanglers and antlion lairs but would not have experienced this particular in ducement instead of being an easy access path to a pleas ant retreat this was an entire landscape that lured one in was that why it was called the voidbecause no one ever returned from it so that nothing was known about it if that were so how could they leave tandy to its merci less mercy she needed to be rescued immediatelyl as i see it chem said we shall have to go in and look for tandy and try to bring her out we risk getting trapped ourselvesnot i think by some monster but by the sheer delight of the region we wont want to leave she flicked her tail perturbed i realize this is a lot to ask of you now smash but do you have any opinion how ironic if the curse had stayed with him just a little longer he could have marshaled its formidable power and expressed an eloquently cogent and relevant thought that might completely clarify their troubled course something like chem i suggest you employ your threedimensional holographic mapprojection to chart the void as we explore ogre ogre it so that not only will we be able to orient more specifi cally on tandys most likely course we shall also have no difficulty finding our way out again but the curse had left him so that he had become too stupid to think of that let alone express it all that actually came out was make map leave trap map trap she asked her brow furrowing i do want to chart the void as i do everything but i dont see how sure enough he had not gotten through he tried again find way no stay use my magic map to find our way out she bright ened of course we cant get lost if i keep it current ill mark a dotted line then we can follow it back if there is any problem thats a very good idea smash she said it comfortingly as one would to a dull child and of course intellectually that was what he was what he had been when infected by the weed of smartness was of no present relevance he had to accept the reality depressing as it now seemed he was not and never would be inherently intelli gent he was after all an ogre that would definitely solve one problem he thought tandy might have taken a certain girlish fancy to him but it had been the enhancement of his intellect provided by the eye queue that appealed to her now that he was back to normal she would properly regard him as the ani mal he was that was certainly bestthough somehow he was too stupid to appreciate the nicety of it fully he had in fact been somewhat puffed up by her attention unde served as it was and had rather enjoyed her company the flattery of her uncritical nearness he did not relish the prospect of going his way alone again but of course he had no choice an ogre went the ogres way lets try it chem said coiling her rope lets keep each other in sight and call out any special things we see our object is to locate tandy and then to bring us all out on the north side of the void do you agree good stratagem centaur femme he agreed inanely she smiled briefly and he saw how nervous she was she was afraid of what they were about to encounter in the void pleasant though it seemed she knew their perspec ogre ogre fives would change the moment they crossed the line and that they might never return wish us luck monster luck chem pro tern he said they stepped across the line together chem had been correct the landscape was even slightly sloping down ahead with lowhanging clouds cruis ing by the ground was covered with lush turf that seemed innocent and bad a fragrant odor with pretty little flowers speckled through it certainly there was no obvious danger and that he feared was the most obvious danger of all now chem generated her magic map the image ap peared in the air by her head but this time it expanded enormously rapidly overlapping the terrain they stood on so that the features of the land of xanth in image passed by them both mountains lakes and the gap chasm apparently her map was not affected by the forgetspell on the gap an item of possible significancerushed by them then trees and streams became large enough to be seen individually and even occasional animals frozen as re corded yet seeming to move because of the expansion of the map hey its not supposed to do that she protested its turning lifesize obviously the map was careering out of control smash wondered why that should happen here if only he had his eye queue back he would be able to realize that this was surely no coincidence and that it related in some funda mental way to the ultimate nature of the void he might even conjecture that the things of the mind whether ani mated in the form of a map or remaining inchoate had considerable impact on the landscape of the void perhaps the interaction between the two created a region of ani mated imagination that could be a lot of fun but might also pose considerable threats to sanity if it got out of con trol perhaps no purely physical menace lurked within the void but rather the state of mental chaos that might pre vail when no aspects of physical reality intruded upon or limited the generation of fanciful imagery but naturally a mere stupid ogre could in no way appreciate the tiniest portion of such a complex conjecture so smash was obli vious he hoped this foolish oblivion would not have seri ous consequences ignorance was not necessarily bliss as any smart creature would know ogre ogre chem confused by her maps misbehavior turned it off then she tried it again concentrating intently this time it expanded from its point source then contracted to pinpoint size gyrating wildly until it steadied down around the size she wanted it she was learning new control and this was just as well for lack of discipline might be extraordinarily troublesome here see there are the grazing centaurs chem said point ing ahead smash looked he saw a tribe of grazing ogres again if only he had retained the curse of intelligence he might have comprehended that another highly significant aspect of this region was manifesting chem perceived one non sensical thing and he perceived another that suggested that the preconceptions of the viewer defined in large part what that viewer saw there was not necessarily any objec tive standard here reality literally was something else in this case perhaps a herd of irrelevant creatures was graz ing neither centaurs nor ogres if this were so he might have continued his thought how could they be certain that anything they saw here was not a kind of illusion tandy could be lost in a world of altered realities and not realize it since chem and smash also were in altered states of perception the problem of locating tandy might be immensely more complicated than anticipated but he a dull ogre would merely blunder on heedless of such potential complications something funny here chem said we know cen taurs dont graze it seem a dream smash said trying vainly to formu late the concept he knew he could not master without the curse of intellect illusion chem exclaimed of course were seeing other creatures that only look like centaurs she was smart as all centaurs were she caught on quickly but she didnt have it all yet me no see centaur she he said clumsily you see something else not centaurs again her brow furrowed what do you see smash smash tapped his own chest oh you see ogres yes i suppose that makes sense i ogre ogre see my kind you see yours but how can we see what is really there this was far too much for him to figure out if only he had his eye queue back he might be able to formulate a reversal of perspective that would cancel out the mind generated changes and leave only the undisturbed truth perhaps a kind of crossreference grid contrasting chems perceptions with his own eliminating the differences she saw centaurs he saw ogresobviously each saw his own kind so that was suspect both saw a number of individu als so there the perceptions aligned and were probably ac curate both saw the creatures grazing which suggested they were in fact grazing animals equine caprine bovine or other further comparison on an organized basis per haps mapping the distinctions on a variant of chems magic map would in due course yield a close approxima tion of the truth whatever it might be of course it might be that there was nothing that even their points of agreement were merely common fancies so that the composite image would be that illusion that was mutually compatible it just might be were the fundamen tal truth penetrated that what remained in the void was nothing the absence of all physical reality creatures thought therefore they existedyet perhaps even their thinking was largely illusion so maybe the thinkers them selves did not existand the moment they realized this they ceased to exist the void wasvoid but without his mental curse he wouldnt see any of that and perhaps this was just as well if he were going to imagine anything he should start with the eye queue vine but he would have to use it cautiously lest the full power of his enhanced intellect succeed only in abolishing himself he needed to preserve the illusion of existence long enough to rescue tandy and get them out of the void so that their seeming reality became actual me need clue to find eye queue he said regretfully chem took him literally which was natural enough since she knew he now lacked the wit to speak figuratively you think there are eye queue vines growing around here maybe i can locate them on my map she concentrated and the suspended map brightened parts of it became greener than others i cant usually place items i havent actually seen she murmured but sometimes i can interpolate extrapolate from experience and intuition i think there could be such vineshere she pointed to one spot on her map and a markerglow ap peared there though they may be imaginary just ordi nary plants that we happen to see as eye queues smash was too stupid to appreciate the distinction he set off in the direction indicated by the map the centaur followed keeping the map near him so he could refer to it at need in short order he was thereand there they were the dangling braided eyeball vines each waiting to curse some blundering creature with its intelligence and percep tion he grabbed one and set it on his head it writhed and sank in immediately how far had he sunk to inflict so eagerly this curse upon himself his intelligence expanded much as the centaurs map had now he grasped many of the same notions he had wished to grasp before he saw one critical flaw in the technique of using a crossreference grid to establish real ity turned on his own present curse of intelligence it would probably reveal his smartness to be illusion since smash needed that intelligence to rescue tandy he elected not to pursue that course it would be better to use the devices of perspective to locate tandy first then explore their unreal mechanisms when the loss of such mechanisms no longer mattered it would also be wise not to ponder the intricacies of his own personal existence what would be the best way to find her if her foot prints glowed it would be easy to track her but he was now far too smart to believe that anything so coincidentally convenient could exist the centaur however might be deceivable i suspect there could be some visible evidence of the passage of out siders he remarked we carry foreign germs alien sub stances from other magic regions there could be interac tions perhaps a small display of illumination smash she exclaimed it worked youre smart again yes i thought it might but its illusion the eye queue is only imaginary how can it have a real effect what can affect the senses can also affect the mind smash explained she had seemed so smart a moment ago now from the lofty vantage of his restored intelligence she seemed a bit slow certainly it was stupid of her to attempt to explain away his mental power for that would put them right back in the morass of incompetence he had to persuade herbefore she persuaded him in xanth things are mostly what they seem to be for example queen iriss illusions of light enable her to see in the dark her illusion of distant vision enables her to see people who are otherwise too far away here in the void in contrast things are what they seem not to be it is possible to finesse these appearances to our advantage and to generate reali ties that serve our interests do you perceive the foot prints she looked dismayed by his confusing logic ido she said surprised mine are disks yours are pawprints mine glow light brown like my hide yours glow black like yours she looked up am i making any sense at all how can a print glow black what other color befits an ogre he asked he did not see the prints but did not remark on that now we must cast about for tandys prints he cracked the briefest smile and hope they do not wail yes of course she agreed they must originate where we crossed the line thats the place to intercept them she started backand paused thats funny whats funny smash was aware that the void was tricky and potentially dangerous if chem began to catch on to its ultimate nature he would have to divert her in a hurry their very existence could depend on it i seem to be up against a wall its intangible but it balks me a wall that was all right that was a physical obstacle not an intellectual one therefore much less dangerous much better to wrestle that sort of thing smash moved to join herand came up against the wall himself it was in visible as she had suggested but as he groped at it he be gan to discern its rough stones it seemed to be fashioned of ogre ogre ogreresistant stuff or maybe his weakened condition pre vented him from demolishing it properly odd his eye queue had another thought however if things in the void were not what they seemed to be perhaps this was true of the wall it might not exist at all if he could succeed in disbelieving in it he could walk through it yet if he succeeded in abolishing a wall this tangible by mental effort what then of the other things of the void such as the eye queue he might do best not to disbelieve what do you perceive chem asked a firm stone wall he said deciding i fear we shall find it difficult to depart the void he had thought that intellectual dissolution or the vacating of reality might cause the demise of intruders into the void perhaps it was after all a more physical barrier he would have to keep his mind open so as not to be trapped by illusions about these illusions there must be a way she said with a certain false confidence she suspected as he did that they could be in worse trouble right now than they had been when the gap dragon charged them or the volcanos lava flows began breaking up under them mental and emotional equilibrium was as important now as physical agility had been then our first job is to catch up with tandy then we can tack le the problem of departure at least she had her priorities in order certainly we can intercept her footprints by proceeding sidewise we now have a notion why she did not return this wall must be pervious from the edge of the void impervious from the interior a little like a oneway path through the forest yes i always liked those oneway paths i dont like this wall quite as well chem proceeded sidewise follow ing the wall she did not see it or really feel it yet it balked her effectively meanwhile smash did not see the glowing footprints but knew they would lead the two of them to tandy there seemed to be more substance to these illu sions than was true elsewhere the illusions of queen iris seemed very real but one could walk right through them the illusions of the void seemed unreal yet prevented penetration would they really all dissipate at such time as he allowed himself to fathom the real nature of the void ogre ogre if nothing truly existed here how could there be a wall to block escape he kept skirting the dangerous thoughts soon chem spied tandys footprintsbright red she an nounced the prints were headed north deeper into the void they followed this new trail smash checked every so often and discovered that the invisible wall paced them any time he tried to step south he could not he could only go north or slide east or west this disturbed him more than it might have when he was ogrishly stupid he did not like traveling a oneway channel this was too much like the route into the lair of a hungry dragon the mo ment he caught up to tandy he would find a way to go back out ofthe void maybe he could break a hole in the wall with a few hard ogre blows of his fist yet again his eye queue slanted across with an alter nate thought suppose the void were like a big funnel al lowing people to slide pleasantly toward its center and bar ring them from climbing out then the wall would not necessarily be a wall at all merely the outer rim of that funnel to smash it apart could be to break up the very ground that supported them and send them plunging in a rockslide down into the deeper depth no percentage there how could he arrange to escape the trap and take his friends with him if no one had escaped before to give warning that was a bad auspice for their own chances well he intended to be the first to emerge to tell the tale could he locate a big bird a roc and get carried out by air smash doubted it he distrusted air travel having had a number of uncomfortable experiences with it and he cer tainly distrusted birds as big as rocs what did rocs eat anyway what else was there then he came up with a notion he thought would work in the void this would use the proper ties of the void against the void itself rather than fighting those properties he would try itwhen the time came theres something ahead chem said i dont know what it is yet in a moment they caught up to it it was an ogressthe beefiest fiercest hairiest ugliest monster he had ever seen with a face so mushy it was almost sickening lovely whats another centaur doing here chem asked ogre ogre ogre ogre instantly the eye queue analyzed the significance of her observation that is another anonymous creature we had better proceed cautiously oh i see what you mean do you think it could be a monster the centaur delicately did not voice the ob vious fearthat the monster could have consumed tandy after all it stood astride her tracks perhaps we should approach it from opposite sides each ready to help the other in case it should attack he wasnt fully satisfied with this decision but the thought of harm to tandy made the matter urgent yes chem agreed nervously as i become acclimated to this region i like it less maybe one of us can draw near her and the other can hide ready to act we cant assume a sleek centaur filly like that is hostile nor could they afford to assume the ugly ogress was not hostile they had to be ready for anything you hide i will approach in friendly fashion the centaur proceeded quietly to the west and in a mo ment disappeared smash gave her time to get properly set tled then stomped gently toward the stranger hoi he called the hideous wonderful ogress snapped about spying him who you she grunted dulcetly her voice like the scratching of harpies talons on dirty slate smash aware that she was not what she seemed was cautious names had a certain power in xanth and he was already below strength it was best to remain anonymous at least until he was sure of the nature of this creature i am an inquiring stranger he replied she tromped right up to him and stood snout to snout in the delightful way of an ogress me gon stir he monster she husked in the fascinatingly unsubtle mode of her ap parent kind and she clinked him in the puss with one hairy paw the blow lacked physical force but smash did a polite backflip as if knocked heels over head what a romantic comeon he remembered how his mother knocked his fa ther about and stepped on his face showing her intimidat ing love how similar this ogreshe was yet his eye queue cautioned caution as was its wont this was not a real ogress she might just be roughing him up for a meal she might not be nearly as friendly as she seemed so he did not reciprocate by smashing her vio lently into a tree besides there was no suitable tree handy he used unogrish eloquence instead this is a remark ably friendly greeting for a stranger no much danger she said he nice stranger and she gave him a friendly kick smash was becoming much intrigued he was sure this was no ogress but she was one interesting person maybe he should hit her back he raised his hamfist then a third party appeared this was another ogress dont hit her smash she cried i just realized smash the first ogress repeated questioningly she seemed amazed we must all describe exactly what we see the second ogress said she too was no true ogress for her speech did not conformunless she bad blundered into some eye queue vinesbut that hardly seemed likely you first smash confused by this development he obliged i see two at tractively brutal ogresses each with a face mushier than the other each hunched so that her handpaws reach almost down to her hindpaws one is brown the other red and i see two centaurs the second ogress said a black stallion and a red mare oho that would be chem seeing her own kind once she had separated from him her own perceptions had taken over so that she saw him falsely i see a handsome black human man and a pretty brown human girl the first ogress said then you are tandy chem exclaimed tandy smash repeated amazed of course im tandy tandy agreed i always was but why are you two dressed up like human people we each perceive our own kind chem explained each person instinctively generates his or her own reality from the void cometake hands and perhaps we can break through to reality they took handsand slowly the alternate images dissi pated and smash saw chem in her ruffled brown coat and tandy in her tattered red dress you were awful handsome as a man tandy said ogre ogre ogre ogre sadly all garbed in black like a dusky king with silver gloves smash realized that his orange jacket had become so dirty it was now almost indistinguishable from his natu ral fur but why did you fall down when i tried to shake your hand the eye queue provided the insight to cause him em barrassment i misunderstood your intent he confessed i thought you were being friendly i was being friendly she exclaimed indignantly you were the first human being i was able to get close to in this funny place i thought you might know some way out i cant seem to go back myself i bang into an invisible hedge or something so i wanted to be very positive and not scare you away after all you might have been lost too yes of course smash agreed weakly but you acted as if id hit you or somethingi she con tinued indignantly this is the way ogres show affection chem explained tandy laughed affection thats how human beings fight smash was silent horribly embarrassed but tandy would not let it go you big oaf ill show you how human beings express affection and she grabbed smashs arm pulling him toward her with small human violence bemused he yielded until his head was down near hers tandy threw her arms around his furry neck and planted a firm long hotblooded kiss on his mouth mov ing her lips against his smash was so surprised he sat down tandy followed him still pressing close locking his head to hers he fell all the way back on the ground but she stayed with him her brown hair flopping forward to cover his wildly staring eyes as she drove home the rest of the kiss at last she released him as she needed a breath what do you think of that ogre smash lay where she had thrown him unable to make sense of the experience hes overwhelmed chem said you gave him an aw fully stiff dose for his first such contact well ive wanted to do it for a long time tandy said hes been too stupid to catch on tandy hes an ogre they dont understand human romance you know that hes an ogre with eye queue he can darned well learn im afraid youre being unrealistic the centaur said talking as if smash were not present perhaps that was the case mentally youre a spunky pretty human girl hes a hulking jungle brute you cant afford to get emotionally involved with a creature like that he just isnt your type and just what is my type tandy flared defiantly a damned demon intent on rape smash is the nicest male creature ive met in xanth how many male creatures have you met in xanth the centaur inquired tandy was silent of course her experience had been quite limited smash at last essayed a remark you could visit a hu man village shut up ogre tandy snapped or ill kiss you again smash shut up she was not bluffing she could do it she still had her arms looped around his neck since she lay half astride him holding him down as it were you have to be realistic chem said the good magi cian sent you out with smash so the ogre could protect you while you searched for a husband what good will it do you to find the destined man as john and the siren and maybe goldy did if you foolishly waste your love on an inappro priate object you would be undermining the very thing you seek oh phooey tandy exclaimed youre right centaur i know youre right centaurs are always rightbut oh it hurts a couple of hot raindrops fell on smashs nose burning him with an acid other than physical she was crying and he found that even more confusing than the kiss ever since he rescued me from the gourd and got me back my soul im not denying hes a good creature chem said im just saying realistically tandy turned ferociously on smash you monster why couldnt you have been a man because im an ogre he said ogre ogre she wrenched one arm clear of him and made as if to strike his face but her hand did not touch him the void spun about him dimming smash realized she had hit him with another tantrum that ironically was more like ogre love why couldnt she have been an ogress an ogress now his mind shaken by the double whammy of kiss and tantrum smash floated half con scious and realized what he had been missing an ogress he like every member of his party could not exist alone he needed a mate that was what had brought bun to good magician humfreys castle that had been his un asked question how could he find his ideal mate hum frey had known and of course there would be ogresses at the ogrefen ogre fen that was why the good magician had sent him to seek the ancestral ogres he would be able to select one who was right for him knock her about in ogre fashion and live in brutal happiness ever after exactly as his par ents had it all did make sense he drifted slowly to earth as the horrendous impact of the tantrum eased now i understand he began i warned you oaf tandy said she leaned over and plastered another big kiss on him smash was so dazed that he almost grasped the nature of the kiss this time perhaps it was the effect of the void making things seem other than they were it was as if she were punching him in the snootand with that perception she became much more alluring then she broke and the odd perspective ended she be came a girl again all soft and pretty and nice and wholly inappropriate for romance it was too bad oh whats the use tandy said im a fool and i know it come on people we have to get out of this place that may not be readily accomplished chem said we can travel in deeper or edge sideways but we cant back out im sure its like a whirlpool drawing us ever inward what we shall find in the center i hesitate to con jecture oblivion tandy said tightly she too had caught on a maw smash said climbing unsteadily to his feet ogre ogre this land is carnivorous it gives us respite only because it doesnt need to consume us instantly it has herds of graz ing creatures to eat first when it gets hungry it will take us i fear that is so the centaur agreed yet there must be some way for smart or creative people to escape it there is so much illusion here maybe we could fool it so far ifs been fooling us not we it tandy said un less we can wish away that wall but smashs eye queue had been cogitating on this problem and now it regurgitated a notionthe one he had flirted with before if we could escape into another world one with different rules such as what chem asked interested have you got something on your hairy mind the hypnogourd i dont like the gourd tandy said instantly and the fact is even if we all entered the gourd our bodies would remain right here the centaur pointed out the gourd is a trap itselfbut if we did get out of it wed still be in the void a trap within a trap but the nightmares can go anywhere smash said even to mundaniaand back thats true tandy agreed they can go right through walls and i think some can run on water so i suppose they could run through the void and out again theyre not ordinary mares but theyre very hard to catch and hard to ride and the cost she smiled ruefully i hap pen to know they would help us if the night stallion told them to smash said oh i forgot tandy exclaimed you still have to fight the night stallion you sacrificed your soul for me she clouded up oh smash i owe you so much the centaur nodded thoughtfully smash placed his soul in jeopardy for you tandy i can appreciate how that would affect you but im not sure you interpret your debt correctly i was locked into that horror deprived of my soul tandy said i had no hope at all the lights had gone out on my horizon then he came and fought the bones and ogre ogre smashed things about and brought out my soul and i lived again i owe my everything to him i should give back my soul no smash cried knowing that she could endure no worse horror than the loss of her soul again i promised to protect you and i should have protected you from the gourd instead of splashing in the lake ill fight this through myself chem shook her head i do see the problemfor each of you i wish i perceived the answers as clearly i have to meet the stallion anyway smash said so when i have conquered him ill ask him for some mares thats so crazy it just might work chem said but theres one detail you may have overlooked we have no hypnogourds here well use your map again he said the centaur considered i must admit it worked for your eye queue replacement vine and our situation is des perate enough so that anythings worth trying but replacement tandy demanded chem will explain it to you while im in the gourd smash said right now lets use the map to locate a gourd patch the centaur projected her map and settled on a likely place for gourds while tandy watched skeptically then the party went there though the way took them deeper into the void and there they wereseveral nice fat hypnogourds with ripe peepholes smash settled himself by the largest you girls get some rest he advised this may take a while remember i have to locate the stallion first then fight him then round up the mares tandy grabbed his hamhand in her two delicate little hands oh smashi wish i could help you but im terri fied to go into a gourd dont go in a gourd smash exclaimed just stay close so you dont get walled off from me and cant bring me out in an emergency he said gruffly i will i will tandys eyes were tearbright oh smash are you strong enough i shouldnt have hit you with that tantrum ogre ogra i like your tantrums you just rest and wait for the nightmares by whatever route they come i know ill see nightmares she said wanly smash glanced at chem keep an eye on her he said disengaging his hand from tandys i will the centaur agreed then smash put his eye to the peephole ogre ogre chapter souls alive he found himself emerging from the cakewalk onto a vast empty stage he landed gently there was no vomit there was a new scene the floor was metalhard and highly polished his feet left smudge marks where they touched the air was half lit by a glow that seemed inherent there was nothing else smash peered about it occurred to him that if the night stallion were here he could spend a long time looking as this place seemed infinitely extensive he had to narrow its compass somehow well he knew how to do that he started tromping un reeling his string behind him he would crisscross this re gion for as long and as far as it took him smash advanced the string became a long line disap pearing in the distance behind it divided the plain into two sections this could take even more time than he had judged he realized since the girls were waiting outside the gourd in the void and would not be able to go in search of food or water he wanted to get on with it quickly so he needed some way to speed things up he cudgeled his eye queue again how could he most efficiently locate a creature that didnt want to be located answer what about following its trail he applied his eye to the floor now that he concen trated he saw the hoofprints they crossed his projected line coming from the right rear and proceeding to the left front there would be no problem following that but his curse in its annoying fashion caused him to question the simplicity of this procedure the hoofprints were suspiciously convenient crossing his line just at the point he thought to look almost as if they were intended to be seen he knew that tracking a creature was not neces sarily simple even when the prints were clear the trail could meander aimlessly looping about getting lost in bad terrain it could become dangerous if the quarry knew it was being trackedand the dark horse surely did know there could be tricks and ambushes no there was no sense playing the game of the night stallion the trail was not to be trusted it was something set up to delude an ordinary ogre better to force the stal lion to play smashs gameand if the horse did not know of smashs hidden asset of intelligence that could be a counter ambush a smart ogre was quite different from a stupid one smash stomped on following his straight line halving the territory this should also restrict the range of the stal lion since it could not go any place smash had already lookedas he understood the rules of this questand therefore could not cross the line yet the territory still seemed to be infinitely large he might tromp forever and never come to the far side for that matter he hadnt started at the near side either he had simply appeared within the range and begun there he also realized that halving the total territory did not neces sarily cut the area remaining to be searched half of infin ity remained infinity also unless he knew which half the stallion was in he had gained nothing he could spend all his time searching in the wrong half his failure guaran teed smash pondered his eye queue was really straining now and probably the eyeballs of it were getting hot in their effort to see the way through infinity one thing he had to say for the curse it certainly tried to help him it never really opposed its will to his own it sought instead to call his attention to new aspects of any situation encoun tered and to provide more effective ways of dealing with problems he had discovered how useful that was when he had tried to function without its aid now he needed it again how could he figure out a sure fast way to pro ceed ogre ogre ogre ogre the vine came up with a notion smash put the ball of string into his mouth and bit it in half he now had two balls each smaller than the first but magically complete he took the first and rolled it violently forward the ball zoomed straight on unrolling leaving its straight line of string since it had an infinite length it would proceed to the infinite end of the plain infinity could be compassed by infinity even an ordinary ogre might grasp that this process would complete the halving of the stalliorfs range now smash set his ear to the floor and listened yes his keen ogre hearing heard a faint hoofbeat in the dis tance to the forward right the stallion was up there somewhere moving clear of the rolling string now smash had the creature partially located he had done something unexpected forced bis opponent to react and gained a small advantage smash bit the remaining ball in half and shaped the halves into new balls he hurled one to the east establish ing a piesection configuration that trapped the stallion in side then he listened again determining in what quadrant the creature lurked and pitched another halfball in a curve this wound grandly around behind the stallions es timated location cutting off its retreat for though smash had not tromped personally wherever the string went the string remained his agent and surely counted he was using a sort of leverage and the horse could not cross his demar cation lest the animal break its own rule of being only in the last place smash looked he put his ear to the floor again the beat of hooves had ceased the stallion had either gotten away or stopped run ning since the former meant a loss for smash he did the expedient thing and decided on the latter he had at last confined his target smash stomped into the stringdefined quadrant if the stallion were here as he had to be he would soon be found in due course smash spied a blotch on the horizon he stomped closer alert for some ruse the blotch grew as he approached it in the manner that distant objects did since they did not like to appear small from up close it took the form of an animal perhaps a lion a lion smash didnt want that he refused to have a mundane monster foisted off on him in lieu of his object if its a lion its a stal lion he mutteredand of course as he said it it was true a single timely word could make a big difference it was a huge standing wingless horse midnight black of hide with eyes that glinted black too this was surely the night stallionthe creature he had come to settle with the ruler of the nightmare world smash stomped to a halt before the creature he stood taller than it but the animal was more massive i am smash the ogre he said who are you for it was best to be quite certain in a case like this the creature merely stood there now smash saw that there was a plaque set up at its forefeet and the plaque said trojan well trojan horse smash said i have come to re deem the lien on my soul he had expected the animal to charge and attack but it did not move or respond it might as well have been a statue how do i do this smash demanded still no response evidently the creature was sulking an gry because he had caught it smash peered more closely at the stallion it certainly seemed frozen he tromped forward and put out a ham hand to touch it the body was metalcold and hard it was indeed a statue had he after all located the wrong thing that would mean he had been deceived by a decoy and would have to do his search all over again smash didnt like this notion so he rejected it he looked at the floor behind the statue were hoofprints the thing might be frozen now but it had not always been probably its present stasis was merely another device to interfere with smashs quest this was one de vious beast well there was one way to take care of that he stood before the stallion and hoisted a hamfist deal with me animal or i will break you into junk ogre ogre the midnight orbs seemed to glitter ominously trojan did not like being threatened smash found himself alone on a lofty windy rainswept pinnacle he looked around the top ledge was just about big enough for him to stretch out on but almost featureless the flat slick rock terminated abruptly at the edge plung ing straight down to a smashing ocean far below there were no plants no food no structures of any kindjust the tug of the wind and the roar of the ocean beneath the night stallion had done this of course it had spelled him to this desolate confinement getting rid of him so much for fair combat the storm swirled closer storms really liked to get a person stranded in a situation like this a bolt of lightning crackled down striking the pinnacle a section of rock peeled off in a shower of sparks and collapsed falling with seeming slowness to the distant water smash stood at the steaming brink and watched the tiny splash the rock had been a fair chunk massive yet from this vantage it looked like a pebble this was a really nice vacation spot for an ogre but he didnt want a vacation he wanted to fight trojan how could he get back into the action now his perch was too small to stretch out on about a quarter of it had fallen the wind intensified taking hold of his fur trying to move him off he wanted to travel but not precisely this way what kind of a splash would he make rain splatted in passing sheets making the surface dou bly slick the water coursed around his feet digging under his cauoused toes trying to pry him from the rock so that he would be carried with it as it flowed over the brink in a troubled waterfall such a drop did not hurt water but his own flesh might be less fortunate a huge wave surged forward below taking dead aim at the base of the rock column the wave smashed inand the entire column trembled more layers of stone peeled and fell for a moment smash thought the whole thing was coming down but about half of it withstood the violence ogre ogre and held its form however it was obvious that this perch would not endure much longer smash considered if he stood here the column would soon collapse dropping him into the ravenous ocean he was an ogre true but he lacked his full strength he would probably be crushed between the tumbling rocks in the wa ter if he tried to climb down much of the same thing would happen the column would collapse before he got below ogres were tough but the forces of nature operating here were overwhelming he had no realistic chance he saw that the ocean waves developed only as they got close to the tower his eye queue concluded that this meant the water was much deeper away from this struc ture because deep water didnt like to rouse itself from its stillness that meant that region was safe to plunge into good enough he hated to leave this pleasant spire but discretion urged the move he leaped off the brink sailing out in a clumsy swan dive toward the deep water then he remembered he couldnt swim very well in a calm lake he was all right in a raging torrent he tended to drown he eyed the looming ocean surging deep and dark it was no mere torrent it was an elemental monster he had no chance at all too bad he faced the horsestatue there was no tower no ocean it had all been a magic vision a test perhaps or a warning obviously he had wiped out he felt weak he must have lost a chunk of his soul but now he knew how it worked the night stallion did not fight physically the creature simply threw turbulent visions at him the way tandy threw tantrums and curse fiends threw curses the ocean tower had been sort of fun so were those tantrums he realized when tandy hit him with one of them but that was nothing to speculate on right now try it again horseface he grunted i still want my soul back the stallions dark eyes flashed malignantly and smash stood in the center of a den of mundane lionsreal lions this time not stallion or antlions he felt ogre ogre abruptly weaker this must be a mundane scene beyond the region of magic so that his magic strength was gone the lions snarled like mammalian dragons lashed their tufted yellow tails and stalked him there were six of them a male four females and a cub the females seemed to be the most aggressive they began sniffing him trying to determine how dangerous he might be and how edible ordinarily smash would have liked nothing better than to mix with a new crowd of monsters in sublime mayhem ogres lived for the joy of bloody battle but two things militated against his natural inclinationhis eye queue and his weakness according to the pusillanimous counsel of the first it was best to avoid combat when the outcome was uncertain and according to the second the outcome was highly uncertain he would do better his cowardly intelligence informed him to flee immediately but two things were wrong with that course there was no place to flee to because he was in a walled arena with wire mesh over the top so he could not escape and the lions had him surrounded anyway he would have to fight unless he could bluff them he tried the bluff he raised his hamfists though they were unprotected by his centaur gauntlets and bellowed defiance this was a stance that would frighten almost any creature of xanth but the lions were not creatures of xanth they were from missouri mundania they had to be shown they pounced ordinarily smash would have been able to mince the mere six monsters with so many blows of fists feet and head but with his strength reduced to mundane normal all he could handle was one while he was pulping that one the other five were chomping him in a moment they had bitten through the hamstring ten dons of his arms and legs making his hamhands and ham feet useless they chomped through the nerve channel of his neck making his head slightly less functional than be fore he was now mostly helpless he could feel but could not move then they gnawed at him taking their time one female on each extremity the male clawing out his belly for the ogre ogre tasty guts the pulped cub roused itself enough to com mence work on smashs nose biting off small bites so as not to choke on its meal it hurt horribly as the monsters chewed off his hands and feet and delved for his kidneys and it wasnt much fun when the cub scooped out an eyeball but smash didnt scream noise seemed pointless at this point anyway it was hard to scream properly when his tongue was gone and his lungs were being chewed out he knew that when the beasts got to his vital organs sensation would end so he waited but the lions were sated before then for smash was a lot of creature they left him delimbed and eviscerated and piled themselves up for a family snooze now the flies appeared settling in swarms and every bite was a new ag ony the sun shone down through the mesh cooking him blazing into his other eye which paralysis prevented him from closing soon he was agonizingly blind but he still felt the flies crawling up his nose looking for new places to bite and lay their maggots it was going he knew to be an exceedingly long haul how had he gotten himself into this fix by challenging the night stallion to recover his soul and to obtain help to rescue tandy and chem from the void was it worth it no because he had not succeeded would he try it again yes because he still wanted to help his friends no matter how much pain came he was back before trojan whole of limb and gut and eye it had been another test case and obviously he had lost that one too he should have found some way to de stroy the lions instead of letting them destroy him but it seemed he still had most of his soul and perhaps the third trial would enable him to win the rest of it back im still game master of nightmares he informed the somber statue again the eyes flashed cruelly this creature of night had no sympathy and no mercy smash was standing at the base of a mountain of rocks help someone cried it sounded like tandy how had she gotten here had she disobeyed his instruc tion and entered the gourd following his string to locate ogre ogre ogre ogre him foolish girl smash looked about but found no one help she cried again im under the mountain smash was horrified he had to get her out there was no passage so he started lifting and hurling away the boul ders he had most of his strength now despite his prior losses so this was easy enough but there were many boulders and somehow tandys voice always came from under the highest remaining pile smash was making progress leveling the mountain but still had far to go he was thing gradually the pile of rocks behind him loomed higher than the pile before but the cries continued to come from beneath how had she gotten herself in so deep he no longer had the strength to hurl the boulders away but had to carry them with great effort then he could no longer lift them and had to roll them at last the mountain had been moved and the ground was level but now the voice came from deep below this was in fact a pit the size of an inverted mountain filled with more bouldersand tandy was at the bottom his body was numb with fatigue it was a labor just to move himself now in this respect his agony was worse than it had been in the lions den for there all he had to do was lie still and wait now he had to cudgel his reluctant muscles to perform inflicting the torture of exertion on himself but he kept going for the job remained to be done he shoved and heaved and slowly rolled the boulders out the deeper he got the worse the chore became for now he had to shove the boulders up out of the deepening pit still her voice cried despairingly from below smash stag gered a boulder slipped from his falling grasp and rolled down to the lowest point he lumbered after it hearing her faint sobs she seemed to be fading as fast as he was but his strength had been exhausted he could no longer move the boulder far enough strain as he might still trying he collapsed and the big stone rolled over him again he faced the night stallion his strength miracu lously restored he realized that tandy had never been there in the vision only her voice used to goad him into an impossible effort im still going to save my soul and my friends smash said though he dreaded whatever the dark horse would throw at him next tandy might not have been literally below that mountain of rocks but his success in these en deavors had a direct bearing on her fate so it was the same thing trojan do your worst the evil eyes flashed horrendously darkening the entire area smash was in a compound with assorted other creatures it was a miserable place stinking of poverty doom and despair jets of bright fire shot from cracks in the ground preventing escape harpies and other carrion birds wheeled above watching for food slop time a guard called and dumped a pail of gar bage into the compound a gnome an elf and a wyvem pounced on the foul refuse but before they got more than a few stinking scraps the harpies swooped down in a squadron and snatched it all away leaving only a pile of defecation in its place the prisoners squabbled among themselves in angry frustration smash saw that all were emaciated they had not been getting enough food small wonder with those harpies hovering what was to be his torture this time for smash realized now that these scenes were supposed to be extremely un pleasant even for an ogre each was awful in a different way as he considered the sun moved rapidly across the pale sky as if time were accelerating for normally nothing could prevail on the sun to hurry its pace one bit smashs hunger accelerated too it took a lot of food to maintain a healthy ogre slops the guard called and dumped the pail there was another scramble but the wyvem wasnt in it that noble little dragon was now too far gone to scramble in any event the harpies got most of the slop again smash felt a pang even garbage looked good now and he had gotten none of course he wouldnt touch anything a harpy had been near anyway they spoiled ten times as much as they ate coating their discards with poisonous refuse har pies were the worlds dirtiest birds in fact real birds re fused to associate with these witchheaded monsters the wyvern belched out a feeble wisp of fire and col ogre ogre lapsed smash crossed over to it moved by unogrish com passion anything i can do for you he asked after all it took one monster to understand another but the wyvem merely expired immediately the other prisoners converged working up what slaver they could dragon meat was a lot better than starvation affronted by the notion of such a fine fighting animal being consumed so indelicately smash hefted a fist ready to defend the body but the vultures descended in a swarm gouging the corpse to pieces from every side so swiftly that smash could do nothing in moments nothing but bones was left his efforts perhaps pointless from the beginning had been wasted smash returned to his place the sun plopped behind a distant mountain throwing up a small shower of debris that colored the clouds briefly in that vicinity it really ought he thought to be more careful where it landedl the stars blinked on some more alertly than others the nocturnal heavens spun by making short work of the night by morning smash was ravenous so were his surviving companions they eyed one another covertly judging when one or the other might be unable to defend himself from consumption when the guard came with the slops the gnome stumbled forward foodi food he croaked the guard paused eying the gnome cynically are you ready to pay ill pay ill pay the gnome agreed with uncomfort ably guilty eagerness the guard reached through the bars of fire and into the gnomes body he hauled out the gnomes struggling soul an emaciated and bedraggled thing that slowly coalesced into a pallid sphere the guard inspected it briefly to make certain it was all there then crammed it indifferently into a dirty bag then he set the pail of slop down and waved the hovering harpies away they screamed epithets of pro test but obeyed one however so far lost control of herself as to loop down close to the tantalizing garbage the guards eyes glinted darkly and the harpy screeched in i sudden terror and pumped back into the dingy sky drop ping several greasy feathers in her haste smash wondered what it was that had so cowed her for harpies had little ogre ogre respect for anything and the guard was an ordinary human being or reasonable facsimile thereof the gnome plunged his head into the bucket and greed ily slurped the glop he guzzled spoiled milk gulped apple and onion peels and crunched on eggshells and coffee grounds in a paroxysm of satiation he had his food now he had paid for it the guard turned to gaze at smash there was a malig nant glitter in the mans eye smash realized that he was in fact an aspect of the night stallion on his rounds col lecting more souls now smash understood the nature of this trial he re solved not to purchase his sustenance at that price if he lost his soul here he lost it everywhere and would not be able to help chem and tandy escape but he knew that this would be the most difficult contest yet each time the stallion came smash would be hungrier and the pail of slops would lure him more strongly how could he be sure he would hold out when starvation melted his muscles and deprived him of willpower this was not a single effort to be made and settled one way or the other this was a draggingout siege against his hungerand the hunger of an ogre was more terrible than his strength the sun shoved rapidly across the welkin looking some what undernourished and irritated itself it kicked innocent clouds out of the way burning one so that the cloud lost continence and watered on the ground below it was an evil day and smashs hunger intensified he had to escape be fore he succumbed he got up dusted off his bedraggled and filthy hide and approached the burning barrier these jete were unlike those of the firewall in xanth or the jets of the region of fire for they were thicker and hotter than the first and steadier than the second but perhaps he could cross them certainly he had to try he held his breath closed his eyes and charged across the barrier of flames after all he had done this in the real world he could survive a little additional scorching he felt the sudden searing heat his fur curled and friz zled this was worse than he had anticipated his hunger weakened body was more sensitive to pain not less then ogre ogre ogre ogre the fire passed he screeched to a halt on singed toes and opened his clenched eyelids he was in the prison chamber the bars of flame behind him he had blackened stripes along his fur and his skin smartedbut it seemed he had gotten turned about what a mistake he turned gulped more air screwed his orbs shut again and leaped through the burning bars again the pain flared awfully this time he knew he hadnt turned he had been in midair as he crossed the flame but as he unscrewed his vision blinking away the smoke from his own eyelashes he found himself still in the cell apparently it was not all that easy to escape he had to go by the rules of the scene nevertheless he readied himself for a third try because an ogre never knew when to quit but as he oriented on the bars he saw the guard standing just beyond them with a glittering gaze suddenly he did know when to quit he turned about and went back to his original spot in the com pound and squatted there like a good prisoner he didnt want to go near the dark horse until this struggle was over the sun plunged another poor creature yielded his vital soul to the stallion in payment for food two more per ished of starvation smashs firewounds festered and his fur fell out in stripes his belly swelled as his limbs shri veled he became too weak to stand he sat crosslegged head hanging forward contemplating the tendons that showed in high relief on his thighs where the hair had fallen out he did not ask for food though he was now being consumed by his own hunger he knew the price slowly while the days and nights raced across the sky he starved he realized as he sank into the final stupor that when he died the stallion would have his squl any way somehow he had misplayed this one too once more he stood beforethe stallion statue still he had some of his soul and would not yield apparently there was a limit to how much of a soul could be taken as penalty for each loss and ogres were omery creatures ill fight for my soul as long as any of it remains to fight for smash declared bring on your next horror equine the eyes glinted then the night stallion moved coming alive you have fought well ogre it said speaking with out difficulty through its horses mouth you have won every challenge this was completely unexpected but i died each time without ever deviating from your purpose you were subjected to the challenge of fear but you evinced no fear well ogres dont know what that is smash said and to the challenge of pain but you did not capitu late ogres dont know how smash admitted and to the challenge of fatigue how could i stop when i thought my friend was caught and to the challenge of hunger that was a bad one smash acknowledged but the price was too high his eye queue curse had made him aware of the significance of the price otherwise he almost certainly would have succumbed and so you blundered through allowing nothing to sway you and thus vacated the lien on fourfifths of your soul only one more test remainsbut on this one depends all that you have gained so far you will win your whole soul hereor lose it send me to that test smash said resolutely the stallions eyes flickered intensely but the scene did not change why did you accept the lien on your soul the creature asked smashs eye queue warned him that the eyeflicker meant he had been projected to another vision and was being tested since the scene had not changed this must be a different sort of test from the others beware to save the soul of my friend whom i had promised to protect smash said carefully i thought you knew that it was your minion of the coffin who cheated her out of it what kind of fool would place the welfare of another before his own the horse demanded ignoring smashs remark smash shrugged embarrassed i never claimed to be other than a fool ogres are very strongand very stupid ogre ogre ogre ogre the stallion snorted if you expect me to believe your implication you think im a fool i know most ogres are stupid but you are not why is that unfortunately ogres were not much given to lying it was part of their stupidity smash had been directly asked he would have to answer i am cursed with the eye queue the vine makes me much smarter than i should be and imbues me with aspects of conscience aesthetic aware ness and human sensitivity i would rid myself of it it i could but i need the intelligence in order to help my friends fool the stallion roared the eye queue curse is an illusion everything in the gourd and in the void is illusion of one sort or another smash countered much of xanth is illusion and perhaps mundania too it might be that if we could only see the ultimate reality xanth itself would not exist but while i exist in it or think i do i will honor the rules of illusion as i do those of reality and draw on the powers my illusory eye queue provides as i do on those my real ogre strength provides the stallion paused that was not precisely what i meant but perhaps it is a sufficient answer obviously your own intelligence is no illusion but were you not aware that the effect of the eye queue vine is temporary that it wears off in a few hours at most and in many cases provides not true intelligence but a vain illusion of it that causes the recipient to make a genuine fool of himself the laughingstock of all who perceive his selfdelusion smash realized that the creature was indeed testing him another wayand an intellectual test was most treacherous for an ogre i was not aware of that he admitted per haps my companions were too kind to think of me in that way but i believe my intelligence is real for it has helped me solve many problems no ordinary ogre could handle and has broadened my horizons immeasurably if this be illusion it is tolerable certainly it lasted me many days without fading perhaps it works better on ogres who can hardly be rendered more foolish than they naturally are you are quite correct you are no ordinary ogre and you are smart enough to give me a considerable challenge most creatures who place their souls in peril do so for far less charitable reasons but of course you are only half ogre naturally the lord of nightmares knew all about him smash refused to lose his temper for that surely was what the stallion wanted lose temper lose soul i am what i am an ogre the stallion nodded as if discovering a weakness in smashs armor he was up to something smash could tell by the way he swished his tail in the absence of flies an ogre with the wit and conscience of a man one who makes the eye queue vine work beyond its capacities and makes it work again even when the vine itself is illusory one who maintains a loyalty to his responsibilities and associates that others would fain define as entirely human i also made the gourd work in the void when it was illusory smash pointed out if you seek to undermine my enhanced intelligence by pointing out that it has no basis you must also concede that your testing of me has no ba sis that was not precisely my thrust similar situations may have differing interpretations he snorted clearing his long throat you have mastered the four challenges without fault and are now entitled to assume the role of master of challenges i shall retire from the office you shall be the night ogre the night ogre smash despite the eye queue was having trouble grasping this you will send the bad images out with your night ogresses and collect the souls of those who yield them you will be master of the gourd the powers of the night will be yours i dont want the powers of the night smash protested i just want to rescue my friends with the powers of the night you can save them the stallion pointed out you will be able to direct your night creatures to bear them sleeping from the void to the safety of the ordinary xanth jungle but smashs eye queue illusory though it might be in terfered with this promising solution would i get to re turn to the world of the day myself the master of night has no need to visit the day so you are prisoner of the night yourself smash said ogre ogre you may capture the souls of others but your own is hos tage i can go to the day the stallion protested again the eye queue looked the horses gift in the mouth it was full of dragons teeth only if you collect enough souls to pay your way how many does it take for an hour of day a dozen a hundred there is another way the stallion said uncomfortably surely so if you arrange a replacement for yourself smash said someone steadfast enough to do the job ac cording to the rules no matter how unpleasant or painful or tedious it becomes someone whom power does not cor rupt the dark horse was silent why is it necessary to send bad dreams to people smash asked is this only a means to jog them from their souls it has a loftier rationale than that the stallion replied somewhat stiffly if no one ever suffered the pangs of conscience or regret evil would prosper without hindrance and eventually take over the world evil can be the sweet sugar of the soul temptingly pleasant in small doses but inevitably corrupting the bad dreams are the realizations of the consequence of evil a timely warning that all think ing creatures require the nightmares guard constantly against spiritual degradationthat same corruption you have withstood take the position ogre you have earned it i wish i could help you smash said but my life is outside the gourd in the jungles of xanth i am a simple forest creature i must help my friends survive the wilder ness in my own fashion and not aspire to be more than any ogre was ever destined to be the stallions eyes dimmed you have navigated the fi nal challenge you have avoided the ultimate temptation of power you are free to return to xanth with your soul in tact the lien is voided suddenly smash felt completely strong again his soul restored but i need help he said i must borrow three of your nightmares to carry my party out of the void nightmares are not beasts of burden the stallion pro tested scraping the ground with a forehoof it seemed this ogre ogre creature if not actually piqued by smashs refusal to take over the proffered office was still less cooperative than he might have been when one scorned an offer of any nature one had to bear the penalty the nightmares alone can travel anywhere even out of the void smash said knowing he had to find some way to gain the assistance he needed only they can help us they could if they chose to the horse agreed but their fee is half a soul for each person carried half my soul smash exclaimed i dont have enough for three half a sou not necessarily your own but it is true you do not have enough nightmare rides come steep smash realized that he was right back in the dilemma he thought he had escaped he had placed his soul in jeopardy to rescue tandy from the gourd now he would have to do it again to rescue tandy and chem from the void but if he rescued both he himself would be lost for the eye queue informed him that two halves of a soul amounted to the whole soul of course he could rescue only tandy the one he had agreed to protect but he could not see his way clear to leave chem in the void she was a nice creature with a worthy mission she did not deserve to be deserted and he had more or less agreed to protect her too when her brother chet had delivered her to him at the brink of the gap chasm i will pay the price he said thinking of the gnome begging for slops do you realize that you could rescue them and retain your soul by becoming the master of night the stallion asked i fear i must go to hell in my own fashion smash said regretfully the horse obviously thought him a smart fool and his eye queue heartily endorsed the sentiment but somehow his fundamental ogre nature shied away from the responsibility for damning others better to be one of the damned even in sacrifice you are ogrishly stupid the stallion remarked with disgust you are obviously unfit for duty here agreed smash agreed go negotiate directly with the mares the horse ogre ogre snorted ill have no part of this his eyes flared with their black light then smash found himself on the plain of the mares the dark herd charged toward him circling him in mo ments as was their wont then they recognized him and hesitated i need two of you to carry my friends to safety he said i know the price naaaay one cried smash recognized her as the one he had tried to befriend the one who had carried tandy to the good magicians castle that had been involuntary without a feeuntil the coffin had claimed a double fee retroactively obviously none of that payment had gone to the mare it had been a gyp deal all around but she cer tainly knew how to carry a person he was sorry he had not been able to figure out what she wanted from xanth i must rescue tandy and chem smash said i will pay the fee who will make the deal two other mares volunteered smash wasnt sure what use they would have for the halves of his soul but that was not much of his business maybe half souls were bartering currency within the gourd accounting for status in the nightmare hierarchy sod he said cautioned by his eye queue soul on delivery they nodded agreeing can you find them he asked when they nodded naaay he realized he would have to go with them at least to where the girls were well wed better introduce ourselves he said i am smash the ogre how shall i know the two of you one of the two struck the ground with a forehoof she left a circular impression in the dirt with little ridges dark spots and pockmarks smash peered at it closely struck by a nagging familiarity where had he seen a configuration like that before then he grasped it this was like a map of the moon with the pocks like the cheese holes one of the dark areas was highlighted and he saw that there was let tering on it mare crisium so youre the mare crisium he said making the con nection mind if i call you crisis she shrugged acquiescently smash turned to the other and who are you ogre ogre the other stomped a forehoof her moonmap was high lighted in another place mare vaporum and youre the mare vaporum he said ill call you vapor the befriended mare now came forward nickering of fering to carry him but i have no soul left over to pay you he protested besides youre far too small to handle a monster like me she walked under himand suddenly he found that he had shrunk or she had grown for now he was riding her comfortably it seemed nightmares had no firmly fixed size then tell me your name too he said you are doing me an unpaid favor and i want to know you in case i should ever be able to repay it i never did discover what you wanted from xanth you know she stamped her hoof he leaned down over her shoul der hanging on to her slick black mane that flowed like a waterfall until he was able to read her map it was high lighted at a large patch labeled mare imbrium you i will call hnbri he decided because i dont know what your name means the three mares galloped across the plain leaving the herd behind little maps of the moon formed the trail wherever their feet touched it made him hungry to think about it too bad the maps werent real with genuine cheese soon they passed through a greenish wall and out into the void it was the rind of the gourd smash realized they were large and the gourd was smallbut somehow it all related he kept trying to forget that size and mass hardly mattered when magic was involved they looped once aroundand there was the brute ogre staring into the gourds peephole until this moment smash had not quite realized that his body had not accom panied him inside he had known it of course but never truly realized it even his eye queue had never come to grips with the seeming paradox of being in two places at the same time then he spied tandy and chem they were asleep it was night of course the only time the nightmares could go abroad ogre ogre well have to wake them smash said then paused noa person has to be asleep to ride a nightmare i re member now or disembodied like me im really asleep too ill put them on you asleep he dismounted and went to pick tandy up but his hands passed right through her he had no phys ical substance he pondered ill have to wake myself up he decided since my soul is forfeit anyway i should be able to stay near the nightmares they arent going to depart before they get their payment it was a rather painful kind of security however he went to his body what a hulking brutish thing it was the black fur was shaggy in some places unkempt in others and singed from his experiences with the firewall in yet others the hamhands and hamfeet were huge and clumsylooking the face was simultaneously gravelly and mushy no selfrespecting creature would be attracted to the physical appearance of an ogreand of course the monsters intellect was even worse he was doing tandy a favor by removing himself from her picture come on ogre you have work to do he grunted put ting out a paw to shake his shoulder but his hand passed through himself too and the body ignored him exactly like the stupid thing it was enough of this nonsense idioti he rasped he put a hamflnger over the peephole he might be insubstantial in this form but he was visible the finger cut os the view the effect was similar to the removal of the gourd suddenly smash was back in his body awake the phan tom self had vanished it existed only when he peered into the gourd when his mental self was apart from his physi cal self the three mares stood watching him warily ordinarily they would have fled the presence of a waking person but they realized that this was a special situation he was about to become one of them all right he said quietly so as not to wake the girls ill set one girl on each of you volunteers you carry them north beyond the void and set them down safely then you split my soul between you fair enough the two mares nodded smash went to lift chem gently ogre ogre she weighed as much as he but he had his full strength now and could readily handle her mass he set her on cri sis chem was bigger than the mare but again the fit was right and the sleeping centaur straddled crisis comfort ably he lifted tandy next she was so small he could have raised her with one finger as he had biythe brassie but he used both hands with infinite care he set her on vapor then he mounted his own mare imbri who had come without the promise of payment again the fit was right anybody could ride any nightmare if the mare permitted it i wish i knew what you want from xanth he mur mured then he remembered that this was irrelevant he would not be returning to xanth anyway so could not fetch her anything they moved on through the void traveling north this was the easy part descending into the depths of the funnel and smash saw that the center of the void was a black hole from which nothing returned not even light this the mares skirted there were after all limits they galloped as swiftly as thought itself the mares as dark as the awful dreams they fostered smash now had a fair understanding of the origin and rationale of those dreams he did not envy the dark horse his job if it was bad to experience the dreams how much worse was it to manufacture them the stallion had the burden of the vi sion of evil for the whole world on his mind no wonder he wanted to retire what use was infinite power when it could be used only negatively they climbed the far slope of the funnel leaving the brink of the dread black hole behind unobstructed by the invisible wall in whatever manner it existed in another moment they were out of the void and into the night of normal xanth smash felt a horrible weight departing his shoulders he had saved them he had gotten them out of the void at last how wonderful this normal xanthian jungle seemed he looked eagerly at it knowing he could not stay that his soul was now forfeit the mares had delivered and it was now his turn perhaps he would be allowed to visit this region on occasion in bodiless form just to renew the ogre ogre ogre ogre awareness of what he had lost and to see how his friends were doing they halted safely beyond the line smash dismounted and lifted chem to the ground where she continued sleep ing feet curled under her head lolling she was a pretty creature of her kind not as well developed as she would be at full maturity but with a nice coat and delicate human features he was glad he had saved her from the void someday she would browbeat some male centaur into hap piness exactly as her mother had done centaurs were strongwilled creatures but well worth knowing farewell friend he murmured i have seen you safely through the worst of xanth i hope you are satisfied with your map then he lifted tandy she was so small and delicate seeming in her sleep her brown hair fell about her face in disarray partly framing and partly concealing her features he deeply regretted his inability to see her through her ad venture but he had made a commitment to the good ma gician humfrey and he was honoring that commitment in the only fashion he knew he had seen tandy through dan ger and trusted she could do all right now on her own she had fitted a lot of practical experience into this journey in a moment he knew he would not care about her at all for caring was impossible without a soul but in this instant he did care he remembered how she had kissed him and he liked the memory human ways were not ogre ways of course but perhaps they had a certain merit through her he had gleaned some faint inkling of an alter nate way of life where violence was secondary to feeling it was no life for an ogre of coursebut somehow he could not resist returning the favor of that kiss now he brought her to his face and touched her precious little lips with his own big crude ones tandy woke instantly the two mares jumped away afraid of being seen by a waking person not of their do main but they did not flee entirely held by the incipient promise of his soul oh smash tandy cried youre back i was so wor ried you stayed in the gourd so long and chem said she thought you werent ready to be roused yet now he was in trouble yet he was obscurely glad it was better to explain things to her so that she would not think he had deserted her you are free of the void tandy but i must leave you oh no smash she protested dont ever leave me this was becoming rapidly more difficult separating from her was somewhat like departing the voidsubtly awkward the mares who carried you out of the void in your sleepthey have to be paid her brow furrowed in the cute way it had paid how he was afraid she wouldnt like this but ogres werent much for prevarication even in a good cause my soul she screamed chem bolted awake snatching up the rope and the mares retreated farther switching their tails nervously whats the matter smash sold his soul to free us tandy cried pointing an accusing finger at the ogre he cant do that the centaur protested he went to the gourd to win back his soul it was the only way smash said he gestured to the two mares i think it is time he looked behind him lo cating imbri and if you will kindly carry my body back into the void afterward so it wont get in anyones way out here the three mares came forward tandy screamed again and threw her arms about smashs neck no no take my soul instead the mares paused uncertain of the proprieties they meant no harm they were only doing their job tandy disengaged herself and dropped to the ground her dander was up my souls almost as good as his isnt it she said to the mares take it and let him go she advanced on crisis i cant let him be taken i love him she surely did for this was the most extreme sacrifice she could make she was deathly afraid of the interior of the gourd smash understood this perfectly that was why he couldnt let her go there but if she refused to let him go in peace what was he to do chem interceded just exactly what was the deal you made smash half my soul for each person carried from the void but three were carried werent they the centaur ogre ogre ogre ogre asked her fine human mind percolating as the fog of sleep dissipated that would mean one and a half souls i am returning with the mares smash said i dont count imbri carried me as a favor shes the one who car ried tandy to the good magicians castle a year ago shes a good creature i know she is tandy agreed but imbri chem asked is that an equine name mare imbrium he clarified the nightmares come out only at night so they never see the sun they identify with places on the moon mare imbrium she repeated the sea of rains surely the raining of our tears so that was what the name meant the education of the centaur had clarified it certainly it was appropriate imbri was reigning over or reining in the rain of tears but it could be said in her favor that she had not done anything to cause those tears she had charged no soul not my tears tandy protested tearfully smash i wont let you go i have to go smash said gently ogres arent very pretty and they arent very smart but they do do what they agree to do i agreed to see the two of you safely through the hazards of xanth and i agreed to parcel my soul be tween the two mares who delivered you from the void you have no right to sacrifice yourself again for us chem cried anyway it wont work well perish alone in the wilderness of northern xanth well it seemed better to get you to xanth instead of the void smash said awkwardly somehow the right he thought he was doing seemed less right now near the edge of xanth the magic begins to fade so its less danger ous ha tandy exclaimed ive heard the mundane mon sters are worse than the xanth ones it may be less dangerous only if you accompany us chem said she considered briefly but a deals a deal the mares must be paid ill pay them tandy offered no smash cried the gourd is not for the like of you it is better for the like of me i dont think so chem said we have all had enough of the gourd regardless of whether weve been inside it but there are three of us we can pay the mares and retain half a soul each three fares so smash can be free too but neither of you has to give any part of her soul for me smash objected you were doing it for us the centaur said we can get along on half souls if were careful i understand they regenerate in time yes tandy said grasping this notion as if being saved from drowning each person can pay her own way she turned to the nearest mare who happened to be crisis take half my soul she said chem faced the second imbri take half of mine the mare of rains hesitated for she had not expected to be rewarded and she had not carried chem take it the centaur insisted the mares glad to have the matter resolved galloped past their respective donors smash saw two souls attenuate between girls and mares then each one tore in half and the mares were gone smash was left standing by the third mare vapor he realized that he could not do lessand of course vapor was supposed to have a half soul in fact she had been promised half of his now she would get it though she had not carried him take half of mine he said vapor charged him there was a wrenching and tearing then he stood reeling something awfully precious had been taken from himbut not all of it then he saw the two girls standing similarly bemused and he knew that something even more precious had been salvaged chapter ogre fun in the morning they woke having suffered no bad dreams the nightmares were not about to venture near them now for that might give them the opportunity to change their minds about their souls also what dreams could they be served worse than what they had already experienced xanth was lovely the green trees glistened in the fading dew and flowers opened white clouds formed lazy pat terns around the sun daring it to bum them off but it ignored their taunts the air was fragrant mainly it was a joy to be alive and free much more joy than it had been before smash discovered that such things were by no means guaranteed he had died in a great dark ocean un der the teeth of lions under a rock he was too fatigued to move and of starvation in prison he had won back his soul then given it up again now he was here with half his i soul and he really appreciated what he had for some time they compared notes each person need ing reassurance because of the lingering ache of separated souls but gradually they acclimated finding that half a soul was indeed much better than none smash tested his strengthand found it at halflevel he had to use both hands instead of one to crush a rock to sand until the other half of his soul regenerated he would be only half an ogre in that respect but this too seemed a reasonable price to pay for his freedom i think it is time for me to go my own way chem said at last i think i have had about as much of this sort of adventure as i can handle i have it all mapped my survey ogre ogre is done now i need to organize the data and try to make sense of it magic doesnt have to make sense smash said rhetori cally but where will you go tandy asked the centaur filly generated her map with all of north ern xanth clearly laid out their travel route neatly marked in a dotted line it is safe for my kind around the fringes of xanth she said centaurs have traded all along the coasts ill trot west to the isthmus then south to castle roogna ill have no trouble at all her projected route dotted its way down the length of northern xanth confi dently she seemed to have forgotten her protestation of last night about how they would perish without smashs protection and smash did not remind her of it obviously it had been his welfare not her own she had been con cerned with i suppose thats best tandy said reluctantly i really liked the company of all you other creatures but your mis sions are not my mission just remember youre not as strong as you should be thats one reason i want to get on home chem said id recommend the same for both of you but i know your destiny differs from mine you have to go on to the ogrefenogre fen smash and take what you find there though i personally feel thats a mistake me make mistake smash asked the things of the void had faded in the night since they had left it and now he found it easier to revert to his normal mode of speech there was no hypnogourd and no eye queue vine so he was not smart any more smash youre half human chem said if you would only give your human side a chance me no man me ogre clan he said firmly that faith had brought him through the horrors of the gourd she sighed so you must be what you must be and do what you must do tandy chem shook her head i cant advise you i hope you get what you want somehow the two girls embraced tearfully then the centaur trot ted away to the west her pretty brown tail flying at half mast as if reflecting the depressed state of her soul im as foolish as you are tandy said drying her eyes ogre ogre ogre ogre so that the blue emerged again like little patches of sky lets get on to the fen before night smash they moved on smash now so near his destination found himself strangely uneasy the good magician had told him he would find what he needed among the ances tral ogres humfrey had not said what that would be or whether smash would like it suppose he didnt like what he needed suppose he hated it suppose it meant the denial of all that he had experienced on this journey with the seven girls the eye queue had been a curse and surely he was well rid of ityet there had been a certain covert satisfaction in ex pressing himself as lucidly as any human being could fa cility of expression was power too just as was strength of muscle the gourd had been a horroryet that too had had its fine moments of exhilarating violence and deep rev elation these things were of course peripheral no con cern of a true ogrebut he had felt something fundamen tally good in them he struggled through his annoying stupidity as he tromped on toward the ogre fen exactly what had made his journey so rewarding despite its nuisances and prob lems not the violence for he could have that any time by challenging stray dragons not the intelligence for that was no part of an ogres heritage not the exploration of the central mysteries of xanth for ogres were not very curious about geography what then as the day faded and the sun hurried down to the hori zon so as not to be caught by night smash finally broke through to a conclusion it wasnt a very original one for ogres werent very original creatures but it would do he had valued the camaraderie the seven girls had needed him and had treated him like a person his long associa tion with the human beings and centaurs of castle roogna had acclimated him to company but this time he had had the wit to appreciate it more fully because of the eye queue curse now he was cursed with the memory of what could not be again camaraderie was not the ogre way at dusk they reached the dismal fringe of the ogrefen ogre fen the swampy marsh stretched out to the east and north as far as the eyeball could peer riddled with green gators and brown possums and other halffanciful denizens were the ancestral ogres also here look tandy cried pointing smash looked there were three ironwood trees braided together that was a sure signal of the presence of ogres since no other creature could do such a thing i guess youll get what you want tomorrow tandy said youll meet your tribe she seemed sad yes me agree he said somehow not as overjoyed as he thought he should be his mission was about to termi nate that was what he wanted wasnt it he twisted a coppertree into the semblance of a shelter for her and spread a large leaf from a table tree over it in the heyday of his strength he could have done better but this would have to do for tonight but it didnt matter tandy didnt use it she curled up against his furry shoul der and slept what was her destiny he wondered before he crashed into his own heavy slumber he now understood that she was looking for a human husband and was destined to find one on this journeybut time was running out for her too he hoped whoever she found would be a good man who would appreciate her spunky qualities and not be bothered by her tantrumtalent smash himself rather liked her tan trums they were a little like ogre love taps perhaps his first inkling of liking for her had been when she threw a tantrum at him she wasnt really a badtempered girl she just tended to get overly excited under extreme stress there had been some of that on this journey too bad he thought again that she couldnt have been an ogress but of course ogresses didnt have magic tricks like tantrums or cute little ways of expressing them selveslike kissing he shook his head he was getting unogrishly maudlin what could an ogre know of the refined raptures of human love of the caring that went beyond the hungers of the moment of the joy and sacrifice of helping the loved one regardless of the cost to oneself certainly not himself yet there was something about this foolish passionate determined girlhuman creature she was so small she was hardly a good morsel for a meal yet she was precious be ogre ogre ogre ogre yond the comprehension of his dim ogre wit she had shown cunning and courage in catching and riding a nightmare to escape her amorous demon and other excellent qualities had manifested since he would miss her when she found her proper situation and left him as had the other girls he thought to kiss her again but the last time he had tried that she had awakened instantly and things had got ten complicated he wanted her to complete her sleep in peace this time so he desisted he had no business kissing a human girl anywayor kissing anything for that matter a drop of rain spattered on her forehead no not rain for the night was calm and the nightmare of rains was nowhere near it was a tear similar to the ones she had dropped on him when she had so angrily demonstrated how human beings expressed affection a tear from his own eye and this was strange because no true ogre cried per haps it was her own tear recycled through his system re turning to her carefully he wiped away the moisture with a hamfinger he had no right to soil her pretty little brow with such contamination she deserved much better better than an ogre the tromp of enormous clumsy feet woke them in the morning the ogres were coming hastily smash and tandy got up smash felt a smidgen stronger perhaps his soul had grown back a little while he slept but he was nowhere near full strength yet knowing the nature of his kind he worried some about that the ogres of the fen arrived small creatures scurried for cover and trees angled their leaves away no one wanted trouble with ogres there were eight of them three brutish males and five females smash gazed at the ogresses in dim wonder two were grizzled old crones one was a stout cub and two were ma ture creatures of his own generation huge and shaggy with muddy fur reeking of sweat and with faces whose smiles would stun zombies and whose frowns would bum wood they were the most repulsive brutes imaginable smash was entranced who he the biggest of the males demanded his voice was mainly a growl unintelligible to ordinary folk smash could understand him because he was another ogre smash himself was unusual in that he could speak comprehensi bly most ogres could communicate verbally only with other ogres suddenly smash was fed up with the rhyming conven tion what good was it when no one who counted could understand it anyway i am smash son of crunch i come to seek my satisfaction among the ancestral ogres as it is destined halfbreed the other ogre exclaimed no need for smashs ability to talk unrhymed betrayed his mixed par entage smash had never liked being called a halfbreed but he could not honestly refute it my mother is a cursefiend he admitted but my father is an ogre and so am i one of the crones spoke up wise beyond her years cursefien human bein she croaked half man the big male ogre grunted we ban might fight the child ogress said eyes lighting it was true an ogre could establish his place in a tribe by fighting for it the male grunted eagerly he me he naturally wanted to be the first to chastise the presump tuous halfbreed what are they saying tandy asked alarmed by the increasingly aggressive stances of the fen ogres it occurred to smash that she would not approve of a physical fight they merely seek some ogre fun he ex plained not telling her that this was apt to be roughly simi lar to the fun the lions of the den had had with him fun in the fen she was not fooled what ogres call fun i call may hem smash you cant afford any trouble youre only at halfstrength there was that fighting was fun but getting beaten to a pulp was not as much fun as winning if anything hap pened to him here tandy would be in trouble for these ogres were not halfway civilized as smash himself was it was galling but he would have to pass up this opportunity no comment he said the ogres goggled incredulously not hot the male ogre demanded his hamfists shuddering with eagerness to pulverize ogre ogre smash turned away i think what i want is elsewhere after all he told tandy lets get away from here he tried to keep the urgency suppressed this could get diffi cult in a moment at least he was not caged in the way he had been with the lions the male made a huge jump landing directly before smash he poked a hamfinger at smashs soiled orange centaur jacket what got he demanded this was not curiosity but insult any creature in clothing was considered effete too weak to survive in the jungle smash raged inwardly at the implication but had to avoid trouble he stepped around the ogre and went on north toward the fen but again the male leaped in front of him he pointed at smashs steel gauntlets making a crudely elaborate gesture of pulling dainty feminine gloves on his own hairy meat hooks the humor of ogres was necessarily crude but it was effective on its level smash paused me swat he snot the ogre chortled aiming a wood sundering blow at smashs head smash lifted a gleaming fist of his own defensively no tandy screamed again smash had to avoid conflict he ducked under the blow in a gesture that completely surprised the ogre and continued north inwardly seething it simply wasnt an ogres way to accept such taunts and duck away from a fight now one of the mature females barred his way her hair was like the tentacular mass of a quarrelsome tangle tree that had just lost a battle with a giant spider web her face made the bubbling mud of the fen seem like a clear mir ror her limbs were so gnarled she might readily pass for a dead shagtree riddled by the droppings of a flock of har pies with indigestion smash had never before encountered such a luscious mass of flesh he cute cheroot she said that was a considerable comeon for an ogress since there were more females than males in this tribe there was obviously a place for smash here if he wanted it good magician humfrey had evidently known this and known that smash needed to settle down with a good female of his own kind what the aging magician had overlooked was ogre ogre the fact that smash would arrive at halfstrength and that tandy would not yet have found her own situation thus smash could not afford to accept the offer however grossly tempting it might be because he could not fight well and could not afford to leave tandy to the ogres mer cies for a female went only to the winner of a fight be tween males so once again he avoided interaction and con tinued on north then the male ogre bad an inspiration of genius for his kind me eat complete he said and grabbed for tandy smashs gauntleted fist shot forward and up catching the ogre smack in the snoot the gauntlet made smashs fist harder than otherwise and increased the effect of its impact the creature rocked back spitting out a yellow tooth delight he cried he fight no tandy yelled again despairingly she knew as well as smash did that it was too late smash had struck the ogre and that committed him quickly the other ogres circled him tandy scooted to a beerbarrel tree getting out of the way smash had never before fought another ogre and wasnt quite sure how to proceed were there conventions did they take turns striking each other was anything barred the ogre gave him no chance to consider he charged his right fist swinging in a windmill motion back and up and forward and down aimed for smashs head smash wished he had the eye queue so that he could analyze the meaning of this approach but dull as he was now he sim ply had to asisume that it meant anything went smash dodged ducked down caught the ogres feet and jerked them up to head height naturally the ogre flipped back his head smacking into the ground with a hollow boom like thunder denting a hole and shaking the bushes in the neighborhood the watching ogres nodded it was a good enough counter starting things off but smash knew that he had substituted guile for force to a certain extent finding a maneuver that did not require his full strength he could not proceed indefinitely this way the ogre bounced off his head somersaulted backward and twisted to his big flat feet he roared a roar that spooked a flock of buzzards from a buzzard bush and sent low clouds scudding hastily away he charged forward ogre ogre again grabbing for smash with both heavy arms but smash knew better than to wait for an ogre hug his or ange jacket would protect him from most of its crushing force but he would not be able to initiate much himself he jumped high stomping gently on the ogres ugly head in passing the stomp drove the ogre a small distance into the ground it was the first motion of the figure called the nail the ogre had to extricate his feet one by one leaving deep prints now he was really angry he turned fists swinging smash parried with one arm using a technique he had picked up at castle roogna then sent his gauntleted fist smashing into the ogres gross midgut it was like hitting wellseasoned ironwood in both places his parrying arm was bruised and his striking fist felt as if it had been clubbed this ogre was stupid so that his ploys were ob vious and easily avoided but he was also tough smash had held his own so far only because he was less stupid and had the protection of his centaur clothing if jacket and gaunt lets failed him the ogre caught smashs parrying arm in a grip of iron or steel and hauled him forward smash parried again by placing his free fist against the ogres snoot and shoving but he quickly became aware of his liability of half strength the other ogre could readily outmuscle him worse the ogre also became aware of this freak weak he grunted and lifted smash into the air smash twisted trying to free himself but could not now he was in for it the ogre jammed him down on his feet so hard it was smashs turn to sink into the ground he shot a terrible punch at smashs chestbut now the jacket did protect smash from most of the effect centaur clothing was de signed to be impervious to all stones arrows pikes teeth claws and other weapons an ogres fist was of course more than it was designed to withstand but the jacket was much better than nothing meanwhile smash countered with another strike to the ogres face beautifying it by knocking out another tooth he had good defense and good offense thanks to the centaursbut otherwise he re mained treacherously weak the ogre windmilled his fist again this time holding ogre ogre smash in place so that he could not escape the blow the fist sledgehammered down on the top of his head driving smash another notch lower he tried to parry but could not the ogre countered his counter another hammer blow landed on his noggin driving him down yet more this was the nail againand this time smash was the nail dont hurt him tandy screamed coming down from her tree eat me if you must but let smash be no smash cried kneedeep in the ground run tandy ogres dont honor deals about food you mean hell destroy you anyway after yes flee while you can while theyre watching me i cant do that she protested then she screamed for the child ogress larger than tandy had pounced on her tandy threw a tantrum once more her eyes swelled up her face turned purple and her hair stood out from her head the tantrum struck the little ogre who fell senseless to the ground tandy retreated to her tree for it took her some time to recharge a tantrum she was now as helpless as smash the ogre had paused watching this byplay the typical ogre was too stupid to pay attention to two things at once he could not watch tandy while pounding smash smash similarly had been too dull to try to extricate himself while watching tandy so had not taken advantage of his oppor tunity now the ogre resumed his effort completing the figure of the nail smash had somehow left his arms by his sides and now they too were caught in the ground pinned he knew he would never have allowed himself to get into this situation if he had retained his eye queue almost any fool would have known better knocks on the head were not ordinarily harmful to ogres because there was very little of importance in an ogre skull except bone but the repeated impacts did serve to jog loose a few stray thoughts flighty fancies not nor mally discovered in such territory why had tandy tried so foolishly to help him it would have made far more sense for her to flee and she was smart enough to have seen that of course her loyalty was commendablebut was largely wasted on an ogre as it was both would perish how did that jibe with the good magicians answers two people dead ogre ogre one answer was that the magician had grown too old to practice magic any more had lost his accuracy of proph ecy and had unwittingly sent them both to their doom it was also possible that the magician was aware of his inade quacy and had sent them to the wilds of interior xanth in order to avoid giving real answers he could have sus pected in his cunning senility that they would never re turn to charge rum with malpractice no smash remained unwilling to believe that of hum frey the man might be old but the gorgon had invigo rated him somewhat and he still might know what he was doing smash hoped so soon the ogre had him waistdeep in the ground and smash could not retaliate he lacked the strength yet if he had not yielded up half his soul someone would have had to remain in the void and that might not have been much of an improvement over the present situation still the blows descended until he was chestdeep and finally neckdeep then the ogre began to tire instead of using his fist he gave his big homy feet a turn he stomped on smashs head until it too was buried in the packed dirt the figure of the nail was complete smash had been driven like a stake fulllength into the ground he was helpless satisfied with his victory the ogre stomped toward the beerbarrel tree where tandy hid smash heard her scream in terror then he heard a fist crash into the trunk of the tree he heard beer swish out from the punctured barrel and smelled its fumes as it coursed across the ground to ward him he was in a dent in the ground formed by the ogres pounding he would soon be drowned in beer if he didnt manage to drink it all and tandy would be dipped in beer and eaten by the victor then he heard the patter of tandys feet coming toward him she was still being foolish she would be much easier to catch here the earth about his face became moist as the beer sank in and he heard it splashing when her feet struck it he hoped her pretty red slippers didnt get soiled meanwhile the ground shuddered as the other ogre tromped after her enjoying the chase then she was over smash scraping out the ground about ogre ogra his head with her feeble little human hands uncovering his buried eyes foaming beer from the tree swirled down blearing his vision but softening the dirt somewhat so she could better excavate but this was useless she could never hope to extricate him herself and already the ogre was looming over her amused at the futility of her effort smash she cried take my half soul in smashs dim beersotted mind something added up one half plus one half equaled something very much like one two half souls together he saw her half soul dropping toward him a hemisphere like a halfeaten apple bisected with fair precision then it struck his head bounced and sank in as the eye queue had done he became internally conscious of it as it spread through him it was a small sweet pretty innocent but spunky fillet of soul exactly the kind that belonged to a girl like her yet as it descended and joined with his big brutish homely leathery ogre half soul it merged to make a satisfying whole at this point in the night stallion horror visions this would have been the end but here in real life with a full soul pieced together it just might be the beginning smash felt his strength returning the ogre lifted tandy into the air by her brown tresses he slavered smashs sunken orbs perceived it all from their beersodden pit in the ground the girl tried to throw a tantrum but she was mostly out of the makings she was terrified rather than angry her tantrumenergy had recently been expended and she bad no soul her effort only made the ogre blink he opened his ponderous and mottled jaw and swung her toward his broken teeth smash flexed he had a full soul of sorts now his strength was back the ground buckled about him one hamhand rose up like the extremity of a zombie emerging from a longundisturbed grave dripping beersodden dirt it caught the hairy ankle of the ogre smash lifted he was well anchored in the ground so all he needed was power he had it the ogre rose into the air surprised but he did not let tandy go he continued to bring her to his salivating maw first things first after all smash brought the foot belonging to the ankle he held to ogre ogre ogre ogre his own mouth he opened his own dirtmarbled jaws they closed on the ogres horny toes they crunched hard folklore had it that ogres were invulnerable to pain be cause they were too tough and stupid to feel it folklore was in error the ogre bellowed out a blast of pain that shook the welkin making the sun vibrate in place and three clouds dump their water incontinently he dropped tandy smash caught her with his other hand after ripping it free of the ground with a spray of dirt that was like a small explosion he set her gently down find shelter he murmured it could become uncomfortable in this vicin ity she nodded mutely then scooted away smash spit out three toes watching them bounce across the dirt he waved the ogre in the air shall we begin toadsnoot he inquired politely the ogre was no coward no ogre was since an ogres brain was too obtuse to allow room for the circuitry of fear he was ready to begin the battle of ogre vs ogre was the most savage encoun ter known in xanth the very land about them seemed to tense expectantly aware that when this was over nothing would be the same perhaps nothing would be period the landscape of xanth was dotted with the imposing remnants of ancient ogre fightswaterfilled calderas stands of petrified trees mountains of rubble and similar artifacts the ogre began without imagination naturally enough he drove a hamfist down on smashs head this time smash met it with his open jaws the fist disappeared into his mouth and his teeth crunched on the scarred wrist again the ogre bellowed and the sun shook in its orbit and the clouds soaked indecorously one downpour spilled onto the sun itself causing an awful sizzle the ogre wrenched his arm upand popped smash right out of the ground in the process for naturally smash had not let go beermud flew outward and rained down on the watching ogres who snapped at the blobs automati cally the ogre slammed his two fists together hard since one fist was inside smashs mouth this meant smashs head was getting doubly boxed vapor shot out of his ears he spit out the fist since he was unable to chew it properly and freed his head now the two combatants faced each other two hulking monsters the one covered with dirt and reeking of beer the other minus two teeth and three toes both were an gryand the anger of ogres was similar to that of volcan oes tornadoes avalanches or other natural calamitiesapt to destroy the neighborhood indiscriminately you called me halfbreed smash said driving a gauntleted fist into the others shoulder this time the blow had ogre force the ogre was hurled sidewise into the trunk of a small rockmaple tree the tree snapped off its top section crashing down on the ogres ugly head he shrugged it off not even noticing the distraction he go me toe he said naming his own grievance though unable to count beyond one he fired his own fist at smashs shoulder the blow hurled smash sidewise into a rockcandy boulder the boulder shattered and sugar cubes flew out and descended like hailstones around them you tried to eat my friend smash said kicking the ogre in the rear the kick sent the monster sailing up in a high arc his posterior smoking then to make sure the ogre understood smash repeated it in ogrish he ea me she the ogre landed bottomfirst in the fen and the water bubbled and steamed about him he picked himself up by hauling with one hamhand on the shaggy nape of his neck then stomped the bog so that the mud flew outward like debris from a meteoric impact and ripped a mediumsized hickory tree from its mooring on an islet the tree came loose with an anguished hick and hicked again as the ogre smashed it down across smashs head breaking it asunder smash felt sorry for the ruined tree probably be cause of the influence of the sweet girls half soul he had borrowed the two ogres faced each other again having now wanned up there was a scurrying and fluttering in the sur rounding jungle as the creatures of the wild who had re mained before now fled the scene of impending violence there were also ripples in the swamp and the beat of drag ons wings all departing hastily none of them wanted any part of this ogre ogre now that smash had his full strength and had interacted with the other ogre it was his judgment that he was the stronger of the two and the smarter he believed he could beat this monsterand it was necessary that he do it to protect tandy but a lot of battle remained before the issue would be resolved smash leaned forward threw his arms around the ogre picked him up and charged toward the dense hard walls of a big walnut tree the ogres head rammed right through the wood and was buried inside the walltrunk his body dangling outside then there was a chomping sound the ogre was chew ing his way out despite his missing teeth soon his snout broke through the far side of the wall then chomped to the left and righthe spit out wallnuts as he went and they formed little walls around the tree where they fell then the tree crashed to the ground its trunk severed the ogre returned to the fray he ripped a medium rosewood tree from the ground and hurled it at smash smash threw up a fist to block it but the trunk splintered and showered him with splinterroses smash in turn swung a fist through a sandalwood trunk severing it he grabbed the loose part and hurled it at the ogre who blocked it this time there was a shower of sandals and other footwear the ogre took hold of a fat yew tree twisting it around and around though it bleated like a female sheep until the trunk separated from the stump me screw with yew he grunted ramming the twisted trunk at smashs face that is unogrammatical smash said ogres always say he or she not you but he ripped off a trunk of syca more and used it to counter the thrust syc em he cried bashing at the yew syc em more he cried bashing again and because this was the nature of that tree it sycked em more both trunks shattered trunks were really better for con taining things than for fighting some trunks were used for trumpeting still these were the most convenient things to use for this battle the ogre tromped into the deeper forest to the south where larger trees grew he chopped with both fists at a big redwood trunk smash stomped to a bigger bluewood ogre ogre and began knocking chips out of it with his own fists soon both trees came crashing down and each ogre picked one up the other ogre was the first to swing smash ducked and the redwood whistled over his head and cracked into a sturdy beech tree the encounter was horrendous the red was knocked right out of the redwood and the sand flew from the beech a cloud of reddyed sand formed making a brief but baleful sandstorm that swirled away in a series of diminishing funnels coating the other trees now smash swung his bluewood the ogre ducked be hind a butternut tree the trunk clobbered the tree blue dye flew out and butter squished out blue butter de scended in a gooky mass coating everything the red sand had missed including a small pasture of milkweed plants blue buttermilk formed all the spectator ogres turned from dry red to dripping blue it did improve their appear ance anything was better than the natural hue of an ogre the ogre bent to rip out a boxwood tree this time smash was faster he sliced off a section of trunk from a cork tree and rammed that at the exposed posterior the cork shoved the ogre right into the box where he was stuck bottomup corked now the ogre was really angry he bellowed so hard the box exploded and the cork shot up toward the sun with a loud bronx cheer when it hit the sun it detonated and a foul cloud eclipsed the orb turning a clear day to the smoggiest night ever to clog the noses of the jungle crea tures began coughing and choking all around and a num ber of plants wilted as the stench spread out like goo in the cloying darkness the ogre retreated he had had enough of smashs full strength but smash was not through with him he pursued following the ogre into the deepest jungle by the sound of his tromping something struck smashs arm temporarily numbing it it was an ironwood bar in the dark the ogre had harvested another tree and had hurled it from ambush some might consider this to be a cowardly act but ogres did not know the meaning of cowardice so it must have been some other kind of act ogres did comprehend cunning so perhaps that was it smash picked up the bar started to twist it into a harm ogre ogre less knot reconsidered and started to hurl it violently back reconsidered again and hung on to it it would make a decent spear he listened trying to locate the ogre he heard the sproing as another ironwood sapling was harvested he charged that spotand tripped over a fallen log naturally the log splintered into a storm of toothpicks that shot out like shrapnel making pincushions of the surrounding vege tation smash lost his balance he windmilled an arm and a leg now the ogre knew smashs location more accurately the other spear eame whistling at him as if it had not a care in the world and caught his outflung foot that smarted smash rolled back got his feet properly under him limped and struck back where his keen ogre hearing indicated the other ogre was unfortunately he had not realized that dirt remained in his ears from the time he was spiked into the ground his blow was countered being off target and the other bar clonked him on the side of the head this turned out to be a serendipitous blessing for the clonk knocked out most of the dirt now he could hear properly he reoriented and swung hard and accurately at the otherand missed for the other was retreating the smog was beginning to clear smash pressed for ward striking repeatedly at the dim shape before him the counterings grew fewer and weaker as the enemy retreated smash acceleratedand the figure ducked aside put out a footand smash tripped over it and stumbled headlong into a dropoff in midair he realized he had been tricked the ogre fa miliar with the terrain while smash was not had led him to the cliff smash should have been more suspicious of the sudden seeming weakness of his opponent but of course without his eye queue he was no smarter than any other ogre he landed on a bed of sharp gravel something yiped great yellow eyes opened a jet of flame illuminated the area smash got a clear view of his situation oops he had fallen directly into a dragons nest this was the lair of a big surface dragon open to the day be cause such a monster feared nothing not even ogres the ogre ogre dragon wasnt here at the moment but its five cubs were in a moment all of them were up and alert they were large cubs almost ready to depart the nest and start con suming people for themselves they were all as massive as smash with coppery snouts green metal neck scales and manes of silvery steel their teeth glinted like stars and their tongues slurped about hungrily as the light returned all recognized him as an enemy and as prey what a trap this was the ogre looked over the brink of the pit ho ho ho ho he roared thunderously causing the nearby trees to shake me screw he blue for smash stood on blue dia monds that made up the nest which he had taken for gravel all dragons liked diamonds they were pretty and hard and highly resistant to heat because dragons hoarded diamonds the stones assumed unreasonable value being very rare elsewhere smash understood this extended even to mundania though he wasnt sure how the dragons man aged to collect the stones from there dragons were not much for ceremony all five pounced blasting out little jets of flame that incinerated the vegeta tion around the nest and heated the diamonds at smashs feet forcing him to jump smash angry at himself for his stupidity in falling into this messimagine being outwitted by a dull ogre reacted with inordinate ie ogrish fury he just wasnt in the mood to mess with little dragons he put out his two gauntleted hands and snatched the first dragon out of the air he whipped it about and used it to strike the second in midpounce both dragons were knocked instantly senseless weight for weight no dragon was a match for an ogre only the advantage of size put the big dragons ahead and these lacked that smash hurled both dragons at the other ogre who stood gloating and grabbed for two more in a moment both of these were dragging and the dragging dragons were hurled up to drape about the ogre the fifth dragon meanwhile had fastened its jaws on smashs legs they were pretty good jaws with diamond hard teeth they were beginning to hurt smash plunged his fist down with such force that the skull caved in he ripped the body away and hurled it too at the other ogre ogre ogre the smog had largely cleared perhaps abetted by the breeze from smashs own activity now an immense shadow fell across them smash looked up it was the mother dragon so huge her landbound bulk blocked off the light of the sun not all big dragons were confined to dragonlandl it would take a whole tribe of ogres to fend her offand the tribe of the ogrefen ogres would cer tainly not do that smash had been tricked into this nest because the other ogre knew it would be the end of him but smash having cursed the darkness of his witless ness now suffered a flashback of dull genius heee he cried pointing a hamfinger at the other ogre the dragoness looked there stood the ogre in mid gloat with the five limp little dragon cubs draped around his body like so much apparel he had been so pleased with his success in framing smash that he had not thought to clear the debris from himself the liability of the true ogre had betrayed himhis inability to concentrate on more than one thing at a time naturally the dragoness assumed that he was the guilty creature with a roar so horrendous that it petrified the local trees and caused a layer of rock on the cliff to shiver into dust several diamonds to craze and crack and a blast of fire that would have vaporized trees and cliff face had the one not just been converted from wood to stone and the other not just powdered out she went for the guilty ogre the ogre was dim but not that dim especially as a re fracted wash of fire frizzled his fur while the dragoness inhaled and oriented for a more accurate second shot he flung off the little dragons and dived into the nestpit landing snootfirst in the diamonds the contrast was con siderablethe sheer beauty of the stones versus the sheer ugliness of the ogre it looked as if he were trying to eat them smash hardly paused for thought at the moment the dragoness was a greater threat to his health than the ogre he wrestled a boulder out of the pit wall and heaved it up at the dragoness while the other ogre struggled to his feet shedding white red green blue and polkadot diamonds the dragoness turned snapped at the boulder found it in edible and spit it out smash realized that the other ogre had disappeared he ogre ogre checked and saw a foot in a hole the boulder he had thrown had blocked a passage and the ogre was crawling down it leaving smash to face the fire alone smash didnt appreciate that so he grabbed the foot and hauled the ogre back and out several more diamonds dropped from crev ices on the creatures hideblack yellow purple plaid and candystriped in a moment smash had the ogre in the air swinging him around by the feet in a circle the dragoness was pumping up for a real burnout blast such an exhalation could incinerate both ogres in a single foop she opened her maw letting the first wisps of super heated steam emerge and her belly rumbled with the gath ering holocaust smash let go of the ogre hurling him directly into the gaping maw headfirst the dragon choked on her own blocked fire for the ogres body was just the right size to plug her gullet the ogres feet protruding slightly from the mouth kicked mad ly then the ogres broken teeth started working as he chewed his way out the dragoness looked startled un certain how to deal with this complication smash wasnt sure how this contest would turn out the dragoness fire was bottled and her own teeth could not quite get purchase on the ogre in her throat but she did have a lot of power and might be able to clear the ogre by either coughing him out or swallowing him the rest of the way on the other hand the ogre could chew quite a dis tance in a short time smash decided to depart the premises with judicious dispatch but where could he go if he scrambled out of the nest the dragoness might chase after him and he would be more like a sitting duck than a running ogre in the open if he remained hssst someone called here smash looked a little humanoid nymph stood within the hole left by the boulder i was raised in the underworld she said i know tun nels cornel smash looked back at the dragoness who was swelling with stifled pressure and at the kicking ogre in her throat the former was about to fire the latter out like a missile he had sympathy for neither and was fed up with the ogre ogre whole business what did he want with ogres anyway they were dull creatures who crunched the bones of human folk human folk tandy he cried i must save her from the ogres the nymph was disgusted idiot she cried i am tandy smash peered closely at her the nymph had brown hair blue eyes and a spunky upturned little nose she was indeed tandy odd that he hadnt recognized her yet who would have expected a nymph to turn out to be a person now get in here you oaf she commanded before that monster pops her cork he followed tandy into the tunnel she led him along a curving route deep down into the ground the air here turned cool the wall clammy the dragon mines here for diamonds that my mother leaves she explained there would be terrible disruption in xanth if it werent for her work the dragons would go on a rampage if their dia monds ran out and so would the other creatures if they couldnt get their own particular stones it certainly is nice to know my mother has been here of course that could have been a long time ago there might even be an aper ture to my home netherworld here though probably she rode the diggle and left no passage behind smash just followed more concerned about escaping the dragon than about the girls idle commentary there was a sound behind them like a giant spike being fired violently into bedrock the dragoness had no doubt disgorged the ogre from her craw and now was ready to pursue the two of them here though the diameter of the tunnel was not great dragons were long sinuous creatures particularly the wingless landbound ones who could move efficiently through small apertures or she could simply send a blast of flame along frying them worse yet she might do both pursuing until she got close then doing some fiery target practice oh im sure theres a way down somewhere near tandy fussed the wall here is shallow i can tell by the way it resonates ive had a lot of experience with this type of formation seetheres a fossil she indicated a glow ing thing that resembled the skeleton of a fish but it squig gled out of sight before smash could examine it closely ogre ogre fossils were like that he knew they preferred to hide from discovery they were like zombies except that they didnt generally travel about much they just rested for eons he had no idea what their purpose in life or death might be but i cant find a hole tandy finished frustrated smash knew they had to get out of this particular pas sage in a hurry he aimed his fist and smashed a hole in the wall a new chamber opened up he dropped through carefully lifting tandy down thats right she exclaimed i forgot about your ogre strength its handy at times a rush of fire flowed along the tunnel they had quitted they had gotten out just in time this is it tandy cried the netherworld i havent been in this section before but i recognize the general con figuration a few days walk and im home then she reconsidered no there isnt any direct connection the whats that thing that cuts xanth in half i cant remem ber the gap chasm smash said dredging it out of his own fading memory in his ogre personality he was too stupid to forget things as readily as tandy could yes that that would cut off this section from the section i live in i think still she led him through a dark labyrinth until the sounds of the enraged dragon faded they finally stood on a ledge near cool water shell never find us here it would douse her fire i hope youll be able to find our way out im lost ogres didnt care one way or the other about the depths of the earth but did like to be able to get around to forage for food and violence when the time is right she said maybe never but what of our missions smash demanded what missions she asked innocently then smash remembered she no longer cared about seeking fulfillment she had given up her soul chapter point of view but in a moment he realized this was not seri ous i have your half soul he said take it back he put his huge paw on his head and drew out the fillet it adhered to his own soul with which it had temporarily merged evidently the two souls liked each other different as they were at last her soul rested in his palm then he moved the faintly luminous hemisphere to her head and patted it in the soul dissolved flowing back into her oh that feels so good she exclaimed now i know how much i missed my soul even the half of it smash back to his own half soul suddenly felt tired he sank down on the rock where he was resting it was dark here but he didnt mind it was easy to rest in this place tandy sank down beside him i think my soul feels lonely she said it was half and then it was whole with yours and now its half again with maybe the better half missing yours is the better half he said its cute and spunky and sensitive while mine is gross and stupid but strong and loyal she said they complement each other a full person needs strength and sensitivity an ogre doesnt but now he wondered she found his hamhand with her own okay smash i remember our missions now i wanted to find a good hus band and you wanted a good wife smash finished i didnt know it but the good magician evidently did so he sent me where i could find one but somehow the notion of sharing ogre ogre t the rest of my life with an ogress no longer appeals i dont know why because true ogres and ogresses are brutes she said you really arent that kind smash perhaps i wasnt when i had the eye queue curse but when i lost it i reverted to my natural state are you sure your natural state is brutish i was raised to be able to smash ironwood trees with single blows of my homy fist he said to wrestle my weight in dragons and pulverize them to squeeze purple bouillon juice from purple wood with my bare hands to chew rocks into sand to thats impressive smash and ive seen you do some of those things but are you sure you arent confusing strength with brutishness you have always been very gen tle with me you are special he said experiencing a surge of unfa miliar feeling chem told me something she learned from a mundane scholar chem and i talked a lot while you were in the gourd there in the void because we didnt know for sure whether we would ever get free of that place the scholars name was ichabod and he knew this little poem about a mundane monster resembling a tiger lily only this one is supposed to be an animal instead of a plant i have fought tiger lilies he said even their roots have claws theyre worse than dandylions she couldnt remember the poem exactly so we played with it applying it to you ogre ogre burning bright ogres dont bum they do when theyre stepping across the firewall she said trying to fetch a boat so the rest of us can navigate past the loan sharks thats what reminded chem of the poem she said the flaming ogre anyway the poem tells how they go through the jungle in the night the fiery ogres and are fearfully awful yes smash said becoming pleased with the image we had a good laugh you arent fearful at all to us youre a big wonderful blundering ball of fur and we wouldnt trade you for anything no matter how brightly i bum smash agreed ruefully ogre ogra ogre ogre he changed the subject how were you able to function without your soul when you lost it before you were coma tose partly before it was the shock of loss she said this time i gave it away i was braced experienced that shouldnt make much difference he protested a soul is a soul and when you lose it it does make a difference what a girl gives away may make her feel good while if the same thing is taken by force it can destroy her but without a soul true thats only an analogy i suppose i was thinking more of love he remembered how the demon had tried to rape her suddenly he hated that demon yes you need someone to protect you but we found no man along the route and now we are beyond the good magicians assignment with out an answer for either of us im not so sure she said were drifting from the subject how did you survive soulless your half soul made me strong enough to beat another ogre you had to have been so weak you would collapse yet you didnt well im half nymph she said half nymph you did seem like a nymph when i always thought of myself as human just as you al ways thought of yourself as ogre but my mother is jewel the nymph so by heredity im as much nymph as girl whats the difference he knew there was a differ ence but found himself unable to define it nymphs are eternally young and beautiful and usually none too bright they are unable to say no to a male for anything my mother is an exception she had to be smart and reliable to handle her job she remains very pretty prettier than i am but shes not as smart as i am you are young and beautiful smash said but so is princess irene and shes a human girl yes so that isnt definitive human girls in the flush of their young prime do approach nymphs in appearance and have a number of nymphal qualities that men find appealing but irene will age while true nymphs wont she loves while nymphs cant love cant love smash was learning more than he had ever expected to about nymphs well my mother does love but as i said shes a very special nymph and my father crombie used a lovespell on her so that doesnt count but some human people dont love so that is not defini tive either true it can be very hard to distinguish a nymph from a thoughtless human girl but one thing is definitive nymphs dont have souls you have a soul i am absolutely certain of that its a very nice little soul too he could feel her smile in the dark her body relaxed and she squeezed his paw thank you i rather like it my self i have a soul because im half human just as you do for the same reason i never thought of that smash said it never oc curred to me that other ogres wouldnt have souls theyre brutes because they have no souls their strength is all magic i suppose so my mother was a variety of human so i inherited my soul from her and it gave you strength to make up for what you lost by being only half ogre agreed that answers a mystery i was never aware of before but you still havent explained how you functioned without a soul yes it was simply a matter of how i thought of it you see human beings have always had souls they have no experience living without them other creatures never had souls so they have learned to cope my mother copes quite well though i suppose some of my fathers soul has rubbed off on her tandy sighed shes such a good person she certainly deserves a soul but she is a nymph and i am half nymph so i can func tion without a soul all i had to do once i realized that was to think of myself as a nymph it made a fundamental difference but i think of myself as an ogreyet i have a soul maybe you should try thinking of yourself as a man smash her hand tightened on his a man he asked blankly im an ogre and im a girl but when i had to i became a nymph ogre ogre ogre ogre so i was able to operate without sinking into the sort of slough i did before in the gourd i was able to follow your fight and to step in when i needed to a man he repeated incredulously please smash im a halfbreed like you like a lot of the creatures of xanth i wont laugh at you its impossible how could i ever be a man smash you dont talk like an ogre any more youre not stupid like an ogre any more the eye queue that vine faded a long time ago smash and the one you got in the voidthat never existed at all it was sheer illusion yet it made you smart again did you ever con sider how that could be it was his turn to smile in the dark i was careful not to think that one through tandy it would have deprived me of the very intelligence that enabled me to indulge in that chain of thought paradoxically you believe in paradox it is an intriguing concept i would say it is impossible in mundania but possible in xanth i really must explore the implications further when i have leisure i have another hypothesis she said the eye queue was illusion but your intelligence was not isnt that a contradiction its illogical to attribute an effect as significant as intelligence to an illusion it certainly is thats why i didnt do it smash i dont think you needed the eye queue vine at all ever not the illusory one or the original one you always had the intelli gence because youre half human and human beings are smart but i was never smart until the eye queue made me so you were smart enough to fool everyone into thinking you were ogrishly stupid smash chem told me about the eye queue vine its effect wears off in hours sometimes its effect is only in selfperception it makes creatures think theyre smart when they arent and they make colos sal fools of themselves without knowing it like people get ting drunk on the spillage from a beerbarrel tree thinking theyre being great company when actually they are dis gusting clowns my father used to tell me about that he said hed made a clown of himself more than once only its worse with the vine was i doing that smash asked mortified no you really were smart and it didnt wear off un til you lost the vine in the flood and it came back the moment you got a new vine even though you only imag ined it doesnt that suggest something to you smash he pondered it confirms that magic is marvelous and not entirely logical or that you became smart only when you thought you ought to be smart maybe the eye queue showed you how the first time after that you could do it any time you wanted to or when you forgot to be stupid but im not smart now he protested you should listen to yourself smash youve been dis coursing on the nuances of paradox and youve been talk ing in a literate fashion why so i have he agreed surprised i forgot i had lost the eye queue precisely so where does your intelligence come from now ogre it must be from my human half as you surmise like my soul i just never invoked it before because because you thought of yourself as an ogre until you saw what ogres really were like and started turning off them now you are sliding toward your human heritage you see it far more dearly than i do because im more objective i see you from the outside i appreciate your human qualities and i think the good magician humfrey did too hes old but hes still savvy i ought to know i cleaned up his castle for a year it didnt looked cleaned up to me i could hardly find a place to stand you should have seen it before i cleaned it up but she laughed actually i didnt touch his private den even the gorgon leaves that alone if anyone ever cleaned up in there no one would know where all his spells and books and things were hes had a century or so to leam their locations but the rest of the castle needs to be kept in order and they felt the gorgon shouldnt have to do it since shes married to him now so i did it i cleaned off the magic mirrors and things some of them bad pretty smart ogra ogre mouths too it wasnt bad and in that year i came to understand that behind the seeming absentmindedness of humfrey there lies a remarkably alert mind he just doesnt like to show it he knew all about you for example before you approached the castle he had you marked a year in advance on his calendar right to the day and hour of your arrival he watched every step of your progress he chortled when you came up against those ogre bones hed gone to a lot of work to get those set up that man knows everything he wants to know thats why he keeps the gorgon in thrall instead of she him she is in complete awe of his knowledge and i thought he was asleepi smash said ruefully everyone does but hes the magician of information one of the most powerful men in xanth he knows every thing worth knowing so he surely knew how much of a mind you had and crafted his answer accordingly now we know he was correct but our missionsneither is complete he didnt know we would fail did he she considered then asked smash why did you fight the other ogre he annoyed me he insulted me but you tried to avoid trouble because i was at halfstrength and knew id lose but then you slugged him you knocked out a tooth he was going to eat you i couldnt allow that why not its what ogres do i had agreed to protect you did you think of that when you struck him no smash admitted i popped him instantly there was no time for thought so there was some other reason you reacted youre my friend do ogres have friends he considered again no im the only ogre who ever had friendsand they were mostly human friends most ogres dont even like other ogres unsurprising she said so to protect me twice you risked your soul yes of course he wasnt certain of the point of her comment ogre ogre would any true ogre have done that no true ogre of course since ogres dont have souls they would never be faced with the choice but still if they did have souls they wouldnt smash doesnt it seem even to you that you have more human qualities than ogre qualities in this circumstance perhaps but in the jungle alone it would be otherwise why did you leave the jungle then i was dissatisfied as i said before i must have needed a wife only i didnt know it then and you could have had a nice brute of an ogress with a face whose full glare would have made the moon rot if youd reacted more like an ogre are you sorry you blew it smash laughed becoming more conscious of her hand on his no do ogres laugh only maliciously so youve thrown away the answer you worked so hard for you think are you going back to the lonely jungle now strangely that also did not appeal the life he had been satisfied with before seemed inadequate now what choice do i have why not try being a man its all in your viewpoint i think the people at castle roogna would accept you im sure they already do prince dor treated you as an equal he treats everybody as an equal but smash won dered would prince dor have been the same with any of the ogrefen ogres this seemed questionable then something else occurred to him you say i was able to make the illusory eye queue vine work in the void because i always did have human intelligence so there was no paradox thats what i say she said smugly then what about the gourd the gourd she asked family that was illusory too in the void and it had noth ing to do with my human nature yet it also worked ogre ogre ogre ogre yes it did she agreed oh smash i never thought of thati but that means that illusion was real in the void that what we thought was there really was there once we thought it such as gourds and glowing footprints so there is no proof im smart without the vine butbut she began to sniffle smash sighed he hated to see her unhappy neverthe less i admit to being smart enough now to find the flaws in your logic which paradoxically proves your case to that extent probably were both right i have human intelligence and the void makes illusion real he paused yet again aware of her hand on his what a sweet little hand it wasi i have never in my life thought of myself as a man i dont know what it could accomplish but at least it might be a diversion while we wait for the dragoness to stop searching for us her sniffles abated magically it might be more than that smash she said sounding excited smash concentrated he imagined the way men were small and not very hairy and rather weak but very smart they used clothing because their natural fur didnt cover the essentials they plucked shoes from shoe trees and socks from hose vines he had a jacket and gloves that was a start they lived in houses because wild creatures could otherwise attack them in their sleep they tended to congregate in villages liking one anothers company they were in fact social creatures seldom alone he imagined himself joining that company walking like a man instead of tromping like an ogre resting on a bed instead of on the trunk of a tree eating delicately one bite at a time chewing it sedately instead of ripping raw flesh crunching bones and using sheer muscle to cram in what ever didnt conveniently fit in his mouth shaking hands instead of knocking for a loop but the whole exercise was ridiculous because he knew he would always be a huge hairy homely monster it isnt working he said with relief i just cant imag ine myself as she set her other hand on his gross arm now he felt the touch of her soul her half soul for he was attuned to it after borrowing it there seemed to be a current of soul traveling along his arm between her two tiny hands he had rescued that soul from the gourd and it had helped rescue him from the ogres he also remembered how quick she had always been in his defense how she had kissed him how she had stayed with him even when he went among the ogres even when she lacked her soul suddenly he wanted very much to please her and he began to get the point of view he felt himself shrinking refining turning polite and smart suddenly it opened out his mind expanded to take in all of xanth as it had when he first felt the curse of the eye queue this time it was no curse it was selfrealization he had become a man tandys hands remained on his arm and hand now he turned to her in the dark his eyes saw nothing but his mind more than made up the difference tandy was a woman she was beautiful in her special fashion she was smart she was nice she was loyal she had a wonderful soul and hewith the perspective of a man he saw her dif ferently with the mind of a man he analyzed it she had been a companion and he realized now how important that had become to him ogres didnt need companions but men did the six other girls had been companions too and he had liked them but tandy was more i dont want to go back to the jungle alone he mur mured his voice had lost much of the ogre guttural qual ity i never thought you belonged there smash oh how sweet she sounded i want but the enormity of the notion balked tiim it didnt balk tandy however smash i told you before that i loved you i have human perception at the moment he said i must caution you not to make statements that are subject to misinterpretation misinterpretation hell she flashed i knew my mind long before you knew yours well you must admit that an ogre and a nymph ogre ogre ogre ogre or a man and a woman halfbreeds he said half bitterly like the centaurs harpies merfolk fauns and whats wrong with halfbreeds she flared in xanth any species can mate with any other it wants to and some of the offspring are fine people whats wrong with chem the centaur with the siren nothing he said impressed by her vehemence mo ment by moment as she talked and his manhood infil trated the farthest reaches of his awareness he was warm ing to her nature she was small but she was an awful lot of small and the threequarter breeds almost identical to the humans like goldy goblin and biythe brassie and john the fairy and fireoak the hamadryad whose soul is the tree he finished all good people but he wondered passingly why since nymphs were so nearly human they didnt have souls obviously there was more to learn about the matter consider xanth she continued hotly divided into myriad kingdoms of people and animals and inbetweens we met the lord of the flies and the prince of whales and the dragon lady and the kingdoms of the goblins birds griffins and the ancestral ogres of the fen he said all of which believe they dominate xanth yes she took a breath how can xanth be prevented from fragmenting entirely except by interaction and cross breeding smash i think the very future of xanth depends on the halfbreeds and quarterbreeds the people like us who share two or more views in mundania no species breeds with anotherand look at mundania according to my fathers stories awful he agreed mundania has no magic so their species just keep drifting farther apart maldng that land more dreary year by year xanth is different xanth can reunify smash we owe it to xanth to now i understand what men object to in women smash said she was startled what they talk too much its to fill in for inactive men she flared oh he turned farther toward her in the dark and she met him halfway this time there was no confusion at all about the kiss it was a small swatch of heaven at last they broke ogre ogre she murmured breath lessly you certainly are a man now youre right the good magician knew he said cud dling her close to him in the dark she did not seem tiny she seemed just right as with riding the nightmares things were always compatible he had known tandy was very feminine now this quality assumed phenomenal new im portance he sent me to the ogresto find you and he sent me to find youthe one creature rough enough to drive off the demon i fled while still being gen tle enough for me to love love smash mulled that concept over i cried for you last night he confessed silly she teased him ogres dont cry because i thought i would lose you i did not know that i loved you she melted oh smash you said it he said it again i love you thats why i fought for you thats why i bargained my soul for you she laughed again teasingly i dont think you know what love is he stiffened i dont but ill show you show me he said dubiously she showed him there was no violence no knocking of heads against trees no screaming or stomping yet it was the most amazing and rewarding experience he had ever had by the time it was done smash knew he never wanted to be anything but a man and never wanted any woman but her they found another way out of the netherworld avoid ing the lurking dragon and trekked south along the east coast of xanth smash by the light of day was smaller than he had been and less hairy and hardly ugly at all but he didnt really mind giving up his previous assets because the acquisition of tandy more than made up for ogre ogre them she sewed him a pair of shorts because men wore them and he did rather resemble a man now they traveled quietly avoiding trouble when this threatened to rankle his suppressed ogre nature tandy would take his hand and smile up at him and the rankle dissipated the trip took several days but that didnt matter be cause it was sheer joy smash hardly noticed the routine xanth hazards since most of his attention was on tandy somehow the hazards seemed diminished anyway for news had spread among the griffins birds dragons gob lins and flies that tandys companion was best left alone even if he didnt look like much it seemed that a certain ogre of the fen had staggered out of the jungle with a headache and though he had not given any details it was evident that he had been roughly treated by the stranger he had fought even the crossing of the gap which smash had almost forgotten until he encountered it again was without event the gap dragon reputed to have a sore tail stayed clear at length they drew near the entrance to tandys home region the route was through a chasm guarded by a tangle tree it was a big aggressive tree and smash knew he could not overcome it so he drew on his human intelli gence and harvested a number of hypnogourds intending to roll them down to the tree if it made the mistake of looking in a single peephole but as they carried two gourds from the patch a cloud of smoke formedbefore them this coalesced into a dusky demon well my little human beauty the demon said to tandy switching his barbed tail about you were lost but now are found i shall have my will of you forthwith he advanced on her grinning lasciviously tandy screamed and dropped her gourd which shat tered on the ground fianti so this was the demon who sought to rape her smash set his own gourd down carefully and stepped forward depart foul spirit he ordered the demon ignored him addressing tandy instead ah you seem more luscious than ever girlcreature it will be long before i tire of you ogre ogre tandy backed away smash saw that she was too fright ened even to throw a tantrum the demon had come upon her so suddenly she had not been able to brace emotionally for the assault smash interposed himself between demon and girl de sist fiant he said the fat demon put out a band and shoved him smash tripped on a stone and tumbled to the ground ignomi niously the demon stepped on his stomach and advanced on tandy pucker up cutie your time has come at last smash was becoming perturbed tandy might believe in crossbreeding as the hope of xanth but she had not chosen to do it with the demon as she had explained there was a considerable difference between what was given voluntar ily and what was forced smash scrambled to his feet and hurried after fiant catching him on the shoulder the demon swung about almost carelessly delivering a brainrattling slap across smashs cheek smash fell back again reeling now fiant shot out a hand and caught tandy by the hair she screamed but could not pull away smash charged back into the frayonly to be met with a careless straightarm that nearly staved in his teeth now the demon deigned to notice him momentarily get lost lout or ill hurt you what was this fiant seemed to be stronger than smash the demon drew tandy in to him by the hair reaching with the clawed fingers of his other hand to rip off her blouse smash charged again fists swinging he caught the de mon on his pointed ear this time fiant became annoyed you seem to be a slow learner creep he loosed the girl spun about and struck smash with a lightningfast onetwo combination punch on chin and stomach smash went down head fog ging gasping for breath no man can stand against a de mon fiant said arrogantly and turned again to tandy but the brief respite had given her a chance to work up some spunk she dived for smash take my soul she cried and he felt its wonderful enhancement infusing him he had forgotten how weak he was with only half a soul then she was yanked away by the hair fiant held her ogre ogre ogre ogre up her feet dangling no more mr nice guy he said off with your skirt on the trip down tandy had re made the tatters of her red dress into a good skirt and completed her wardrobe and smashs by sewing material from cloth bushes smash leaped up and tackled the demon now he had his strength but fiant poked two fingers at his eyes pain fully blinded smash fell to the ground again he had a full soul again why couldnt he prevail it was tandy who came up with the answer smash youre too much of a man now she cried from her dan gle too gentle and polite try thinking of yourself as an ogre it was true smash had spent several days becoming manishly civilized as fiant had said no man was a match for a demon but an ogre now smash thought of himself as an ogre it wasnt hard he had spent his life indulging in just such thinking the old thought patterns were strong he visualized the ground trembling at his stomp trees being ripped from their moor ings boulders being crushed to sand by single blows of horny fists hair sprouted on his arms muscles bulged horrendously his height jumped his orange jacket which hung on him loosely abruptly became tight his shorts split apart and fell off his hands swelled into hams his bruised eyeballs popped into awful ogre orbs ogre ogre smash put one hamfinger to the ground and lifted his whole body into the air then he flipped neatly to his rock calloused feet he roaredand the leaves of the nearest trees swirled away so unfortunately did tandys clothes such as remained they were not constructed for hurricane winds she swung in dainty nudity by her hair go get him ogre she cried and kicked the demon on the nose fiant looked at smashand gaped suddenly he faced a monster far worse than himself he dropped the girl and turned to flee smash bent down hooked his fingers in the turf and yanked the turf came toward him in a rug dumping the demon on his homs smash took one tromp forward and launched a mighty kick at fiants elevated rump the kick should have propelled the demon well toward the sun but smashs foot passed right through fiant smash thrown off balance by the missed kick did a backward flip and whomped on his head that hardly mattered to an ogre but it gave the demon a chance to get organized fiant realized that the ogre could not really hurt him thanks to his ability to dematerialize at will this restored his courage marvelously bullies always got brave when the odds were loaded on their side he got up strode toward smash and punched him in the gut it was a good hard blowbut now smash shrugged it off as the trifle it was and countered with a sweep of his arm that was so swift and fierce it caused a contrail behind it but this blow too passed through the demon without effect hes dematerializing tandy cried you cant hit him unconvinced smash plunged his fist at the demons head from above this blow should have driven the demon halfway into the ground instead it passed the entire length of piants body without impediment and struck the bare rock beneath where the rug of turf had been removed the rock cracked apart and powdered into sand naturally then smash rammed a straight punch at fiants belly and only succeeded in sundering the tree behind him smash was tearing up the landscape to no avail but the demon could hit smash by rematerializing his fists just before they struck the blows didnt really hurt but smash was annoyed how could he pulverize a creature who could not be hit back he tried to grab fiant this worked slightly better the demons body was as diffuse as smoke to his touch but smashs spread hamhands had more purchase and he was able to guide the smoke as long as he handled it carefully unfortunately the demons fists remained material and they now beat a brutal tattoo on smashs face his nose and eyes were hurting anew use your mind smash tandy called smash held the demon in place enduring the facial bat tering while he put his natural eye queue intellect to work what would deal with such a demon once and for all it would not be enough merely to drive fiant off he had to fix it so the demon could never again bother tandy if tandy had a notion how he should proceed why hadnt she simply screamed it out because if the demon heard he would act to negate it smash had to do whatever it was by surprise he glanced at tandyand saw her sitting on the gourd he had carried suddenly he understood he snapped at the demons fists using his big ogre teeth oh no you dont monster fiant exclaimed you cant get me that way sure enough he punched smash on the tongue and when smashs teeth closed on the fist it dema terialized and withdrew unhurt but meanwhile smash was carrying the demon toward the gourd when he got there he slowly tilted fiant down toward the peephole tandy had been sitting on the demon was about to face the gourd if fiant saw it too soon he would strike it and shatter it ruining the ploy fiant intent on punching smashs snout into a pulp did not spy the gourd until he was abruptly face to face with it no he cried realizing what it was he jammed his eyes closed so he could not look and dematerialized yes smash grunted he shoved the demon headfirst at the gourdbecause fiant was dematerialized he passed right through the peephole headfirst suddenly smash re membered the bottle ifrit inside this same gourd wasnt the gourd another kind of container you want to force your way into something this is a good place smash fed the rest of the demon through arms torso legs and feet until all of him was gone let him find his way out of thatv tandy cried jubi lantly oh this really serves him right smash put his ear to the peephole he heard a faint angry neighing as of an aroused stallion and a startled scream it seemed the demon could not dematerialize very effectively in a world where everything was already imma terial then the beat of hooves faded away in the internal distance smash smiled as tandy had suggested it would be long before the demon found his way out of that situation he drew forth tandys fillet of soul and handed it back to her suddenly he felt his full strength return and saw tandy brightening similarly their two half souls had been returned smash realized what it was the nightmares had made a fair exchange for the two halves of fiant smash straightened up keeping his eye averted from the peephole he squinted at tandy perceiving her disheveled but pert nudity ogre confess like she dress he said oh youre a sight for sore eyes yourself tandy said in nurselike fashion wiping smashs battered face and sore nose too but do you know something i love you just as much in the ogre view he kissed her then using his sore lips not caring what point of view it might be love was after all blind
